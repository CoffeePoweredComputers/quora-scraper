            "answer_text": "Why do INFP's get so uptight about political issues? When I answer questions, sometimes I will analyze the question itself before answering. So I looked up the word Uptight\u2026 \u201c\u2026anxious or angry in a tense and overly controlled way.\u201d It\u2019s basically a negative label. As though a person doesn\u2019t have a right to dislike whatever they choose to dislike. My interpretation: the person asking this question is saying they are annoyed that INFPs \u201cget so anxious and overly controlled when faced with political issues\u201d. It makes me wonder why it is a bad thing to be upset with politics. Is everyone meant to enjoy it? Politics is supposed to be used to help nations and governments make a better world for the beings who live there. But it is actually used in order for those in power to lay claim to even more power. But I will answer why politics annoys me. And it doesn\u2019t just annoy me, most behavior in relation to politics disgusts me. Politics is drama. People sit around and argue the supposed truths within the lies they want everyone to accept.President. I live in a country where the chosen leader is nothing but a sad representation of how pathetic our politics has become.Health care costs. Expensive. Enough said on that topic.Education costs. Why is it so damn much money for people to gain knowledge? Know why? Because if people become too intelligent, they will realize how horrible this country is and want to regain control! Can\u2019t have that.Environment. Seriously? This planet is environmentally falling apart. This isn\u2019t a fabrication or voodoo. Wake up.I\u2019m annoyed now. ^^; So that\u2019s all I can put together for the time being. Unless people are completely numb or are blindly accepting this nonsense, I believe that INFPs have a valid enough reason to be \u201cuptight\u201d. If you\u2019d like INFPs to settle down about politics, fix the freakin\u2019 planet! :p \u2014-How do you cope with the thought of knowing that we are living in a largely controlling and manipulative society?-Do INFPs often feel like they've been born on the wrong planet?-Why is the world so harsh on INFPs?-Is it normal for an INFP, who feels so deeply, to refuse to acknowledge all of the bad things happening in the world?-What happens when an INFP becomes a realist?

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: May not apply to all INFPs. Thank you for the A2A. The MBTI is useful for making some broad, yet mostly accurate generalizations of the 16 personality types. However, I do not think the generalization that INFPs get uptight about political issues holds as much water. Though it is unlikely, not all INFPs are deeply invested in political issues. Whether it is out of ignorance, lack of interest, or something else, it is possible for some INFPs to be apathetic about political issues. It is also possible for INFPs to be deeply invested and concerned about politics, yet not be \u201cuptight\u201d. Many INFPs are passionate about defending their values and beliefs, yes, but healthy INFPs also have an open-mindedness and flexibility that allows them to consider a variety of viewpoints, even ones that do not support their beliefs. If there happened to be INFPs who are unquestionably \u201cuptight\u201d about political issues, I would guess it would largely be because of an overactive Fi (Introverted Feeling). INFPs have dominant Fi, which drives them to say and do things based on their specific internal moral code and values and how they feel about it. They also spend a lot time curating their internal morals and values, so they naturally end up feeling very strongly about it if those values are violated. However, overuse of Fi can lead them to become overly fixated in their beliefs and intolerant of those who would dare disagree/violate them. They will stake their very identity with the political issues at hand, and refuse to budge an inch because the alternative would be a socio-political landscape that may not be accepting of their cherished values. Passionate political opinions, and wanting a world/society that is more consistent with your values are not inherently bad, but narrow-mindedness and over-the-top righteousness is. Finally, I would like to mention the reason why many INFPs care so strongly about politics in the first place is because politics is basically the embodiment of values. If you recall, INFPs\u2019 first cognitive function is curating those values, and trying to live a life abiding by them as well as defending them. Therefore they cannot help but become invested at least a little in this very public arena of values. How much they become invested and how calmly and maturely they handle their emotional investment depends on the individual INFP. I hope this helps. ",
