            "answer_text": "i would like to divide my answer into four parts-  during middle and high school, i loved maths because of the fact that if u ace it, it'll fetch u great marks. there is no 'grey' in maths, its either black or white- correct or incorrect. plain simple. later, when i started practicing more i realised the beauty of it. i used to solve the same problem through different methods. and let me tell u, i am the girl who can spend her whole life in the library, coz i love reading different authors' perspective to the same thing. it fascinates me.in high school, surprisingly i did not opt for maths but opted for biology. now, in biology my favourite was genetics. omg! how much i loved genetics. it appealed to me because i didn't have to remember anything unlike other parts of the syllabus. i really really liked it. another subject that i loved dearly was psychology. it was one of my subjects in high school. the first class that i attended was on stages of child development. i loathed it. i hate kids and i thought to myself, \"is this what psychology is?\" definitely a bad impression to start with. i skipped a few classes after that. but ultimately had to opt for psychology. it was then i realized, that it was much more than what i thought. there were various chapters on communication, self and personality, intelligence and aptitude, psychological disorders etc. the best part was all was infront of you. u can see people to remember things.comes college.. and my favorite subject now? PHARMACOLOGY. because of the teacher! good enough reason according to me. she is the best teacher anyone can get for the subject. she knows  it all. we all wait for her classes unlike other subjects.",

            "answer_text": " Learn how to use praise as a learning and coaching tool. Let me elaborate. The wrong kind of praise creates self-defeating behavior. The right kind motivates students to learn. - Carol Dweck Have you ever done any reading from Carol Dweck? If not, you\u2019ll probably find her research on using praise very interesting. This will be particularly true if you have children or grandchildren in the extended family. Dweck research has shown when you praise effort, you encourage a growth mindset, the belief that intellectual ability can be developed through education and effort. Those with a growth mindset believe that they can get better at almost anything, as long as they spend the necessary time and energy. Instead of seeking to avoid mistakes, they see mistakes as an essential precursor of knowledge.
