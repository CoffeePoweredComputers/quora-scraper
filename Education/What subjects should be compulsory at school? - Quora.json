            "answer_text": "I believe education does have layers. At the base, four skills should be taught. Writing, Reading, Math (up to basic Algebra and geometry) and How to absorb knowledge (e.g. learn). Expanding from that, I think there are a few secondary skills that are very useful in todays society: Programming. With programming you learn logic and how to organise ideas into practicality. It has many applications in your daily life. Not saying everyone should be a programmer - just that knowing a bit of programming can make your path a bit easier. Rhethoric. Knowing how to speak really helps with your image. Exercise (not necessarily P.E.). If every school day started with a 15 minute warm-up routine, kids would not only be more healthy but also much more attentive in class. Getting this routine from day one in school would give a whole generation of kids that do the routine. History, so that we do not repeat the mistakes of our past (or atleast not at the same scale). Aside from that I believe school should expose you to as many different subjects as possible so that you may choose a field and profession according to what you like. ",
