I would say that there are various times in a persons life that it is acceptable to live with their parents. 0\u201318 for reasons that should appear obvious. There are cases where kids move out early, of course, but everyone would agree that before 18, living with ones parents is common and expected.18\u201324 where the kids are in college and either live in the town they attend college or they come home on breaks, maintaining their permanent residence as their parents\u2019 house. Or maybe they've started contributing financially to the household if they aren't going to a formal training/university. Maybe they're establishing themselves without a heavy financial burden such as rent so they are able to more focus on what they want to do instead of what they have to do to make ends meat. They could also, on the other side of the coin, be freeloading or lazy. Under certain circumstances it may be time to reality check and claim \u201cyou're too old to live at home\u201d. For the most part, taken completely out of context, 24 and under doesn't raise eyebrows.25+: I think 25 is the beginning of a societal expectation of independence. For most regularly developing post-adolescents I would imagine most parents expect the same. At least in the United States. It's a somewhat unspoken rule. Just listen to a 26 year old justify why he's \u201cstill\u201d living at home with his parents. The speaker is assuming the listener is forming a judgment about them and they want to make a quick caveat to say, \u201cI know what you're thinking but I'm different because\u2026\u201d Part 2: I didn't give a range because life is so crazy and unpredictable. And for the most part, again just assuming, health problems in parents come on when kids are older. Like after 25. Again, average. Children live with parents during a terminal illness or help with final affairs. And this can happen at any point, as we all know. Maybe even the parents move in with the children. Which prompts he question: how young is too young for parents to live with their adult children?",

            "answer_text": "I love this question and all of the answers. They create a wonderful mosaic of time and experience. And the common thread seems to be to move out when you are ready (although that should also include your parents' feelings.) I am 64 now, and my two sons are 29 and 37. My experience and theirs are greatly different. Time creates huge differences. My husband and I got married when we were 20 and 22. My youngest was living away from home on campus from his early twenties on. My oldest, though, except for one year on campus, has lived at home. The situation between the two of them has been completely different. The second was more independent and more sure of the direction he wanted to go at an early age. It made sense for him to move out quickly and spend less time with us. Now he has graduated, has his first professional job, and is engaged to be married. The first had a very rocky experience out of high school. Younger than his peers, he wasn't ready for college life, and crashed and burned during freshman year. He dropped out and came home. Since he wasn't in school he began to work. He's had several jobs and continued college work part-time. He spent many years in a low-paying job that involved complicated customer service, which helped him overcome extreme shyness. He didn't make anywhere enough money for rent, even shared with others, and stayed at home. He took on more chores at home instead. We were anxious, though, about his job and lack of room for moving up. It took him a long time to admit it was a dead end job, but he learned and grew a lot while there. He quit two years ago. As soon as he quit he started to look for another job. Lots of job applications (all online), few interviews. As time went on and he was getting no offers, he fine-tuned his resume and crafted his cover letter to show himself at his best. Finally several months ago he started to get call backs for interviews. Six weeks ago he got two offers in one week. He accepted the hotel job (what he wanted all along), and has a great beginning wage. He is finally on his way! So, two sons, two very different experiences, neither one pushed out but both supported by us parents. And both, now, in careers which will support them so they can live independently and successfully. Some anxious times for me and my husband as this all played out, but in the end the results are so very good that we are glad we were patient and helped each as they needed it. ",
