            "answer_text": "Children born deaf have problems with speaking because they are unable to develop their lingual skills (prelingual deafness). Most of us learn how to speak by hearing others speak and hearing the noises we ourselves make; we try to mimic the noises around us as we grow up. Children who cannot hear have no such guideline to go by. However, this is not to say that they cannot speak at all. With a cochlear implant or the help of a speech pathologist, the child should be able to develop some degree of spoken language. The younger the child is when the cochlear implant is given, the better. Sign language will also help the child communicate and the baby might have actually developed his own sign language in order to communicate. The child exposed to a sign language will grasp it as quickly as a hearing child would a spoken language.  There are quite a few reasons for hearing loss. It's mostly genetic (more than 50%) and the gene can be recessive, so neither parent would have been deaf. There are other reasons for deafness too, like difficulties in pregnancy or any drugs or alcohol the mother took while pregnant and so on.  It's important to remember than deaf children are as intelligent and normal as other children. Given the right support, they can develop as well as anybody else. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Giordon. I have edited the question, since 'mute' and 'dumb' are both offensive terms to Deaf people.  Deaf people speak signed languages, and speaking through our hands does not render us 'silent.'   We are communicating words, thoughts, and ideas.  We are not silent people. If a child is born deaf, s/he is going to be a visual being, dependent on her/his eyes to collect information.  The eyes are the deaf child's strongest point. It is not reasonable to expect the deaf child to depend on her/his weak point, which is her/his ears. I encourage you to learn the sign language used in your area/state/country, and speak that sign language with your deaf child. The deaf child does have the ability to learn speech and lipreading. But a good education is far more important than speech and lipreading, and that's where your deaf child should focus her/his time and energy on.  Good education and access to language/communication via signed language makes for a happy, well-rounded deaf child. As for medical causes...it could be genetic. By the way, I've been Deaf since birth and I'm a well-educated Deaf adult who speaks American Sign Language (ASL). My two children are also born Deaf and speak ASL. It is genetic for us. ",
