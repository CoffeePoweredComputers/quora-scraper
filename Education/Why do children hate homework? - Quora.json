            "answer_text": "Many people (not just children) hate homework because the opportunity cost is high, easy to notice, and unbounded. Opportunity cost is the cost you pay in all the opportunities you miss. The opportunity cost is high because homework takes up a portion of every afternoon and weekend you would otherwise have free to do anything at all. You could be building a tree house, playing soccer, bonding with your parents, laughing with your friends, studying a topic that really interests you, volunteering for a cause you care about, reading a good book, etc. There are so many wonderful things you miss out on when you\u2019re doing homeword. The opportunity cost is easy to notice because homework is supposed to be done during otherwise unscheduled time. When you\u2019re at school, you also pay a high opportunity cost, but you don\u2019t notice because all your peers are there doing the same thing at the same time, so you\u2019re not missing a bunch of kids playing while you have to study. The opportunity cost is unbounded because you never know for sure how long your homework would take. An essay can be such a challenge that you start it right when you get home from school, but struggle with it until 2am. It\u2019s frightening to think of your entire evening or weekend getting eaten up on that one stressful activity, and you don\u2019t know if that will happen. The homework may teach you something. It may be pleasant, or even really fun. It may be terribly boring or too hard for you. It may be useless. Regardless, you are missing out on so many things you could be doing instead. Things that you love, that you would choose to do, that would enrich your life. If you are a child who hates homework there is nothing wrong with you. You are perceiving the theft of your childhood, something you will only live once. ",

            "answer_text": "The only time I like doing homework is if it gets me out of something I really don't want to do after school like my parents dragging me swimming or shopping or when I actually learn something and start to get the hang of whatever it is that I'm learning. I despise homework when it's a) electronic, or b) totally irrelevant, or c) I have no freaking idea what it is and have to learn something from Google. Worst thing there is next to braces. Edit: Looking back at this, I seem like such a spoiled brat  sorry. Anyways, to clarify, electronic homework is a hassle to get access to usually, you have to sign in a bunch of times and go through a bazillion portals to a specific site. Homework also drills things you already know into your head, in general. Sometimes it's necessary and like with math formulas to memorize, but most of our drilling happens everyday in class. It feels like it wastes your time when you already know everything. And when you have to google something in order to get homework done, you start to dislike the teacher because you felt\u2026swindled. I mean, I constantly hear my classmates complain about the teacher not actually teaching them and them having to research everything themselves. Sometimes I don't mind, but most of the time it would be hugely beneficial to have someone there to help explain the material. Personally I prefer in-depth study projects or essays. Those are the assignments that really make me feel like I'm learning something new and to the maximum extent. ",
