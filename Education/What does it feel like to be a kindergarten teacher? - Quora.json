            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an awesome feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s a bit overwhelming at Years start as they come in totally new to school. Like any beginning the journey into school is quite a time. As a k teacher you feel you are the first for that child and you want to be someone they admire, learn from, and love. I really enjoy kinder. It feels like critical work to me and it feels like I really help our world. There is no better job really. At the end of the year I\u2019m often so emotional saying goodbye- but I can reflect on all the amazing progress. If you are considering the work I\u2019d suggest a combination of patience and care are really important. Plus enjoying young children. They are very funny and profound. If you want to feel a connection to life- consider this work. ",

            "answer_text": "Actualy it was so incredible experiance when I teached them. Children likes a clear paper what ever we want to write on it they never complaint about it. So this is the most important think for me and challenging. Because what we teach today will affect in the long times. If we are not carefull educating them it will makes bad think of them. So that\u2019s the way I say being a kindergarten teacher is amazing. #please correct my eror gramatical because I\u2019ve still study in english ",
