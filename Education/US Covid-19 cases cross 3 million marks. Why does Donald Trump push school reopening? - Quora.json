            "answer_text": "That three million number is a bit misleading. There are not three million active cases of the COVID virus. United States Coronavirus: 3,184,184 Cases and 135,279 Deaths This link clearly shows that nearly half of the three million have recovered. Let\u2019s put on our way back machine back to the first month of when the virus came into the news. The emphasis at the time was \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d FYI, This discussion will get long, but at the same time I\u2019m trying to create a full and complete explanation. Looking back on this and looking at the news today, it seems to me that many don\u2019t understand what it means to flatten the curve. I will compare taking no steps to flatten the curve with flatting the curve. Keep in mind that since we did take steps to flatten the curve, any quantities related to not flattening the curve are strictly estimates. First an image I found at dummies.com:  In this set of three curves the top image is the flattest (the highest point the curve reaches is closest to the X-axis, or to put it another way the Y value has the smallest max value). The bottom image is the least flat, the max Y value is the greatest of all three. One thing aspect of these graphs that differs from the discussion (and needs to be remembered) is the total area beneath their graphs is not equal. This discussion will be about two graphs who have an equal area under the line. The X axis (the horizontal line) of our graphs will be time, on the left will be early dates on the right will be later dates. The Y axis will be the number of new cases of COVID for a particular day. Without a vaccine a virus plows through a population. Moving from person to person getting people sick. If we had done nothing to prevent the spread of the disease, simply lived our lives exactly as we had before this started, the graph would look like the bottom graph, steep sides with a high peak. This would have overwhelmed the medical system we have in place. There would have been so many sick people sick at the same time that of those that needed assistance, some would have not been able to get assistance just too many people. But, we did take steps to \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d Which means that as the disease progresses through the population, at it\u2019s peak, that time when the number of new cases per day is at it\u2019s maximum. The doctors and hospitals will not be overwhelmed. Thus everyone that needs help will get help. This is why we want to flatten the curve. The steps we are taking are not to eradicate the disease, the only way to eradicate the disease to use a vaccine. What does this all have to do with kids going back to school? It all has to do with statistics and predicting the future. Where will be on the curve come September. Opening the schools is about looking for what will be happening then. It\u2019s not about what\u2019s happening now. There is a natural human tendency to think in terms of consistency, what\u2019s happening today is what will be happening a month from now. Thinking only in terms of consistency creates fallacious thinking. Simply saying it\u2019s bad today, so it will be bad in September is a logical fallacy. Besides, Trump isn\u2019t saying the schools must open. He\u2019s simply saying if the school isn\u2019t open then the federal government will not be sending money to those institutions that are not using the money for the intent it was sent. The federal government is looking for a return on investment. Their dollars are intended to create educated kids. Not, to line peoples pockets. If the school system doesn\u2019t want to open and this puts people out of work, Then they should get their money from the government through the channels that deal with unemployment. Schools are not to be creating \u201cunemployment\u201d offices for their out of work teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "There are probably several reasons. First is that it\u2019s something of a return to normalcy, and a lot of people feel the need for normalcy. Second is because, in America, it\u2019s pretty much an economic necessity. I\u2019m a teacher. I know that I\u2019m not \u201cjust a glorified babysitter,\u201d but I also realize that the time that students spend in school DOES allow many families to have both parents working. Which, for many of these families, is a necessity. When young children have to stay home, this means that someone has stay home to take care of them. In some cases, this is an extended family member (aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa), but many families don\u2019t have that luxury. Maybe they\u2019re young enough that all their own family works. Maybe they don\u2019t live near someone that can take care of their child while their child learns from home. It\u2019s not necessarily an ideological issue\u2026it\u2019s simple economic necessity. To be fair, 60\u201370 years ago, the family dynamic was much different. Many (maybe most) married women with children stayed home during the day. If a friend worked, chances are that their child could have stayed with the family next door during the day. That simply isn\u2019t as true anymore, and with more and more single-parent households, how is a child to be learning from home when they can\u2019t be home because their PARENT can\u2019t be home, or else they won\u2019t HAVE a home? Now, at the beginning, I believed that the federal government should have told all banks that, if they use the government\u2019s money to back loans, mortgage payments will stop until further notice. Perhaps a much-reduced fee that could keep SOME money coming into a bank to cover expenses, but no mortgage payments, and no real interest payed out or taken in. This would have necessarily have to have been extended to rent as well. ",
