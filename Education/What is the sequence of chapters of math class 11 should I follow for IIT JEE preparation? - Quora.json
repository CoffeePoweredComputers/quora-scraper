            "answer_text": "I think you should start with basic mathematical chapters like 1\u2014linear inequalities 2-logarithms These may be basic but they are really worth asking in JEE . Now here starts the main jee stream 1\u2014-Sets,Relations and Functions 2\u2014Quadratic Equations 3\u2014Trigonometry(excluding inverse trigonometric functions) 4\u2014 Binomial Theorem 5\u2014-Sequence and Series 6\u2014-Permutations and Combinations 7\u2014Straight Lines 8\u2014Circles 9\u2014CONIC SECTIONS 10\u2014Complex Numbers NOW ONLY FEW CHAPTERS ARE LEFT WHICH CAN BE DONE AT ANY TIME BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE SEQUENCE IN MY COACHING Probability- The whole probability was taught in class 12th (so here you have to manage in 11th) Statistics- It isn't in JEE Advanced course so just few notes were given and was completed in 2 lectures.(it was taught at last in 11th itself) Solution of triangles- Pretty tricky questions may be asked .It was taught after trigonometry. Introduction to 3-D geometry- It was taught before start of straight lines. But no need to worry as it will be taught in 12th in detail PS- THIS WAS THE SEQUENCE WHICH MY COACHING INSTITUTE FOLLOWED. AND IT'S A RENOWNED ONE. (Just below ALLEN). Now you can guess easily. Pls do UPOVOTE and share if you liked the answer. ",
