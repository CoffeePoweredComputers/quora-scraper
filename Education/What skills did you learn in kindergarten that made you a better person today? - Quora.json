            "answer_text": "I never went to kindergarten. It was war time. My mum and I moved to near where dad was stationed in the Royal Air Force. We lived in bed sitting room. We spent a lot of time exploring and picking flowers. She read a lot to me and I learned to read before I was five. I also knew my multiplication tables which made a big difference when I went to school at five, to a one teacher school where I taught contemporaries to read. So it gave me an excellent start in school life. ",
