My parents liked keeping grandkids for weekends and dad didn\u2019t respect the boy\u2019s diet. They feed kids everything they wanted and dad told the boy he could have pop with sugar. He gained weight at their house. His mom had him on a weight loss diet and was having to be strict telling he ate enough and her work was undone. He was informed if the boy gained at all at his house he couldn\u2019t keep him. Everyone needs to respect parental rights, diet, bedtime, tv or whatever. Unless they are abusive they have rights to raise their children their way. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s actually really bad for anyone to contradict your parenting skills in front of the children. I think you need to sit down with the offenders alone and let them know that you\u2019re not okay with that. Whether you want it or not though, you should also let them know you\u2019re open to constructive criticism as long as it is not done in front of the children and if the person cannot contain themselves in the presence of the children, you\u2019ll refrain from spending time with them and the children at the same time.
