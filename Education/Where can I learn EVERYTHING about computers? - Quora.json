            "answer_text": "If my opinion be longed for,I shall say that you don't really need to narrow up your scope. As far As I see,you are really and completely into Computer Science.  The whole thing is to learn every day, to get brighter and brighter. That's what this world is about. \"The hunger and thirst for knowledge, the keen delight in the chase, the  good humored willingness to admit that the scent was false, the eager  desire to get on with the work, the cheerful resolution to go back and  begin again, the broad good sense, the unaffected modesty, the  imperturbable temper, the gratitude for any little help that was given -  all these will remain in my memory though I cannot paint them for  others.\" As Frederic William Maitland said. So,Keep this endeavor going on :) Your zeal must be glowing like this flame of fire as it is :)Practice.Sit before the computer And see for yourself what you wanna know.!Search..!Explore..!That's how you'll learn. :) ",
