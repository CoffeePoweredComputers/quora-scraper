            "answer_text": "START SIGNING WITH HIM/HER NOW. This means start learning right away and using what you learn around your child. And by signing, I do not mean a signed version of whatever your national spoken language is, or paralinguistic systems such as Cued Speech. I am talking about a natural signed language, such as ASL or BSL or whatever. And don't worry if your signing is not perfect. Research has shown that children have the ability to mentally correct for the linguistic mistakes of their non-fluent parents, especially when you:Regularly expose your child to Deaf adults. It's not that hard. Go to your local school for the Deaf or Deaf club or attend a Deaf event with your child. Explain that your child is Deaf and you want your child to meet Deaf people, old and young. I guarantee you, you will find Deaf people very appreciative of what you're doing. Ask for a referral to someone who would be willing to act as something of a \u201cmentor\u201d or \u201cDeaf grandparent/uncle/aunt\u201d to your child and you. And if you meet someone you like, ask them to do this. Having a Deaf mentor is good for your child \u2014 not only do they get a good natural language role model to help them develop their signed language in ways you can't, but this person also lets your child know that this is something your child can grow up to be. And it's not good just for your child, it's good for you too. Meeting competent, confident, functioning Deaf adults will help you to see the adult your child can grow up to be. Moreover, these people have experienced all the things your child has and will go through, and they can give you tips and insights into how to raise your child in healthy, Deaf-centric ways.Enroll your child at a School for the Deaf, especially one with a good ASL-English bilingual focus, or at least a strong, ASL-based mainstream program (although in many ways, mainstreamed programs typically cannot offer many of the same benefits as a school for the Deaf).Treat your child normally in every way except for language. Whatever rules, expectations, behaviors you would set for a Hearing child, establish the same for your Deaf child. And Always instill a \u201cDeaf can\u201d attitude \u2014 no excuses just because they're Deaf.I can't emphasize this enough: Make ALL language accessible in house, even when it \u201cdoesn't concern the kid\u201d. This gives you practice in the language, but more importantly it provides the child with normal access to language and information that is picked up throughout life but not usually explicitly taught. This \u201cincidental learning\u201d is something that Hearing children routinely have access to, and this information typically gives hearing children an advantage that most Deaf children in Hearing-parented households don't have. Deaf children need to see the things adults talk abut and how adults resolve issues and problems, just as their Hearing peers do, and again, this helps when the child themselves become adults.Don't bother with cochlear implants \u2014 the risks are too great and the benefits are not guaranteed. If you must, go with hearing aids \u2014 at least this does not harm the child, and allows the child to make their own choices with their bodies.Develop good literacy practices \u2014 READ to your Deaf child and encourage your child to develop good written and receptive English skills. Instill your love of books (I hope you have one) into your child.If you do all of this, don't worry about \u201closing your child to Deaf culture\u201d. Unless you're a terrible, pedophilic sadist who routinely tortures children during satanic rituals, you will find that you will have a better relationship with your child than parents of Deaf children who decided to raise them \u201corally \u201c. I know I certainly wish my parents had done the above things for me. ",
