            "answer_text": "Originally posted as a comment but got too big: I cannot elicit any advantages over other countries, but here are some issues: Probably the biggest issue of all in US education is the increasing tendency to a \u201cOne Size Fits All\u201d approach. I believe that this has more to do with school funding than student education which has taken a major hit as a result. Students are very different and learn at different rates. Also some students excel in certain subject areas and struggle in others. The US concept of a GPA gives a very false impression of many students as it benefits the mediocre generalist. Any school where straight \u201cA\u201ds can be achieved through \u201cHard Work\u201d is letting their students down as \u201cA\u201d grades should not be achievable by the majority which is a good thing and should be understood not to be failure. Also the fact that an \u201cA\u201d means different things in different classes and factors have to be applied so that GPA\u2019s can go as high as the 5\u2019s is another red flag. Students should be graded on performance on individual subjects especially if headed to college. This brings me to another major issue with US education (it is in no way a \u201cSystem\u201d.) There are no universal testing or grading standards. Student grades are based on teachers\u2019 grade books which may be very prejudicial if the relationship is particularly good or bad. In any case the teachers can grade high or low across the board so kids in adjacent home rooms can appear very different. Add to that the horrendous practice of \u201cGrading on a Curve\u201d which means that in a clump of students of similar ability some will get A\u2019s and some might get C\u2019s which is blatantly unfair. American schools are run at (usually) a town level by elected school boards. These people are not required to have any prior education experience and are often just housewives. Curricula and learning materials are often selected by the boards who are subject to the publisher\u2019s salespeople who have a vested interest in frequent sales commissions. Every town board is an independent animal, so there is never going to be any consistency in US education. In addition the financial wastage in this model is extreme as there is no possibility for economies of scale. As a result facilities are usually lacking for both STEM and Fine Arts students. Last but not least, Tenure. This is a major symptom of a dysfunctional state. Teaching should be a career profession just like any other. This means that teachers should be evaluated frequently, rewarded accordingly and remedial action taken where necessary. School administrators have to be professional managers who are in touch with all aspects of their schools. Teachers should only be removed or disciplined under very well defined circumstances. I believe the concept of tenure came about because the schools have historically been run more on emotion than fact and knee jerk reactions needed a defense system. I believe we have to get away from tenure and go to a formal employment system just like any other industry. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello I myself was an immigrant from Australia to the United States and I came here for my higher education. I got enrolled in University of Florida and I am glad that I did! Not only is the education here in the US much better, the facilities, the exposure, the PR that you make with your peers, the social life\u2026 everything is much better. I would recommend you to checkout this article Perks of Being a Student in the USA which details the benefits and perks of being a student in the United States of America. As far as pros go, they are a lot, however, what the article fails to mention is the cons of the American education system. I\u2019ll try and list them below Too costly: International students are charged an exorbitant rate for tution! Plus when you combine room and boarding, food etc etc it is one of the most expensive education system (at college level) in the worldVisa Issues: Especially with the current government of Trump, they aren\u2019t very welcoming for international studentsWork problems: It is not easy to get full time work for international students, even after graduation, as visa can be a big hinderence.Hope this helps you out.
