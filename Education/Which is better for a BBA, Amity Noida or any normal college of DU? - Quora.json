            "answer_text": "A bachelor's degree like BBA doesn't really count in the long run. Unless of course if you intend on working right after graduation. Therefore it's better to do it from DU simply because of the fact that a BBA from Amity will cost you atleast 5 times more than the one from a DU college. So get a grad degree from DU, do well in CAT/ GMAT and go for an MBA. Where you get an MBA from is what really matters. ",
