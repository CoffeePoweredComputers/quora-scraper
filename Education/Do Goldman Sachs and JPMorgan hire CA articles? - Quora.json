            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Your question is a little confusing but I\u2019ll attempt to answer it. So companies like JP Morgan/Goldman Sacs are finance based companies which offer services related to investment banking, securities and other financial services. They don\u2019t run articleship for CA students. Only CA firms like PWC, KPMG, Kothari and Co. have the authority to employ articles. In no circumstance your internship at Goldman sacs can be validated as articleship by the ICAI. Now if you are asking whether qualified CAs get hired at Goldman Sacs or not, then the answer is yes. Typical CA jobs at these companies are: Internal Audit and consultancy servicesProduct and Funding controller: P&L reconciliation and trading analysisAccounting control and reporting functions for various business lines the company ownsRisk control and capital management ( need3\u20135 years of work ex)Investment Banking IB( rare for CAs, if you are a rank holder than you can get in here. IB back office is an option for CAs but it takes long to get to the front end job)Also if you take this advise if you are attracted to finance and Investment banking jobs then CA might not be the right course for you. Best of luck! ",

Even if you get shortlisted, they will offer you the profile they have vacancy in. But yes, you can always clearly mention your preferred field of work (in case you might get lucky enough to get that).",
