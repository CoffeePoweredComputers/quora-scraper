            "answer_text": "I tend to believe thinking is a more natural process, the very existence of humans is 'curiosity'. We have always asked and will continue to ask. For starters i'd suggest this -'Start with a why', I encourage this whenever I find someone not asking this. Probing someone to think, initiates the natural process. However to understand why it didn't happen naturally can be deeply rooted and may be time consuming. Under important situations, it is important to cure the root cause.Here's a great video I like - the power of 'Start with a why'~Apple's bondVideo link-How great leaders inspire action ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates maintained that \"I cannot teach anyone anything, I can only make them think\". Our 9th and 10th standard algebra problems could only be solved with 'a string of illogical characters', popularly known as formulas. I feel that the only help these so called formulas have got us, is that they've forced us to think in directions more than one.  All that we have done with these formulas is applied analogical analysis to problems at hand. In essence, together analyzing a problem and its solution followed by replicating the same resolution process elsewhere, is the only way to make one THINK. ",
