            "answer_text": "Well, you cannot know your destiny! But you can work at making it what you want it to be! Even then there are no guarantees in for our lives! As for what you will be in accordance with your DNA that's not an answer too many people can give, but I have an explanation as to what I believe. We are basically made up of different codes according to a mixture of biological matter that includes nucleic acids as to whom we will be. We have people in this world that do look like we do in different places! They may or may not act as you do. Even twins that are exact do not act exactly the same or even have the same fingerprints although their DNA will match! We become what we are through many different chemical reactions during the time that we are in utero. Nothing can give us a predestined future as to what we will become in later years after birth, but our environment has much to do with it also! Also, after birth it's partly up to us and our destiny that cannot be seen by anyone but God above! We are coded and that's how we are a person and not a bird or insect! Stop trying to figure it out, because you probably never will! And when you do find out why we are on this earth you will no longer be an earthly being with the ability to pass along your knowledge of why we are put on this earth because you would have passed on\u2026 You are an intelligent deep thinking person! There are many books out there that are so informative and with so many different answers, so therefore, if you read them you may come up with your own conclusion! Keep your mind open, never have just one perception about our creation or why we are who we are! This world is vast and the creation of life forms are of the same! Enjoy!! ",

            "answer_text": "How can I get a good tip on knowing your destiny? (\u201cyour destiny\u201d)??.. You're probably not, but, if you're implying to know about (\u201cmy\u201d) destiny, then I'm sorry this one has not been born, and the would be parents are already dead and buried.:) Ukaegbu, In surmise that it's your destiny in question, let's try a few things together. First of all, I must admit that this idea of one knowing his own destiny, is an error of the mind capabilities. Just a quick reflection on (The late- Princess Diana, her beloved son Harry and the father; waiting to be king, Phillip.) How would they, explain your question? I'd be eager to know. That's for sure. That of a destiny awareness is not mentally possible. Periodt. Establishing that as a (\u201cfrontal lobe\u201d) consciousness moving forward is probably the best road to travel on, as you play with the idea of knowing what tomorrow morning brings. Well, of course, destiny is the added on constant of the over-morrows. And one means what brings, not what's of the habitual routing. You see, destiny is really ghost related. You cannot see it, however, you can imagine, \u2014wish upon, sort of, the dream-kind-attitudes and approaches which will not amount to any thing, but simply what is. Which is always what's here, there and everywhere. Wether you're cognizant, or irresponsible, regardless to what one thinks and wishes, what (\u201cis\u201d), \u2014the most relevant but, for some reason, least recognized, and trusted to be; yet remains un perturbed over one's mis-conceiving off. Yes. That (\u201cis\u201d), is the destiny. Well, the reality at the moment, which is the real presentation of the living,\u2014(that material nature called life). The error of considering destiny to be a time future moment. An old ego trick, a psychological to pathological of a mind stretched, infesting the mental logic of the present/moments. A misguided mistake. Yes, Theresa, what it does unsuspecting, is actually distract one from the present time whenever that time is in its moments. Being less focus on the intentions of the moment, escaping the real life experience, in having focus instead on a imaginary anticipation of a future to come destination. (A God knows when future). Off course all you've got is just your chronological yearly,( invented birthdays), which you dearly relish, but really has nothing to do with the mysterious continuum of life's magic. Ok. So. Ukaegbu. There, you've found yourself in the mode control? Fear to say? :) I apologise if I'm mistaken, \u2014most heartedly. Trapped in alternating Illusions of the wayward mind. Destiny coated with the (\u201cwhat-may-seem-good\u201d). An imaginary dream intentioned coloured (\u201cdestiny\u201d). Ahh? Dancing with devil? That, is also of the same nature. A culprit of a mission impossible. Destin to be an illusive. However though on the worldly-lines; your are able to benefit, so it's not totally waste. Acquaint yourself to the players in the science of astrology. With a monster of an appetite, they'll ultimately convince you. Delve into the reading and study of your dreams, a tasking endeavour, but you may be intrigue,\u2014 a bit of fun in that. Look up the videos of the cosmos, and their numbers pinpointing up to your destination. :) Over (\u201csat\u201d) your self on your planetary signs and symbols. Again, you might find some interesting things about your character, which may lead you to wonder-control; cognitive to the impossible destiny knowledge. You must have heard the (\u201csilly phrase\u201d) that says, \u201cshoot for the stars, you may land on the clouds,\u201d at best. Well, how lucky you'd have to be to find clouds to support your weight. Just another stress to the psyche? So. Carefully demand from your conscience, some answers. Some meditative question only you are equipped to answer, as only you are able to be with you at all times. Ain't that amazing? Really, in all else, in all of this can't know all,- universe, cosmos, heaven, hell, planets, earth and nature? What's more? It's you and you, no matter where, in all of the time. Well, for you, home in your quarters, \u2014the place most comforting to you. And. There you ask yourself, why do you want to know about the non existing impossible, \u2014(destiny)? Is this a question based on fear? And if, why? Sort of interrogate your self, \u2014 a very cleansing thing to do. Great of a tip, when most logically contemplated. And, hope that you're of the trusting type, or the sceptical? This two qualities are of utmost importance before any agreements are to stick in your mind. Theresa. Are you ready to believe, as you are requesting to know? ",

            "answer_text": "When we are born, God sends us here with a destiny. It is difficult to know the destiny. Even an expert wise man who tells about destiny can never tell full destiny because God wants to keep some surprises. However, those interested to know the destiny, may adopt following methods. Where the result is dependent on our efforts, watch the efforts. If right efforts are being put and we are getting small successes (as per set targets), the goal for which we are working will be our most probable destiny, in 90% of the cases. 10% is left out for God\u2019s element of surprise. Also note that 90% is in cases where very few others are involved in our getting final success. This method does not work in cases like getting a lottery, selections where we are one among 1000, getting same day airlines reservations etc. Some persons of God can tell it up to 90% certainty. But do not spend too much time in searching the person of God. You will get him/her if you are destined to meet, so why spend too much time ? Good Astrologers can tell about it with 75% certainty. Here also, do not go on meeting Astrologers, one after another to get the best predictions. Remain satisfied with one or two and as regards the predictions made by them, do not take the same as certain and hence never stop your efforts if the same are required. ",

            "answer_text": "Quest to know your destiny is directing your efforts in the wrong direction. Your habits, character, circumstances, efforts, friends and family determine your destiny. You can make it whatever you want it to be. All you have to be is the best version of yourself and it will all take care of itself. If you believe in destiny, you know you can't change it. If it is in your destiny, nobody can take it from you and it is not in your destiny, nothing can give it to you. I like to think that God likes to maintain the balance between good and evil in his creation, the yin and the yang or heaven and hell\u2026 Having been born in India, I subscribe to the philosophy that your actions can be in your hands but not your fate or destiny. And, that all beings are born good and pure and our deeds determine what kind of person we end up being. The physical appearance is immaterial. The most beautiful or handsome person might not be the nicest person and the \u201cugliest\u201d person might be the kindest person on this earth. I believe that every being is His image or reflection and should be treated as such. This is why I think we should concentrate on being the best version of ourselves instead of focusing on the outward appearances of ourselves or of others. Believing in \u2018Destiny\u2019 shows you believe in there being a higher power that controls everything. So let's trust \u2018Him\u2019 to be just towards us and everyone else too and enjoy the ride. I like a quote from the Sikh philosophy, \u201cI did the deeds He directed my hands to do\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "There is such a thing Destiny based on previous lives account which shapes our present life. But at the same time there is a way to get rid of bad karmic account in present life. If we believe in Inner Power residing as Spirit in each one of us, it takes care of us and charts our path such that we live with joy and peace. And in our Ego, if we dont believe, the devil forces encash on opportunity to make our life hell. For example, if someone is too clever and takes pride in being cunning, he will be fooled no matter how meticulously he plans. On the other hand, if someone is innocent and belives in God, especially in feminine aspect of God, he will be saved even in war, quake, flood. The mistakes that we do are as follows: Purchase of God: We know that earth, Sun and Moon are working for us without any money. We cannot buy life from God. Still we think, we can buy God by donating in temples, churches etc. Money is a man-made thing, not God-made thing. Divine never understands money, (neither dollar, nor INR). When we donate in the name of God, we actually insult Him and invite His wrath.Fanaticism: Many religions are nothing but orthodox fanatic principles, very much against the incarnations they claim to follow. For example, Christ said offer your another cheek to someone who slaps you! Which Christian on earth practices it? Rather they abuse Him by drinking wine in His name. He never made any wine contrary to wrong myths created. Some indulge in fasting in the name of religious practice. For example, If its my child\u2019s birthday, I will celebrate with lavish food party. But if its a God incarnation birthday, I will fast!!!! Why? Whats the logic? If we worship God as our creator, why will He be happy to see us fasting and suffering? Isnt mankind already living in enough sufferings that He would be pleased to see us suffering further? A simple common sense which we dont use! Who will like it when we dont eat in birthday party of someone? By the way, fasting is not prescribed in any scriptures! The word actually is Upas Na \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0928\u093e ie Don\u2019t fast! Those who still do \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0938 (fast), they are given life of beggar in next birth, so that they can \u2018fast\u2019!Disregard for women: Its feminine power that runs the universe. SHE is known by different names as Divine Mother, Holy Ghost, Adishakti, Pratkriti, Devi and SHE has incarnated as Athena (Greek Goddess), Shri Sita, Shri Radha, Mother Mary, Fatima bi (daughter of Prophet Mohammad) and 108 times as Shri Durga. Most religions have ignored this feminine aspect of God and hence failed. Once we disregard feminine aspect of God and more importanly good respectable women, we invite wrath of all deities including Goddess. Indians have disregarded Shri Sitaji and its worthy women, so they suffer generally on poverty! Power of Shri Krishna is Shri Radha. Ra means Energy, Dha means Dharan (ie Sustain). If Shri Krishna alone had any powers He could have killed Kansa right after His birth!Ignoring Common Sense: God is aways fair. Schooling and formal education can be matter of man made privileges, but common sense is something that He ensured that everyone is born with. Often illterates are found to have more of it than many well read men! Kabira said, padhe padhe pandit hua moorkh (By reading too much, a wise becomes fool). It doesnt require anything to print any book. One is free to write anything and people read it as Gospel without applying common sense. This is how many so called spiritual and religious personalities have misled seekers of truth. So many false gurus have come up promising to \u2018sell\u2019 peace! If peace could be sold in shops then why there is no peace in the world when most have people have money? Do we ever use our common sesnse? We don\u2019t, so it gives business opportunity to fake gurus like Ravi Shankar, Sadhguru, Dalai Lama and anyone having prefix and suffix Baba and Swami in his name, esp those who have come up after 1970. They have made people their slave of their sex, power and money needs by hypnotising. People blindly offer money thinking they will be able to buy Divine Love. What will God do of our money, which is a man made thing? (Which can be demonetised anyday by any Prime Minister overnight). Do we ever think ???Black Magic: It is sold everywhere and people buy it. There will hardly be anyone who believes in God or who doesnt believe in God who never bought it! How? When we know its a bad and harmful thing, why we buy it? Actually it is sold by a different name! It is sold as white magic as spirtual thing. It is sold as spiritual mantra, magic mantra, special puja to change fortunes, as stones which people wear in their fingers to change their Stars or tabiz. Strangely proud athiest like Irfan Khan used to buy it to get cancer. He clearly said in his interviews he does not believe in God, then what is that Tabiz in neck his representing? Anti-God powers!So its a vicious circle we put ourselves into. Their followers gets incurable diseases and follow Astrologers, Tarrot card readers, fortune tellers etc who basically use Black Magic techniques to impress us and get things done for their clients. To ensure, client keeps coming back to them, they put some black magic in their lives, so smartly so that one comes again to them and revenue keeps rolling in. They cause much more harm than the loss of money to their clients. They give them diseases like Cancer and many more horrible incurebale diseases for life for which medical science has no cure. And for cure if one goes to black powers like Vipassana, alternative medicines, pranic healing, Reiki etc, then he further entangles himself into that fatal vicious circle.So in nutshell, the answer lies in being alert, catious, using common sense and believing no one but God that resides in our heart as the Spirit! The thing that is sold is Satanic power! ",

Now, what happens next isn\u2019t confirmed, so I believe that finding something which is not confirmed or probably would be created with time and your actions is completely impossible. Now having studied various scriptures and Srimad Bhagvad Gita, I can explain a concept of how actually the destiny works. Now just leave the past and future, as they are domain of god, but now YOU are in control of the present, of course with the will of Krsna, so in whatever condition you are is your destiny currently, but the actions that you take within this period shall create your destiny for next period. Coming to your actions, it is said that you have sanskara which means something that you have inherited from your past life or experiencing certain conditions due to your karma in present or past life. Now, in this there are two stages of further formation with relate with subconscious mind, one is Rag and other is dvesha and actions are pretty much controlled by these, so your destiny somewhere is related to your previous karma, and the action you are performing right now, which matters the most. karmanya vadi karasye, maa phalheshu kadachana You only have right to action, and not entitlement to any fruit, and neither should you think about it. So your actions define the destiny continuously but there is surely an element of God and previous karma, which should not bother you. Hare Krishna! ",

Destiny is what you wake up to in the morning and what you lay your head down on your pillow at night having fulfilled. Asking about Destiny is either delving deep into acceptance of your moment, or ( far more likely) hoping for an ideal future. So to satisfy this I'll ask: do you A) pick up the tools at your feet and do with them what they are best suited to accomplish, or B) create a hole in your life that is shaped exactly like you want and try to push every experience into the far recesses to fill in the gaps? Basically are you building towards fulfillment or are you fiddling about in the empty spaces between your actual hopes and dreams? Strong spirit that I know explained it this way \u2014 \u201cWhen I woke up one morning and was done bullshiting about in the woods looking for myself I wandered out of my tent buttnaked and held my hands up in the sky as the sun rose and said, \u2018I am ready for everything you have in store for me and I'm willing to take responsibility for everything that that brings!\u2019\u201d I see him out and about on occasion and he's got a lot of years under his belt so I guess thats worked out well for him.

People confuse Free Will with Destiny. Free Will is what you have from the start that allows you to shape your own end, course no one really thinks about their end til they are really close to the end. Everything is up to you when Free Will is involved, but that means that Destiny & Fate cannot exist alongside Free Will. Destiny & Fate are shackles, you do everything according to a preset plan before you were even born. Free Will has no shackles, you do everything according to your will and not the design of a cosmic entity. Can we know for sure with absolute 100% certainty that we have Free Will or are shackled to Fate & Destiny? No, we cannot possibly know that. Even Prophecy contradicts Free Will, for a Prophecy to work, everything has to be pre-planned along with every person alive involved in that plan whether they know it or not. ",

Krishna says: Now hear, O son of Prtha, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt. I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, both phenomenal and numinous. This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know. Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth. Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego -- all together these eight constitute My separated material energies. Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature. All created beings have their source in these two natures. Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution. O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread. --Bhagavad Gita 7.1-7  ",

My faith suggests that God may provide guidance, and my religion may influence my direction - my decisions about where I choose to go - but my destiny is completely within my hands. My belief is that one should learn to regularly reflect, whether that is through meditation, prayer, or just talking to yourself. This action will allow you to learn from mistakes, understand your course in life, and find your purpose through your present actions. Is this the best course? Is the path I travel the best one for me? Where is this path likely to lead? From that point, you can set some plans and move in a more positive direction. That path will lead to your destiny. Your path - your life - will be different. Embrace that. Be an observer and student in your journey. Your destiny will reveal itself. ",

In your daily life you have hundreds of such moments when you don\u2019t agree with your friends, family and other people around you. Some hot topics include your career, marriage and other stuff. You just want to follow the things you believe in. To do so, you have to be courageous to stand for them. and more importantly you have to act on them. Once you start living your life on your terms you will find that is your destiny. all actors, singers, writers, entrepreneurs and even the mad engineers and doctors they are part of this group.

            "answer_text": "Albert Einstein is known to have remarked \u201cI can\u2019t believe that God is playing with dice!\u201d Albert Einstein is one of the greatest of minds in human history. But his intelligence was focused on physics predominantly and perhaps not as much on life in general. Our destiny is precisely like rolling a dice. You have not the faintest idea as to what number is going to show up at the top. There are a million+ variables that govern your life. The macro world is believed to be deterministic but the quantum world is not. This shows clearly that natural laws allow for randomness. In any case no human has predicted what is to come with 100% accuracy. So how do you look at destiny? Well, follow Sri Krishna\u2019s advice. Sri Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that, all that you have under your control is to do your best. What the result is going to be is a great unknown. You may sow the seed, water it, put enough fertilizer and do all pest control that you need to do but will the seed sprout and produce a harvest or not is not under your control. Hope for the best and be ready to accept the worst. That is the way to be wise and happy. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Can Destiny Destiny Change?\" Astrology gives logical solutions Luck is created by karma. Today's karma only creates destiny. Efforts to always increase their capacity, with sweet speech and sweet behaviour, in the right direction, continuous proper actions lead to prosperity. Due to the prosperity of this birth, it is hidden in the deeds of previous lives, and the results of the deeds done in this birth will be found in the subsequent lives, it is believed that spirituality. According to astrology, the worship of Bhagyesh, Karmesh, Lagnesh, Dhanesh and Prathamesh are the suppliers of wealth. Tantra Shastra refers to the worship of his favourite with the worship of Yaksha Yaksini. Lakshmi and Kubera are Yakshini and Yaksha. In the night, Shringar is worshipped facing the west and is said to be a money supplier. Lal Kitab refers to the distribution of sweetmeats as a factor of honour and glory. Chanting of Maya and Aishwarya seeds under the vine tree also provides wealth, according to Tantra sources. A few days ago a curious asked us this question, \"Is change possible in the future?\" In general, terms, if the future is predetermined, then how far it is possible to bring changes in it? If destiny is certain, how can it be changed, it is a problem of every kind and they do not get the right answer. Today we will discuss the same issue to what extent and how can we change the future of predetermination? This is a difficult question and this solution is even more difficult !!  First of all, it is necessary to know that according to astrology, every living being takes birth from its own birth. According to the main Lagna, lunar Lagna and sun Lagna, the destiny of the creature is fixed and he keeps fighting with this destiny throughout his life. Some people are very lucky, in whose luck only and only happiness is written throughout their life and there is no shadow of misfortune on them. But what about the innumerable people who are always weeping for sorrow !! According to astrology, planetary signs leave their full impact on every human being and normal human beings have no way to avoid them. But after the invention of astrology, the planetary planets falling on man were clearly identified and various measures were also created at different times so that humans could be protected from cruel and sinful sightings of the planets and by warning them in time to correct The solution can be suggested. So we come back to the same basic question\u2026 ie, is future change possible? So Astrology answers yes. But its limits also determine how much time can be avoided by avoiding the impending crisis. Astrology puts forward its view with full logic as to how a pre-determined Destiny can be changed. It needs to be deeply understood. Now try to know this with an example: Two horoscopes come in which the planets of complete divorce are present. Normally, no person would approve such a marriage. But a scholar astrologer will understand this very deeply and will express their opinion only after a minimum examination of planetary forces. Keep in mind that astrology follows the principle of negative-negative = positive. In such a situation, if the two existing horoscopes exist exactly equally i.e. neither one less nor one more, the planets that induce such divorce, then they completely neutralize each other's faults and if there is a relationship between them. Then it will be difficult to find a happy couple like them. However, the biggest obstacle in this is the same planets and forcing humans to think negative rather than positive. In such a situation, man becomes a puppet in the hands of the planets and he does not think of any trick from his side. That is, the planets obstruct thinking and motivate a man to walk according to his own destiny so that he does not change his destiny and he is at a loss by doing the work of pre-destiny recording. Perhaps you must have got the idea from this that if a man wishes, he can change his destiny by precise and timely measures, but the planets prevent him from doing so repeatedly. In such a situation, only the lucky ones are able to fight their destiny and change their fortunes to have a happy life. ",

When the arc of karma comes back, you will experience on your own body what you once did to others. In this life or in a past life. Karma can be slow and quick to come back to the person who sent it out. It can come back in this life and it can come back in a later life. But one thing is 100% certain: it WILL come back. Nobody can understand his or her fate seen in a one-life perspective. Your destiny is shaped by our own previous actions. The goal of of long journey of evolution is to become real, all-loving human beings, who live to serve others. That is the goal, so the more you practice friendship, help and universal love the closer you are to your goal. ",

To place yourself in God\u2019s hand and accept His will over your own will? It would be easier to move a mountain for some people. And while these three rules are a process, they are also a simultaneous endeavor. It is not a matter of waiting to finish one to start the next.

            "answer_text": "This world of humanity is based on full freedom and absence of any forcible destiny. Here, you are free to do any type of work and no destiny forces you to do any specific work as said in the Gita (Na kartrutvam...). The concept of destiny exists only in the link of the specific work and the specific fruit. You have full freedom to put your finger in fire or water. No destiny forces you to put your finger in fire or water. The destiny lies only in the link between a specific work and corresponding specific fruit. It is destined that the fire burns your finger and the water keeps your finger cool. The destiny is not in the selection of the work.  You have put your finger in the fire due to ignorance or ego. After burning the finger, you may say that you have put the finger in the fire due to the destiny. God has destined the specific system, which links every action with a specific fruit. After putting your finger, God is not ordering the fire to burn it. The subsequent fruit for a specific work is already destined. God or the destiny does not interfere with the choice of your selection of a specific work. Even the so called past destiny does not interfere with your works. The composition of your psychology is fixed based on your past deeds. Thus, work is responsible for the will and the will is the generator of the work. Since the composition of your psychology is already based on your past deeds and is fixed, you can treat that as destiny and in such case, destiny is guiding everything.  The psychology is a specific pattern of ideas generated by the past deeds and it is called as \u2018Samskara\u2019. An idea can be changed by knowledge. Samskara is a fixed concept and the right knowledge is a group of right concepts. You have the opportunity of hearing the right knowledge since God comes to this world quite often in human form. You have the freedom to hear such divine knowledge or not to hear. You have also freedom to practice the knowledge or leave it without practice. At every step, the basic freedom is given. This human world is also the right place for testing the devotees and here also, the full freedom is protected. You are totally free to sacrifice anything or not to sacrifice anything even if God desires for it. God does not force you or threaten you or wash your brain in your sacrifice since such sacrifice is not real. God is pleased only with the real sacrifice done by the soul in the atmosphere of total freedom.  In the examination hall, you are totally free to answer the question paper to any extent or even to return the white paper without writing even a word. God preaches the total concept and in the stage of implementation of it, God does not influence your mind in any way. After teaching all the right knowledge through the Gita, Krishna said that the decision to fight or not is totally left to Arjuna (yathechchasi\u2026). The basic reason is that God is not in need of anything from anybody. The sacrifice is not to satisfy God but only to uplift you. The sacrifice proves your real attachment to God and such real attachment is not in the benefit of God but it is only in your benefit. Krishna asked for the special gem from Satrajit, the father of Satyabhama. Krishna is not in need of that gem. He is the creator of that gem. Even without the help of that gem, He can create wealth. He can even stop the power of the gem to create the wealth. Krishna asked the gem from Satrajit because Satrajit cannot maintain it and will fall in trouble.   Only for the welfare of Satrajit, He asked him for that gem. But, Satrajit thought that Krishna asked that gem for His personal benefit and thereby, for His personal satisfaction. Such misunderstanding made Satrajit to refuse the gem. Astrology says that the happening of good or bad incidents is due to the planets. This misunderstanding again leads the people to think that their actions are destined by the planets. Here, your actions are not destined by the planets. Your actions are only destined by your psychological set up, which is destined by your past deeds. The planet links the specific fruit for the specific action.   You do something based on your Samskara. The planet gives its correspondent fruit immediately. You blame the planet for guiding you to do a specific work and this is totally wrong. A planet is only destined to give the specific result linked with your specific action. The specific work is based on your specific psychological pattern only. The horoscope gives the composition of your specific psychological pattern. Since your future actions also depend on the same pattern, future prediction can be easily given. A specific psychological pattern is always linked with a specific composition of planets representing your qualities or ideas.  Therefore, there is no external destiny here other than yourself regarding your future. If the Samskara is modified with the help of the divine knowledge, the whole destiny is changed, which means your horoscope totally disappears. Every period is divided into sub periods, every sub period is again divided into further sub periods and every division involves the revolution of all the nine planets again and again. This means that human being is a mixture of both good and bad always in every step of the time.  Actually, the basic concept of astrology indicates that there is the existence of some unimaginable supernatural force that guides this world. Hence, astrology is an introduction for the philosophy. Without taking this basic reality, you misuse the astrology to justify yourself by linking your wrong actions to the planets. The worship of the supernatural and unimaginable planets introduces the worship of unimaginable God. But, this is again misused as the worship of the planet for not giving the bad result for the bad action done by you.  If you worship God, He will preach you the right knowledge, which changes the total destiny. By your worship, God will not protect you from your sins. Therefore, in this world, the destiny is also in your hands only. There is full freedom for you to change your destiny through the right knowledge. Hence, this world of humanity is called as \u2018Karma Loka\u2019, which means that your actions decide everything and that your action is based on your psychological pattern only and not by any pre-determined external destiny. The upper worlds are called as \u2018Bhoga Lokas\u2019 because there is no freedom to perform any new action and you have no freedom at all, but for enjoying the destined results for your already recorded actions.  \u2018Pravrutti\u2019 means attachment to worldly bonds. \u2018Nivrutti\u2019 is detachment of your worldly bonds for the sake of God. This world is the stage for both pravrutti and nivrutti. Full freedom up to the level of changing your destiny exists here. Your destiny is only your fixed psychological pattern generated from the past deeds and not any other external force. This pattern can be changed by the right knowledge received from God in the form of preacher. Therefore, there is every chance for changing your destiny in this world. Generally, people blame the reason for their bad actions to be some external force called as destiny in which there is no trace of their personal psychological involvement. People say, \u2018People say so\u2019. The people cannot be the authority unless the whole subject is perfectly analyzed. Even there are several misinterpretations in books written by ancestral scholars. You should not blindly take the people or the ancient books as authority without analyzing them perfectly. The Gita says that you will laugh at such authorities if you analyze the subject with sharp scientific intelligence (Buddhyaayukto\u2026).  Even if the implementation is impossible, it is better to have the right knowledge, which follows the soul to the next birth so that the practical implementation can be done sometime in the future. This point looks quite good, but there is the practical danger. Just like the cooked food can be attacked by the bacteria in the atmosphere, the right knowledge is also attacked by the worldly attractions and sometimes, the right knowledge may become weaker and weaker and even may finally disappear even in the later part of this life. Therefore, it is better to implement the realized concept as early as possible like eating the cooked food immediately. ",

If you want to be a checkout chick be the best you can, that means know the job. You may want to get into the upper part of that business. That will entail education that can help you understand the business. Accounting, organising skills, economics. If you want to be a brain surgeon it is still education. What you put in to achieve is up to you. No one owes you anything. Barring wars, viruses other accidents etc you whilst you have a choice it is up to you. If you want to be a lay about and think you are owed anything then you can go that way. Nothing comes to us without our input. Nothing gets you nothing. But you can bet all choices in your life are yours. But don't waste your life it ain't that long. ",

In my own experience I have been able to mix my passion (martial arts) with work (teaching martial arts).Although I still have to keep a part time day job to get by and make rent, I sleep noticeably better at night than when I was working full time and had extra money for whatever. I would not trade being able to do what I love every day for any amount of money;and when money isn\u2019t your main driving factor and it\u2019s the passion for the field that motivates you,IMO that\u2019s how I know I am inline with my destiny.If you are in a place where you don\u2019t quite know what you are passionate about, start by trying what you think you might like.Life is like a video game,you learn as you go. Destiny is decided by what you do now.I know one day I\u2019ll be there in a position where I can quit my day job; but at the moment it\u2019s not that bad knowing that after work I\u2019ll be going to my happy place. A good book I can recommend about destiny is The alchemist by Paulo Coelho ",

Who does the planning? If we can change a million things with a million choices how are destined to make the choices we make no matter how we make them? How would you know? And, more importantly, who or what is doing the planning? Humanity is at the mercy of genetics, circumstance and choice. To assume any of it is planned without evidence of such planning means that destiny is an illusion. ",
