            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely, and we even encourage it. The fact is, we want students to learn. Whatever tool they can use to accomplish that is welcomed. I have students who ask me at the beginning of each unit, \u201cAre there any YouTube videos on this we can study?\u201d I can usually answer that I have already put the links on their class page. I had a student last semester who would send me links every time she found a video relevant to what we were discussing. Sometimes the videos were ones I had seen, but other times they were not, and I added them to my list of videos to share. I had another student who downloaded all the videos he could while he was at school so that he could watch them at home. He would also share them with any students who wanted them. Many of my students do not have internet outside of school. Of the ones who have internet only on their phones, most are not on unlimited plans, and they aren't going to use precious data on school related videos. Having access to them offline or at school makes a difference. My students keep asking me when I am going to make YouTube videos. I tell them that my odd sense of humor is probably best left to the classroom, and there are plenty of people making better videos than I could. I will leave that to them. If students are willing to watch videos to learn, more power to them! ",

Sadly though, very few actually seem to look at them. Perhaps because as soon as they go on YouTube, they find their favourite pop stars, a play through of a stage of a game they\u2019re having trouble with and some cat videos? ",
