            "answer_text": "The is a whole universe of investment out there - from stocks, bonds, options, commodities, property. So are you talking about this overview when you want to learn about investment planning and analysis? ie which assets to select, which investment style to select eg technical vs fundamental. Or are you more specific in learning about one particular investment class eg stock market? If you are talking about the stock market, there are 3 skills you need to develop how to analyze companieshow to value themhow to mitigate against risksI have not come across any book that covers all these 3. Because of this, I have curated a list of articles, podcasts, videos that is available free online and categorized them into 3 levels of expertise. Someone who is interested to learn about how to invest as a value investor can then pick the appropriate level to start. If you are thinking of this, then search \u201cbaby steps into the investment universe\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Not my cuppa, but that sounds more like \u201cportfolio management\u201d than it does \u201ctrading\u201d or \u201cinvesting\u201d. If so then other search-engine seed phrases would include \u201cefficient frontier\u201d and \u201cmodern portfolio theory\u201d. If I were to recommend any reading to the student, I would recommend tacking \u201cwikipedia\u201d on to the end of your selected search-engine seed, for an overview. Bottom line here, search engines respond well to specific \u2018terms of art\u2019, so that\u2019s not a bad way to start to learn these days, cultivating an \u2018ear\u2019 for the \u2018jargon\u2019.
