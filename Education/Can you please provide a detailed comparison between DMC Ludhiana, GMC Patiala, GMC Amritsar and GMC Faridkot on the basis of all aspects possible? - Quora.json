            "answer_text": "Order of preference in govt colleges- GMC Patiala> Amritsar> Faridkot This is a multifactorial decision based on faculty, infrastructure and patient in load. Even though Faridkot outcasts Patiala and Amritsar if talking abt infrastructure but it is still new and experience counts in medical field! DMC Ludhiana being a private institution has amazing infrastructure (almost comparable to AIIMS and PGI) but the cost comes a deciding factor here. The overall tution fees of MBBS in govt. Colleges is 4.4 lakhs while that in DMCL (govt quota) is nearly 14\u201315 lakhs. Hostels are definitely not so great in govt colleges. I hope I could give u a brief about it. ",
