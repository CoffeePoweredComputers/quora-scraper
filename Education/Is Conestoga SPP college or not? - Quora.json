            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to answer this as best as I can. The SPP, or Student Partner Program (Canada\u2019s SPP: All You Need to Know | Admission Table \u2013 Your Study Overseas Counselor). Introduced by the Canadian government to specifically aide Indian students who wish to study and eventually work in Canada. The program will hasten the visa process, thereby ensuring that students not only receive their visas sooner, but can do so with minimal documentation. A few colleges have been handpicked by the Canadian government to participate in SPP. Most of these colleges are funded by the government and all of them offer education of the highest standards. The above text is directly from the website. The website goes into detail about what courses are available under the SPP? What are the eligibility requirements? And, all of the other college\u2019s that are part of the program. The link above should be able to provide you with all your FAQ\u2019s and provides contact information for further detailed enquiries. As a Conestoga Alumnus (2011), I can say from personal experience, that the school is excellent! They provide students with every opportunity to succeed. I hope this answer helps. If not, please let me know which details you\u2019re looking for, and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible. Otherwise, I wish you every success in your future (with or without Conestoga). ",
