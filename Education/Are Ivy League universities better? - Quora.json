            "answer_text": "Definitely! It was not until I attended Princeton that I appreciated the substantial importance of campus culture. In my experience, the Ivy League schools \u201cspecialise\u201d in this\u2014particularly, in the culture of achievement. What that means is that you will be surrounded by people who can\u2019t help but want to be active in moving the frontier, taking on the world and offering other people something of value. That probably seems idealistic (and it is, for many) but you ultimately discover that most students embrace this feeling. By contrast, I attended Northwestern and Stanford as an undergraduate. While both schools are also elite and have brilliant students, I found the cultural element lacking (in retrospect) by comparison to my later experience at Princeton. What was lacking? A sense of confidence and unconditional support by the school and faculty. In particular, I found that many (though far from all) Northwestern students who\u2019d been rejected from Ivy League schools, felt disgruntled and insecure about it. This feeling, in my view, was further reinforced by the academic schedule and faculty approach which seemed hellbent on making students prove themselves, even after having already undergone rigorous admission standards. For example, every class I took was graded on a curve, where the average grade had to be a \u201cC\u201d or even a \u201cC-\u201d. And someone had to fail. One class I took, an \u201cF\u201d was an 82%! This seems fair, I suppose, but today the world\u2019s perception of a \u201cC\u201d (as in the \u201cgentleman C\u201d) is not what it once was. Getting a bunch of \u201cB\u2019s\u201d on the your transcript, though truly good grades at NU in any class, will definitely hurt your chances at gaining admission to top graduate schools elsewhere. My point is that the professors seemed to take the approach that the students were second-best, and that reinforced the insecure culture. Furthermore, when people are insecure, their conversations shift away from ideas to people and, in America, that means shifting towards discussions of race, gender and ethnicity. Really, these are stupid topics. But they became primary topics on campus. It was like America, at-large, today. And this only added to the negative climate, however, as people seemed wounded by the discussions. Indeed, at times I felt many of my white classmates resented having to attend school alongside minority students, especially if we got the top grades. They walled themselves off into fraternities and sororities, with just a few opening their doors to \u201cnon-traditional\u201d candidates. I just never felt this at Princeton. One always got the strong impression that Princeton loved its students and would go the extra mile (or the extra hundred miles) necessary to make sure its students are seen as the best there are; that they would be placed in the best graduate schools and jobs after graduation and that they would be continually supported throughout their careers and lives. In fact, the only place at Princeton where I felt the presence of a \u201csecond-best\u201d culture was in my department\u2014economics. This might have been because most of the economists were from MIT and many people (naturally) felt MIT was the best economics department in the world. Perhaps it was but, ironically, I hated MIT\u2019s campus and culture. Overall, Princeton is just more prestigious anyway and, in retrospect, that was an important consideration, since I chose later to leave the field. In any case, I don\u2019t believe the economics faculty understood the Princeton culture of going the extra mile, or at least I never felt it did. It was an anomaly. I suspect this had to do with the faculty being comprised of economists, as many economists come from humble backgrounds: where people are preoccupied with talking about stupid things like race, gender and ethnicity. Economists themselves are also insecure with respect to mathematicians. In any case, I think that was a uniquely bad experience. The Labor Economists, in fact, were very different, as were the Israelis (whom I enjoyed spending time around). Otherwise, I felt attending a Ivy League school was more than worth it and I sometimes wish I had known that in high school. NOTE: I don't want to cast a negative an impression of Northwestern or non-Ivy\u2019s. My comments reflected the feeling I sensed among other students\u2014not the feeling I personally held about the school. In fact, I felt fortunate to be there and took so many extra courses just to explore the environment that I graduated with almost a full year of additional credits. NU afforded me the ability to do this (as long as I kept my grades up!) and I believe this definitely shaped my future in many ways. Moreover, what I failed to mention is that while there, I took part in a specific college\u2014the College of Commerce and Industry\u2014and this college (which was also a dorm) consisted of an inordinate number of high achieving people. As a result, my grades and study habits were greatly boosted while living there, as I learned much from my room mates and dorm mates. In other words, I believe CCI replicated much of what I later found was more generally part of the Princeton environment. I have no doubt every elite school has such pockets, and I would encourage you to not be dismayed should you not gain entrance to an Ivy League school. Ivy League schools perhaps specialise in creating great culture, but they, by no means, have a monopoly on great culture. ",

The level of self-actualization to be worthy of admission -today- makes you so strong that it makes other faucets of life trivial. It\u2019s like making the Olympic wrestling team and not going. You\u2019re still formidable. But no one cares. I think that Ivy League schools are idea factories and there\u2019s really no better place to develop from 18\u201326. Especially if your life ends at 26.  You should work day and night getting in, and become self actualized enough to earn getting in. But how many high school applicants know what management consulting even is? Who had goals like that while studying for AP Calc BC? We wanted to shoot rockets so they\u2019d land on Mars. If they don\u2019t get in, they\u2019ll still want to aim for management consulting jobs etc, to imitate Ivy League results. Once non-first world countries raise their standard of living their kids will push the undergrad admissions rate down to below 1%. Get in now and smile forever. Just like people who applied 10 years ago did. For me, they didn\u2019t take as many AP credits as I wanted. I didn\u2019t want a hard time/responsibility. I didn\u2019t fit in when I visited. I went to a silent film, fiddled with my thumbs and was asked to be quiet by an older gentleman. Then I left. Going to my state school guaranteed a secondary school teacher job. Graduate one year early, that\u2019s a Tesla. Two years early and that\u2019s a Tesla and a house down payment. And I didn\u2019t have to take multiple regression analysis. And I wouldn\u2019t have to get fired without good cause after a bit (schoolteacher tenure). And time. And not exactly the high stress of being a pediatric surgeon. Go if you want to be the biggest battery version of yourself. If you just want to be a consumer, there\u2019s easier ways. And remember, if you were good at life, you wouldn\u2019t need more school.

Put another way: The Ivy League is a prestigious organization because of the caliber of its member institutions; but not the other way around. There are plenty of universities that are considered \"better\" than some or all of the Ivy League colleges. Taking a look at Thomson Reuters' World University Rankings 2013-2014, let's see how the 8 Ivy League universities stack up:  Harvard (3)Princeton (6)Yale (11)Columbia (13)Penn (16)Cornell (19)Brown (52)Dartmouth (126)Certainly a super impressive list. But you could never convince me that any of those schools are \"better\" than, say: Caltech, Stanford, MIT, Oxford, and Cambridge. They could be equivalent, but certainly not better. And then there are a large number of universities that might not necessarily compare well to Harvard on all measures, but stack up very nicely to at least some or most of the Ivy League schools. I'm talking about Cal-Berkeley, UChicago, Duke, Michigan (shameless plug for my alma mater), Northwestern, the London schools, etc. As an athletic conference, though, Ivy League schools are sort of crappy. I guess they're good at hockey and lacrosse...? Don't go to an ivy League university if you want to watch big-time college football, my friend. ",

It doesn\u2019t hurt to have a \u201cHarvard\u201d \u201cYale\u2019 or \u201cPrinceton\u201d on your degree. Now, here is the proverbial dilemma. Is it better to go to an Ivy League school and get C\u2019s or to a lesser known school and get A\u2019s? Scenario: You are an employer. You have two candidates. One graduated from Harvard with all C grades. Another graduated from Iowa State, (just an example), with straight A\u2019s. All other things being equal, whom do you hire? Difficult. Is it better to be a bench warmer non-starter, professional baseball player in the Major Leagues or a everyday player, all star in the minor leagues? You decide., ",
