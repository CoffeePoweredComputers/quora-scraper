            "answer_text": "Because school does not always prepare you for life. This was written by me last week: Somebody asked me: How do I get over the fact that some people will be better than me?There are things in life that you do not need to worry about, this is one of them. Decided what you want in life, set you goals, work out a plan to reach those goals. Then work very hard. I am uneducated. I went to an all black school as a child where an experimental form of teaching was used that was meant for deaf children. I had no connection between letters and sounds. I did not understand grammar. I am a high school drop out. I spent most of my life as a functioning illiterate. However, if I heard a word I did not know, I always looked it up in a dictionary. I made the most of my natural talents and worked very hard. I was naturally good at sales. I earned money as a sales person and put my children in very good private schools. In that school, they were taught phonics. My five-year-old daughter taught me phonics. All my children are much smarter than me and some are embarrassed by my grammar. As I grew, my business, people would come to me for jobs. People from Ivy League colleges worked for me, the illiterate. If I needed a letter sent out, I had to have someone else do it for me. I never let my lack of education get in my way. When I was in my forties, my kids went to college. I went with them. Professor Steve Simpson from Otero Junior College took me under his wing and taught me the basics of English and Grammar. Sadly he passed before he was done teaching me but at least now I can communicate in writing. I also got many hours of tutoring from a friend and homeschool specialist Debbie Radstorm.Do not worry about being better or worse than someone else. Competition is a trick of the weak. We are all in this together, and we all have our strengths to add to the world and weaknesses which we need help with. Decide what you want and do life. ",

            "answer_text": "Before college, school is mandatory. You MUST attend or your parents will get into a lot of trouble. (Homeschool is school and is heavily regulated/watched.) After high school, colleges only accept people who they believe will be successful. You need high GPA, test scores, enriching activities, and other evidence that you're smart. Regardless of what people say, whether you drop out or fail out is not of concern. These people were admitted and had to progress or leave just like anyone else. When it comes down to it, the question you're asking is why do people who were forced to go to school or accepted into a college fail out and become successful? The answer is they CHOSE to do something else that they liked and were great at. I am a person who hated school with every fiber of my being- the rigidity and the structure and the people who bullied me. When I left the system, I felt that, for the first time, I had exercised my right to have a choice in my life. I didn't just have to follow a path. I could finally chart my own course. In college, I was fine until I realized there was no one keeping me there. No one could make me do anything. Not my parents. Not the school. So I left. They accepted me because I'm inteligent and I'm showing them just how intelligent I am. I'm so intelligent that I KNOW I never needed them. I didn't buy into their propaganda that college is success and security. I'm the kind of person who will always seek out information. I read everyday. I maintain three library cards of different libraries in my area. Most people who graduate college don't read a book ever again.  TL;DR: I'm an adult, college drop out and I exercised my right to decide my own future. I chose what I wanted to do and I'm great at it. I'm sure I'll be successful. Already am because I'm happy for once. ",
