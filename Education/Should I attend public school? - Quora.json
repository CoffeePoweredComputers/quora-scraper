            "answer_text": "You know how you worry about the prejudices people have about homeschoolers? Try not to let your prejudices about brick-and-mortar school get you down. Look up your local school, see what people say about it. I homeschooled my kids, private schooled, and public schooled.  There were times when each of them worked great, and times when each worked poorly. The thing is, you don't have a sign on your head that say \"homeschooled.\"  No one will know, until they have gotten to know you. If someone asks where you went to middle school, try saying, \"I homeschooled last year.\"  No need to explain the whole thing. Give them a chance, and see if they just don't happen to like hanging out with someone who is different.  My son is different, they liked him. Depending on your state, lots of places allow you to go back to homeschooling if public school doesn't turn out to be a good fit.  So, you might as well try it. ",

            "answer_text": "High School educations in general are usually terrible nowadays but I agree going to public school could be very beneficial.  There may be people at the high school who pick on you but remember that is because of their own insecurities and pay no mind to it.  Many people in high school like to develop diverse and unique interest at that age they start to find themselves.  As long as you are friendly and talk to people you should have no problem.  Your concern over being able to talk to people is one of the main reasons I dislike the home school education as public school prepares people for many social situations. ",
