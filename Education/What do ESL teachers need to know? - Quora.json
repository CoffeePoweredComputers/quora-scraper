            "answer_text": "Steven gave a great answer. Teachers need to know English, there are so many losers in Korea who can\u2019t even speak it properly trying to teach. So many of them need to brush up on grammar. I just got offered a job at a huge academy as a hiring manager so I could weed out the lame vs the qualified. Our academy has an Indian guy from Hawaii who thinks he\u2019s the best teacher ever, but he sounds like Raj from the tv show \u201cBig Bang\u201d and his grammar level is similar to the jr high students here. So many Korean adults leave after a few classes, so he just got stripped of all adults. Finally, it\u2019s not about you!!! ",

            "answer_text": "A lot. I took a four month course with classes for four hours every day. Here\u2019s the typical 100 hour curriculum for being certified to teach ESL in a non-credit situation: Unit One - An Introduction to English Language Teaching (10 hours) Unit Two - Teaching Language Skills (25 hours) Unit Three - Adapting Subject-Specific Content (10 hours) Unit Four - Structuring and Delivering Lessons (20 hours) Unit Five - Managing Your Teaching Environment (25 hours) Unit Six - Resources and Materials (10 hours) So, like any other teaching course, you learn about the history of the field, teaching techniques, how to tailor them to people with different skill levels, how to do a lesson plan, and how to deal with issues that arise int the classroom.
