            "answer_text": "As soon as there are only standard children in standard families with identical goals there will be a 'best' private school. Until then, the best school for the dyslexic children of some of my friends will be the specialist school near them.  The best school for my nephew will be the famous British public school that offered him a full scholarship.  The best school for an aspiring tennis player might well be a specialist academy in California.  The best school for a child from a stable and loving family with strong emotional and intellectual support for them is likely to be any good school that is close enough for them to stay at home. Having been brought up in the private school system, and with many teachers as friends and relatives, the most important insight was one from my father (a private school teacher and then school inspector for 45 years).  He advised very strongly against trying to cram a child with private tuition to get them to scrape a place by the skin of their teeth at an academically competitive school.  That school might give the parents a feeling that they have done the 'best' for their child, but the child is probably doomed to a school life of relative failure and disappointment.  That is rarely a recipe for success, however illustrious the school is. One other point to note is that schools develop their brands in clever ways, so don't be tricked by the numbers.  I went to a school with a headmaster who was a superb businessman.  He managed to make the school the best tennis school in the UK by virtue of offering specialist scholarships to a number of aspiring tennis players, and hiring good coaches.  The majority of the pupils at the school never picked up a tennis  racket in their whole school career. ",
