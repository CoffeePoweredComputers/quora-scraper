            "answer_text": "Yes you can, because all emails are free,but you must control the PASS WORD, otherwise some idiot will change it intentionally and your objective will be lost (and students are expert to put into trouble). Otherwise you have to open account in individual\u2019s name which may be hectic according to the number of the students. If your objective is to spread education or teach online or after the school/college hour, discuss something, giving notes then :_ I suggest you one thing: Ope a FACEBOOK page on education and create a Closed Group page of which you will be the Administrator, without your permission nobody will be able to post anything in that group, moreover the entire control will be in your hand, which will not be possible in email. Tell your students to create FB account and go ahead. ",
