            "answer_text": "I see no reason why you can\u2019t apply for an IB school. It will be a new experience for you and combined with CBSE, it should make you an all rounder in academics and outside. You might find the program tough initially, because of two main reasons; tougher English and importance to extra-curricular activities. In CBSE, English is usually neglected a bit, while the sciences and math are prioritized, while the IB is not so. It gives equal status to all subjects and also has English literature, which is not taught. There will be a significant change in the teaching and learning styles as well. IBDP encourages self-learning and research, while CBSE (as far as I know) has fixed books to learn from. In IB, the student is trained for university by writing essays, sports activities, community service and others. The IB program focuses on the overall development of a student, and has proved to be a rich course, which makes the student ready for university and the world at large. If you decide to take the course, it will be a very enjoyable and exciting experience for you, along with your overall development. Cheers, and good luck! ",
