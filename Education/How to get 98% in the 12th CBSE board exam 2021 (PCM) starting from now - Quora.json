            "answer_text": "I gave my Class 12 CBSE this year, and I scored 98.2%. Initially when result was declared, I got 97.8%, but on sending my English Core paper for re-evaluation, my score increased by 3 marks. Anyway, Physics: Concepts are very important. Learn all derivations. Make sure you know every derivation before the final exam, because any derivation can be popped as a numerical question, or an mcq, or a short answer. Secondly, during school course, finish ncert numericals and examples. Theory also is very important to answer intrinsic questions asked. For the one mark questions, try doing NCERT Exemplar. Chemistry: Make sure you know everything in NCERT. Every equation, every condition for every reaction, every mechanism, every named reaction in Organic chemistry. The inorganic chemistry in NCERT is vast enough to be enough for JEE Advanced itself, or so, my teachers told me. Anyway, yeah the inorganic is very good in NCERT. If in particular you want a book to practice chem, I would recommend Oswaal. Has every type of question. Mathematics: You need to do the NCERT questions first. Very important. Sometimes, same questions from NCERT do appear in the board exams. Also, try to remember every formula for calculus, certain methods for tricky questions, and the concept for every chapter. A basic understanding of the topic is very important at the first, before shifting your thought process to application. Never, ever neglect English. It is a score booster. Make sure you listen to your school classes attentively. And give your tests meticulously. Should be enough. If you do have another subject, give importance to that too. Anyway for PCM, always do previous year question papers for you to be aware of the different type of questions. The setter ain't gonna give every question new. There'll be few new questions. Others, adapted from previous questions only. Good luck. Hope you achieve your goals. ",

            "answer_text": "I gave my class 12th CBSE this year (2020) and I also had PCM. I don't expect such a percentage( and believe me only some people do) , but I think I am the correct person to answer this question as I realised certain mistakes I did while preparing for the same. At first , you need to Concur with the idea it's not something impossible to get that. So let me proceed separately with all the subjects. Physics: In physics you need to get all your concepts strong , the one marker questions are mostly concept based. You should have solved enough of numericals from all the chapters much before your mock starts .Do solve each and every numericals from NCERT, might it be from exercise or examples.Try to understand the derivations rather than mugging them.Chemistry: My teacher used to say NCERT is \u201cGod\" for chemistry and he was true saying so. Do chapter reading very thoroughly. For physical chemistry NCERT problems are more than enough . for organic you must have read each chapter at least thrice to get all reactions entrenched in your brain.Maths: Solve some standard book like RD Sharma or KC Sinha as they have level problems in them with good theoretical explanation. Do not forget to mark all such questions which you found difficult or you were not able to solve them at once. During exams you can go only through those questions.English: You will not get time to study English all around The year so what you have to ensure is being attentive in class so that you at least have knowledge of all the chapters and give School test sincerely for EnglishThe same applies for all the additional subjects which you have.Some extra tips;Keep on solving previous year questions chapter wise, for that you can refer arihant publication book. Do not wait to solve it at the end when exams are near.Keep NCERT examplar to get an idea about objective questions.Complete your course as soon as possible. This is what I could not do and I regret for this. hope this helps best of luck!!",

            "answer_text": "First of all, it requires a lot of self-confidence and you must believe in yourself that you are capable of scoring a 100%. Your studies shouldn\u2019t be to satisfy your Family nor your parents but it should be focussing on your future. Your inner believes are your foundation to success. There are a lot of experts here who could tell you about the strategies and tips to score a 98%, well I will tell you about how you should mentally and physically prepare for this milestone. You should always begin things with a smile. Study happily. Never get frustrated or stressed. When you start to feel tired, get a break, breathe in positivity and release out all the toxic negative thoughts. Learn everything to understand than to score. You should learn things so that you could understand the principle behind the working of the wonders of the world. Your studies should never be only focussed on scores but rather on your knowledge on the mysteries of the world. This allows you to create learning a more enjoyable process and you yearn to learn increases. Ignore what Sharma ji\u2019s Beta does. You know that our parents are always comparing us to the neighbouring competitors we have. this drains our energies unwantedly and creates a negative implication in our mind. You never give focus on those unnecessary competitions because the first and foremost competitor you have got is you. You are your only limit. You are your mentor. Hardwork. Ofcourse the real path to success. Whatever you seek in your life, you must go above boundaries for it. Take it as a challenge and put your life into it. Manage your energy and time wisely. Do the hardwork as a smartwork. The main thing you should keep in your mind is whatever way you chose to win over your goals, you should always be looking for the smartest and most strategical ways of winning. you should seek tips and tricks to win over the easiest way to remember things. Whatever your goal is, keep reminding yourself of your ultimate dream. you might be eagering for a 98% in class 12 for an admission into a good college and course. You might be having a dream career, a dream life. When you feel down, keep reminding yourself of the ultimate aim you have, your goal, for what you are striving for. No matter whatever happens, just don\u2019t quit. Run, walk, or even crawl but only towards your goal. All the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "first of all , during the whole year never feel demotivated and always think about this 98 digit , either you sleep or you play just think about this digit . Now as you know, there is a lockdown in the whole country so , if you have the books with you then well and fine and if you don't either download the pdf or watch any video for the respective chapter. Now, lets talk about the strategy - firstly , your aim should be to study for 4\u20135\u20136 max hours in the lock down period till may 2020(maybe), 5\u20136\u20137 minimum from june to oct and 6\u201310 till jan lastly as much as you can till your boards. I will not cover the whole year in the same blog, I will only cover your plan till may end. so, till may end you should be covered with atleast 4 chapter of maths( by ncert and RS) , 3 each of phys , chem , maths and a mild reading or analysis of several chapters of English. if I get above 100 upvotes on this answer , I will share the whole strategy on scoring ABOVE 95% and don't foeget to follow me then only you will be able to see that answer and I guarantee that strategy would be realistic and achievable.

I\u2019m telling you the way CBSE has changed the exam pattern it needs 100% conceptual knowledge because rote learning won\u2019t fetch you good marks (Ab Sirf Ratne Se Exam Mein Number Nahi Ayenge). You have to know understand each and every line of your NCERT Textbook for PCM. I am giving some important tips to score 95% and above in Board Exams subject wise. Please do follow them. Physics: Stick to NCERT Textbook and Practice back questions of NCERT along with A you would easily score 65+ out of 70. No need to do Exemplar for Physics. 2. Chemistry (Percentage Booster Subject): NCERT is GOD Book for Chemistry, no need to follow any other reference books. Practice Arihant Previous Year Questions. Practice lot of Questions for Physical Chemistry and make short notes for Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. Practice Chemistry Exemplar for MCQs. 3. Maths Practice NCERT Textbook and Arihant Previous Year Questions many times. Don\u2019t ignore small topics like Vector Algebra or 3-D or LP till the end of session. Do some important questions of Calculus topics from R.D. Sharma No need to do Exemplar for Maths. 4. English Read one chapter daily from the book and try to understand the story. Practice Writing Skills so much so that you may complete Section - B (Writing Skills) in 30 - 45 mins as it is a time consuming section. Also Practice Arihant Previous Year Questions 5. For the 5th Subject Make your own read and learn strategy. Hope this helps. You can follow and prepare through \u201cToppr : The Better Learning App\u201d to get 98% marks i 12th CBSE board exam. ",
