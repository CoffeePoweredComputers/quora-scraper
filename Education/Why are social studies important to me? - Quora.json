            "answer_text": "Social studies major here, Social studies is important because it covers a wide range of subjects such as: political science, history, psychology, and economics. These subjects are crucial in understanding history or the political climate as a whole. Sure you can simply delve into one subject, but you really need to have a little bit of knowledge in all in order to really understand what youre talking about. Typical social studies programs include a majority of history classes w/ the other subjects mixed in & I think it\u2019s a perfect combo to make you a good social studies teacher or professor, or just a heavy weight in political / historical discussions in general. Granted I will say that you dont necessarily need to go to school to become fluent in the social studies, but it\u2019s not a bad thing if you want a job in the field like a historian, professor, teacher, archaeologist, etc. Have a good day! :) Follow me on Twitter & Instagram: @IanPhillipsUSA ",
