            "answer_text": "The School Day: The day starts off by waking up way too early in the morning. I wake up at 5:30 so I have extra time in the morning, as I tend to be zombie like, especially towards the end of the week. My bus comes at around 6:35, which is ridiculous because my stop is the last one and it is only a 10 minute drive to the school.I arrive at school at 6:45ish, which is about 35 minutes before school even starts. In this time I usually go to the library with a friend or boredly wander around the halls. School starts at 7:20.At my school we have 4 hour and a half classes on an A day-B day schedule so classes are different on A days than on B days. We have four mandatory core classes: English, math, science, and history; a mandatory study hall for 9th graders; and 2\u20133 electives. In the IB program one of the electives must be a foreign language. All 9th and 10th graders also have to take P.E./Health.Cafeteria food is disgusting. I always bring my own lunch. Where you sit is pretty free for all: try to get a table before they\u2019re all taken and sit with the friends who happen to have the same lunch as you.Athletics are pretty competitive in the US and most schools have several sports teams and clubs. Both are really fun and many extra curriculars (sports, clubs, marching band, etc) are offered so everyone can participate. My school has a very spirited and friendly environment, so sports are extra fun. Also, the band kids aren\u2019t as weird/geeky/nerdy as movies portray them.Homework. I have lots of it. Study Hall is a real lifesaver. Depending on the day I can have anywhere from 1\u20134 hours of homework.The stereotypes: True or False? Not all smart people are nerds. Cheerleaders are actually really friendly. Not that many Jocks are dumb. Most people are friendly. Not every popular kid is mean. There are tons of people (including myself) who don\u2019t fall into one of the stereotypical categories of students like the ones mentioned above! For example, I\u2019m in concert Band, but I\u2019m also a three season athlete and I have mostly As in my classes. Finally, some additional American type things in our schools: There\u2019s pretty much a flag in every classroom and we say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, followed by a \u201cmoment of silence,\u201d which is actually about 30 seconds.Standardized tests. In Virginia, we have SOLs alongside final exams, the SAT, and many others that I can\u2019t remember.the PACER: repeatedly running back in forth across the gym, increasing the pace every 6\u20137 repetitions until you\u2019re literally sprinting. I\u2019m on the cross country and track teams and I still hate it. We also have to do push-up, curl-up, and flexibility tests.Homecoming. At my school it\u2019s not just the football game. We have a spirit week, a bonfire (in which we burn a cardboard cutout of the other school\u2019s mascot), a pep rally, a mini parade, a dance, and homecoming hallways. In homecoming hallways, each class (as in grade) has to decorate their own specific hallway according to a theme. This year it was seasons, and each grade picked one season. Then, judges rank the hallways according to how well they were decorated. Finally, is the game itself. Everyone is dressed up in school colors and some people even have streamers and face paint.Finally, my last point: the hierarchy. It\u2019s a rigged system. Everyone hates the freshmen. In school-wide competitions, like homecoming hallways, freshmen get last pick and usually always lose. At pep rallies, we have Sing-off, in which a song starts playing, then your grade has to recognize the song and start singing karaoke. The catch? The seniors and juniors get their song played at full volume, while the freshmen can barely hear theirs. A few times as a freshman, they didn\u2019t even play a song, they just watched us expectantly. I understand that freshman are the newbies and generally annoying, but it\u2019s a little ridiculous.",

            "answer_text": "What is the American high school life like? I had to rewrite this a few times because I realized it is incredibly difficult to frame the life of an American high schooler in a few paragraphs. I should include that the following is based on a public school in Connecticut, but after reading various answers I found some things are universal. Prepare yourself to enter the life of a mediocre high school student\u2026 Time Or lack thereof, actually. I am currently in offseason for soccer but I still have to play for a club 3\u20134 days a week and indoor soccer two days a week to stay ready for the season. This consumes an enormous amount of time. I usually fall asleep anywhere from 10:30 PM to 2:30: AM, but I\u2019ve passed out at 6:00 PM from pure exhaustion and slept through the night. I don't know how to emphasize this enough, but I feel like I\u2019ve lost the time to be a high schooler. School, work, and sports eat up my time. Stress It wouldn't be right if I didn\u2019t include a section on the stress of a high school student. Obviously the levels of stress one endures depends on many factors, but I can name a few being somebody who takes somewhat average classes and plays sports. I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of people would assume that the stress is being induced by the school, but it really isn\u2019t. I put minimum effort into my classes and my grades reflect that. I have a 3.4 GPA and I\u2019ll end up at an okay college, which is fine with me. Parents induce more stress in the lives of me and my friends than any school ever has. Of course every parent differs, but most put pressure on their kids to get good grades to go to a good college and get good salaries and live good lives. I\u2019m perfectly happy with my situation in school because I know that to get to the next level and attend a top tier school is a massive leap from where I stand. I don't let these things get to me, but I watch it ruin people in school. \u201cWhy do students go out and party and drink alcohol when it\u2019s illegal?\u201d they ask. It\u2019s to relax for half a second and forget about the 4 projects we have due on Monday. I realize this paragraph is messy, but the pressure I\u2019m trying to describe is incredibly difficult to put into words. Friends Again, subjective. Different people with different personalities at different schools experience different things. But there are still common themes to be derived from independent events at schools. To start, bullying is very rare and any incidents are very isolated. The average student is friendly, but sometimes it\u2019s just difficult to see because their mind is racing through the Periodic Table of Elements before their quiz next period. The cafeteria is pretty much as crazy as portrayed in movies, with a little less emphasis on food fights. There are almost invisible borders between the Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. Friend groups obviously develop and people sit with the same group of people pretty much everyday. Nobody sits alone or gets targeted or anything like that. Like I said, most people are actually friendly, and this friendliness comes out during lunch. I have noticed that as the years progress (I\u2019m a Junior), and this is true of life and not just high school, you lose your \u201cfake\u201d friends and your relationships with your real friends are developed further. Making new friends is as easy as adding them on Snapchat or saying hi when you pass them in the hallways. Nothing wild in the friend scene except for the occasional drama that gets spread like wildfire. Sleep No, we\u2019re not exaggerating when we say we\u2019re running on 4 hours of sleep. I know friends in advanced classes who cannot fall asleep until 3 AM without risking losing hold of their grades. I have come home and sat with my dog on the couch for a minute, only to wake up 2 hours later. Yes, I have fallen asleep sitting up on my couch. Sports and a lack of a healthy amount of sleep drains more energy than you can fathom. My own mother thought I was depressed because I was taking so many naps after school. The rigorous schedule of school is an absolute sleep killer when paired with an exhausting sport routine. Education I live in an affluent county, there\u2019s no doubt about it. We have some of the best public schools in the country and a lot of money goes into our public school system. I can't compare this education to that of another school because I\u2019ve lived here for my entire life, but I would consider my experiences to be relatively productive and solid thus far. Every classroom from 1st grade to 12th has a Smart Board, and the teachers are usually friendly (usually). I certainly see where other students are coming from when they complain of the irrelevance of [insert subject here] in real life, but I tend to think that if you have the capability to grasp tough concepts in school then that proves you have a strong mind. Similarly I understand how students say school kills creativity and promotes memorization. I would like to disagree with this point and claim that school is application rather than memorization, but the numerous unlabeled mathematical formulas and dates in history I have in the back of my head tell me to say otherwise. Food Breakfast at home is a thing of the past. Waking up at 6:45 and getting out the door at 7:45 does not leave time for breakfast. I usually have to buy a bagel and butter from the cafeteria and eat it during first period. Lunch at the school is okay. The food isn't slop, but it sure as hell isn\u2019t restaurant quality. The chicken patties make everyone question what real chicken looks like, and the cookies are strong enough to give a man a concussion if tapped against the head. Dinner depends on families and schedules, but my family tries to have a relaxed sit down dinner on Sunday\u2019s, with the rest of the week being pretty free-for-all. Illegal Activities Not much to say here. Of course high schoolers drink, of course high schoolers smoke. Saying we don't would mar the credibility of this answer. Drinking starts in my town usually the summer after 8th grade, weed could be introduced anywhere from 8th grade on. There are people who avoid both like the plague, but the number of people who do this reduces greatly as the years go by. Hard drugs are pretty non existent around my high school, which is good because I\u2019m sure many people would get sucked in. Vaping is not a big thing anymore, the parents are two steps behind per usual. Juuls and Phix\u2019s are worth their weight in gold, and every other kid has one. If you don't know what these are, they\u2019re like little vapes that have \u201cpods\u201d with a liquid that contains nicotine. Typical Day: Wake up at 6:45, arrive at school between 7:10\u20138:10, first period is at 8:20. Three periods, then the \u201chour period\u201d in the middle of the day, a class that changes every day the fills this block takes up an hour, get through the three afternoon classes somehow, out at 2:50. Straight to soccer practice/work, home by 6:30. Shower and eat, start homework at 8:15. Depending on how much homework I have, I\u2019ll get to bed from 10:30\u20132:30 am. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and\u2026.. If you read this far than congratulations, you've probably read more in the last 10 minutes than I have in the last 3 years of English class. I\u2019ll add anything I forgot and correct any errors if I see any that I missed. As always\u2026 there's my $0.02 ",
