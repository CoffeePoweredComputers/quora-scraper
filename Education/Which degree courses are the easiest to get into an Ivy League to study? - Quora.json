            "answer_text": "At all of the Ivies other than Penn and Cornell, you apply to the college in general and not to a particular program. At Cornell, the engineering program is generally considered harder than others; I do not know much about Penn. But in all cases the competition for admissions is significant, and it would be misleading to think that a particular program is \u201ceasier\u201d to get into than others. They are all highly competitive. ",

            "answer_text": "The Ivies don\u2019t admit by major or restrict by major. They may ask you to indicate an intended major, but that is out of interest in how you are leaning. For most Ivies, you formally declare your major at the end of sophomore year, although you are likely taking classes in your major earlier, of course. Students are entirely free to choose any major or change major as long as they are on track with the prerequisites and introductory classes. Most LAC\u2019s don\u2019t particularly admit by major either. The universities that do admit by major are usually the state universities and other larger universities what have multiple \u2018School of X\u2019. Depending on the university it may or may not be easy to change major after being admitted. Some majors are \u2018impacted\u2019, meaning there are more applicants to the major than can be accommodated and that can make it very difficult to transfer in. ",
