            "answer_text": "I earned an MFA in creative writing.  I was over thirty and had already worked for five years as an attorney when I decided to go back to school.  I can think of several reasons why you might want to consider obtaining a writing degree: The free time to write accompanied by attending classes in writing and literature was an excellent way for me concentrate on writing and studying.I was hired by the university as a teaching assistant, so I had a tuition waiver and a small stipend.  That allowed me to earn the degree without incurring undue debt.The immersive experience of getting to know both the faculty (all published authors) and my fellow students was stimulating.  Late night bull sessions at the local bars certainly helped get my creative juices flowing.The relationships I formed while at that university are still a source of inspiration, advice and references.  Not only did I gain knowledge about the writing and editing process from the required workshops, but the faculty gave us a lot of practical advice about the way the publishing business works.When I graduated, I had what is considered a terminal degree at many small universities and community colleges.  My MFA has allowed me to earn extra money teaching composition and literature classes which I enjoy.If I had merely \"stopped out\" for a few years, holed up in a cabin somewhere and tried to write, I don't think that experience would have been as productive as my MFA experience was.  I was required to produce a body of work for my thesis which I had to defend before my graduate committee.  I am proud of that work.I do agree with the other answers in this thread that a degree in writing is not absolutely necessary to become a writer.  But it was an important step for me.  I love the academic life, and I am grateful for that experience.  I certainly would not have the same skill set today had I not pursued an MFA. ",

            "answer_text": "(I have a B.A. in English Literature.) And the answer is a resounding no.  They don't really teach you how to write in school. That's something you do on your own. Or, I don't know about you but, I never really learned to write in English class. Not anything useful at least. This essay by Paul Graham more or less explains how the teaching of writing became tied with the teaching of literature and why consequently we write pointless essays in English class: The Age of the Essay If you take a 'creative' writing course, what will happen is you'll be forced to write 2 or 3 pieces over the course of a semester and then you'll get some slight feedback. This is of course nowhere near enough, just as a few essays a semester per normal course is nowhere near enough. If you want to learn to write, you read lots and lots of books by the writers you like the most and then you write yourself and you find new authors and you repeat ad infinitum. You really want to write something like one page a day. For feedback just post on Quora or perhaps Medium.  Write about whatever you want. You'll be infinitely more motivated than if you were forced to write about something that you believe to be a waste of time. Honestly, my year of writing almost every day on Quora and achieving Top Writer did more for my writing (incidentally I wrote more than the 4 years of my degree, not a coincidence). Quantity has its own quality. And Quora is great because you'll get continuous and immediate feedback on reasonable pieces and trash pieces will be ignored. ",
