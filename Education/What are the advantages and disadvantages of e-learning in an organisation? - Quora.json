There is no hard and fast rule.Using discussion boards and chats, you will be able to interact with everyone online and also clear your doubts if any.Whatever the instructions through a video that are provided for audio and video learning can be rewound and seen and heard again and again if you do not happen to understand the topic first time around.Disadvantages Of eLearning Well, there aren't many disadvantages of eLearning software like udemy clone, the most one being that you simply get knowledge only on a theoretical basis and when it involves putting to use whatever you have learned, it may be a little different. The face-to-face learning experience is missing, which can interest a number of you. The major of the online assessments are limited to questions that are only objective in nature.There is also the problem of the extent of the security of online learning programs.The originality of a particular student's work is also a problem as online just about anyone can do a project rather than the actual student itself.Whatever the evaluation that is computer marked generally has a tendency of being only knowledge-based and not necessarily practicality-based.",
