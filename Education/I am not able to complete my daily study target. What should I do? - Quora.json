            "answer_text": "Hi How to Get Motivated to Study Have you ever sat down with your book and stared at the same words until you fall asleep? You know you should study but you just don't feel like it? Hopefully these ideas will help you get motivated to study. 1Find a quiet space where you won't be distracted. This could be a library, a cafe, a room in your house, or anywhere else that is free from excessive noise and interruptions. Avoid places where you're likely to run into your friends.2Stock up on study supplies. Make sure you have all the pens, pencils, paper, highlighters, and Post-Its you need. You don't want to interrupt your study time to get more.3Keep a small stash of water and snacks by your side. People are more productive when they're hydrated and taking steady sips of water will help stave off thirst. Small snacks like peanuts, granola bars or fruit will help keep you energized.Avoid fast food and pastries. This includes pizza, hamburgers, nachos, doughnuts, muffins, cinnamon rolls, and croissants. These foods will give you a short energy rush that quickly turns into sleepiness1Wear comfortable clothing. Little things like having to pull up your trousers can eat away at your concentration. Wear clothes that are familiar, fit loosely, and don't constrict you.If you have long hair, tie it back so that it doesn't fall into your eyes.2Put your cellphone on silent. You do not want to be taking calls from friends and family members when you're trying to study. Let them know in advance that you need time to study, if you think they'll be concerned. Better yet, just place it on silent and keep it somewhere out of view so you won't be tempted to keep taking a sneak peek.I hope it proves useful for u",
