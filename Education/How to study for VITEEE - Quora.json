            "answer_text": "The best thing about VITEEE is that you don't have to prepare exclusively for it. Prepare from NCERTs. You don't have to worry about the difficulty level of the questions. They are a mix of easy,average and difficult(less than 10%). Your basics should be clear. That would be enough because the exam doesn't test your intelligence. It tests your speed and accuracy. You might want to take a look at the mock papers or previous years questions based on VITEEE's pattern. It's not required but since you have no prior idea about the exam I would suggest so. In the end, its all relative!Do not worry much and Good Luck! ",

The syllabus is almost the same as CBSE board. Start with NCERT then solve JEE level questions. VITEEE is more of a concept based exam, it tests your basic knowledge. You need to solve 125 questions in 90 minutes. So you need to be fast and accurate. So practice accordingly. ",
