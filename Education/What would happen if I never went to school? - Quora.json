            "answer_text": "For one thing, you wouldn\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. You would be ignorant about so many things: reading, writing, understanding world events perhaps. Unless you decided to do things on your own, starting with the fundamentals of learning (for which most locations offer tutoring), you would work your way through life doing things the hard way. You might not be on the IRS radar, but that would only happen if you were paid by an employer \u201cunder the table.\u201d Most employers would want you to fill out W-2 forms (I think that\u2019s the correct form) and they are submitted to the IRS so you\u2019re no longer off the radar in that case. You\u2019d see your world as what would be immediately around you, not understanding the greater world and the immense jigsaw puzzle that working and living in society usually becomes. IF you married and had children, you would know less than them in a scholastic sense by the time they finished first grade. By the time they finished sixth grade, the children would have progressed so far beyond you that you could no longer understand their homework or carry on conversations about what they learned. UNLESS you were willing to learn alongside your children. As they began to understand geography, you might be able to work with a world globe or atlas. Their mathematics would overwhelm you, unless you\u2019d been with them as they learned the foundations of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Some of the information you\u2019d already have, just from working in a business world. The rest of it would be information you could readily learn if you were open to such education. Learning should be a lifelong endeavor. Whether it takes place in a classroom or out in the world, we never stop adding information to our brains. ",

            "answer_text": "It is an interesting question. Let me answer you this way. My father never went to school. But, he learned from his friends as his friends took him to join as the video cassette player importer long time ago (before personal computer even existed). He and his friends managed to make \u201cabnormal\u201d profit because he can beat the system (tax, import duties etc), and make a lot of money out of it. Now, our country gets better and better. Tax and import control gets better too. Can you still make money the way my father did? without going to school? Well, in order to \u201cbeat\u201d the system, you must understand this modern system. And, in order to understand the system (let alone to \u201cbeat\u201d it), you must go to school. ",
