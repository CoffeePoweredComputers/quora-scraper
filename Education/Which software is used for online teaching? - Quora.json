Online tutors instruct and guide online learners to execute the online learning process with the tools which you need to know. One way is the online meeting method in which all the students and the tutor join the virtual class by clicking on a single particular link. Students can see the screen of Tutor\u2019s laptop/PC and can interact with the instructor by speaking. It is analogous to the real world classroom where students together watch the same board. Skype is the suitable example here. Another way includes the whiteboard method where learners and tutors share the same digital board and anyone either the teacher or the student can scribble on it. This method is a more interactive process and a better virtual setup of classroom Another way is the live streaming process where real and virtual classrooms held simultaneously. A digital cam records and streams the live class to the hundreds of learners across the world in a virtual classroom.
