            "answer_text": "Often times, we\u2019re great students, but sometimes we\u2019re also bad test-takers. It\u2019s a weird dilemma, but tests require specific, pinpointed approaches to excel. Specifically, you need to think about how your teacher (as well as the subject material they\u2019re teaching) wants you to think, as you cannot really progress academically without mastering the basic foundations. Thus, for really any exam, you need to create a plan. You need to review your previous performance and understand what went right and what went wrong. Ask yourself questions such as these: What questions did I get right?What thought process enabled me to get the answer right?What questions did I get wrong?Why did I pick the wrong answer? How do I correct it?These are general questions you should be asking to create a study plan. With this new identification, you can now work through the types of problems/questions you messed up along the way. While you are doing this, it is incredibly key that you also make sure you understand the underlying concept, and, if you don\u2019t, do all in your power to try! Ask a friend or a teacher for assistance while trying to understand this, or consult free sources on the Internet. Once you understand the concept, the problems/questions themselves should become easier. One thing to note in general: this is a consistent, continual process. If you want to \u201cace\u201d every exam, you must prepare consistently (nearly daily) and intensively by asking yourself the above questions. In other words, studying must become a part of your routine. If you want to learn more about how to create a study routine, SSA has prepared our own ways on how to prepare for exams, as well how to become a better test taker (https://www.socraticsummeracademy.com/blog/good-grades-low-sat-score and https://www.socraticsummeracademy.com/blog/sat-study-plan). While these mainly focus on the SAT, you can apply the same concepts to your other exams. And, if these ideas don\u2019t work for you, there are plenty of other resources out there that might suit you a lot better. Just keep looking! Hope this helps! ",
