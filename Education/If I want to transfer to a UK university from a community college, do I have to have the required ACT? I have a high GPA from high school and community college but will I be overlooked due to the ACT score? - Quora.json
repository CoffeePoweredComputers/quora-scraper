            "answer_text": "If you complete community college and come out with an associate degree, you can use that as an entrance qualification to many UK universities. I've not seen any reading they will take students who have gone to CC but not completed their associate degree. If the university you're interested in doesn't mention associate degrees on their website you should contact them and ask (there is normally an \u201cif your qualification is not shown context us\u201d link). Durham, Bristol and Southampton are among those that have associate degrees on their website and give the following equivalence (without A*A*A for Southampton) between associate degree GPAs and A level grades for undergraduate entry, so this seems fairly well established (Durham: Country Information; Bristol: USA; Southampton: Information for students from the USA): Associates Degree A*A*A \u2013 Associates Degree with a GPA of 3.4 or better. A*AA \u2013 Associates Degree with a GPA of 3.3 or better. AAA \u2013 Associates Degree with a GPA of 3.2 or better. AAB \u2013 Associates Degree with a GPA of 3.1 or better. ABB \u2013 Associates Degree with a GPA of 3.0 or better. Other universities: Edinburgh states a minimum GPA of 3.0 for entry with an associate degree (USA). Kent wants a GPA of 3.2 (Information for students from the USA - University of Kent). Cardiff says \u201csuccessful completion of an associate degree\u201d (Entry requirements for the United States).

If you have not completed your associates degree, then what you have to present is your secondary school qualifications. You cannot successfully apply to any university, in any country without meeting the requirements. So the short answer is, if you want the community college to count, you have to finish your associates degree (or be in the process of finishing your last year), at which point your ACT score is irrelevant. If you haven\u2019t finished your associates degree, then your ACT is still relevant. ",
