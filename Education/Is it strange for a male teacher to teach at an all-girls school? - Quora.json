            "answer_text": "Um, no. To clarify, I study at an all-girls school, and we have multiple male teachers teaching at our school. Sure, most of them gravitate towards the more science-based subjects (Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Geography etc), but we\u2019ve had two arts teachers, a music teacher, and a Chinese teacher too. Is it strange for a female teacher to teach at an all-boys school? Hell no. The sex of the students shouldn\u2019t make a difference. What matters is quality of teaching and whether students actually learn. I\u2019d rather have a male teacher who invigorates my passion for the subject than a female teacher who can\u2019t do jack shit. ",
