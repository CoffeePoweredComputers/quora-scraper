            "answer_text": "KV\u2019s generally have a fixed no. Of seats in each category based on the parents service type(eg. defense, central govt. , state govt., etc). During my time (1994\u20132007) there were 7 categories. although not sure about now. There are seats present even for businessmen\u2019s kids, but due to the very small pecentage it is almost negligible. Also the purpose of KV is to provide symmetric schooling throughout the year irrspective of the location so that in case of relocation the kids/parents need not take extra stress on covering up syllabus or change in books or uniform. It is ideal for those people who are getting transferred frequently and hence the misconception of defence background requirement. There are other schools like army and airforce where kids of civilians are not given admission. Admission procedure includes form filling and a small interview kind of test. Please check that in the particular school as each KV has its own applicants. Also, with due respect I would like to mention that there are no shortcuts. All the best for your Kid. ",

P.S. - having a defense background is not so compulsory to take admission in KV. ",

Although my parents are also not from defense background but I had done my all schooling from kendriya Vidyalaya Rohtak, Haryana.

So hurry up to visit the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya and ask them about the admission procedure and about the admission form availability. Best of luck ",
