            "answer_text": "I think it's because many people don't go about doing this properly. When your spouse isn't making enough for the entire family to survive, it's paramount that both couples work. Indeed, nannies are expensive and many think it's cheaper for one parent to stay home but long term gain of having work experience and remaining EMPLOYABLE is extremely important to have something to fall back on. I don't want to sound judgemental so I will acknowledge that the act of taking care of ones children is a positive thing. So I am not saying the act itself is stigmatized, but it's more or less when looking at the overall net benefit when looking at things long-term. I think there are more cons than pros to this overall. Being a stay at home parent means you are 100% at the mercy of your partner. There is no guarantee you will get any assets or money from them, trust me on that. There is guarantee however that you will never find a job again when there are people with masters degrees with 10 years of experience can't even find jobs due to the competition. Ever heard of being too overqualified? They cannot even get a job at McDonalds. I recently read hundreds if not thousands of millenials who could not be employed even with years of work experience and degrees and felt sick to the core. No these aren't gender studies or arts people either incase you are wondering, they have STEM field degrees. So when you are competing with people who already have degrees and masters who cannot get a job, do you seriously think a single parent who lived at home for the last 10 to 20 years would find a job? Job gaps are hell on earth and a destroyer of your chances of being employable if you sincerely didn't do anything for 5 to 10 years. Factor in age and the lack of stimulating your brain as you have been out of the workforce for that long, absorbing information and doing tasks can be very difficult. I've known stay at home parents who tried to go back to school and they have said it's astronomically harder compared to people who have always stayed in the workforce and increased their skills. Secondly, being a stay at home parent can work as long as the people are not pieces of shit by cheating and/or actually plan to be together. As long as prenup wasn't signed and as long as the one spouse even has anything to give. Divorce is over 40\u201350% rocket high and the reality is you also truly have no way of knowing or trusting another human being that fully to rely your ENTIRE future on. This legacy will impact their lives for the rest of their life. I knew a woman who was an engineer who gave it up to be a stay at home mother. Fast forward years later she obviously couldn't get a job in her field and in general and the only job she was finally able to find was to be a part time bathroom cleaner. Her entire engineering education had gone down to the toilet, literally and there was no way to get that back. Also I have seen tons of other people who were ruined by this. One notable case where a woman married a very rich man but he cheated and tossed her out. As he had outsourced majority of his money and squandered most of it in expert ways as well as being able to fraud the system, there was no way for her to prove it and she was left pretty much homeless and living off of government assistance. These things are scary and real, and it's not about being paranoid it's being realistic. I also know someone else who didnt get a cent from divorce as the partner doesnt have the money to give, they are on welfare. I believe they are the ones who has to give their dead beat ex partner money instead of the other way around. Its not smart to rely on anyone to this extent. I'd rather draw my own blood with a knife to my body then offer my entire life on a plate to someone else like this, watching the years go by and torching my dreams to ashes. Yes things can work out as a stay at home parent, if you are one of the fortunate people to escape that divorce statistic, have a wonderful partner and loving kids that happened to work out. However, you can still do everything right and sacrifice 200% of your maximum capabilities to help your family, only to see it burn before you in an instant if your partner simply does not want to be with you. Your kids could also turn out like ungrateful pieces of shit and your hard work and effort raising them becomes worthless. You may pride in yourself by saying that you don't expect anything out of them but it's a very big risk to go this path even still, if there is no money or hope of getting an income or a future. ",

            "answer_text": "Envy? Jealousy? there could be many reasons. In the USA people are very work focused. Everywhere I go the first thing people ask is \u201c What do you do?\u201d I usually don\u2019t tell people unless I am net working for job purposes. I even get asked this at nightclubs. I came here to get drunk not to talk about my work LOL. This is probably the reason why people look down on stay home mom. Since there is no career title really tied to being a stay home mom, people think you just lay at home. That is only for rich stay home moms, most stay home mom don\u2019t even have a choice I will explain that later. Stay home mom often take on the roles of chief, baby sitter, cleaner, driver, gardener, and even teacher for 0 pay for her family. My mom was a doctor before she got divorced and she chose to spend time with me staying home. The amount of bounding time with her was worth more than anything i could ask for. She never slacked around. She was always cooking from scratch, tutoring me, taking me to classes and even helping other working parents with their children. She was at every single swimming practice I had daily and swimming competition on the weekends. More and more millennial are choosing to stay home because they don\u2019t make enough to pay for childcare some places around me cost 3k a month just for a regular daycare. You have to earn 4k and more pre tax a month to even pay someone to take care of your child so you can even work. More Millennial Parents Are Choosing to Stay at Home. Should You? Way More Millennial Women Are Becoming Stay-At-Home Moms Vs. Gen Xers, But Why? In today\u2019s day and age most people don\u2019t make enough to stay on one income. A lot of people have to work because they have to support their family. Some families need two income to work in order to afford very basic things. They can\u2019t have children due to cost or they are stuck at work despite not wanting to be there. This causes a lot of resentment for some people. I read somewhere younger generation are actually choosing to stay home over older generations. They are leaning towards traditional roles. Ironically we have less of a choice in what we want to do now than before. Before your parents made enough so your mother can chose to work or not work. Now for most you need both to work. When people are unhappy where they are they tend to put down other people around them. There is nothing wrong with stay home parent. I went to a very good college and I make more than my husband. However when we have our child I will CHOSE to stay home for few years to raise my family. Luckily for me, we can afford to. I made this decision because I lost my mom when I was just 24 and she was only 48. Family and time is wroth more than money and career to me personally. Since my family can afford it I will choose it and my husband is supporting me 100%. I could care less what someone else has to say. Once the doors are closed it is your house and your life that you have to live with. If you want to tan on a beach all day and drink cocktail who is stopping you? We are adults , as long as it is within law you can do ANYTHING. This is not high school, there is no need for bullying others. MIND YOUR OWN LIFE. For everything you do in life there is always that one person who is negative towards you, even if you are saving lives. The only thing I agree with others is , if you are choosing to be full time stay home mom , do volunteering or something on the side to keep your resume updated. In case your husband dies in a tragic accident you can at least put food on the table. ",
