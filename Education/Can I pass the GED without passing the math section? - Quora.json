            "answer_text": "There are three different high school equivalency exams in use in the United States - the GED, the TASC, and HiSet. On each one, you must pass all sections of the test in order to get the certificate. The GED does allow you to use a calculator on more questions than the TASC. One thing to bear in mind is that you\u2019ll use math on other sections of the test. It will pay off to find a teacher or tutor who can sometimes work with you one on one and use different study tools. The same approach does not work for everybody. ",
