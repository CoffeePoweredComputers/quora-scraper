            "answer_text": "I would suggest a card. If you want to enclose a gift card or cash, you may, but it is not expected. It can be embarrassing to have people really gush over you at graduation, depending on how well you know them. Depending on how high of premium there is on seats at graduation, it may be quite an honor to be invited, or they may have invited a lot of people who are casual friends. Where I live, people generally do graduation parties, and this would be an appropriate venue to take a gift if you wanted to (and were invited). I do think some people brought flowers to their graduates (at graduation), but I saw a lot more of that at college graduation for associate\u2019s degrees and nurse pinning. Just another suggestion: follow up with graduates in the next year. It is a big deal when you graduate, but once you start working or going to college you often don\u2019t hear much from anyone back home. A care package or even a card lets them know people haven\u2019t forgotten them. Sometimes people are ambivalent about graduating, but they can definitely use your support in their lives after high school as well. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re graduating wear your gown and hat, bring your phone and keys to you car/house. If you smoke bring your smokes & a lighter to use after the ceremony is over. If you\u2019re celebrating someone else\u2019s graduation bring your smokes, lighter and keys to your car/home. Also bring a card and flowers and a big smile and a hug. Nothing else is required. ",
