            "answer_text": "I'm an alumni of SAPS ( St Antony's Public School, Anakkal). SAPS stands among the best schools in India. The following are the benefits of joining SAPS. *You will be in the company of highly ambitious focused, hard-working and motivated students. *You will have access to good quality coaching for engineering and medical entrance examinations. However there is another list of things that you must take note of when you join SAPS. U will be under a lot of additional pressure ( other than that from your family) while you are here. For eg, you will be labelled as a loser for scoring 18/20. Every weekend, the coaching centre conducts mock tests and the list of the toppers will be published. If you cannot find a place in the list you are doomed. The pressure quadruples if you are a hosteler. You will have to stay in congested dormitories and study in congested study halls. There is a common landphone for inmates to communicate with their parents. Number of calls is restricted to 2 calls of 5 minutes duration per week. I know a lot of successful people from SAPS. But I'm pretty sure that they would have been successful even if they were in any other school which offers entrance coaching. I also know people who failed miserably only because they joined SAPS. 16 year olds who were labelled \u201cfools\u201d because they scored 2 marks less than the topper or called \u201cirresponsible waste fellows\u201d because he/she couldn't recollect the name of 10 bryophytes correctly. As far as the K E School Mannanam is considered, it is not as reputed as SAPS and doesn't produce as much future IITians and doctors as SAPS does. But as I mentioned in the beginning, if u can get quality entrance coaching, then the school doesn't matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Being a saps alumni myself, i can confidently assure you that this school isn\u2019t for the faint hearted You will have to face extreme pressure, both from the school management and the entrance authorities. You will have to go through many emotionaly challenging situations, but looking back i\u2019d say every moment was worth it. The whole experience would make u a stronger person and will also ensure u attain ur goal of grabbing a seat in a top notch professional college. The quality of coaching offered by brilliant along with the efforts of the teachers of the school,and most importantly the interaction with such a core group of academicaly proficient students will make sure your attempts find their mark. Also SAPS has been in the picture for a much longer time than KE and has proved itself over and over again I would recommend saps anytime!! ",
