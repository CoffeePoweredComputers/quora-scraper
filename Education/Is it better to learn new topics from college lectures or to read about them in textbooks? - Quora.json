            "answer_text": "The answer, of course, is that it depends on the learner, the subject, the lecturer, and the textbook. But there is considerable evidence that lectures are of limited value. Graham Gibbs recently wrote this about lectures: \u201cMore than 700 studies have confirmed that lectures are less effective than a wide range of methods for achieving almost every educational goal you can think of. Even for the straightforward objective of transmitting factual information, they are no better than a host of alternatives, including private reading. Moreover, lectures inspire students less than other methods, and lead to less study afterwards.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "This depends entirely on you. Some people need a lecture to learn and not the text book, and vice versa. Find and use the most effective method for YOU. Personally, I found both to be useful. A professor will usually provide some insight/connection that is not explicitly stated in a textbook. A textbook however, will usually offer more detailed/thorough explanations and background (assuming it's a good textbook). I would not discount one or the other, nor forego one either. ",
