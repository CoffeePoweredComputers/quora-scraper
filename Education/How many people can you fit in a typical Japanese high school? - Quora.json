            "answer_text": "Japanese law caps class size at 40 students. This is true for elementary and secondary schools; both public and private. Prefectures (states) can lower this number if they desire. Municipalities can do the same, as well. What this means at the primary and junior high school level is that if 41 kids enroll then they will be split into two classes; one of 20 and the other 21. It should be noted that most municipalities have smaller break numbers for 1st and 2nd grades. This breaking of class size depending on enrollment doesn't really apply to high schools. In the case of high schools, the number of classes are set. The kids sit for a test for that school and the school takes the higher scores until the number of spaces are filled. Usually, but not always, the number of spaces available is 40. It should be noted that all the high schools in Japan are ranked and the test scores needed to get in are well known. A lesser talented student would not sit the test at a high ranking school. Generally speaking, only those kids with a good chance of getting into one of the 'better' schools will sit the test for that school. So, how many kids go to a Japanese high school? If you know the number of classes, you can multiply by 40 and you should be near the number. The problem is that schools do not have the same number of classes. Some schools have only 3 classes per grade and some schools will have 12 or more. Generally speaking, public high schools have from 4 to 6 classes per grade. Private high schools will have about double that. Private high schools will also, sometimes, have one or two limited enrollment classes of say, 20 kids. These smaller classes are usually elite in nature.  40 kids and 40 desks There are some rural high schools with only one or two classes per grade and with fewer than 40 kids per class. This is because there is no other high school within a reasonable distance.  Unlike American high schools, where the kids change rooms, in Japan it is the teachers that go to the kid's classroom. Classes are usually designated as 3-1, 3-2, or 2-A, 2-B, etc. The numbers are for years; so all the 1-somethings are in their first year of high school. This would be the 10th grade for you Americans taking notes. Japanese schooling uses a 6-3-3 model. The first 9 years are compulsory, though about 95% go on to high school. There is also an extensive pre-school system. For more on pre-schools I've added a link below. Each class has a home room teacher and throughout the day teachers for the various subjects will rotate in. Some classes, science, computer studies, music, etc., will be held in specialized rooms. You would be wise not to base too many assumptions about Japanese high schools on tv dramas or anime. The reality is far more banal.  See those short skirt in the top photo? Umm... Not.

            "answer_text": "If you mean \"What is the average student populace a typical Japanese high school?\" then that is probably around 1,000 to 1,200 students. Most high schools in Japan look the same. They are typically 3 or 4 stories high, though how many are 3 stories compared to 4, I'm not certain. I attended a school that was 4 stories high, and it didn't have an elevator yet. Each floor is typically designated to a grade, and the youngest grade is usually at the top - depending on how many grades there are. The teacher's have their offices typically on the bottom floor, as well as the VERY small cafeteria area for selling food to students who didn't bring lunch that day. Next to the main building is typically the large gym, and perhaps an additional building might have classrooms for things like the arts, music, science labs etc. Though these may also be part of the main building. In the main building each floor has roughly 10 or so classrooms, usually each one is assigned a letter. So I was in class E for example. 35 students or so per class, with  10 classrooms, times 3 grades = 1,050 students.  If your question really is \"how many people can you fit in a typical Japanese high school?\" as in - how many bodies could you physically fit into a Japanese high school? - and now I'm imagining thousands of bodies stuffed in a building like their in a clown car - then the answer is probably 5,000 or so. If you include the gym as well, then it might be an additional 3,000. But they'd have to really be packed in there. Bodies on top of each other and stuff maybe. ",

At rural schools, you can have as few as one class per grade, so anywhere from a few dozen to 100 students. Really, it depends on how many students are at a given school (which is in fact the answer to the question), since it can be all over the place. ",
