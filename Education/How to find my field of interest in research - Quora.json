            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Abhinaba. I will answer both your questions here. How to find a research interestThe foremost requirement at a philosophical level is to question everything. Do not take existing knowledge as finalAt a more functional level, read up a lot in your field. You are bound to find gaps, scope of improvement and incongruous ideas. Choose an idea with which you identify a lot and feel a passion for.The next step is again to read about the latest developments and find out ways to add to themThus you find your research interest. Now for the second part about how to do research or try to find a solution/add to existing knowledge. 2. How to go about doing research a. Next step is hypothesis formation. Once you have reached the last stage mentioned above, you have to form a hypothesis. Remember hypothesis is not just a mere conjecture it's supported by years of research and data you would have read. b. You come up with a robust research design and decide upon the mothods you will use to obtain data and also on analysis of data. You also mostly include a back plan. You may submit this design to your company, supervisor or university authorities. Or you may submit to government or private funding agencies to ask for funds. c. Then you start collecting your own data by way of experiments, survey, field data, depending upon your area and research design. d. Next, the data is parsed for inconsistencies and analysed to determine what it shows. Remember that in another model. Data is collected first and then analysed. Based on that a hypothesis is formed and then more data is collected in a different setting to test the hypothesis in various settings. e. If your hypothesis stands against multiple such cycles of data collection and analysis. It is robust enough. f. You can report your findings in a peer reviewed journal and ask for comments and criticisms and also suggestions. I hope I have been able to answer your question. ",
