Let me tell you why it is so. It is so because you may have thought that dr. means doctor but it is not so. Yes, dr. Means doctor but dr. has a another meaning too dr. also means doctorate degree which means simply that a person has received the highest degree awarded by any university faculty or other approved educational organization in any fields. Like for an e.g of your case your chemistry teacher has got the highest degree in chemistry .That's why there is dr. written before your chemistry teacher. Hoped it help. --------Debosneha\ud83d\ude07 ",
