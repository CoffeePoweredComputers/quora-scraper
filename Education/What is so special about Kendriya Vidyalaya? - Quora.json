            "answer_text": "There is always something special about an Educational institution no matter whether it is kendriya Vidyalaya or JNV, DPS or A sarva Shiksha Abhiyan School and I think the speciality of. Such an organisation depends on its Students, teachers and how effectively the results are drawn. Now, what is so special about Kendriya Vidyalaya?  I pursued my Schooling from two kendriya Vidyalayas - Class 6 to 10 from KV mashrak, Saran Bihar and 11 to 12th From KV Danapur Army Cantt Patna Bihar. Based on my personal experiences I would say Kendriya Vidyalaya has one of the best curriculum for an All Round Development of a student. You are at one of the best places where you can make or enhance your career in the field you want and the passion you follow. You will ask me why at only Kendriya Vidyalaya th same options are available at Every School in india then I would say no and never\u2026why?  Because, the fee of Kendriya Vidyalaya is exceptionally low for the same and better quality education. I started at 160 Rs per month and ended with 800 when it wad increased in 2009 end and I had to pay 2400 for that three months instead of 480 which I used to pay. The most stupendous for us is its admission fee which was Rs 25 only till I conpleted my 12th. Before entering KV I was studying in a Private Convent which used to charge me a heavy cost and it used to be nearly INR 3600 per months for I and My brother and in 2003 it meant a lot for my parents and the most irrirating was the penality they put for late payment. It always added to make the sum huge although the quality of education they imparted was good and innovative.  Suppose if You are good at anything whether study, games and sports or art and drawing, singing or u can say anything which u like at your student life u will get N number of chances without paying any cost along with a coach or Good teacher at your school level, Cluster level, regional level, National and finally SGFI level which can give u a big name and a bright platform to go on. And these things u rarely get in a private school and if anyhow u ger it it will cost u very expensive which is beyond reach of many students. The teachers are highly Qualified , Cracks GOVT recruitment Exams and their salary is exceptionally good so they need not to think for convincing students to come for tuition and any tuition class by a KV faculty is strictly prohibited and if found culprit the action is immediately taken by Principal or Autgority or by the Chairman of that Kv who is generally the DM of that District. The infrastructure is beautiful, library facility, a big occupying Computer lab, greenery all around and the best is Teacher student ratio which I always found less than 55 for a teacher till I was at schooling. The morning assembly boosts one but sometime it becomes typical for students specially in sunny days . Debate, quiz, Extempore, Mock Parliament enhances ones leadership capability and Scouts and Guides camp inhibits some extra authentic visions to serve the nation and Humanity. The syllabus all over India is same and if ur parents get transferred to another city then you need not to worry as the time and completion of syllabus duration is same for each school. The marks and Grading system is very flexible and up to class 6 th every student is passed to get register for the next class which really teduces the burden of students and they can focus on study as well as other all round development activities without any fear and a answer to telk their parents that who topped the class and why he or she didn\u2019t? But sometimes there is a shortage of faculties as we all know it happens in Govt aided instititions and sometimes when the teachers get transgmferred at random and one may find leisure classes many times these days. At last I would say it is difficult to get an admission in kendriya Vidyalaya but once u are inn then be sure you are going to advance yourself to cope with this stressed competition with all ease. Currently My 4 nephews are studying in kendriya vidyalaya and I have found them good at study and doing better & we 3 brothers completed our study and it gave us a lot. So kendriya Vidyalaya has till served 7 of our family and hope more will be served with moving time and Kv will continue its job to nurture students making them worth living. Hope You will find this post worth reading and like it and put forth your comment too. ",

            "answer_text": "What's so special thing about Kendriya Vidyalaya. I\u2019ll tell you WHY? I studied at three KVS across the India. KV Eastern Air Command, Shillong.KV No.1 AFS Agra.KV INS Hamla, Mumbai.Now, according to my observations, you'll find a crowd of central government employees kids studying here. Mostly employees are in Indian Defence. Basically, you'll find the essences of whole India in one school. Their orgins are from South, North, East, West of India, you just name the state. So, at a very young age students of KV learn about different culture and their background automatically by their circle and there is no discrimination amongst them. Student who have travelled a lot due to their parent\u2019s transfer across the India have a lot of stories to tell and everyone have their different experiences and learnings also the story starts from when they're at XYZ place. Its always fun to listen and also to share your own story. The games periods, Yoga periods, all these periods are everyones favorite. KV follows CBSE Board and its syllabus specially in 11 and 12 grade is very important to get into a good college. The teachers in KVS have to go through a special exam to teach in such a Institution. Only well qualified teachers make it. KV believes in overall development and not just studies, and a student gets a lot of opportunities to perfrom. KVS rank in the list of educational institutes is No. 1 whereas IIT is on 3 rank. (I read that in newspaper). Many people say that it's a government school and people believe government schools are not up to the mark but the truth is, that KVS is one of those government schools where people try to get admission and don't get admission easily. So, you can imagine it's reputation outside. There are few well reputated government school in India where people don't get admission easily like sanik school and also KVS. When I was studying , back in those days me and my friends use to find a lot of loopholes. But when we got into college and told people we are from KV most of them were like *wow*. So, every KVian realize its true value after passing out. Lol. ",
