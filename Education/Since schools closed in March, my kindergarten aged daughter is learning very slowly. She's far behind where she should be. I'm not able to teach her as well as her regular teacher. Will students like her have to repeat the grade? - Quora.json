            "answer_text": "\u201cThey really don\u2019t learn much in kindergarten.\u201d Ahhhh! One of the most damaging misconceptions about early childhood development is that children are \u201cunteachable\u201d until a certain age. I get it, I get it. Kindergarteners are cute, squishy, slimey, and, quite frankly, a bit alien-like (to the teachers like me who prefer older age groups). Kindergarten can seem like a glorified daycare where kids don\u2019t learn much more than their colors, shapes, 1,2,3\u2019s and A,B,C\u2019s. But hear me out! Kindergarten is as important as any other grade\u2014 with a vastly different role. While babies and young children may seem passive or unaware of the world around them, evidence suggests that the most critical brain development happens in the first five years of life. One could even argue, especially scientifically, that preschool-kindergarten are *more* important than the latter grades, in terms of development and the scope of lifelong learning. (If you want to do some research, Google: \u201cfirst 5 years child development\u201d or \u201c30 million word gap\u201d). Many other Quorans responded with great key points. You can rest easy knowing that, theoretically, your child is in roughly the same spot as many of her peers and, theoretically, her teacher will be prepared to handle the learning gaps of all students when returning to the classroom. This is nothing new to teachers. We never, ever receive a group of students who are all at the same academic level. We are trained to meet our students where they are and help them achieve new heights from there. Parents are not expected to fulfill the roles of professional teachers any more than teachers should be expected to fulfill the roles of parent. There are, however, instances where those roles intertwine. Noting your daughter\u2019s age and the present state of the world around us, there are two things you can do as a parent that would greatly benefit her future return to school, but are also just good practice in parenting anyway: Talk! Read! Sing! Question! Encourage conversation with your child as much as possible. Try not to dumb things down when you speak to her, but do try to explain things and answer her questions about the world. Wonder openly with her. \u201cI wonder why the grass is green? I wonder why we see more butterflies in the spring?\u201d Search for those answers together when you don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a dual purpose to this strategy. It\u2019s all about getting your child to interact with a wide range of vocabulary, and teaching them to be lifelong learners. Practice the phrase \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014 but let\u2019s find out!\u201d Demonstrating your thought process out loud is incredibly poignant for a child to help learn ways of thinking, reasoning, and questioning. Instead of walking through the grocery store silently, you can wonder aloud with your child \u201cshould I get X, or Y? Hmmm\u2026 Y looks healthier, but X is one dollar less.\u201d For these purposes, the content of your conversations is not quite as important as the action of interacting regularly with your kid. You want your child to encounter a wide range of words, by talking, singing, listening to audio books, reading physical books, etc. Evidence shows that the more words a child encounters in their first 5 years, the better off they will fare in latter school years. Be warned, though! Plopping your child in front of a TV show to \u201chear more words\u201d does not count as \u201cencountering vocabulary.\u201d Sorry, well-intentioned busy parents!Ensure her emotional safety and development. On that note about interacting with your child\u2014 humans are social animals! Quarantine has been difficult for many of us adults, and it\u2019s a little selfish to assume that our children don\u2019t face similar difficulties. Issues for children stuck at home right now might include an emotionally/physically unsafe household, lack of normal routine and structure, and lack of interaction with others, to name a few. Humans crave human interaction, and when deprived of adequate socialization or emotional attention, children will mistake any attention for positive attention. What am I saying? Behavior issues (in the home or classroom) are often rooted in the child\u2019s search for attention. (Not always. Another good Google search is \u201cSEAT behavior\u201d). Many times, children \u201cact out\u201d because they are looking for a response from you, and they have learned through your feedback and reinforcement that negative behavior will get you to talk to/look at them a lot faster than positive behavior will. You don\u2019t have behavior issues now? Great! But make sure to keep an eye out for any emotional/behavioral changes that might arise during this lockdown. You know your child best, and you should be trying to ensure they feel emotionally safe and cared for, especially during these uncertain times. Also\u2014 it sounds quite silly, but boredom is actually a huge stressor on our brains!Now, for any ambitious readers who want to continue their kindergartener\u2019s education at home but respect the sanctity of summer (AKA make it fun): Have them play (safely) with tools and objects that make them use their hands. Gross and fine motor skills are a big focus in kinder. Make a game playing with tweezers and picking up cotton balls (and count them while you\u2019re at it!). Supervise them using scissors or hot glue guns to make creations. These things get their little hand muscles ready to adequately hold pencils and form letters. You really see the difference in frustration levels with students who are not accustomed to using their hands when learning to write their ABC\u2019s.Have them draw pictures and tell you stories about those pictures. Ask them questions about what they drew, ask them details about the story they are spinning, or ask them to draw what happens next in their story/picture. This is a precursor to writing and storytelling.Play word games. Scramble letters and try to assemble simple one, two, or three letter words with them. (Look up \u201csight words\u201d to know good ones to practice) Ask your child\u2014 how many rhymes can you think of for \u201ccat?\u201d \u201cbed?\u201d \u201cdog?\u201d Your kid is likely to list fake words as they try to think of rhymes, like \u201cbed, red, jed, fed, ped\u201d which is perfectly okay! Let them know which words are real and which they made up. They are learning that words are not only made up of the same various letters, but that words carry meaning and their meaning changes when you change a few letters.",

            "answer_text": "Since schools closed in March, my kindergarten aged daughter is learning very slowly. She's far behind where she should be. I'm not able to teach her as well as her regular teacher. Will students like her have to repeat the grade? Try not to worry about it too much. I know that is pretty much impossible to do, but hear me out. This global pandemic is causing all sorts of unprecedented problems. Children all over the world are having their education seriously disrupted, but it really can\u2019t be helped. Distance education and similar arrangements are helping to reduce that disruption, but they can\u2019t replace proper schooling. Parents simply cannot be expected to do the job of a professional teacher. The good news is that teachers are very aware of the problem, and your daughter is not alone in this. When school does resume, your daughter will be getting the help she needs to catch up. You will probably find that the majority of her classmates will be in the same situation. We know that this will need to happen, and plans are likely being drawn up right now. In the meantime, if you can, try and reach out to your daughter\u2019s school. Ask them if there is anything they can suggest you do to help your daughter during this difficult time. My own recommendation would be to focus on reading. Read books with your daughter. Read lots of them. Read child-friendly websites. Read signs in the street (assuming you aren\u2019t housebound). Read the labels on the food in the kitchen. Read everything. If you can show your daughter how to sound out words and so forth, wonderful. If you don\u2019t feel confident doing this, don\u2019t worry. She will learn a lot just by watching and listening to you as you read things to her. ",
