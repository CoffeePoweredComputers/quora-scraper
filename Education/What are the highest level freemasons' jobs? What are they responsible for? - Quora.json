            "answer_text": "Daniel Tomlinson\u2019s answer is correct. It difficult to interpret your question. To my knowledge employment within the fraternity is limited to the staff within the Grand Lodge offices. In California, 3 Lodge officers may be paid: the Secretary, the Organist and the Tiler. But most often these offices are filled by volunteers. I'm about to be installed as Tiler for the 4th or 5th time, and I served 3 years as Secretary . I've never been paid other than in satisfaction at contributing. But some Lodges are large enough that their Secretary performs a full time job. In those instances, they are often compensated. But, I wonder if what you're really asking is what/who runs Freemasonry? The answer to that is that there is not a worldwide head of the fraternity. Each Grand Lodge is sovereign within its jurisdiction. In the US, that jurisdiction is a state. Elsewhere in the world it is a country or region. Within a Grand Lodge, the Grand Master is the boss, and his decisions are given great weight under Masonic Law. He has the power to create, or close a Lodge; to create a Mason on the spot, or to remove a man from Masonry for cause. He is guided and constrained, in California, by the California Masonic Code (CMC), which spells out the laws and rules within this jurisdiction. The CMC may only be changed by a vote of the members of the Grand Lodge (Master and Wardens of each Lodge) and representatives of the Past Masters of each Lodge in an annual meeting. Once you understand this independent. organizational arrangement, it becomes much more difficult to subscribe to the conspiracy theorists who have the Freemasons running the world. Seems implausible to me given that there are so many independent Grand Lodges in the world. I hope this is helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose the question may be addressing positions such as the Sovereign Grand Commander Inspector General of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Southern Jurisdiction, and similar positions. The position is a weighty one, and I know these individuals labor hard at their appointed tasks. Having attended the same events with these brothers, I have to say I have never seen anyone work as tirelessly and with such grace and dedication. The SGIG Ronald Seale was worn to the bone to my observation, and my admiration certainly increased at seeing him give every ounce of strength. As to what are they responsible for, I hope I do not speak out of school to say that most at the House of the Temple are responsible for the operation of the daily business of the S.R. and aiding in various charitable programs and encouraging membership and education. I have always been aided to the utmost whenever contacting a \u2018high level\u2019 employee in the body of Freemasons. Whether it be the local Grand Lodge secretary or reaching out to the S.R. workers. In our Masonic jurisdiction, and as far as I am aware, there are no wages for the Grand Lodge officers. I believe there is a small stipend for travel expenses. It\u2019s an enormous commitment, and requires a great deal of time and dedication. I hope this reply helps somewhat. ",
