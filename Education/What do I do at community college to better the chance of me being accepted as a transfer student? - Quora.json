            "answer_text": "First, be sure that the community college has a transfer or articulation agreement with one or more public four-year institutions in the state and which ones they are. This will vary from state to state. The community college should have a transfer advisor who can help you. Second, be sure you\u2019re enrolled in a transfer program. It is intended to cover the same subjects covered in many college freshman and sophomore year courses and usually leads to an Associate in Arts (A.A.) or Associate in Science (A.S.) degree, NOT an Associate ih Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree. Work with your advisor to take all the required courses in the program, together with strongly recommended electives. Third, get the best grades you can. Usually, only grades of C or higher are accepted in transfer. If you earn a D in a course, it is likely that the four-year institution will not accept that course. The community college also probably has a minimum cumulative grade point average to be met in order to earn an associate degree. Be sure to at least meet it. Fourth, learn to manage your time so you can complete all the work in each if the courses you\u2019re in and have some time to eat and sleep. This is very important. You are responsible for the quality of your work, not the faculty member, who will expect you to do it all. Finally, when in doubt, ask your advisor. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "What do I do at community college to better the chance of me being accepted as a transfer student? Several things come to mind: First, plan for your transfer. Know exactly what program you intend to transfer to, and ensure all your classes align. In Virginia, we have a program that allows for automatic acceptance at a state four-year university if you attend a community college first. Several of my interns have used it for engineering.Second, complete your associates degree. Transferring with a degree is easier than without. I picked up two before I ended up transferring, but that was also due to moving while in the military. Also note I got technician jobs from my AAS degree, so its a great backup if you don't finish the four-year school for any reason.Last, focus on your grades. Transferring is easier with a 3.8 GPA than a 2.0. Good grades sell the idea you are truly collage material. SAT scores, nice essays, recommendations and decent grades in high school suggest you may do well in college.Your grades in college are definitive proof.",
