            "answer_text": "1. Held in March, along with your Juniors. You register as a private candidate when appearing for an Improvement Exam, you are allowed a new role number, and are allotted a centre near your residence (Within a span of 5-10KM). You get the same Paper as your Juniors get. You don't need to give Practical Exams again, though. Their marks are carried over. 2.  In Improvement Exam Mark Sheet is the same as your Initial Mark Sheet except, for where \"PASSED\" is written, you get something on the lines of \"XXXX\" indicating an Improved result. However, this doesn't matter, you'll anyways need to produce both the Mark Sheets where ever you present your result with the Improved Score. 3. This is where CBSE is unclear on the matter. At the Delhi office, one of the officials said that you'll need to improve in all subjects or your new mark sheet won't be accepted by certain colleges like IIT. However, to a friend of mine, a different official told him that your highest scores are considered. I'd assume that the former is true, to remain on a safer side. But then, at 70.04% you don't have a choice. So, give the Improvement Exam regardless of the condition of \"What if you don't improve\". 4. Yes. The procedure for BITSAT is straight forward. They ask you whether you appeared for Improvement or not. For others its a bit tricky (even IIT) but there's no real problem with the matter. All the colleges accept improvement scores. 5. I don't think so. 6. It doesn't. ",

The exams will be held with the regular students with the same examination paper at the allotted examination center. The practical examination marks will be taken from the previous examination (if applicable) so you just have to prepare for the theory paper. You can take out the admit card from http://cbse.nic.in ie cbse official website and also you can apply for any number of subjects you want to apply for. Hope it helps :-) ",
