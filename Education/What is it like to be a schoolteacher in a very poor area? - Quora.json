            "answer_text": "I did not teach(intentionally, though I love it) but I had started to work during the weekends, with a slum school in my area(near Mumbai, India)..just a 5 minute walk from where I lived. Education, teaching is close to my heart - and I had all my ideas and strategies ready before I landed there\u2026. How I would use technology to compensate for lack of quality teachers. How using multimedia and interactive e-learning softwares would result in humongous improvement in learning in the least amount of time! The kids would enjoy learning resulting in increased attendance! With increased attendance and learning, the school performance would improve - without huge efforts needed from teachers! I also had ideas on how I would get funding fot the technology help. This experiment might get famous - and if we could standardize this model - it would spread to all other such schools. The country, the world would be a better place! Until I landed at the school, and was slapped by reality.  Pic: The school was inside this area The entire school(250 odd students in two shifts) used one toilet. Girls and boys both used the same toilet. Actually, the other slum dwellers also used the same toilet. And I forgot to mention, the toilet was in the open - adjoining the school building. And yes, the door was broken. So it wouldn\u2019t completely close. So you were partially visible when you went about your business. Needless to say - water supply was a problem. Impact? Girl students were dropping out - especially once they hit puberty(in 7th or 8th grade) due to absence of a f$@!$ng toilet! My technology ideas sounded like another age, another planet\u2026as I asked \u201cOK, what are the other pressing problems?\u201d Students would not attend school. My immediate judgement? Ya, probably because the teachers weren\u2019t good enough. That\u2019s where I came in as the savior with my multimedia power, isn\u2019t it? Not really - some of the classrooms had leaking roofs, making it impossible to sit during rains. Floor levels were low causing flooding in heavy rains. Less working fans - making it impossible to sit in hot summers. Doors were broken..so even stray dogs came in for a class sometimes. Of course, teachers attendance, punctuality was also a problem. But at least I could work with them. Students would not learn. Why? Because they did not have books. I thought - I will bloody buy them notebooks. Beg my friends if needed. Until I realized they were talking about textbooks! How does a school run without students having text books?!! It was surviving purely on love, devotion and a desperate will to survive. And yes, many students in 6th grade could not do addition, subtraction. Most student\u2019s parents had a drinking problem at home. So money meant for school fees got diverted. 5\u20136 people staying in a single room meant challenges in studying. Plus most parents did not appreciate the value of studying anyway. My mind reeled as I was dragged down Maslow\u2019s hierarchy and all my priorities shifted.  For the following 1\u20132 years, the focus was entirely on infrastructure. Friends chipped in, my company\u2019s CSR wing helped heavily. Even Quorans helped. This helped in installing toilets, separate urinals for the boys. Getting good quality blackboards for all classrooms, fixing all benches, then working on buying students books, fixing the office furniture. This was followed by getting them a desktop, printers (the teachers had to spend a significant amounts from their pockets just to print documents, report cards from outside!) Each step was an adventure in itself. This was followed by multiple parent-teacher meetings. Addressing an audience which comes from a totally different value system and beliefs is a totally different ball game. Moderating shouting matches, blame games(involving parents and school teachers both!) , setting expectations, motivating the teachers that \u201cthis is not an exercise in futility\u201d and a dozen other things! Then of course fund raising efforts, social media campaigns, setting up a blog to report our progress\u2026. From a teacher\u2019s perspective - half of them were working for free in the hope that one day they would be formally employed and get all their past salary arrears. So no incentive to put in their best. The others tried a lot but were sincerely bogged down by absence of infrastructure and unsupportive parents. But of course, one of the best things that happened for me was that I met my wife through this initiative :) (Vijayraj Kamat (\u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0924)'s answer to Has any couple met on Quora and fallen in love?) Many learnings, rich experience and many more memories to share in my association of 3\u20134 years. Too much for a single Quora answer :) But undeniably one of my hardest and most enriching experiences. When we talked about other things like career, marriage, aspirations in life, dealing with people\u2026my mother used to say \u201cYou have changed. Your way of thinking and looking at life has changed. I suspect it is due to working with the slum school\u201d :) Maybe she is right.  I am sure the infra improvements, meeting up with parents, teachers helped a lot. But I still feel sad that I was not able to do much to improve academic performance - and that was my primary motive. The academic performance went up a lot in the first year - but I know there was no causation and it would be incorrect to claim credit for it\u2026 I tried many solutions(discussions, setting up attendance tracking processes, roping in my friend\u2019s NGO from Pune to provide workbooks etc) But I failed to garner the teacher\u2019s support and motivate them enough. Or help the students themselves in improving academically. That\u2019s a regret I always carry in my heart and an answer I still haven\u2019t found. :( But whatever we did together, was of course worth it. Some pictures\u2026  The entire school lined up for India\u2019s I-day celebration. The structures on the left and right are the school.  Pic: Rohan - heck of a personality. Was into oration, drama, and martial arts. ",

            "answer_text": "I worked in some very poor districts in the Bronx. Some stuff that happened. . . Had to escort a kid back to his apartment because there was a very real chance he'd get jumped by adultTeaching special education classes with Emotionally Disturbed, Learning Disabled and English Language Learners all in the same room. This happened EVERY year I taught special ed.Malnourished students, who were taking food from the cafeteria home just to get a little extra. One little girl had taken milk and a banana and forgotten about it till it spoiled, and I ended up washing her already ripped and tattered bookbag. My paraprofessionals refused to touch it, and it was the only one she had. No way was I letting that go down.Kids needing me so much emotionally they accidently start calling me mom. That one's a little sweet.Being a witness to the profound suffering of children because of their circumstances. Example: every year I taught in the Bronx, I could reasonably expect more than 50% of my students to be from a single parent home.Lack of supplies. Expect to spend your own money for supplies. Seriously. Not just for school supplies, but for the supplies needed to turn you class into as close to a community center as you can manage. There are problems much bigger than 2+2 that you have to address.Oh this. . . This is my favorite. Losing your job because the bigwigs up top classified your school as failing and decided to close it. Only to see it open again the next year with only half of the staff returned, the entire other half, mostly people of color, removed, and experienced educators replaced with ill prepared white idealists from Teach for America. The poor souls really believe they are doing something good, but are really just a source of cheap labour for schools and the 6 weeks training they go through is a poor substitue for 2 years of training in assessments, ZPD, etc.Being told you are a failure because you cannot teach kids well enough to make 2-3 years of growth in one year, simply on the basis of a once a year test they don't do well on.Watching kids view THEMSELVES as failures when they don't do well on these tests, not because you are disappointed in them, but because they are disappointed in themselves. This broke my heart every time I saw it. Still does, even here in Japan, where students still put unreasonably high expectations on themselves.The Black Educator Tax \u2014 the price every black educator gets in which they are guaranteed to recieve the most difficult students on the basis that they will 'connect'. This virtually ensures that black teachers will be firmly embedded in a certain role as disciplinarian, a role many of us DON'T want. We are teachers, not jailers.Anyway, I teach in Japan now. Because, reasons. Thanks for reading. ",
