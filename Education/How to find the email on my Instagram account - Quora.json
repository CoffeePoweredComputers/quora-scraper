            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, you are out of luck if you are trying to find the email behind an Instagram account. There is good reason for this\u2026 it keeps users secure and keeps a boundary between personal and social media. However, in some circumstances you may be in luck. Some users decide to leave their email in their bio; therefore, their followers can easily communicate or network with them.If they have an Instagram business account it is likely that they\u2019ll have a contact button where you can reach out to them\u2026 or have their email listed on their account.You could potentially ask the user via DM. You can do this through engaging with a particular user in direct message and then ask for their email to \u201cbetter communicate\u201d.Another way you may be able to find their email is\u2026 if the account is a personal account. If it is personal that normally means there is a Facebook profile linked which may have more information on the person you are trying to communicate with.Hope this helps. If you have any other questions about Instagram feel free to view my profile or request my answer to a question. ",

If you know the person then the best way to know the persons Email is by simply asking them. Rather then taking the pain to download and know the functionality of different background check apps, the simplest way would be to directly contact the person and enquire from them. Another way to find emails is if they have a business page you can click on contact via email and this will pop up their email address. ",
