            "answer_text": "Well it just means \u201cbetween\u201d disciplines. Meaning not your own. For example, on an ethics committee you may want a variety of different disciplines to attend a meeting for a patient and family\u2019s best interest on a serious ethical dilemma. A diverse group of disciplines can offer different insights/perspectives/views. An example could be a medical staff member, nursing member, spiritual advisor to represent their religious beliefs, therapists, and others. At any rate you get others from different areas with different perspectives working together for the same goals in a symbiotic relationship. Don\u2019t ask people though who do not fit into this interdisciplinary group. For example do not go to a an artist down the road or a police officer who has no idea of the situation at hand. You want to ask persons who can add depth and value and have a vested interest (non maleficence) for the patient and family at hand. Good luck! \ud83c\udf40 ",

An example would be a doctor specialising in in respiratory complaints and a surgeon who specializes in thoracic surgery working together to decide if an operation to remove a lung is the best course of action, or if less intrusive e therapies can be tried first.
