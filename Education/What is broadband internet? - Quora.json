            "answer_text": "Back in the old days, you only had dial-up. There was a modem attached to your phone line, and it was slow ! They got faster over time, but not that much faster really. The last modem I used was billed as 56kbs, but in reality never reached more than 44kbs. That\u2019s how you accessed the Internet. The data from your computer got changed into audio signals that were passed over the phone network just like your voice, and it was decoded at the other end. Then came broadband - it doesn\u2019t have to be wireless, although it sometimes is. It\u2019s literally faster and it uses a broader range of frequencies (hence the name). Oh, and it\u2019s also digital. Dialup was analog, but broadband isn\u2019t. The first iteration uses your phone line and provides one of the standard ADSL options - ADSL1 which will allow up to 8Mbs, ADSL2 which allows up to 12 Mbs and the dreadfully named ADSL2+ which can support up to 24Mbs. There are other variants of ADSL as well, but when I was testing them, they weren\u2019t allowed to be connected to the public phone network, so we wired an apartment building and connected it to a nearby fibre ring. I saw 85Mbs downstream most of the time. That was VDSL. Now we\u2019ve got fibre - if you\u2019re lucky here in Australia, you\u2019ll have fibre to your house. If not it\u2019s either to the curb outside your house, or to a box a couple of hundred meters away in which case the copper phone line will move the data the last distance to your house or business. Fibre to the house can offer 100Mbs downstream, and other current technologies can come close to that. The crappy option is HFC, which is a mix of optical fibre and co-ax cable. Wireless is broadband too, and it certainly exists, but in this country it\u2019s more expensive and usually found outside the cities and major towns. Having good line of sight helps as you can imagine. If you\u2019re lucky (or perhaps unlucky, it depends on your viewpoint) there\u2019s also satellite where you have a dish pointing to a satellite in stationary orbit about 22,000 miles above the Earth, and always on the equator. From the users point of view it\u2019s all the same - it\u2019s all Internet and it usually just works. But some options are considerably faster than others. ",

            "answer_text": "It is simply high speed Internet over wireless Wireless communication uses Radio frequency band to transmit/receive. For example: frequency =200Mhz, bandwidth = 10 Mhz. This means that you are using the band between 200 and 210 Mhz. Ciming back to the \u201cband\u201d, the broader (wider) the band, the higher the speed. The thiner the band, the better coverage. Thus: Narrowband Internet: allows biger coverage area but slow speeds Broadband Internet: allows highee speeds but smaller coverage area 2G and EDGE are narrowband 3G, HSDPA, HSUPA,HSPA, LTE (4G) are broadband ",
