            "answer_text": "I\u2019m of an opinion that there\u2019s more beyond the \u201cBrand\u201d, coming to pursuing good quality education and career. I\u2019m definitely one of those students who aimed and got into top brands, and had a decent education there. But, ever since i got into the business of guiding students for Master\u2019s education abroad, my opinion has slightly changed. The Craze for Branded Universities- Most of the students aiming for a great master\u2019s education want to get into one of those \u201cBranded\u201d universities everyone is talking about. I\u2019m not just talking about the Harvards and Stanfords of US but even the next tier of Universities such as University of California, LA or SD or North Carolina, Chapel Hill or TAMU, college station etc.. Remember, even these universities have a huge number of applicants from all around the world, especially from the Subcontinent, China, Korea etc.. . Getting into such Universities of course takes a great profile with good GPAs, GREs etc.. An added hurdle is the sheer amount of competition the applicants face. For example, even after guiding multiple students over the years, for us it\u2019s still quite hard to tell if a student with a great profile can get into CS program of North Carolina, Chapel Hill or not. It really depends on how competitive the Pool of applicants is. Moving Beyond\u2026 What I can safely claim is that there are Universities which are almost on an equal footing as the \u201cPopular\u201d ones in terms of quality of education, but have somehow missed the limelight. To be honest, a few reasons for them not being that popular could be High tuition fees, Location, limited intake etc.. However, one secret advantage these Universities enjoy is the \u201cRelatively low volume of applicants\u201d. This very situation can increase one\u2019s chances of admit into a great graduate course. Note that some courses in such universities might be ranked higher than the popular ones. Also, one\u2019s chance of getting on campus jobs or Assistantship increases owing to less number of students in the program, which in turn decrease your expenses. Branded V/S Not-Branded- For many students, the \u201cCraze for Brand\u201d is not just the driving factor to aim for such universities, but the opportunities that are created in terms of Job. I cannot deny that. Graduating from a \u201cMaryland, college park\u201d or \u201cColumbia\u201d definitely turns heads. The competition is crushing though. On the other hand, graduating from a good Master\u2019s course offered by these Not-branded Universities can also positively impact one\u2019s resume, because employers usually look not only at the \u201cbrands\u201d but also the content in an applicant. In my opinion, if you are looking for an enriching education experience, do not limit yourself by just applying for brands. You should also give a shot to the other set of Universities. QS rankings for some Popular Universities- University of California, Los Angeles \u2013 35 University of Illinois, Urbana Champagne - 75 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill- 90 University of Southern California- 129 Texas A&M, College Station \u2013 189 University of Illinois, Chicago- 231 UMass, Amherst- 305 Northeastern University- 344 Stony Brook University, SUNY \u2013 359 University of Texas, Dallas \u2013 501-510 University of Cincinnati \u2013 561-570 QS Rankings of some \u201cNot so popular\u201d Universities Northwestern University 31 Rice University 85 Boston University 98 Case Western Reserve 167 Vanderbilt 200 Dartmouth College- 207 Georgetown University- 226 University of Notre Dame- 241 Tufts University 253 LeHigh University 551-560 Drexel University 561-571 College of William and Mary \u2013 600+ Of course some might not agree with the Universities in the \u201cNot so Popular\u201d list, but we have observed fewer students applying to them (from India). I also tried to include popular universities from different \u201cTiers\u201d keeping all sorts of profiles in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it does. If you let it. Its really simple, really cool to say it doesn't matter at all. But it does, trust me. I am at a 3rd tier college in West Bengal. And the difference is not in your attitude, or whatever abstract term people use. Its in a much more real difference, a difference in the quality of education, and a difference in the opportunities present, that then causes a negative outlook amongst students. You realize immediately that most of the teachers don't have much of an idea about the stuff they're teaching. Those who do are difficult to find. Even the HODs and the senior teachers are often absolutely clueless about the stuff they teach. When I joined my college, and saw an incompetent nincompoop parading about as an HOD, simply because he is one. Whether he knows his subject doesn't matter. There is no scope for R&D in most such colleges. How can there be? The day-to-day functions are barely completed in such a place. How do you even expect a functioning R&D cell here. I was recently offered an internship at a start-up. I went to my HOD for an NOC, so I could complete my work there. He tells me, \"Whats the point of a student interning at a company? Don't your parents give you enough money already? Attend your classes, thats more important.\" Never mind the fact that I would be gone in my semester vacations, and wouldn't miss a class. Never mind that classes are barely held in the college. I then spoke to another teacher, who advised me to complete the internship, and then return with a medical certificate, just in case I missed any classes. This is just an example of what happens. There will be many more such problems. Naturally, you cannot broaden your horizons, or think beyond getting a basic job. Plus, there's the famous non-IITian stigma. Recruiters don't take you seriously. Your neighbours are more ashamed of you than your parents are. All of it takes its toll. The question is, what will you do about it? While I might seem rather pessimistic so far, I can tell you something else. It is at this place, that I have met some fantastic students. Who didn't give a damn where they were. Sayan Chowdhury, Ratnadeep Debnath, Kushal Das, Prithviraj Mukherjee and Soham Ghoshalare just some people from my college who I can name. They didn't let the college stop them, and are some of the most respected professionals in their fields today. This is just a small sampling. Even among my own friends, Souradeep De and Avik Ghosh are some people who haven't let the college's bad name stop them from crafting out a reputation from themselves. And how can I forget User, this guy is named in just about every major company's security hall of fame. And he's at BIT Mesra's extension centre, not even doing a B.Tech, but an BCA. Maybe speak to one of them someday. At times, you might not be able to help getting into a poor college. Thats understandable. Stuff happens. Yes, the college brand will matter, but its not everything. You can always step out of its shadow. At the end of the day, its only you that matters, no one, and nothing else comes close. All the best!! ",

Average people don\u2019t get into the top universities, its those who slug it out on a consistent basis that make it in. And to survive on such campuses, you\u2019re really going to have to up your game or risk being tossed aside onto the pavement. Its survival of the fittest, and this game played at the college trains them to survive the next challenge, getting a job. Not just any job, but the most drooled over jobs that ensures a comfy and luxurious life. The people who hire want a hard working individual who knows what he\u2019s doing. If you hail from a prestigious college, that itself is proof of you meeting the above two conditions. Brand matters. Would you choose to buy a Nike shoe, or some local shoe? What if they were priced at the same rate? The answer is obvious even if they were priced differently. Why? Because Nike has a reputation of always delivering, both quality and style. That reputation is upheld by the bloodbath that goes on in their campuses, that produces such prized contenders, which the companies view as valuable assets. You can whine about how its not fair, but thats how it is. Its survival of the fittest, and the college you study at, will either lift your status up into the stars, or pull it down into the gutter.

            "answer_text": "Generally, as long as a school is legitimate/reputable (i.e. not a diploma mill), then the 'name' of the school will be unimportant to most employers, and only a small factor to those employers who actually do consider what school you went to. Employers mostly just care that you have your degree. The name of your school matters the most in terms of getting accepted into a competitive graduate program. The question \"Does the name of my school really matter?\" is relevant mostly to high school students. To them I would say, go to the school that is the best value. You are far better off graduating from a state school with no debt than taking out loans to attend a private university. If you are in a position where you have a full-ride at a prestigious school, then you are one of the lucky ones. The biggest difference truly in what school you attend is the quality of your experience there. This means that, in terms of personal growth, it is ideal to pick the school that is the best fit for you, and oftentimes it is the more prestigious schools that offer the best environments for growth. However, it is still best to make a wise financial decision. In terms of \"Will I get a job?\", however, any decent school will do. ",

            "answer_text": " We all know that how much important education is. In every year millions of scholars complete their 10+2 education and take entry in the new phase of life with the hope of making it top Universities and colleges .And, for all these pass out students there are plenty of colleges that are try hard every year to get their attention and fill up their seats. The pressure on students to put immense work hard and score well to get into a decent college is main thing that everybody wants. But, there is something that goes hidden from the students and parents, i.e., the struggle that colleges face to attract the students towards them for admission and keep up with the pace. No matter what, the education sector has become a business because of some money minded businessman who invest in education sector and build a building of money making ideas rather quality education, and it runs on money and efforts taken by humans. It is like any other business project that requires constant capital and nurturing. What makes a college BRAND? I will tell you, Its students, when after completing the course students give positive feedback that is called brand, and it will be possible when a college imparts excellent knowledge, changes individual temperament, Provides good practical knowledge, Placements, because brand name matters to great extent after when it comes to get a good job and skills. There are many fake brands also that bribe many news agencies for attractive advertisements. At the time of admission you should be careful about these fake attractions. I will make you understand with an example- I am a student of KCC Institute of Technology and Management in greater Noida. I took admission in this institute because it has a new set of curriculum that were designed and develop with an extensive research of latest market trends and the prospects of future. College , over a period of time, developed an authority in the domain as it is the only institute in that area which started with the courses that were job oriented. It offers B.Tech with specializations As the time passed by and when other colleges realized the importance of these courses that are being taught in the university KCC and they also started some of courses. Since the KCC was the first one to provide these courses it led the race and still leading . But, after a course of period colleges started the same course things went down. Because you can make a exact copy but original always remain the same. I got placed in a renowned company with a package of 10LPA. and this is equal to an average IIT student. All i want to say sometimes you get trapped in wrong branding so just make a wise decision on your own. I visited the colleges of Greater Noida, but no one is even closer to KCC in terms of specialized course. I am not saying that other colleges are not providing extra courses but not as good as KCC. KCC is the only college which is authorized academic partner with AUTODESK in Greater Noida. Thank You!! ",

It\u2019s a pity because college is just what you put into it, whether it\u2019s Ivy League or not. And many people graduate from Ivy League school that floated through them because of family wealth. I had a friend who who interviewed for a job, he was told if he got it, he would have to shave his beard. One of his old professors asked him, do you really want to work for an outfit like that? It\u2019s the same for people who hire on brand college name. ",
