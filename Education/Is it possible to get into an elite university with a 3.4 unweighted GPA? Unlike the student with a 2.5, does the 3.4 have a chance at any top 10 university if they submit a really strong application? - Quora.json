            "answer_text": "When you say \u2018really strong application\u2019 what do you mean, exactly? For highly selective schools, merit is the floor. What I mean by that is that you must have the academic qualifications for admission and then they will consider the other attributes you possess. And those attributes must be very special. Do you have National recognition? Have you been admitted to selective summer camps? Are you intellectually curious and engaged, taking extra classes in the areas that interest you? Are you \u2018hooked\u2019 in some way? Here are just a few examples of ways you could be hooked: first generation, under-represented minority, athlete, legacy, child of someone powerful/rich/capable of donating. What is it that makes you extraordinary? I think the more important question is whether admission to a top ten university is even what your first criteria should be. There are wonderful colleges available to you with a 3.4, and what you do with your time there will be the biggest determinant of your future success. If you have a 3.4 in high school, how will that translate to success in a highly competitive, rigorously academic collegiate environment? Why not consider all of the attributes that matter to you, whether it is location, potential for merit aid, major, campus size, classes being taught by professors or TAs, opportunities for internships, campus spirit, Greek life, walkability, access to mountains/city/ocean, etc. Decide what is really important to you in a campus and then apply to schools that provide most of those elements. That is what will make it the right school for you, not whether US News says it is top ten. ",
