            "answer_text": "Lets start with a definition, there is a colloquial understanding of the term that translates roughly as \"America is the best\" that when pushed, is based on emotive, rather than reasoned factors.  This subjective reasoning naturally doesn't fare well under objective scrutiny, so I hope the OP is referring to the doctrine of American exceptionalism that essentially argues that 'America' exists in a perfect storm of abundant natural resources, an industrious and innovative workforce, a classless and fair society and more. At its heart the concept is very short sighted when it moves from an observational understanding of socioeconomic factors to an 'inexorable, unchangeable, ideological birthright'.  America is, and has been exceptional, but it is vital to understand that this has just been how the 'hand it has been dealt'.  The factors I listed above were a mixture of luck and timing and crucially can and do change. Rome was exceptional, the ancient greeks were exceptional, the British Empire was exceptional, the Persian empire was exceptional and frankly this list could go on for a long time.  During the Apex of those empires, all the inhabitants (save a few malcontents) believed in their own exceptionalism, it is almost laughably predictable for the current world power to believe they are 'truly' exceptional, rather than riding a lucky wave of being the right people in the right place at the right time.  It's a little like every parent thinking their baby is the most beautiful one in the world. Let me be clear, I am not 'Anti American' I have travelled there about 10 times and I am truly awed at America's achievements and contributions to humanity, naturally though it is, like any country, not perfect.  The declaration of independence was a defining piece of history, and these words: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" Are nothing less than sacred. I will address the 3 most important (IMHO) factors defining American Exceptionalism.  A classless and fair society.Abundant natural resources  An industrious and innovative workforce.One of the core tenets of American Exceptionalism is a classless republic.  Rising from the ashes of Old Europe, the American dream was one where ANYONE could become rich or the president (well originally if you were a white male).  It is a truly wonderful aspiration, but the key question how true does it hold today? Recent studies have shown that social mobility is worse in America than much of Europe.  Whilst countries like the UK have slowly dealt with a measure of inequality in their social, economic and political structures, America has developed one built around money.  If you are born poor in America, you have a higher chance of staying poor, if you are born rich you have a greater chance of staying rich than compared to the UK.  A fact that surely makes the founding fathers turn in their graves. Since the 80's, two political families have run the country, their lowest point of power was under Obama's presidency when they 'only' managed to get a Clinton as a secretary of State (3rd most senior role after President and Vice president), 3 decades of two families de facto running the country?  Chances are Hillary Clinton will win the next election, and Jeb Bush might follow her.  If they both serve two terms that could be another 16 years of the Bush Clinton Dynasty taking us to 2032 which would be over half a century of them being in power.  Some European royal families didn't last that long. America's natural resources are phenomenal.  The size of the place allows for massive food production, and the ground is awash with oil, gas, precious minerals and more.  However, many other countries have this and they don't all last.  In and of itself it doesn't create 'exceptionalism'. Workforce.  The American economy and those who power it are still at the forefront of the world, however cracks are appearing.  The Global financial centre is no longer indisputably New York as it once was.  Hollywood has lost a lot of market share, the auto industry is being trounced by the East.  Silicon Valley is still strong but more and more of the hardware production is being outsourced to Asia, once this happens with software (and it will), it will be the beginning of the end for America's dominance in tech. In conclusion my answer is yes.  American exceptionalism does exist, as it did in Rome, and Egypt, and Britain, and China, and Persia and so on.  For the last century at least America has led the world.  But things are changing.  Moreover, understanding the factors that led to this rise it is important to recognise that this is nothing inherent to America or Americans.  It was simply in the right place at the right time. ",

            "answer_text": "(The following is a piece that I have submitted for the monthly #YoungPolitics column of Women's Voices Magazine.  I figured I should share it here for all of Quora to read, slightly modified of course to account for the nuances of this question.) As an American living outside the United States, this was a question that I had to grapple with on a regular basis.  Each and every country has its own unique story\u2014something that sets it apart from its peers and gives it its own unique character.  If I were to use this definition, then by extension all countries are exceptional. But if that were the case, what then is the United States? We should look at what the term \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d implies.  The logic goes that the United States, as the world\u2019s first \u201cnew nation\u201d, is so inherently different from other countries that we must understand it when it does things differently from the rest of the world, and we can\u2019t expect it to march to its beat. Sure, on the one hand the United States is exceptional.  Nowhere else on Earth is there a country that has built so much in such a short amount of time but us, and the world respects us for that.  America is exceptional in that it was a nation molded on liberty, freedom and equality: a wildly different set of values and ideals that previously defined the Old World\u2014a new order of the ages (novus ordo seclorum) that, as Charles Thomson suggested, would signify \u201cthe beginning of the new American Era\u201d that would be put on the Great Seal.  In fact, we still belong in this era: Thomas Jefferson\u2019s \u201cEmpire of Liberty\u201d, where America is the world\u2019s model for freedom and democracy, still lives. But there is a dark side to this exceptionalism.  Exceptionalism has been used to justify the most reprehensible crimes against others because we sought to assert our supremacy over those who don\u2019t adhere to who we say we are.  Exceptionalism in the 19th century was tied to Manifest Destiny, which lapsed America towards the very Old World ideals it sought to repudiate.  She didn\u2019t want an empire, for example, but got one built on the blood of American victors and foreign victims by the early 20th century.  She wanted to avoid war with the Monroe Doctrine, but found herself dragged into World War I. What does this point out to?  Yes, America is exceptional and I believe it.  It has served as a role model for countries the whole world over, and her story is truly unique as the world\u2019s first \u201cnew nation\u201d, unencumbered by the pretenses of Europe.  But at the same time, America is mortal, unexceptional and just like the rest of us.  She succumbs to the pressures of the world around her, seeks to be like them, and ultimately found her place at the top. But if you were to ask me about this, I think the United States should be commended for making a name for itself among nations.  America survived on sheer will and determination where so many others have failed, and it was her example that inspired so many other countries to survive and make it out on their own.  But we must also reconcile the fact that the United States was only able to achieve what it has achieved on the back of injustice, inequality and the suffering of her fellow men, and we must begin to reconcile what exceptional qualities this nation has with the dark past that built it.  Only then can we truly say that America is exceptional, because that\u2019s the reputation she rightfully deserves as her own. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I believe America is notable for its decisions to forgo social policies that favor the majority, eventually rsulting in its having recently converted itself to a de facto oligarchy. America is exceptional in being less egalitarian than most other developed countries. America has brutal prison sentences 13 times the average for OECD nations. America stands for liberty, but deprives more of its citizens of liberty than any other country. We are an exception in countless more ways to the norms that define other wealthy democracies. Of course, this is not what anyone else means by American Exceptionalism, but the fact are the facts. If America was really the best, we would spend time ennumerating the ways, not just making the bald statement \"we are the best!\" ",
