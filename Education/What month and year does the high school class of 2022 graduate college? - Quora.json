            "answer_text": "In the US, high school students usually go directly into college, where they spend four years earning a bachelor\u2019s degree. That means students who graduated in Spring 2020 enter college in Fall 2020 and graduate with their bachelor\u2019s degree in Spring 2024. 2021 entrants graduate in 2025. 2022 entrants graduate in 2026. Of course some students take a gap year before college; some enter with credits from dual enrollment, AP, or IB that can accelerate their studies, and some take five years to graduate. Some go into military service, take up employment, or choose part-time enrollment in a community college with intent to eventually transfer to a four year college or university. ",
