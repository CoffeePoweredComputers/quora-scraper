            "answer_text": " Heello, I have something incredible to share today! So this year I decided to take it upon myself to finally go all in on becoming MY BEST SELF\u2026 For years I knew I wanted more\u2026 I knew I had untapped potential and it was finally time to set it free. And after researching some of the best success coaches on the planet I came across this guy Dean Graziosi. I started following him and I LOVED his stuff! So just recently I decided to join his monthly Inner Circle and all I can say is WOW! It has been a complete needle mover in my personal and business life like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen. And on our last LIVE hangout, Dean talked about the importance of being surrounded by like-minded individuals all hungry for that next level of life. And I knew I had to share the message! So for anyone out there that feels like they have more gas in the tank\u2026 like they have untapped potential waiting to explode\u2026 then I want to invite you to come on over and join our amazing Inner Circle. If you want to hear Dean explain all of the benefits and bonuses you get when you join (better than my quick post lol) then you can watch a quick video at the link below! (if using Instagram we recommend pushing them to the link in your bio) Dean Graziosi's Inner Circle I would love, love, love to have more of my friends and family members on this journey towards our better lives. I sure have loved mine so far! So come check it out! I can\u2019t wait for next month\u2019s hangout :) Dean Graziosi's Inner Circle ",
