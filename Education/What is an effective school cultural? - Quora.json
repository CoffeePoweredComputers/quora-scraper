            "answer_text": "I think an effective school culture is where everyone is respected and ideas are heard, not necessarily used, but heard. It with the school board, principal, and teachers. But if people are disrespected then, it will filter down from above and everyone feels it. Also, parents should be hard, but really feel a need to defend their students if there is a problem. School culture is difficult to define, and everyone is responsible. ",
