            "answer_text": "The first and most basic problem is communication with the students. In a school with large numbers of ESL who speak versions of the same language you find bilingual teachers in say English & Spanish (the schools where I spent about 28 years) But in a school with more languages it is a bigger problem. One where I spent 5 years had over 40 languages besides English, 11 in my last homeroom and my students were college level fluent in English. They tried to keep the number of languages in any single ESL class down to 6. The ESL teachers had 3 or 4 assistants-often parents, aunts, uncles, cousins etc. who were English fluent come in at least part time to help with translation. I had one brother and sister who were among 8 students in the entire LA Unified School District who spoke their language. They both were fluent in English by the time I met them in 11th and 12th grades. The other six were all members of their extended family. The only employee in the district who spoke their language was their Aunt who was a UCLA grad student, worked for the district part time and traveled to each of the total of 3 schools these 8 students attended and did translation for the ESL teachers. Counting all the members of their family there were only about 30 or so people in the city of LA who spoke their language. Now that is pretty much as isolated you can get. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you have to say where, and with what age students, for a complete answer. But let\u2019s suppose we\u2019re talking about a US public school. K-12 ESL teachers have to work with general program teachers to help students attain grade level mastery of the entire curriculum, not just English. Some of their colleagues will be eager for their help, and some will resist, either because they don\u2019t know enough about language learning, or because they resent the presence of those \u201cforeigners.\u201d ESL teachers in the early grades also have the problem of teaching children to read a language they don\u2019t know very well. Decoding is relatively easy. Making sense of what\u2019s said in a language you don\u2019t know is harder. Parents may not be able to help with homework if the homework is in English. There\u2019s a flip side. ESL students generally know why it is that they have to learn English, and they pay attention. ",
