However, since H2SO4 is a strong diprotonic acid, even a small amount at low concentrations would be very dangerous. ",

            "answer_text": "When the sulfuric acid is ingested, it can damage the internal organs e.g. burning holes in the stomach, because the acid rapidly decomposes proteins and lipids upon contact with living tissue. You should get help immediately! Concentration matters as well. The higher the concentration, the more corrosive the acid. Concentrations from 0.5M (moles per cubic decimetre) to 1.5M are labelled as irritant, while concentrations stronger than 1.5M are labelled as corrosive. However, even solutions labelled as irritant can still be corrosive if you are exposed to it for long enough. ",
