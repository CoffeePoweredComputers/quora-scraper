            "answer_text": "If course you can, but first, ask yourself what was the impression you made in that class? What kind of student were you? Would your teacher remember many specific details about you? Can the teacher recall examples to illustrate her recommendation? Some schools do not allow teachers/professors the freedom to say no to a request for a letter of recommendation. That means that the teacher might say yes to your request but write a somewhat negative letter. Other teachers can afford to be honest and tell you to find someone who knows you better to write a letter on your behalf. Either way, be considered with your teacher and provide her with a resume/CV and your essays if you have them. That way, your teacher will have the opportunity to know more about you, and maybe, just maybe, improve her opinion about you. If you feel you cannot trust a teacher it is better to find someone else to write the letter. Most teachers will not write a letter unless you sign away your rights to see the letter. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely! I have written many Letters of Recommendation. There are a few things I would stress though: Ask them personally -as opposed to an e-mail. Teachers encounter many students and we always like putting a name with a face. We will remember where you sat in our class, how you contributed, but could see you in a grocery store and not recognize you at all. Make it personal!Give us PLENTY of time to write it. Like 2 or 3 weeks\u2026 Yes! Seriously. Don\u2019t ask them a week before you need it. Be aware of what is going on in the semester too. If you know mid-terms or finals are coming up, we prepare for them as much as our students (and time afterwards grading). Plan Ahead!After you ask them, tell them you will e-mail ALL the pertinent information they will need to write your letter. Then, in your e-mail, do that and include a gentle reminder of when you need it and when and where it will be convenient for YOU to come and get it from them. If you want your teacher to mail your letter, I would provide a self stamped envelope at the time of asking. (if it gets down to the deadline and you haven\u2019t heard from them, don\u2019t be afraid to either send a reminder e-mail, or leave a friendly voicemail).Wahoo! Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I asked a teacher for a letter of recommendation once. Here is the answer I received. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to write you a letter of reference. Whether it will be a recommendation or not is up to me to decide.\u201d At first I was taken aback, but the more I thought about this question, the more it meant to me. Here\u2019s an explanation. You, as the person receiving the reference, are not entitled to read it. You should provide the sender with a stamped envelope addressed to the admissions office of the school you\u2019re applying to. If the college has provided a form, you should include that, too. The writer will write the reference or fill out the form. A thoughtful reference letter might very well include some reservations about you that will actually help your application, but, if you read it, you might find it hurtful because you don\u2019t understand why the letter isn\u2019t a full-on rave. A good reference letter will highlight your strengths, while also pointing out some areas needing improvement. You will be able to help the person writing the reference by giving him or her a sheet highlighting your accomplishments at the school. Do not expect ever to see the letter. It\u2019s an area where you have to trust the teacher to have your best interests at heart. Hope you\u2019re accepted at a couple of colleges you\u2019d like to attend. ",
