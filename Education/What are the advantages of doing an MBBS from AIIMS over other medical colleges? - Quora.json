            "answer_text": "I joined AIIMS in 2007 as a nerdy 17-year-old and, five years later, left the institution as a responsible, mature doctor with a well-rounded personality. Despite topping the AIIMS entrance exam, I had initially joined IIT Delhi, but soon realised that my interest lay in medicine. So I quit IIT and joined AIIMS. Although many thought I had made a mistake by giving up IIT, it was the best decision of my life. When you join college after school, everything is new and you are unsure of the future. You need someone to hold your hand and guide you. AIIMS did just that. Several other medical colleges arguably impart the same knowledge, but I feel AIIMS teaches you how to make the best use of that knowledge. Being a good doctor is really important, but AIIMS also imparts other life skills that matter in the long run.  Of the thousands of aspirants who take the AIIMS entrance exam every year, less than a hundred-odd end up realising their dream of studying in the institute. Mine was a batch of 50 students, with toppers from every state. Together we created a competitive yet healthy environment. At AIIMS, students get clinical postings from the second year itself, and that's when we get a first-hand experience of patients and our profession. The sheer variety and number of cases one gets to handle here is mind-boggling. AIIMS, a tertiary care centre, gets patients whom other hospitals have failed to cure. That, in itself, is a challenge as well as an opportunity. We see the rarest of cases from all over the country. When expected to handle such patients, one obviously reads and researches more. The technology, too, is the best one can find. We have state-of-the-art lecture theatres, instrumentation and skill labs. The faculty lays a lot of stress on research work from the very beginning.  The institute provides ample opportunities to participate in national and international conferences as well as exchange programmes. Such exposure helps students achieve standards at par with the best in the world. AIIMS students have gone on to become doyens not just in India but in international institutions as well. When you know your seniors and alumni are leading doctors setting standards in the field of medicine globally, you have great role models to inspire you. Along with the intense focus on academics and learning, AIIMS offers a host of extra-curricular activities. World class facilities for sports as well as recreation are available on the campus. We can boast of a strong socio-cultural club and annually host the biggest fest among medical colleges, Pulse. It attracts students from across the country and allows for interaction with students from other professional streams, opening our world to varying viewpoints and ideas. A big thanks to my alma mater for making me a skillful and confident medical professional. The author is a senior resident in the department of radiology, AIIMS.

            "answer_text": "It's scares me that the people of this fine country have to ask such a na\u00efve question. Let me take you back to your school days. Remember when your mother told you 'beta, abhi padhai ache se kar lo, 10th k baad to aish hai'(study hard now so that you can relax after 10th) that turned out to be an utter lie because the same phrase was repeated again for you to finish 12th and then entrance and the college. But was that actually a lie. Let's touch upon the concept of foundation stone. Your mother asked you to study for 10th so that you can have decent marks thus, your prospective senior school doesn't have to choose you instead you can choose the school of your pleasing and much more important the stream of your dreams. Does any one cares how much you scored in 10th standard, or for that matter, if you even topped the CBSE Board 8 years back. No. A big fat No. But, that achievement had laid a foundation stone for all your future achievements. You were shovelled along the path of greater achievements. You were poised to settle for nothing less. The same continued in 12th standard and then entrance exam. And thus you finally made it to medical college. I couldnot make it to AIIMS, but I did get into AFMC. I am not sure I will be able to tell you what you will gain if you make it to AIIMS, I am not even trying to elaborate on that point. The fact that I am putting across is that the institute you graduate from matters. Let me explain this with a snippet from stereotype revolving your image of a doctor. A doctor is someone who is wearing a white coat, with a stethoscope around his neck and smile on his face, and asks you 'whats wrong?\u2019 But, aforementioned stereotype is there in the heads of the people who have mostly never been to a doctor's office. Most of the people who have been to a doctor's office(to whom they are not paying 2000 bucks per visit) will tell you that the real doctor was no where close to the stereotype. He may have been rude, angry, shouting at the top of his voice, not listening to what patient had to say or worse not bothered about the patients sufferings. Now, that doesn't make your doctor wrong. It's just that he was never made used to the fact that he may have to attend an OPD of 200 patients in 3-4 hours. All the knowledge was imparted upon him but never the subtle ethos and intricacies of the expectations of a patient toward his doctor. MBBS lays a foundation stone to being a doctor. Motto of my Alma mater i.e. AFMC is sarve santhu niramaya   Which means, \u2018MAY ALL BE FREE FROM SICKNESS AND DISEASE' that is what is instilled upon us and not just the medical knowledge. You can be Radiologists, Surgeon or Cardiologist from AIIMS, AFMC, or JIPMER, you will always be a doctor from your graduation Alma mater. On a material front. If you looking for perks of graduating from a premium institute, I can refer you to all the other answers that include reservation in PG, low fees, good infrastructure, good research opportunities, high rates of publications, good life style, thorough development etc etc. ",
