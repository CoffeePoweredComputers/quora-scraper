            "answer_text": "What level of math do you anticipate having studied during college? Everything depends on where you left off. Advanced algebra only? Pre-calculus? Statistics basics? Lower division only -basics of calculus, linear algebra? differential equations, vector analysis? Upper division - abstract algebra, number theory, partial differential equations, mathematical proofs, mathematical modelling, stochastics, complex numbers in calculus, advanced statistics Graduate level - string theory, complex coordinate systems, N-space. Private, for-profit universities will allow you to enroll, even if you have an undergraduate degree. Some university extension classes in higher math may be offered Go for a masters degree or PhD Get your employer to sponsor you for post-graduate math classes (though math major students get first priority).
