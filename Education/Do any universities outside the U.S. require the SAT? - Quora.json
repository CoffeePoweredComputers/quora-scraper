            "answer_text": "If, like me, you want to learn the structure of standardized tests, taking the test and analyzing the results is like taking an old analog clock apart to see how the gears turn the handles.  You get a sense of how the thing works, even if not a mastery of it.If you want to see how your education differs from the education expected of a U.S. high school student, taking the test might help you.    This is true even if you're in the U.S., but attend an alternative school or are home-schooled.If you plan to attend graduate school in the U.S. and want to \"get the feel\" of standardized tests without messing up your testing record for the GRE, you could take the SAT once or twice first.You could do it just for the fun of it, but I just buy old tests and save a lot of money when I want to do that.",
