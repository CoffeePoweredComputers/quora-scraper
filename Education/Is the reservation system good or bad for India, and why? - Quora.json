            "answer_text": "The Indian reservation system was a boon to the society in the beginning and for some years after that . Infact it has helped in raising the status of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes by giving them reservations in educational and job opportunities but now since everybody has equal rights and the condition of the people has improved we don\u2019t really need it. It has now become a curse to the society as most of the times it happens that a person who is more capable of doing a particular job or is more intelligent and talented is not able to rise up to such a higher level and a less worthier person who has a reservation succeeds. Infact reservations should made on the basis of merit and not on on the basis of the caste system. Even if the reservations are made on the basis of the caste system there is still discrimination happening on the basis of religion. It has happened with people I know.There were 3 people to choose from for a job . The person I knew was most eligible for the job and was fulfilling all the conditions but another person was chosen even though he had less achievements and not very suitable for the job.Both of them were of different religions . What could the basis of the discrimination? religion or bribe or any other issue? but what we saw was clear discrimination because when the officials were questioned they could not say a word. It is time to change our mindset then only will this country progress into the heaven of freedom as Rabindranath Tagore wanted. ",

            "answer_text": "Your perspective depends on whether you are benefiting from this reservation system or losing from it. Hence, we have two types of emotions in India in respect of reservation. Most upper caste people think that reservation is bad because they are losing opportunities in getting education in good colleges and getting government jobs due to reservation.Most lower caste people (who get the benefit of reservation) feel that reservation is not only justified but even necessary to remove the disparity between different castes in IndiaIt is a fact that caste is an important factor in Indian society. Most couples in India belong to the same caste. Hence, almost all their relatives belong to the same caste. They are all prejudiced on caste basis since their birth. Hence, whenever an opportunity rises, they promote the members of their own caste as compared to others. The lower caste people hardly had any representation in power structure of India before reservation. However, they are now well represented in the bureaucracy and politics. This has happened only due to reservation in educational institutions, jobs and in elections. It is difficult to say whether it is good or bad for India. If a policy benefits approximately 75% of the population (SC, ST, OBC), it is difficult to term it bad in a democracy. It is role reversal now. In the earlier times, the upper castes (Brahmins, Rajputs and Vaisya) who were in power reserved almost all privileges for them. The same is done today by the lower castes. I am sure that but for the intervention of the Honorable Supreme Court by placing cap of 50% in reservation, it would have crossed more than 75% by now. Interestingly, it has still not allowed reservation in Higher Judiciary. It is better to accept the reality of Indian reservation system and live within the system rather than trying to prove its benefits or losses to India. Any amount of argument is not going to change the system, which is going to decide the issue on the basis of the votes. Reservation is an emotional issue and people always find reasons to justify their feelings. ",
