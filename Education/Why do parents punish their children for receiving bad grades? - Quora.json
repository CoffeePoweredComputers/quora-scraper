            "answer_text": "The answer is simple, to induce fear. As a kid, my parents always beat me up whenever I had bad grades in school, I would get so scared that I started working hard so I won\u2019t get beaten again. My parents would use various tools to hit me, a ratan stick, broom, feather duster, belt, hanger\u2026\u2026 they would hit me until my skin splits and bleed. No matter how much they hit me and how hard I studied, my grades never went up. As I grew older I got used to them hitting me to the point that I can\u2019t feel pain any longer, so I stopped studying when I entered high school. That resulted in me failing 6 subjects, they found out that I don\u2019t care if they hit me so they brought out knives and threw them at me or burn me with hot wax. I got so scared, I started studying again, but my grades are still bad. My parents gave up on me, told me that I have no future with my grades. They stopped hitting me, and that\u2019s when I decided I need to move away from them, far away. I started working hard so I could get a scholarship and move away from them, my grades finally went up and I was finally able to apply for a scholarship. There is no point in hitting your child if they get bad grades, it only breaks them mentally and traumatizes them. I am 18 now, and I am still traumatized, my relationship with my parents are severely broken. I wish to no longer come into contact with them once I move out of their house. My scars are nothing but reminders of how terrible my parents are, hitting your children because of their grades is never the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Fathers who beat their children because of bad grades probably were beat for the same reason by their father. Beating your child doesn't make them be better in school. Sitting down and trying to find out what is the problem as seeing if you can help them is a better choice. You can't make your kids smarter by beating them because they can only be so smart everyone has a limit. Maybe the child has dyslexia and sees things backwards so it's hard to read and do anything. Some kids have attention deficit syndrome and find it hard to concentrate on what's being taught in class or retain information that is being taught. Some kids just don't have the brain power to understand simple things when being educated and need more tutoring or help in that area.not every child is smart smart smart picks up everything quickly and has no problem in school. So you're seeing what is the problem with a child and trying to help them is what you should be doing not beating on them.beating a child who cannot learn just makes them more stressed out upset and terrified and it doesn't make them learn any better in fact it might do the reverse get worse. Another thought is the child may not be able to see well and needs eyeglasses and that's why they can't do things like they should. There are so many factors in the situation and parents should be more understanding and a father should never beat on a child just because they can't perform the way they he wants them to.somebody needs to take that father aside and tell him to stop beating on your child you're not making it any better. In fact it's showing the father is pretty stupid and that's probably why he got beat up by his father. Some authorities or maybe a school person teacher something needs you talk to this father about what he's doing so there's this stop because beating a child doesn't make them learn better or get smarter.
