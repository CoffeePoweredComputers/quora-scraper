            "answer_text": "Hey! Thanks for A2A Life at GMC Patiala is something I can write about in detail as I've spent almost an year here for now! Coming from the outskirts of Chandigarh to Patiala was definitely challenging as you get to meet people who are from typical punjabi areas with the same culture rather than a Chandigarhian who's a bit different from them! Major problem you'll face is if u aren't fluent in Punjabi then that language barrier definitely arises coz ppl then treat you as some outsider or a tag is given to you of being \u2018Chandigarh ke nawab'. Hostels-pretty cumbersome for the girls in initial months rather than for the boys who get their individual rooms within a month,before that be prepared to live in those clumsy dormitories. Academics- The teaching will start the first day itself which slowly paces within a month! By the second month you'll appear for first substage which for then is terrifying but slowly u get habitual to it!! Caution: you'll be heartbroken to see scoring mere 6\u20137/10 even after giving brilliant answers bt then you'll come to know those are the highest marks!xD The other subjects will start with the practicals shortly and they are the most fun period! D hall was my personal fav as you've straight 2 hours to explore a human body the way you like-your table teacher will guide you more if you are interested in it! Co-curricular- Various events like Sports meet and the college fest\u2019Aura\u2019 are pretty engaging! Make sure you participate in Aura as that's the only time a medico stays away from books! Also u get to meet your seniors and make amazing friends!! Other facilities: Library are reading room was really good for the students you can't study I'm their rooms can go to the reading room anytime in the day until 11:50 pm. Swimming Pool and Gyms are also available! And now u dont need to stress for Neet-PG lol! Study for the university exams from books of good standards,be regular with your readings and you will easily score good! All in all, you get acclamitised to this place slowly! ",
