            "answer_text": "I just finished my freshman year in high school. I felt that high school this year was fun and enjoyable. Whenever I do homework, especially since I had a lot of honors classes and one AP class during my freshman year and when I used to talk with friends, it was fun. High school is a fun time, it is the time for you to challenge yourself, learn new things and apply it to real life and as well as have a social life, talking with friends, etc\u2026 High school transition for current 8th graders depending on your state, may be hard for some people, but even they are capable of succeeding as long as they have the motivation and the desire of working towards getting good grades. I focused a lot on my GPA, extracurricular activities(chess club) and took help when I needed it or when I chose to improve my grade. I am now preparing for the SAT. But my main advice for people who are going to start high school in the upcoming fall is just work hard and do the best you can and join the clubs and sports that interest you and motivate yourself. Also, do not procrastinate, as it will not help in high school or college. Good luck and work hard! ",
