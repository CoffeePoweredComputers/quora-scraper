            "answer_text": "The biology syllabus of 11th and 12th is as easy as it could get. The chapters, irrespective of your board (whether CBSC or State board) are neatly compiled and expressed in simple language. Make sure that you study one chapter of biology a week, solve the questions at the back of the chapter, go through the formulas and don't forget to make good notes, which you can refer to while revising. There are many video tutorials on YouTube which explain all the concepts thoroughly and this is beneficial as visual memories are retained effectively for a longer time. Bozzeman science and Khan academy are trusted channels among the many. 11th and 12th is also the time to prepare for various entrance exams for your graduate college, and most of these entrances are objectives comprising of multiple choice questions. So pay attention to the details and aim for understanding the concept rather than rote learning. Dedicating around 4.5 to 6 hours/wk for biology is sufficient. Do not ignore other subjects like Physics, chemistry and mathematics. *Refer to NCERT books irrespective of your board,for enhancing your knowledge. If you belong to the state board category, refer to the standard state textbook for subjective answers. All the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you pay attention in class, and are aware of what's going on in each topic, half your job ends there. Besides that, writing and studying always helps. (This applies for most subjects.) Make bullet points. Once you're done with a subtopic, go over it in your head once again, briefly, before moving on. You could, again, make bullet points. It doesn't have to be very fancy, but hold on to the sheet/book you use. In my experience, studying sequentially really helps. Once you've gone over a chapter once or twice, even just looking at subheadings will help you recollect what you had studied the previous time (this is when the random points you had made while studying come handy). For Biology, in particular, you can make flow charts for most topics. Do that, and refer to them the next time you study. ",

            "answer_text": "thanks for A2A well\u2026. bio is really interesting\u2026.. and as easy as it could get for 11 and 12 classes. so, all you have to do it is read NCERT. The book is very interesting, neatly compiled and really sufficient and quite rich in providing the knowledge at this level. Read NCERT as many times as you can. It will help you everywhere you go in the world! Literally, in school, competitions, everywhere. some people have written that practice writing but I personally do not really recommend that. I would say read bio, understand the things, the phenomena, how do they happen , the sequences, the steps and really mug up all the scientific terms and other biological terms. Yeah, practice the diagrams for sure. But read read and read as much as you can and just think you have to understand and memorise it in a such a way that you wouldn\u2019t have to take a reference from it, when anyone asks you something or when you solve any question. So you must try to, in a way, trace the book in your mind. PS: Interest in bio is a prerequisite and it is vital. I am emphasising so much on reading it again and again because it will surely benefit you. once you start getting bored reading, thinking that you know everything, still there would be plenty of things you would not know. you know what I mean? This means that you have to go deeper each time you further read it. You must read all the tables, learn the figure, the statements below the figures, the boxes proving additional knowledge and even the summary after the end of each chapter is essential. you would be never tired of exploring new things in this awesome book. every word is important. please ask anything that you don\u2019t understand, from your teacher. Leave no doubt. All the best! ",

First and foremost, you need to be thorough in all the concepts of biology, for both type of exam (specially NCERT). What you have read till 10th was just a trailer of what you will learn in 11th and 12th. If you are done with NCERT completely, then you can further access any helping book. Do the written practice, don\u2019t just mug up things. Diagrams are a must. Practice them regularly. ",
