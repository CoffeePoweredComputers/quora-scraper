            "answer_text": "I tell my kids the truth (nobody knows) whenever this topic or almost any other topic comes up. [I think I sneaked in some inaccuracies about Santa Claus and the tooth fairy] Three year old kids don't usually ask because they are scared of dying. To think this far ahead and see the consequences requires a few more years to develop. Their world view reaches only a few minutes into the past and the future. Anything further requires lots of repetition. So, they really just want to know. They are curious, especially if they see something happen around them. And that's just as it should be, if you think of it. I tell them that nobody knows what happens when you die, but there are some people that were almost dead (heart stopped) who could tell stories of what they have seen. Often it was a tunnel of light etc.. Grandpa (or hamster), many people think, might be up there in the sky, invisible. Others believe he may be reborn as a baby mouse or some other animal.Animals usually die much earlier than people because their heart beats faster. And, yes, so far everything that lives has died. Otherwise the world would run out room for everyone.  For a three year old only a fraction of the above explanation is usually satisfying enough. For older kids, this could turn into a wonderful discussion about differences between living and non living things. Plants, animals, fungi... what lives? What doesn't? Are we sure? etc.. As adults we tend to overthink things. A young child with a normal peaceful childhood has way fewer fears than most adults. And much more interest to understand something that affects them and temporarily catches their attention.  ",

            "answer_text": "In 1982 Sesame Street ran an episode on the death of one of it's cast members, Mr. Hooper. There is a book on this subject: I'll Miss You, Mr HooperLucky for you and me it's online too, in the link provided. It shows how Sesame Street handled the question about death in a way children can understand and relate to. Another thing to remember, as shown by the way Blue's Clues creates their program, is that children don't need answers. They need something to relate to and then the time to generate stories about it themselves. Give your child clues, ask questions and have it travel it's own journey, just as they would by slowly figuring out a favourite pet in Blue's Clues. Make sure he or she does not get confused which easily happens for a three year old.  And if the answer 'I don't know' is what remains, that's ok. Sesame Street's answer was 'Just because'.     ",
