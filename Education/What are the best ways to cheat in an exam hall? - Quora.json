            "answer_text": "The following are fictional events and did not happen to myself or anyone that I associated with.  In high school, a friend and I developed a system that only works with multiple choice tests with less than 60 questions. Every minute to the exact second one of us would:  A - CoughB - Clear throatC - Scratch head D - Put left arm downE - Right arm down And drop your pencil if you weren't sure. So at 11:15 I would cough. At 11:16 he would out his left arm down.  If you both do the same, its most likely correct, if they differ then go with your gut or trust the other person if you were unsure, some answers should differ anyways. We sat at a square table that sat 4 and we were facing each other. It can work better with audible notifications if you are seated across the room. Some others could include kicking the chair, tapping a pencil, shuffling feet, sniffing, etc.  ",
