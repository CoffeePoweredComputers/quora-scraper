            "answer_text": "Okay so I wasn\u2019t at LaGuardia High School when he was there but I would say I know a lil bit of info because of the teachers telling stories and stuff like that. He was 10/10 the class clown. Insanely outgoing from all reports and definitely charming. His alter ego was \u201cTimmy T\u201d, according to all of my drama teachers, and often made raps. Hopefully y\u2019all know about the Ms.Lawton rap he did that went viral. Absolutely hilarious. (She was my math teacher too). Oh and he also did a rap show for Rising Stars, which was the name for our school talent show. Watch it online. Good stuff! Not only was he insanely hilarious but also naturally smart. I can\u2019t confirm this but he probably had a 4.0. Teachers loved him. I mean that\u2019s why they can\u2019t stop talkin about him! He ended up getting into Columbia but dropped out because it wasn\u2019t the direction he wanted to be going. My Drama teacher says that he was always one of the strongest actors in his class which makes sense based on his current fame. Apparently he was pretty popular with the ladies too (obviously not as popular as he is now).He dated Madonnas daughter for a bit. Okay so overall he always been that great.  There\u2019s the man himself. ",

Marc Chalamet was my next door neighbor. There were 15 apartments on the 4th floor. Marc was a writer, correspondent for a French publication. A very nice, pleasant, handsome man. He was not married at the time. When he went out shopping to the Gristedes on the corner, he would knock on my door to see if I needed anything. I would ask; \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Marc Chalamet\u2019s response, always: \u201cMarc, The Frenchman\u201d. I always wanted to tell that story on Quora. Thanks for the opportunity. ",
