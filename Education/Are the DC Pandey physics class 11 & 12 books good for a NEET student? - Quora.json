You can use it because it contains easy - moderate level question( namely Level 1) which is asked in both JEE MAINS & NEET exams as well as tough level question( namely Level 2) for JEE ADVANCED. In this book, all the concepts are written to the point and it has lots of MCQs. It consists in 5 parts namely MECHANICS 1, MECHANICS 2, WAVES & THERMODYNAMICS, ELECTRICITY & MAGNETISM and OPTIC & MODERN PHYSICS. From my point of view, you can take it for practice the problems and if price does not matter. ",
