            "answer_text": "What is percentage? It has taken me almost 50 years to boil it down to something simple that I can remember. First: \u201cper cent\u201d or \u201c%\u201d means literally same as \u201cdivided by 100\u201d. Since they are the same you can write \u201c1/100\u201d instead of \u201c%\u201d or \u201cpercent\u201d anywhere, anytime. Secondly since 100% = 1, you can multiply or divide by \u201c100%\u201d any time, anywhere. So \u201c50 per cent\u201d or \u201c50 %\u201d means \u201c50 divided by 100\u2033 or 50/100 or 0.5 or 1/2. Say you have a fraction, say 0.5 and want to express it as a percentage. If you write % after the 0.5, you must also multiply by 100 to keep the value the same. In other words, to keep your 0.5 the same, you must divide by it 100 and multiply it by 100. That is, multiply it by % and multiply it by 100. So 0.5 equals 0.5 % times 100 or 50%. Also, note that since 100% = 1. So you can multiply any number by 100% without changing it. For example, 0.5 = 0.5 x 100%, or = 50%. You can divide by 100% also because 100% = 1. For example, 50% divided by 100% equals 0.5, because as in fractions the \u201c%\u201d can be crossed out. I use these tricks al the time, otherwise the percent stuff is too confusing. So practice these tricks until you really understand them. Memorize how you can change from percent or to percent this way. Then it will be easy. ",

            "answer_text": " If you want to calculate your percentage [Click Me] Well, when it comes to percentages, the answer is 100% of the time. Wow. All right, maybe not 100% of the time, but a lot. percentages are used every day to calculate things like, well, how much sales tax you pay when you buy something, how much something costs when it's on sale, how much fiber is in your granola bar, or how much money you can make if you invested in the stock market. That's all real-life stuff for sure. So you can see that it's really important to understand percentages and how we use them in All right, then, are you ready to learn the key to understanding percentages or percents, as they're called for short? Drumroll, please? A percent is a fraction. What? That's right, a percent is a fraction. And since you already know all about fractions, learning about percent is going to be easy. But a percent isn't just any old fraction, a percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number, if it's a percent, then no matter what the the top number is, the bottom number will be 100. In fact, because the bottom number of a percent is always 100, we don't even write it. Instead, we use this handy little symbol called the percent sign. Whenever you see this symbol after a number, it means the number is a percent. It's really a fraction with 100 on the bottom, but it's just been written in this more compact form, like this number 15. Here, it's got the percent sign after it so we read it as 15%. And because a percent is really a fraction that always has 100 as the Number, we know that it means the same thing as 15. Over 100. percents make even more sense if you know what the word percent means the prefix of the word per means for each or for every, you know, like if someone said only one cookie per person, and the root word cent is Latin for 100. That's why there are 100 cents and $1. So percent literally means per 100. And that's why there are shortcuts for writing fractions that have 100 as the bottom number. All right. So whenever you see a percent like this, you know it can be replaced with or converted to a fraction. Let's look at a few examples. So you see the pattern. 3% means three over 110% means 10 over 125% means 25 over 175% mean 75 over 100. These are percents and these are the fractions that they stand for. There are a few other interesting percents that we should take a look at. Like this one, zero percent, can you have zero percent? Yes, zero percent would just mean zero over 100. It's what we like to call a zero fraction because its value is just zero. Remember, it's okay to have zero on the top of a fraction, but not the bottom. All right, then, what about 100%? Well, 100% just means 100 over 100. That's what we like to call a whole fraction. The top number is the same as the bottom. So its value is just one whole or one. Okay, then zero percent is just zero, and 100% is just one. But what about numbers bigger than 100? Can you have 126%? Yep, it works exactly the same way. 126% just means 126 over 100. And you know, from the fractions videos, that's what we call an improper fraction. The top number is bigger than the bottom number, so the fraction's value will be greater than one. All right, team. I want you to go out there and give me up Hundred and 10% effort in today's game, but coach, it would be improper for us to give 110% effort in today's game. Okay, so now you know the key to percentages, that they're just special fractions that always have 100 as the bottom number. But there's one more thing that I need to tell you about in this video. And that's decimals. Do you remember in the video about fractions and decimals that you can convert any fraction into a decimal value? Sometimes it was kind of tricky converting to a decimal if we had to divide the top number by the bottom number. But other times like when we had base 10 fractions, it was easy, because decimal number places are made for counting based infractions like 10s, hundreds, and thousands. Well guess what? percents are based on infractions. They're hundredths because their bottom number is always 100. That means it's really easy to rewrite a percentage as a decimal number. You can do it the same way as we did in the base 10 fractions video. For example, we know that 15% is just 15 10 over 100, right? That's its fraction form, but it also has the decimal form 0.15 because this is the hundreds place, and 0.15 means the 1500s. So we can rewrite 15% as a fraction 15 over 100 or as a decimal 0.15. And now that you know why we can easily convert a percentage to a decimal, let me show you a really simple trick for doing it. First, you start with a number in percent form like this 35%. Next, you imagine where the decimal point should be in the number 35. It's not shown but if it was, it would be right here next to the one's place. Now, remember, 35 and 35.0 are the same value. Now that you know where the decimal point is, just move it to number places to the left away from the percent symbol and draw it in right there. Last of all, once you've moved the decimal point, you erase the percent sign because As you don't have a percent anymore, moving the decimal point two places to the left converted it into the decimal value of that percent. Let's try converting a few more percent into their decimal values so you can get the hang of it. For 62%, we move the decimal point two places to the left and get 0.6. Remember, we can put an extra zero in front of the decimal point to be a placeholder. And to make the decimal point easier to notice. For 75%, we move the decimal point and get 0.75. For 99%, we move the decimal point to get 0.99. Pretty cool, huh? Okay, but what about 4%? You might wonder how we can move the decimal point two places over when our number only has one digit, but all we need to do is use a zero as a placeholder in the number place that's missing. Then when we move the decimal point two places over, we ended up with a decimal value of 0.04. Now that makes sense because four is in the hundreds place, and 4% is for over 100. And in the same way, 1% would just be 0.01. Again, we need that extra zero placeholders. Here are a few more interesting examples, zero percent would just be 0.00. And if we have 100%, and we move the decimal point two places to the left, we end up with 1.00. But 1.00 is the same value as one. And that's why 100% represents one hole. And if we have 142%, we move the decimal point to get 1.42. That's a value greater than one, which is what we would expect because 142% is really an improper fraction 142 over 100, its value should be greater than one. All right, so now you know that a percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number, and you know that you can rewrite percents in either their fraction form or their decimal form 25 percent is 25 over 100, or 0.25. But keep in mind that you could go the other way too. If someone gives you a fraction with 100 as the bottom number, you can rewrite it and percent for if you get 12 over 100, you can say that's 12%. And if you get 80 over 100, you can say that's 80%. Or if you get the decimal 0.10, you can say that's 10%. And if you get the decimal 0.38, you can say that's 38%. So that's the key to percentages. There is another way to write fractions and decimals, but there's a lot more to learn about how they're using the map. And we'll learn more about that in the next few videos. But for now, you should be sure that you really understand the basics of percentages by doing the exercises for this section. Thanks for ",
