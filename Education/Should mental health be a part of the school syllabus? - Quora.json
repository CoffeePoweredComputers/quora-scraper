            "answer_text": "I was never educated about mental health in school, and I still haven\u2019t been educated about it. (For reference, I\u2019m in ninth grade right now.) I have struggled with mental health issues for my whole life, mostly without knowing that anything was out of the ordinary. Anything relating to politics, sexuality or mental health was completely taboo at my house, so I received no education regarding any of the issues I was, and still am, fighting with. I had no idea that waking up in the morning and wanting to kill myself was anything other than normal. I had no idea that being unable to speak in social situations was anything other than normal. I had no idea that \u201cfriends\u201d manipulating me and making fun of who I was was anything other than normal. If I had been educated about mental illnesses and disorders, maybe I would have recognized the symptoms in myself earlier, and been able to seek out help earlier. I only found out what anxiety and depression were maybe two years after my first suicide attempt in the fifth grade, from when I was severely depressed, after I researched it on Wikipedia and realized that not everyone felt like me on a daily basis. There was no doubt about it, I had, and still have, depression. I was formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist about a month or two ago. This was caused by the severe bullying I went through at a young age and the years of doing nothing about it. If I had known earlier, I could have saved myself from years of suffering. If I had known earlier, I could have gotten on meds earlier and been able to function properly by now. If I had known earlier, I could have been able to recognize the symptoms I was displaying and done something about it. So what are my opinions on mental health education in schools? I really think that the basics should be taught in school. That would help many kids be able to recognize their symptoms and get the proper help earlier, to save them from a lifetime of suffering and wondering why they are different than everyone else. I have to say though, this isn\u2019t only place where mental health needs to be talked about more. There is a huge stigma against mental health, and there is a whole trend about making fun of mental health right now. Suicide isn\u2019t funny. Anorexia isn\u2019t cool. Anxiety isn\u2019t trendy. Depression isn\u2019t \u201ceasy to get over\u201d. Bipolar Disorder isn\u2019t just having mood swings. Borderline Personality Disorder isn\u2019t just being mysterious or attractive. All of this just contributes to the invalidation of mental illness and disorders in the world right now. And makes people too embarrassed to seek out help for fear of being told they\u2019re just acting \u201cquirky\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d. Maybe if in school people were taught correct and factual information about mental illnesses, people would stop making fun of them, and then the people who need professional help would be able to without feeling ashamed of themselves. I personally hope so. That is why I strive to spread awareness on this website as an advocate for mental health awareness. I just hope that this education will be able to take place in the near future. I\u2019m going to make it happen if no-one else does, no matter what.  Send help. </3 ",

            "answer_text": "YES YES YES. This would\u2019ve helped me so much in school. I used to think that I was weird as hell for having no friends and being afraid to do small things. I had no idea what was wrong with me. It\u2019s also SUPER important because I know, at least from my experience, parents of color don\u2019t acknowledge mental health. A lot them were taught that mental health and therapy is \u201cwhite people shit\u201d. They think depression is laziness, anxiety is a just you being a coward, Dissociative identity disorder is you being batshit crazy. They don\u2019t know DID is caused by trauma. They don\u2019t know having anxiety doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re just shy. Not all of them think this way, but it\u2019s a common occurence. It would help so much. It might even prevent a lot of suicides from children thinking they were crazy and can never be helped. BUT, I don\u2019t think that media should be teaching it. For examples, DID (used to be known as multiple personality disorder) is portrayed HORRIBLY in the media. The movie SPLIT was used in a classroom and I guarantee you 99% or more of those students think that people with DID are serial killers and murderers and rapists. Depression and Suicidal Tendencies are also very glamorized in media. They don\u2019t show how depression can make you not shower for weeks or you\u2019re exhausted all the time, or simply losing passion in your favorite things, or the memory loss. It\u2019s important kids learn the facts instead of what makes a good book or movie or song. ",
