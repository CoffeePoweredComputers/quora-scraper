This university provides cheap education to the students in every corner of the country. There is no age bar for the students to take admission in this university and even jail prisoners can Pursue education through this university. Most importantly the degree awarded by this university is at par with other universities.Some of the educational institutions are excellent and several foreign students come there to pursue higher education such as the IITs, IIMs, ISI,Kolkata etc.",
