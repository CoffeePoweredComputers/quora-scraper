            "answer_text": "Its difficult to take a good stand in Nigeria. To answer this, the payment system will be divided into two, government and private. The government uses great level to determine the income of teachers and not whether he or she teaches in elementary or high school. Another thing is also the level of government that is responsible for the running of the concerned institution. The federal pay more than the state and local government, state government pay more than local government. The payment system in the private institutions is arbitrary and can not be said whether elementary pay more than high schools. For instance, elementary school located in maitama in abuja(federal capital territory) is more likely to pay much more than high school located in a remote area in kano state. ",

I can\u2019t address private, parochial or non-unionized schools. My hat is off to anyone who teaches at the elementary level. You are the ones who set them on the right road, get them excited about learning, and teach them, often, how to be not just students but people with regard for others. It makes no sense to me to pay any teaching level differently. We have different roles but all are equally important. ",

All classroom teachers are paid on the same scale, so an elementary teacher and a secondary teacher with the same degree, service years, pd hours, etc., will make the same amount of money. However, on my state, elementary teachers have a lower average salary than secondary teachers do. Not sure why, elementary teachers have to work more, and have a way harder job (I teach special ed middle schoolers and I wouldn't trade them for elementary kids). ",
