            "answer_text": "I grew up in a community were 20% to 30% of the high school students knew they were not going to college. A couple of them where extremely dedicated high school students because they knew that this was the last time they were going to get a free education that taught them everything. They certainly gravitated towards certain subjects like geometry, woodworking, drafting, and computers, but they also tried to really understand some of the literature we where going to read. One in particular knew he was going to go right into the Marines and really enjoyed reading and discussing books. He told my brother that he wanted to get the most out of high school that he could. With his grades he probably could have gotten a scholarship to a good school too. Secondary Education is important because it provides a broad education to everyone. We already live in a world which evolution, global warming, and basic statistics are doubted and people\u2019s lack of knowledge about other cultures and our own government are used to manipulate them. I feel much better that we have a secondary education system that tries to educate everyone. Imagine how much worse if people did not get to study science, history, and literature. It might not be the best, but it at least offers a panacea against further ignorance. ",

            "answer_text": "As a teacher I was often asked this question, normally as I was passing out assignments. I have always felt that \u201cto go onto college\u201d or \u201cto get a good job,\u201d while valid, are only partial answers. Because those two responses are given elsewhere, I always tried to round out the perspective by stressing the need to simply know as much as you can about the world, and your relationship to it, whether in science, arts, or being able to successfully work with others. Secondary education also begins to prepare you to seek and find answers on your own, and so continue your learning throughout your life. ",
