            "answer_text": "here\u2019s an example: news reports revealed that during a certain week the murder-rate in Dallas TX went up alarmingly compared to that same week historically. in a side story buried in the back pages also showed a significant increase in road repairs during that same week. did the road repairs somehow have an \u201cimpact\u201d on the murder-rate? not likely. that\u2019s an example of a correlation. there was some connection, but probably not a direct impact. what explains the high incident of road repairs. the weather had been unseasonably hot, with record highs for over a week. the hot weather softened the street asphalt and resulted in massive calls for repair of potholes. the hot weather may also have had an impact on the murder-rate, which has been verified by other studies. social studies is careful not to say that there was a direct cause-and-effect relationship because most effects have multiple-causes and it\u2019s hard to say there is a single cause for what happens. it does seem likely, however, that extreme high temperatures had some impact\u2014more than a simple coincidence, but less than a singular cause. the social scientist tries to tease out just how significant the impact might have been.
