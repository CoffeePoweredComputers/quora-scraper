            "answer_text": "AIIMS Bhopal, I say. Not because there\u2019s better education in AIIMS but the facilities there are way much better. AIIMS Bhopal\u2019s infrastructure is better than that of Kota. One of the biggest problem that GMC kota is facing is that its attached hospital is almost 12 kms from the college which is a hectic especially for the girls. Buses are there but they do not provide much of an assistance. If you are a localite then choose Kota otherwise Bhopal is better. I, again, will say that the quality of education here is good but it is lagging behind in terms of infrastructure and facilities. ",
