            "answer_text": "The most important thing to remember is that schools should never, ever be treated like businesses. Corporate ideas shouldn't be working their way into institutions designed to operate to serve the entire community without concern for profit margins. Consequently competition has no place in teacher's pay schemes. No teacher's remuneration should ever be dependent on their colleagues. Schools work because teachers feel like their part of a team and work together for the good of the students. Anything that destroys that sense of team work should be actively discouraged.  Performance based pay is all about competition which is why it's so destructive to a school environment. It's also entirely ineffective when based on student assessment because it assumes teachers are the only variable that affects standardized testing. If you want to know which teachers are good and which teachers aren't, then ask the school leadership team. If the principle, assistant principle, year level coordinators etc are any good, then they know which teachers are doing a great job and which one's aren't. They're fully aware which ones are inspiring kids and producing great lessons and which one's are just coasting and phoning it in. And if they have staff that are just turning up and doing the minimum of work then it's something that they should be taking responsibility for. We're quite quick to blame teachers for uninspired and under-performing students but we should be equally quick to blame leadership for poor teachers. If a teacher is totally unmotivated then it should be up to the leadership to motivate them by moving them into a role that inspires them, dealing with the root cause of their disengagement or giving them a warning that it's not acceptable.  The best way to assess teachers is to free up principals to be leaders in the school. We should reverse the recent trend of turning principals into CEO's who have to spend all day every day behind a desk dealing with paperwork. Education departments should exist to make the life of school leaders easier and not harder and they should spend less time being called away from their school to pointless meetings that only exist to serve bureaucrats in government buildings. A principal should spend the majority of their time with students, teachers and parents and a tiny fraction of their time with anyone else.  Teachers should then have an annual assessment meeting with a leader who knows what they do, understands teaching and understands how the teacher works in their class. They should be able to make it clear if the teacher is under performing and not living up to expectations and if it's clear that they're still not performing to the required standard after sufficient warning then they should be denied an incremental pay increase.  Teachers who do perform to the required standard should receive an incremental pay increase on an annual basis. Teaching is a hard profession and every teacher learns their craft in their first few years on the job, not during their teacher training. Every school's most valuable asset is experienced teachers who are still in the classroom and happy to mentor new teachers and help them along and provide guidance. I think it's only fair that someone who has dedicated thirty years to the teaching profession is paid more than someone who has given thirty days. ",

            "answer_text": "I was just trying to find stuff to understand \u201c Assessment for Teachers\u201d and I am surprised to find nothing significant . I would like to start by answering this question : Learning and assessment is an ongoing process and we should ensure it is part of teacher\u2019s routine . As we keep a check of students learning and development and ensure it with time to time assessment , so is the necessity for teaching fraternity . We need to assess teachers on their knowledge related to subject and teaching pedagogy . We need to assess teachers on their aptitude towards their profession and also emotional quotient . Best way to assess a teacher is : Through time to time tests on subject knowledge , teaching pedagogy ,psychometric , and also skill based .By performance benchmarking against other teachers on various levelsBy seeing their collaboration on various events and platforms where they network with fellow teachers and show remarkable learning curve .By comparative analysis of their behaviour inside and outside the classroom .Assessment of teachers is equally important for their learning and development not only in terms of Salary appraisal but to help them understand their own value and worth . Teachers are an asset for the state , and their assessment will give them a report card for their own improvement and self worth . It will help them place themselves better in the job market too . And definitely school would be in a better position to retain their high valued teachers and encourage the others to achieve their full potential . It would give them better visibility and much needed appreciation for their efforts . Would love to know more ideas on teacher\u2019s assessment . ",
