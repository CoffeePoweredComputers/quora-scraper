            "answer_text": "Generally yes. The standard is that to teach at a particular level, you need credentials at least one level higher than the diploma or degree the student is working toward. Breaking it down: Elementary: bachelor\u2019s degree in elementary education\u2014continuing employment often requires earnibng a master\u2019s.Secondary: bachelor\u2019s degree in education with a cognate in language arts\u2014continuing employment often requires earning a master\u2019s.College technical associate degrees: master\u2019s preferred, bachelor\u2019s with several years of professional experience accepted, some programs require no degree if one is not available (truck driving, culinary)/College bnachelor\u2019s degree programs: master\u2019s in the discipline, or in a close discipline with around 18 hours of graduate courses in the discipline. As noted, graduates with bachelor\u2019s degrees work as teaching assistants but in theory there is a fully qualified faculty member supervising.Master\u2019s degree: PhD, MFA, DD, or other terminal degree.Professional degree (MD, JD, DO, DDS, DVM): professional degree in the field and a record of professional activity. Law professors are expected to publish in legal journals. The best medical schools like doctors who also hold a PhD which further qualifies them as researchers.Doctoral: terminal degree with an established record of research and publication, performance or creative activity, or other related continuing advanced work in the field,In the USA the accrediting agencies permit exceptions in the case of demonstrated excellence in a field (as one assessor put it, we wouldn\u2019t forbid Michael Crichton from teaching creative writing even though his degree was not in English). Elementary and sedcondary schools may employ a teacher without minimum credentials on an \u201cemergency certificate\u201d basis. If a college employs someone without ordinary credentials, the chief academic officer is often required to notify the state board of the instructor\u2019s qualifications and a plan to remediate any deficiencies.

            "answer_text": "That depends on who wants to employ you. Some authorities require certain levels of achievement, so this question cannot be answered as it stands. My first job after qualifying as a schoolmaster was to teach English as a foreign language in a Scandinavian country. At my interview I was not asked what level of competence I had, or even whether I had been trained to teach English. I later learned that 700 or so applicants had put in for the job, but only 17 had been accepted. I was one of the 17. The job was one of the toughest that I can remember over my teaching career. I had no knowledge of the language of the country, and the hours were long. My contract lasted only one year, but I had been offered the job of setting up a Norwegian Office for the teaching of English, but I was so mentally drained that I turned this offer down. But this is just a mild warning for those who seek to teach English: it can be an exhausting job, especially if it happens to be your first one as a teacher, and if you are offered a job where English is not the official language! But having said all this, my experience was offset by the wonderful winter climate, and a chance to visit a boarding school for reindeer herders just inside the Arctic circle, where the daily temperature was minus 35* centigrade. My next job as a teacher of English was in a much warmer climate, in Zambia, and although the teaching was almost as difficult, it was made slightly easier because the official language was English, and used in the education system. Most pupils had a basic knowledge of English. The difficulties of living out in the bush country was offset by being able to visit the Victoria Falls and enjoy the challenges of being rather isolated, with roads being plagued by corrugations or by mud in the various seasons. But there ARE compensations if you choose to teach English, especially if it\u2019s in a foreign country, but it IS an advantage if the inhabitants of the country have some knowledge of English in the first place. Good luck to you! ",
