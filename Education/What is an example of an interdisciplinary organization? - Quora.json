            "answer_text": "With my organization we are actually doing this. It is a similar approach where we look to apply technology on big problems to find solutions to them and build self-sustained businesses based on this. What we do is an 8-week program where we bring mentors and visitors of several disciplines and experts on different fields. Each week is oriented to a different technology (the more \"sciency\" aspect) but at the same time we have entrepreneurship and startup building workshops. This allows the flow of ideas, application of different technologies, learning of basic concepts and ways these are being used or could be used, but also how they can be marketed, the importance of communication for a startup, growth hacking, effective presentation and pitching. Not everybody needs to know all of this in depth, but if you are a startup chances are you have scarce resources so it is good to know some of them. I would say the key for the success of this of course is the people that you are able to get. In our case the participants (they are participants because it is a paid program they assist) come from all over the world and we look to have as much diversity and disciplines as possible. So we look for all kind of engineers, programers, science people, but also business, design, communication, arts, etc. You don't need to actually have a complete control of the developing process but rather develop a structure that is robust enough to guide it through without getting to dead ends, but at the same time flexible enough to iterate and adapt to the process needs. This flexibility plus the heterogeneous crowd will spawn into an organic flow of ideas and interdisciplinary exchange that cannot be fostered in a completely controlled environment. ",
