            "answer_text": "What you\u2019re talking about is the ars vs. techne split. It does go back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, but we still use it today. Art (ars, or Poiesis - Wikipedia) did not originally refer to the fine and performing arts; it referred to any intellectual endeavor that was an end to itself. Arts could have practical applications, like rhetoric\u2019s application to persuasive speech, but the purpose was not to be practical. Similarly, technology (Techne - Wikipedia) did not originally refer to computers, but to doing, making, building; it was all applied. The Greeks absolutely looked down on this sort of thing; it was for the lower classes. This included what we now call fine and performing arts. Of course, nothing is pure, but business trades on being applied; even though in reality you just study business as a business major, there\u2019s the implication that it\u2019s useful. The Greeks thought more highly of things that weren\u2019t useful\u2026 and so do modern Americans. We pretend to not, but we do an absolutely horrid job of it. Andrew Weill is the Quora exception; a successful and brilliant lawyer, he has spoken with love and admiration of his son, a former combat medic who is now a paramedic. I contrast him with other Quorans, whom I will not name but who screech volubly about \u201cwhy is no one going into the trades!?\u201d, but who clearly think that the trades are for other, lesser people. I wish I could claim to be free of this prejudice, but so much of my identity is tied up in intellectual development that, like the Greeks, I mistake it for personal development. I know many amazing people in applied fields of all kinds, and yet I\u2019d be lying if I said I never looked down my nose at those fields (but not the people; that\u2019s not me). However, there\u2019s another side to this: the people who attack the liberal arts (including my field, computer science) because we aren\u2019t applied. If there\u2019s one thing that the fields of the liberal arts all share, it\u2019s a healthy respect for the useless. This is partly because what\u2019s useless today may prove critical tomorrow, but also because knowledge does not need to justify itself. ",

            "answer_text": "For hundreds of years in Europe and America, college was primarily limited to the children of thr entitled wealthy. It\u2019s main purpose was to educate them to be refined elites, and to fulfill their inherited roles of lords and ladies. Course offerings focused on the so called liberal arts such as literature, Latin, French, philosophy, history, and Christian religious studies. Subjects like business, accounting, and anything vocational were considered crass, and beneath these elites. The end of WWII, and the GI bill for returning veterans, who demanded courses that prepared them to get a job. This opened up most universities\u2019 course offerings to include vocationally related majors like engineering, nursing, business administration, and accounting, as opposed to learning how to introduce one in French or pour tea. Unfortunately, remnants of this elitist attitude still exist with many public school counselors, who often direct students towards a liberal arts education, which will leave many of these graduates under or unemployable, except perhaps for becoming a teacher.
