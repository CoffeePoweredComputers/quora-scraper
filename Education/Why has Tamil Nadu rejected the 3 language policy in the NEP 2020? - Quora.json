            "answer_text": "The 3 language formula has been around since 1968. Tell me how many of the Hindi speaking Northern states have learnt a third language. Tell me how many schools or colleges in Hindi speaking Northern states teach a third language, whether it be Bengali, Oriyya, Gujrati, or Marati, or, heaven forbid, a Madraasi language. India is a country made up of many ancient nations. We all have long histories. Till the Britishers took over India, there was no one country called India. Even the great emperor Asoka did not force his dominion to use one language. And if you are one of those, who does not know history, Asoka\u2019s empire did not include the Southern India. We call ourselves a Republic, and have no idea about what a Republic is. Some of us (the very people who clamor for Hindi as the language that should bind all Indians) very proudly talk about all their imaginary Maha Janapadas bullshit!!! What an irony!!! Whether you like it or not, the only language that binds us, you guessed it, is English. Don\u2019t worry, an average Englishman or an American has a tough time understanding your English. The English you speak is your very own. A worthless piece of garbage who sought refuge in my state by name Aurobindo Gosh, never learnt Tamil even after staying there for more than half his life. It is said that piece of garbage knew 30 languages. Such is the level of contempt from all North Indians towards S.Indians. Every Bengali should hang his head in shame for having produced a worthless piece of low-class garbage like Aurobindo Gosh. The primary reason why the Hindian controlled, Central Indian govt pushes for Hindi has to do with the number of MPs from Hindi speaking states. Whereas the Southern states implemented family planning and two children policy, the Hindi speakers went on reproducing the way they always did. And now they have more MPs.!!! This was pointed out by none other than Sashi Tharoor. Don\u2019t tell me Narendar Lodi is not a Hindi speaker. He is a low-class Gujarati Bania, who has no morals or ethics. He will sell India to the Chinese if he can make a good profit. Addendum: From Wikpedia on 3 language policy. C. N. Annadurai, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu during 1967\u20131969, opposed the requirement to learn Hindi in Tamil Nadu, \"What serves to link us with the outside world is certainly capable of rendering the same service inside India as well. To plead for two link languages is like boring a smaller hole in a wall for the kitten while there is a bigger one for the cat. What suits the cat will suit the kitten as well.\" [6] He was willing to adopt the formula in Tamil Nadu only on the condition that all other states of India too would adopt it. [7] Academics have noted the failure of the formula. Harold F. Schiffman, an expert on Dravidian culture at the University of Pennsylvania, observed that the formula \"has been honored in the breach more than in reality\" and that due to the lack of a symbolic national language, there is a tendency \"for English to take over as the instrumental language\" in India. [8] Political scientist Brian Weinstein of Howard University said that \"neither Hindi nor non-Hindi speaking states followed the (1968) directive\". [2] References ",

            "answer_text": "They want only tamil in tamil nadu and also want tamil any where in india . Let us now go with details. It is so pathetic and unfortunate that most of Quora readers don't know d most important point that the great scholar sri annadurai introduced two language formula wide g.o 105 in 1968 giving chance Tamil students to study Tamil and other linguistic minorities like Telugu Kannada Urdu Malayalam to pursue education in respective mother tongue under first part after abolising hindi from curriculam There was no problem from 1968 to 2006 . All the problems raised due to the two language formula the same two language formula being continued bringing a foolish act 13 ,/ 2006 ms.no.21 compelling and enforcing all linguistic students to study only Tamil under part 1 giving no room no chance no opportunity for linguistic minorities students like Telugu Kannada Urdu Malayalam Gujarati etc. to study their mother tongue as first part . no third part in Tamilnadu education system. Discussions with linguistic minorities association continued till 2011 where they brought g.o.44.giving room for students of linguistic to study their mother tongue. 2011. Govt.changed.presuming and assuming that d linguistic minorities students are studying Tamil from 2006 the government instructed and compelled all LM students to write SSLC public examination in 2016 only in Tamil.(the student who is in Ist std in 2006.will appear SSLC exam in 2016) From 2016 every year people are filing cases in the high court of madras and getting permission to write SSLC public examination in the mother tongue. So unfortunate and pathatic in fanatic attitude system. Now casses moved to Three judges bench which extended the permission up to 2022 and still there is no permanent solution for the linguistic minorities students issue. This 2020 education policy is an opportunity to study once mother tongue up to 5th standard . Light modification can be brought without introducing the three language formula in Tamil Nadu. Let the government can modify act 105 and act 13/2006. Allow Tamil students study only Tamil under part1 up to 12th standard and also allowing linguistic minority students to study the respective mother tongue like Telugu Kannada Urdu Malayalam upto 5th standard and can compel enforce linguistic minority students to study Tamil for 50 marks and the mother tongue for 50 marks under part 1 from 6 th std. second part english for hundred marks. Saying that I don't persuade occasion in Tamil is a mistake. At d Same time compelling enforcing to study only Tamil is crime that's what the act 13/ 2006. doing now. Instead of Insisting and persisting Tamilnadu Government to introduce third language formula above same formula can be continued with modifications given. Ready for debate discussion if people saying it is wrong note. Article 350A of our constitution crystall clearly says Which concluded and cinfirm ed by our supreme court 5 judges constitutional full bench Reads IT SHALL BE THE ENDEAVOUR OF EVERY STATE and of every local authority within d state to provide adequate facilities for instruction in d mother tongue at d primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minorities Which is not all followed by TN govt from 2006.after d act 13/2006. Further d same supreme court constitutional full page consisting of five judges categorically answered a question raised by supreme court giving judgement for d question.about medium of instruction saying d student has a right to choose d medium of instruction.
