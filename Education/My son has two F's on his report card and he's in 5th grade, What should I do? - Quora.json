            "answer_text": "You have many good answers already, so I\u2019ll simply list what I see as the most important points: Don\u2019t panic or get angry \u2014 neither will help. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions.Schedule an informational meeting with your child\u2019s teachers to understand what happened (or didn\u2019t).Ask about the courses that were failed. Try to get an idea if there were problems during the whole course, or only in spots, and what those were.Ask more generally about how your child is doing in other courses. He may be having problems across the board; he may simply have problems with something such as math; he may only be succeeding in courses that interest him. You need to get a more complete picture.Ask more generally about how your child seems to be fitting in. Someone alienated or bullied by others may not do well in classes.Think about your own behavior. Have you been saying things or doing things around the home that would make your child afraid to talk to you? Have you properly valued good study habits but not put undue expectations on the child? (No \u201cYou have to study every night or you won\u2019t get into a top college\u201d kinds of pressure.) You want to be encouraging yet reasonable.Have a calm talk with your child. Make it clear that you aren\u2019t going to be angry \u2014 and don\u2019t be. Try to understand why the performance was poor, and why he didn\u2019t talk to you about it sooner. Note the child\u2019s demeanor \u2014 is he resigned, hopeful, fearful? If anything other than hopeful or committed, try to understand why.From the above, come up with some plan that will help your child do better in what comes next. Talk it over with his teachers to be sure they think it is a good idea. Be sure your son is involved in the planning and discussion. Don\u2019t make the involvement temporary or overwhelming. Provide assistance, support, interest, and encouragement on a regular basis. Don\u2019t put all the responsibility on your child\u2019s teachers \u2014 you are still his parent. A few things to note: Your child may have vision problems. That was the age where I first got glasses, and my world was transformed. Suddenly, I could read again, and see what was on the blackboard. It made a huge difference.Your child might have a learning disability such as dyslexia. Be sure to discuss this with the teachers, and possibly arrange for your child to be tested if anyone strongly suspects this is the case.Note that not everyone is good at everything. These grades don\u2019t determine the future, nor are they grades on life. Keep the focus on building, being more positive, and helping your child grow.Above all else, be loving and accepting. No matter what grades he gets, he is your son. He deserves respect and encouragement. Guide him. When necessary, put reasonable restrictions in place. But don\u2019t ever make him feel badly about who he is or what he may not really be able to do. An F in 5th grade won\u2019t determine if your son gets into college (if that is appropriate later), no will it determine if he is happy and successful as an adult. How YOU react to those Fs, and how you treat him will likely make a bigger difference in those outcomes. ",

            "answer_text": "Help him, don't punish him. Talk to him about it without making him feel like a bad kid. Fifth grade is a great time to start digging in to this. Do some research. Talk to his teacher(s), find out why his grades were low. Did he not turn in or complete his assignments, or did he complete them poorly? What are his study habits? Do you see him doing homework at home? Your course of action will vary depending on the answers to these questions and others. If he isn't turning in assignments, but you find them all hiding in his backpack, help him get more organized. Perhaps get him a planner and help him use it. Have him write down every assignment he gets, and when it is due, especially if it isn't the next day. Then you can do planner checks with him every evening. If needed, have him show you each assignment so you know it is complete, and you can check his answers if you want. Then make a checklist of every assignment due the next day to help him remember to turn them in. Have him show you the checked-off list from the day before during the planner check. Make a system that works for both of you. And don't just force him to do homework as soon as he gets home from school. Let him have half an hour to decompress, maybe have a snack and do something fun. Just keep the time limited so that the work gets done. Make a schedule and stick to it together. If he just isn't doing his assignments, then find out why. It could be an organization thing that the ideas in the paragraph above can help. Or maybe he's getting stuck on his assignments, and needs some help. Encourage him to ask for help when he isn't sure about his assignments, rather than struggling silently. Praise him for asking questions, rather than making him feel dumb for needing to. If you're struggling with it, too, maybe invest in a tutor. After all, it's not unusual if he struggles with the same subjects that gave you trouble at his age. Help him to have a study space at home that helps him succeed. Does he need a quiet space where he won't be disturbed while he works? Even if you don't have space to dedicate for that, establish a \u201chomework time\u201d to minimize distractions from electronics, siblings, and even you. Does he work better with music playing? Either have some helpful music playing while he works, or get him some nice headphones to help him block other noise. This can be especially helpful if he has ADHD or something similar. Don't be afraid to find out if he has a learning disorder. Having something like that diagnosed means you can get him the help he needs, it doesn't mean that he's any less of a person because of it. I personally have ADHD, and until I figured out about using music to help me focus, schoolwork was a struggle for me even with medication helping me. I have a friend who has Obsessive Defiance Disorder, which I'd never heard if before I met him. Basically, his first impulse in most situation is to defy what is expected of him. He needed a lot of help to understand and control that reaction. But he's still a wonderful guy. So if you or your son's teacher think that he may have a learning disability, get him the help he needs. It won't change who he is, it will help him show the better side of himself more easily. Work with your son, help him to succeed, and help him want to succeed. Help him understand that he isn't being punished, especially if you need to cut back his TV or computer time so that he does all of his homework. It's not a bad idea to provide small rewards for making improvement week by week, even before his report card comes out, to help establish good habits. Everyone learns differently, so don't hesitate to keep making changes to find a system that works best for both of you. ",
