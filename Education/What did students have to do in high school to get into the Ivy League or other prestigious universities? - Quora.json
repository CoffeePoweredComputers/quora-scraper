            "answer_text": "I studied hard, took AP classes, got great grades, scored high on my standardized tests, and never touched drugs or alcohol. That was all well and good. But what really got me in was being an elite basketball player. If there is a trick to getting into an Ivy League, I\u2019d say it\u2019s to be good enough at a sport that the school wants you but you actually don\u2019t want them. Here\u2019s how it went for me: When I was 17, I was one of the best basketball players in my region. I wasn\u2019t so out of this world that college coaches were offering me money under the table, but I was solid. Solid, and obsessed. My only goal in life was to get a D1 basketball scholarship. Without a scholarship, I was just another schmuck who had wasted thousands of hours practicing left-handed floaters. Without a scholarship, I would end up playing for some podunk D3 school that was recruiting me, like MIT or CalTech. I mean, how could I live with myself? I had minor interest from some good basketball schools, such as Stanford and Berkeley. They said, \u201cYou can be a walk-on,\u201d but I heard, \u201cWe need a new water boy, doesn\u2019t that sound fun?\u201d The Naval Academy, the Air Force, and Tulsa also expressed strong interest and could offer significant financial aid. I blew them all off. I wasn\u2019t about to brave war or Oklahoma.  ^^A generic recruiting letter circa 2004. Now they probably send their Mark Twain quotes via email^^ My picky attitude is less crazy than it seems. You have to be a little delusional to make it as an athlete, especially when you are a 5\u20199 Jewish kid. Irrational confidence goes a long way in athletics. Still, putting all your eggs in the one basket when you are only seventeen is never a wise move. Next thing you know you\u2019re assessing three opportunities \u2014 going to either Harvard, Yale, or Pepperdine University \u2014 and thinking, \u201cI absolutely must go to the local Jesuit school whose only claim to fame is being the setting for a Nickelodeon show starring Britney Spears\u2019s little sister.\u201d Those are the kinds of thoughts you have when you\u2019re physically and emotionally immature. I was making these critical life choices when I was just 18 months older than the child in this picture.  There are late bloomers, and then there was me. I look like a 10-year-old who got lost in the mall and was happy to be found by Lute Olson. I was a sophomore in high school. Unfortunately, there was one hitch in my grand plan to play for the Pepperdine Waves \u2014 they didn\u2019t want me. They only had one scholarship available for my position, and the summer of my junior year I learned that they had offered it to Mike Gerrity. That hurt. I\u2019d battled Mike on the Southern California basketball circuit since 8th grade, and I considered him my arch rival. I loathed him, to a level that had become borderline psychotic. I\u2019m not saying I would have been happy if he had fallen into the lion pit at the zoo and been eaten alive, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been at the funeral. (I should not have felt satisfaction when he transferred three times and was hit with NCAA sanctions his senior year. But I did.) With Pepperdine off the table, I briefly considered going to prep school for a year. Minnesota said they\u2019d make me an offer if I went that route. I was tempted, but that plan didn\u2019t go over well with my parents. They knew Harvard was ready to make me a key player. More importantly, Harvard was basically guaranteeing I would get accepted early admission if I applied. It was like my parents cared more about academics than basketball, which did not compute with me. Eventually, my mom and dad talked some sense into me. Harvard it was. They didn\u2019t offer scholarships, but at least they were D1. I applied and was accepted as an early admit. I thought the personal note from the dean was a nice touch, even if he might have let his four-year-old son write it as practice.   I would soon meet classmates who wanted to swap acceptance stories. They\u2019d talk about how, when they opened their acceptance letter, the world froze, then they cried tears of joy and millions of doves erupted in flight or whatever. I\u2019d pretend I was just as excited when I opened my letter. I left out the part where I threw it to the side, fired up Grand Theft Auto on my PlayStation, and ran over the first digital civilian who looked like Mike Gerrity. ",

            "answer_text": "Before I applied to colleges, I used to read similar posts that had absurd answers, such as being nationally ranked or donating a billion dollars. These types of answers convinced me that I would never be good enough to get into the Ivies or similarly ranked schools. This year, I have been accepted to Harvard, Columbia, Yale, UPenn, Cornell, JHU, Barnard, NYU, Brandeis, BU, etc., and I will be attending Harvard College in the fall to study Regenerative Biology. One of the most important things to do with your application is paint a cohesive picture of yourself to colleges. I am definitely a STEM kid, and participated in some STEM clubs. I also was VP of Model UN for 2 years and participated for 3. Model UN stuck out on my application as not matching the rest of my ECs, so I decided to incorporate it into my Harvard supplemental essay. I wrote about how I first learned about antibiotic resistance in my AP Bio class, how I tested some solutions to it in my research class, and found a specific antibiotic resistance lab at Harvard, where I would continue my research. I tied all of this to my first MUN conference, since my committee was mimicking the World Health Organization with a focus on antibiotic resistance. I think it is important to show why you do what you do, especially after school, and how it relates to your major. This allows more insight to who you are as an individual. If you do know your major, definitely try to find cool opportunities for you to pursue your passion further outside of school. In my town, the community outreach program coordinates a summer internship program for high school students, so I was able to intern at a big biopharma company after my junior year. That summer, I also attended a medical precollege program at Brandeis on a full-tuition scholarship. I applied to these programs for myself, because I wanted to explore different aspects of the medical field. The most important thing you can do to get into an Ivy or any dream school is to be yourself throughout high school, and explore what interests you. A close second is the interview. My interviewer used to work in the admissions office and now works for the alumni network. I made sure to bring a notebook with some key points I wanted to talk about during the interview (my internship, the precollege program, etc). On the other side, I wrote about 7 questions to ask her afterwards, and when it came time for them I asked the best questions first, since I ran out of time to ask them all. She told me that all of my questions were difficult, and that for one of them, she has never been asked that question before. My Harvard interview was unique amongst the others because I talked about family matters and gym class, and for the gym story she said that she got goosebumps. It was such a strange interview, but I told my story truthfully. For questions, ask questions that will have them talk about their time at the school or opinions about it, and always relate their answer back to something that you have experienced. For stats, I have always cared a lot about my grades, so I have a 5.19/5.33 GPA. At my school, the highest GPA is a 5.33, meaning all A+s in honors or AP classes. I could have gotten all A+s in honors classes to boost my GPA since they\u2019re worth the same as AP, but I took AP classes in all MESH subjects both my junior and senior year because I love to learn and wanted to push myself. For junior year, I got a 4 in Biology and a 5 in APUSH, Lang, and Micro-Econ. For senior year, I took 4 APs and self-studied for 2 more. I am a first-gen low-income student, so I applied to 20 colleges with fee waivers. I originally applied Early Decision to Columbia with a 1460 SAT and got deferred. I then used Khan Academy to raise my score to a 1520 (720 R 800 M), which was solely from raising my math score from a 740 to 800. My essay score was a 21/24. I\u2019m glad that I was able to get my SAT score over 1500, but it was nowhere near perfect. Also, I was reading on College Confidential and Reddit while waiting for the ED results to come out, and I saw so many posts about students who got rejected ED from Columbia with 1500s or even 1550s. This scared me because as I told you, I only had a 1460. For my letter of continued interest, I obsessively watched Greg Smith\u2019s video on Youtube. Smith says that you should reach out to a professor at the school, so I did and he invited me to visit his lab at Columbia! I went with my parents and they waited outside. It was a great experience and I got to ask some students in the lab so many questions. That experience got me to fall in love even more with Columbia. Ultimately, I got rejected from 3 schools: Princeton, Brown, and Tufts. These are the applications that I spent the least amount of time on, and the schools that I did not really care about. The admissions offices were able to see that, so I did not get in. Please do not apply to schools if you don\u2019t want to go there, it is just a waste of your time! I applied to these schools because it wasn\u2019t until February/Early March that I realized I would not be happy at these schools. My decision came down to Yale, Harvard, and Columbia. Then, it was between Columbia and Harvard. I have always felt an attachment to Columbia and NYC, but I live near Harvard and used to dream of going there when I was younger. Harvard gave me a great financial aid offer, and for some other reasons I decided on Harvard. The lab I visited at Columbia focused on CRISPR, and Harvard has a major (concentration) that is very similar to genetic engineering, called \u201cHuman Developmental and Regenerative Biology\u201d. Harvard has the best biology program in the country, and has more options in terms of 3 Biology majors that I would be interested in. Good luck, and remember to remain true to yourself. The college process works out for everyone, and you will love whichever school you choose to attend. Don\u2019t forget to prepare for your interviews, and HAVE FUN! If you are doing an EC that does not make you feel fulfilled, try doing something that interests you and makes you happy. ",
