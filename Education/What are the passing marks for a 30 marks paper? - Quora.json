            "answer_text": "It totally depends on your passing percentage criterion. If it's 30% then it will be 9 marks. If it's 40% it means you've to take at least 12 marks to pass that exam. And if 50% or more you better score 15 or more. Example : 30% of 30 = x 30/100 * 30 = x Each Zeroes (numerator) will be cancel out by 100 (denominator). 3*3=x 9=x X=9 (minimum marks when percentage is 30%) Hope you easily understand. All the best of the luck ;) Any suggestions : please do comments as its my first answer. ",

            "answer_text": "As per the general standards followed by most of the institutes, the passing marked are usually 35% or 40%. If you consider 35% then from 30 one should get 10.5 Marks. (35%*30 = 0.35*30) If you consider 40% then from 30 one should get 12 Marks. (40%*30 = 0.4*30) However if this is for some company then keep in mind some companies keep cutoff Marks as high as 60%-70%. Companies keep such high percentage and treat the exam as elimination round. Thanks! ",
