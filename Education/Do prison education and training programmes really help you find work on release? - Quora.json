            "answer_text": "The very serious, EXTREME lack of viable programs is a major component of why the justice system in the USA, I'm talking from 1994, is the revolving door it's known by all to be. From then, in Michigan, and the feds, for over 23 years, they took the college option away (Pell grant), you could personally pay to do a correspondence course, but most don't have, and at $0.23 an hour, never will have that as an option. How far is \u201ccreative writing\u201d or any of the other ridiculously useless classes they have going to take you when you walk out of the door? I went in at 16. Got out, with a ged 8 years later. Did parole for a few months, robbed a couple dealers, graduated to robbing banks and even a couple police stations. And, as is the case more often than not, it ended because my partner shot me when we were leaving a bank we just hit. NOT because some awesome law enforcement agency caught me. Fyi, cops don't stop or solve crimes as a result of their training. 98% of the time someone turns someone else in (or they tell on themselves. Why do people STILL talk to the cops? \u201cAttorney\u201d is the only thing you should ever say to the police. ESPECIALLY when you ar the station.) Sorry for the rant. ",

But by the time a prisoner who has spent a lot of time in high level prisons makes it there it is time for him to go home..People realize this private prisons are all about making money. Pay the guards the lowest amount possible for a dangerous job, Make money off cheap inmate labor and complain about needing more money which when given to them comes out of tax payers. Do you really think the owners such as Corporate Corrections, Maxwell House, and Peposi need more money? ",

I worked my but off and got a 4.0 for that year worth of work. I've used that paper to work as a repair technition, which opened up other opportunities. So for me, yes it helped. ",
