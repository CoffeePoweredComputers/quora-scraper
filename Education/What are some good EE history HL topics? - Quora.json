            "answer_text": "To start, \u201cEE History HL\u201d is not a thing. You\u2019re either writing an History Extended Essay or an History HL IA. Level does not come into play for the former. Since the question mentions EE, I will assume it is about an EE. Anyway, history is broad. What you need to do is narrow it down. Have a specific country you want to study? Start there.Have a social issue you want to look at? Start there.Have a certain economic topic you want to look at? Start there.Just have interest in a specific topic? Start there.I personally did not write a History EE, though I could have taken the topic of my Literature EE and made it one. I had several friends write History EEs, though I can\u2019t remember them all, nor the extent of the topics. Topics that I do remember The rise of obesity and fast food culture in America after WWIIHow the Algerian soccer team helped lead Algeria to indepdenceIvan the Terrible and modernizing RussiaWilliam Wallace and Scottish IndependenceMistreatment of Austrialian natives and impactA certain opera about a Turkish subject (written by a European) and how it reflects orientalist viewsI want to say this was History, not a Music paperAs you can see, topics varied. People chose things that interest them. That\u2019s how you find a topic. You pick a subject you like then narrow it down to a question you can answer in 4000 words. (If this question is about History HL IA, then topics are limited to the history you are studying. For instance, if you\u2019re studying US History, you can\u2019t pick a topic on the Italian Renaissance. Use a similar process.) Although I didn\u2019t write a History EE, when I was picking the literature pieces for my EE, I started with a book a really liked in high school (though I know admit to hating it after writing the EE) and finding a complementary book to write my EE. Good luck.  A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Anything you find interesting. Whatever you find really cool to learn about, Will make a great EE as you\u2019ll be happier writing it. With that being said, it\u2019s helpful to write about a topic or event that has been covered in class, or will be on the exam. Additionally, a famous event/topic will have more resources and information to make use of. I did my history IA on th zoot suit riots, which went pretty well as I loved the topic. ",
