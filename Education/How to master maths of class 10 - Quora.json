            "answer_text": "Maths was my enemy for almost whole of my school life. The subject became a huge hindrance in me getting my high scores. Let me tell you I went about tackling it(my method worked in 2013, I am sure it works even today). Let\u2019s go in steps: I joined a tuition. Cliche, I know. It helped me though. Tuition helped me to allot a specific amount of time to maths everyday. I made it a point to join a tuition which has a small batch size, so that I can easily talk and clarify my doubts with my teacher.Solve all the NCERT questions. I tell this to every student. NCERT textbook is your Bible. Be thorough with all the sums(including examples) of NCERT. When I say solve, I mean take a pen and book, write and solve. DO NOT READ MATHS, PRACTICE IT.When you are practicing maths, keep a thin book with you to write down all the formulae. Make sure you write what each variable stands for. Whenever you have time, go through formulae. If not use it for last minute reference before entering your exam hall.After solving NCERT questions thoroughly, dig up all previous year question papers. Dig previous 10 year\u2019s question paper. Solve them using timer. Make sure you complete your paper( write the answer the way you would write in your exam, with all the steps) in 2.5 hrs. Attempt your co-ordinate geometry and statistics questions also within this 2.5 hours. This will improve your speed.Grab a reference book, I used Together with and R.D.Sharma. Try solving them as much as possible. Approach your tuition of school teacher if you are not able to solve. Please remember, while checking the solutions of solved questions in reference book, there is a chance that your method might be different or your final answer does not match. Don\u2019t fret, books can be wrong at times. Again, approach your teacher.Remember your exam is a written exam and maths is a subject which can have calculation mistakes while writing, hence practice writing.DO NOT use calculator while practicing the questions. Calculate manually. Once you have finished doing the exercise, cross-check using calculator.(A tip) Usually the numbers used in the questions would be such that the calculation becomes easy. Usually you will get a perfect answer within few steps. If you didn\u2019t probably you are using a longer method or your answer is wrong. Crosscheck!(Not applicable for R.D.Sharma\u2019s questions)I am sorry the answer went long, but this is what I did. It seems like a lot but trust me, it is difficult to do. After doing all of this, my marks in 10th was 10.00(CGPA) and in 12th it was 99/100. I am telling you my marks so that you know that the method actually works. I had a group of friends with whom I used to practice and all of them got equally good marks. I hope this helps you. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Maths is a very important subject or we can say that it is a very scoring subject. If you master the maths of class 10 then it would definitely help you in class 11 ( If you would take maths in class 11). Let me tell you what I did to get good marks in maths and what I did wrong during the preparation of maths in class 10. Your concepts should be clear - For mastering maths, your concepts should be crystal clear. Go through NCERT, Youtube videos, etc to understand the concepts.Practice Practice!! - Without daily practice, you cannot master maths. Maths is not a subject to mug up the answers. It needs practice. Practice different types of question from different books ( If you have completed your NCERT)Solve NCERT thoroughly- Ncert should be your first priority. First complete NCERT then go for other books.Never ever rely on NCERT - It may sound absurd but remember you want to MASTER MATHS. You do not want to just pass in the exams. Once you have completed NCERT, go for higher level books like- RD SHARMA, RS AGGARWAL. I Think it is a MUST to solve RD SHARMA or the latter one to master maths. Don\u2019t solve all the questions of RD SHARMA but at least solve the solved examples and few questions from HOTS ( High Order Thinking Skills).Solve about 20 previous years question paper - Solving previous year question paper will help you to know that what type of questions are asked mostly every year. Try to solve it in 3 hours as this is the time you are given in your exams.Never leave the weak chapters - Never leave the chapters which you find hard and you are weak in it. Give more time and solve more questions from that chapter.Enjoy maths - Never take maths as a burden. If you solve maths reluctantly than you will never be able to get good marks in maths. ENJOY the essence of maths.Remember that you want to master maths. Give your Hundred percent and score well in maths. Always Remember:- \u201c If You Can Dream It, You Can Achieve It\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I used to suck at this particular subject until class 9. I literally used to fail each year in Mathematics and hated the subject because I used to find it difficult to understand. Thereafter, I took private classes from a someone who was 3 years elder to me. Since then, my perspective towards the subject and also my marks in it drastically improved. I realized that I did not know the basic concepts of maths that could help me understand the problems. So, first I made that clear which should be your first step. There is a reason why we do sums in a particular manner. There is a reason behind most of the formulas. Try to understand that, instead of mugging up all the formulas. Read the Introduction provided for each chapter. It will help you understand a particular chapter. Then, practice. All the sums from the book that you follow in your school. The exercises. The test sums. The examples. Everything. DO NOT GO FOR SELECTIVE STUDY & DO NOT TRY TO STUDY EVERYTHING ON THE DAY BEFORE YOUR EXAMS. Yes. You read it right. I have seen students worried about the subject only before the exams. In-spite of taking tutions, they pay the least interest in the subject throughout the year. Study for the subject at least half an hour a day (Minimum). Focus more on weak chapters. Ask your friends and teachers for sums which you are unable to understand. Try working on the sums alone. PUT APPROPRIATE EFFORT AND SEE THE CHANGE. If I can score good in the subject, anybody can. I REPEAT, ANYBODY CAN. ",

This will make sure you stay in touch with the concepts.Practice writing down the steps you take for solving a question as the process also gains marks.Do not skip any topic, complete the syllabus thoroughly.Feel free to think out your answers on rough paper. It helps in understanding the question quicker and you can use a column in your answer sheet for rough work during exams.Pay attention to details, a single misplaced decimal sign or - or + can lead to an incorrect answer in questions you otherwise know.Always write out questions even if you know them mentally, writing helps improve your answering style.Practice answering previous year papers and sample papers within the time limits of the official exam.Definitely practice the last 5 year question papers.Identify trends in the question paper.Identify your weak areas, where you are unable to answer and where you answer incorrectly.Increase your speed in answering so you are able to complete the exam and have some time for revision during the exam.Create a study schedule and focus on studying and practicing weak areas and doing a few practice questions in areas you are comfortable in.With theorems and concepts remember to understand the applications thoroughly.Keep your formulae/concept list with you and read it at least 3 times a day.Long answer questions are scoring and generally come from algebra geometry, mensuration and trigonometry, so prepare accordingly.Hope this helps!!! Good Luck!!! ",

            "answer_text": "First dont take maths as a burden.. Best way to learn maths is simply nothing but enjoying it.. Now there are certain steps you need to follow.. First of all Buy an RS Aggarwal and follow it by heart and faith.. because I think it has more basic questions as compared to NCERT and it gets your level to the height which is needed.. Solving Questions, understanding concepts is one thing but remembering formulas is another.. Some say that just note down the formulas in separate page nd blah blah.. you can do that but it gives a feel of burden.. isnt it.. remember you dnt need to take this thing as a burden.. So my way is a bit different but it is effective.. Theres nthng much to do, just get some basic questions say 5\u201310 or 15 based on that formula.. now start solving them one by one, keeping the formula beside.. now for first question see the formula and solve it.. repeat this for second and third.. then try not looking at the formula and writing that on your own.. if you feel you dnt remember just have a look at that.. continue this process and after few attempts you will realise that you have learned the formula.. now the key here is to choose the questions wisely.. so keep the first 3 questions purely basic.. and then let the question rise its level.. so that you can practice, learn the use and remember the formula at the same time.. Once you do this.. then that seperate paper with all formula thing will come in play in the form of revision.. Just follow these with your heart, have faith and trust yourself.. Hope you do the best.. ",

Firstly you have to give some of your study time to maths daily because it's really a scoring subject. Probably maths is divided into three important categories,i.e. Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry.You must study this subject as per the weight age.Don't avoid Trigonometry. While studying,please don't focus on only one subject. You must be thorough in topics like Graph, statistics and geometric construction. Remember one thing, while doing construction label all necessary points.Practice at least one, of all type before the exam. Start preparing from minimum marks to maximum marks.Take a look at marking sceme. If you go according to marking sceme it will be really a great help. HOTS(high order thinking skills) questions -This type of questions plays prominent roll in your exam because they have maximum marksize. If you want to score maximum score you must practice it effectively.

Solving will provide you an idea on where you are going wrong and how could you improve on them.Many a times students tend to mug up the questions, mainly the theorems, which is not good preparation. You should never learn and mug up any question or theorem. Frequent testing- Attempt same pattern of questions and decipher the technique applied to solve those. This will give you a clearer understanding of the subject.Look for new questions on the similar context from Previous Year Question paper, Sample paper and other Model test paper. This will also help you gain confidence for the exam. Make a timetable- You should always time yourself while answering the sample papers as it will help you manage time during the exam.Revise as many times as you can. Also, try and finish chapters which you find easy to understand as it will boost your confidence. Devote less time to the chapters you are comfortable with. While preparing, mark the questions and topics that you find difficult. And, devote more time to these trouble areas instead of procrastinating or avoiding them. Important formulae and definitions- Every chapter of mathematics contains certain formulae and definitions that every student is expected to know. Prior to learning any formula, read the definition related to it and make sure that you have understood the definition.While studying, mark the formulae that you find are difficult to derive and revise these formulae again and again to make sure that these are on your fingertips. Regularity- Another important factor is the regularity of practice. There\u2019s no doubt that all the subjects are equally important and you must spend a significant amount of time on each. But ensure that your timetable takes care of mathematics on a regular basis. more infomation visit edukeha site it help you more ",
