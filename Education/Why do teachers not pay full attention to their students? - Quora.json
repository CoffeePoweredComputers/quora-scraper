            "answer_text": "I\u2019d love to but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m human. I\u2019m not omnipotent, I\u2019m not omnipresent, I\u2019m certainly not all powerful. I can either pay full attention to one student while ignoring all the others or I can pay some attention to all of them, muting the details of what is going on. When I\u2019ve got an opportunity to discuss things one on one, I give about 90% of my attention to the one student, however, I\u2019m using my periphery to ensure the other students are safe and working productively. When I\u2019m dealing with the entire class I\u2019m giving the whole group 90% of my attention, while focusing 10% on that one student who was upset this morning and might need extra help them moment I\u2019m finished speaking. In my \u201coffscreen\u201d processes, I am also thinking of my family, whether my daughter is well, that I need to speak for my mother tomorrow for her birthday, that gas is expensive but I need to fill up my car, whether the meeting this afternoon will be cancelled as grades are due in and how long it is going to take to drive home because there are roadworks and a delay might mean dinner doesn\u2019t get cooked on time. I\u2019m not even as busy as some other teachers, but that\u2019s what\u2019s going on all the time. If I haven\u2019t slept well, my focus might be a little less than razor edge sharp. Sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do students not pay full attention to their teachers? Is the more pertinent question!. You walk, as a teacher into a classroom full of noisy, undisciplined students. You have planned the lesson and the amount of work you want to cover in the time. Very few have the right books ready. Some are throwing bits of paper at one another, some call out - seemingly wanting attention. You take a roll call. Eliminating the Donald Ducks and Elvis Presley, you try to make a start. 7 minutes of the precious time has passed. M\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6 is still not ready, he explains he's left his books in his locker, can he go and get them?. You pay attention to him, yes. Someone else says you have their exercise book, they didn't get it back as they were absent last lesson. Fortunate you have it. Are you getting the idea? Teachers try, it would help if students did too. ",
