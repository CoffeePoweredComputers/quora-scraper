            "answer_text": "Deep breath. Long answer coming. What are your goals for your legal career?Where do you want to work?Having answered those questions (with probably no data), and moving to the actual selection of a particular law school: Every law school is different. Each has strengths and weaknesses, different philosophies of legal education, connections to different parts of the legal communities in which it operates (local, regional, national, international, public, private, non-profit, corporate, etc.)Each has its own academic standards. Do not imagine that by some magical thinking that you will be able to get into a top tier law school with a very low GPA and a dreadful LSAT score unless a family member is willing to donate millions of dollars to the school.Each will offer a different financial aid package. Go to the best law school you can afford that has a mission and goals in line with your values.It is your job to learn about as many schools as you can, visit as many as you can, talk to students, staff, faculty and alumni, and then make your own decision.
