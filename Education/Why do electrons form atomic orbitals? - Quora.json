            "answer_text": "First, orbitals are our way of describing what is going on, it's not something that is fundamental.  Orbitals are simply a useful approximation, but you could imagine that some alien species of quantum mechanics, would not use the concept of orbitals. With that prelude, orbitals are a useful concept and approximation that results from the spherical symmetry of the Coulomb potential.  The Coulomb potential is of the form[math] V(r) \\sim \\frac{ q_1 q_2}{ r}[/math]and the thing to notice is that this only depends on the distance between the two charges and not on the orientation of the two.  In other words, there is a spherical shell around the charge where the electric potential energy is the same.  What that means is angular momentum is a \"good\" quantum number -- which means that each state of the Coulomb potential will have a well-defined angular momentum. This immediately implies that each state that has angular momentum l, has (2l+1) states -- when you fold in the electron's 2 spin states, you double this number.  These are the orbitals. There are second order effects which cause orbitals to like to be filled, which increases the conceptual usefulness of the concept of orbitals.  All of this is a bit fortuitous, because the electron-elecron could ruin much of this entire picture of orbitals being a \"thing\". ",

            "answer_text": "Electrons do not form atomic orbitals \u2026 it is the combination of electrons and protons that form atomic orbitals. They do this because opposite charges attract, but electrons can have excess kinetic energy relative to the protons that stop them from falling into the nucleus. This is similar, but not the same as, the way planets form orbits about a star. ",
