            "answer_text": "Yes, the reservation system is justified. I don't approve of the reservation for the Marathas though. Basically, the reason behind reservation is that certain disadvantaged groups get a push to make them competent with the groups that don't have any inherent disadvantage. These not only include backward castes, but also financially backward people. I think you will agree on the need for reservation based on the financial condition. We also need the reservation for backward castes. WHY?Reservation is needed because these people need a push to get into some institution, otherwise they simply won't bother to aim for something. This will have repercussions, in the sense that, only a small group of elite people will be having access to education, or will hold high posts in the government. If this cycle goes on, it will again lead to the same problem of having only a small group of citizens holding important posts, leading lavish lives and having power and influence. This will create a huge disparity in society. It will lead to a dystopian society as described in The Hunger Games, with a few elite people controlling most of the resources.  You can even say that Naxalism originated precisely due to this very reason. The rich and middle classes exploited the poor. This went on till some time, until in 1967 when the first Naxalite uprising occurred. Unless disparity in society is controlled, peace cannot be achieved. Reservation simply means we are competing with people who have the same facilities as us and are not burdened with myriad social problems.   You may argue against this, that there are a lot of rich people in the backward castes today and so reservation is unnecessary.This may seem true, but the people from backward castes who are rich represent only a small minority of the total population of the backward castes. Also, it is precisely for this reason that there is a provision for excluding people who fail to provide a Non-Creamy layer certificate stating that their income is below so-and-so level. Also, in a country where people were exploited by their caste till recently and in some places are still exploited, it is our moral obligation to do all that is possible to make them go ahead. There is a philosophical reason behind this too. If a certain section has been disadvantaged and exploited, it is natural, for that section to rise against oppression and demand privileges. The living conditions of these people are appalling especially in villages. For example, in a village near Dhule, Maharashtra, there was a slight famine recently. People didn't have much food for their families. Even farm animals were dying. Needless to say, the condition of people from backward castes was even worse. In those days, they were so hungry, that when a dead buffalo or cow was thrown away, the whole family would feast on the remains of the dead animal for 5 days. If such is the condition of people in modern India, don't you think they need a system which will help them atleast get on par with other people living in luxury?   People are also understandably against reservation in education. A common argument is, that why should there be reservation when merit would suffice. I would like to present my case with some statistics.  Only around 10% - 15% of the Indian population aged 17 and older acquires a college degree. Most of these people are from good backgrounds with relatively little financial problems. And out of these, a small minority graduate from an institute of repute. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that those who get a college degree belong to the creamy layer of society. The really disadvantaged cannot dream of a good school education, forget even a shady college education.  Upper caste people will always have an upper hand in education. This is because of the following reasons: There is a high probability that their parents are educated and hence education is encouraged.Financial problems are relatively non-existent in comparison with lower caste people.Even if financial problems are present, children are not made to earn money.These people can afford to buy books, join classes and travel on bikes for the purpose of education.The lower caste people face the following hurdles: Their parents are mostly uneducated, therefore education is taken lightly. Even if parents are ready to educate, they face hurdles like not knowing which stream to take, which stream is good for a career or what type of profile to build for a job.Financial problems rule the roost. This is the biggest problem. There isn't enough money for books, forget tuitions or bikes.Children think that education is privilege not a right. This mentality makes them think earning money is more important than getting educated.Now, I hope I have convinced you of the necessity of reservation. On another note, there is a notion that reservation is not useful or it amounts to spoon feeding and undermines the quality of education. I want to say that this is not true. Many Ivy league universities around the world have a program known as the Affirmative Action Program. It is akin to reservation in India, except that it is for Blacks. In a study it was proved, that Blacks who entered these elite institutions with lower grades than their white counterparts, achieved notable success after graduation. They also earned advanced degrees at the same rate as their white counterparts.This is the same argument I would like to put forward for the quality of education. On an ending note, I want to say, reservation is not THE solution, it is one of many solutions. But reservation cannot be dispensed away with. Hope this clears your doubt. ",

            "answer_text": "Reservation in India has prevailed since we got Independence. It has been there for more than 60 years and was first introduced in the year 1951 by the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The term reservation, according to the Cambridge Dictionary, means \"an arrangement in which something such as a seat or a table, etc is kept for you.\" If we talk about the same in the context of education, it means keeping aside a fixed percentage or ratio of seats in schools, colleges and universities for students of a particular caste or section of society. Reservation in India was introduced with the idea of upliftment of the backward classes after Independence. These sections of the society were not able to enjoy their basic human rights because of which it became necessary to provide them with a reservation at that time. Reservation was introduced for a period of ten years, from 1951 to 1961. During these ten years, the government was responsible for the upliftment of backward classes and also had to bring them on par with the other sections of the society. India's growth has been continuously hampered because of our nation's Reservation policies. The deserved are not getting the chance to prove themselves even though they may be better qualified than someone who got a chance because of reservation. Reservation has always favoured the reserved and not the merit. Further, reservation also creates a gap amongst people. It creates a feeling of dissatisfaction among people who belong to general category as they are not given the same treatment and criteria of selection as to those of reserved class and this upsets them as they have to work harder than the reserved class. Thus, Reservation promotes caste system as well. Another reason to remove the reservation from education is that it does not give a fair and equal chance to all students. Thus, instead of selecting students based on their merit, majority seats in colleges are filled by those students who belong to the reserved category. This is mistreatment of those students who are refused seats even though they might have had scored better than a student who got admission through reservation. The majority of these reserved seats are filled by those students who do not require a reservation and are financially well off. For example, some backward section families who are financially well off now. In many cases, the students who require reservation are not allowed to go to schools/colleges by their parents as they believe that this is just a waste of time and that their child should instead work with them so that the family can earn some extra money. Thus, parents take their child to work with them instead of sending the child to a school or college. One such example is of the maid who comes in our society to work. She has a child who is just 11 years old but still accompanies his mother every day to work. Another very important and usually an unnoticed point is that these backward classes have time and time again have asked for reservations rather than for their upliftment. Instead of providing reservations, the government should instead provide educational scholarships and grants and other forms of aids (financial), as these are a much better option than providing reservation. If such grants and scholarships are provided, they would result in the upliftment of these backward classes. We can understand this through an example of a group of kids who are trying to jump and one kid is not able to jump as high as the others to reach a shelf (where sweets are kept). What if the kid who cannot jump was given sweets without jumping? Would that child ever be motivated to try to jump? What should be done is to train the weak kid and finally make them capable of jumping. What reservation is doing is to make the weak kid want to cling to their \u2018weak' tag so that they can get stuff easily. Caste-based reservations are misused by the \u2018creamy layer' of backward classes because this layer has access to better coaching, education in good schools etc and are at the same level as of general category but still get the benefits of reservation as they were considered backwards in earlier times. Therefore, even though these classes are no more backwards and don't require a reservation, they are given reservations just because they were backwards in the past. The best example is the \u2018Dalit' who don't require a reservation but still get it and, in the process, prevent the really underprivileged backward students from getting the benefits of reservation. The most prominent example is the 2017 IAS topper who is the daughter of two gazetted rank govt/PSU officers could hardly be called socially backward or under-privileged. Yet she used her Scheduled Caste reservation to grab an IAS seat denying it to a truly underprivileged SC candidate. Another disadvantage of reservation is that it causes a Disparity among students. Knowledgeable and deserving students are not able to avail the opportunity in education, whereas students who couldn't make it to the merit but belong to one of these backward classes are enjoying the opportunities given to them to study in top colleges. Thus, even though these students are not as qualified as those students whose name was on the merit list, they get the chance to study in the colleges of their choice. The average statistics of students studying and applying for higher education says that the reserved category like SC and ST should have 40% to qualify for higher education while general category students require a minimum of 80 per cent to have a chance of getting into a good college. The difference is double, and this is not only affecting the education system, but also affecting the mindset of students living in society. Those students who belong to the general category and are average in studies believe that there is no point in working hard as the seats in good colleges would either be taken by students scoring very good marks or/and by students of the reserved category and thus this thought holds them back from working harder. The entrance exam fees are also categorized in various colleges because of the reservation system. Usually this the case in government colleges where reservation quota is also high as compared to private colleges. Almost every student of the backward class and lower middle class prefers to go these government colleges (as the fees are comparatively low compared to private institutions), and this category comprises of the majority of Indian population going to colleges. Thus, when the general category students go to government colleges, they realise that it is very hard for them to get in because of reservation and, on the other hand, if they try to get into private colleges, they are unable to do so as the fees is very high. Thus, even though these students would have scored good in their exams, they are unable to get into government colleges or private colleges. These general category students' economic considerations are not taken into consideration while giving or refusing them admissions and this needs to change. If the reservation is removed, it would help in considering all students at the same level and students who are not able to pay the fee of private colleges and also not enter government colleges because of reservation will be able to get admission in the government universities. Also, because of this discrepancy, majority of the people have a common view that reservation system should be eliminated and students should be given a chance to secure a seat in colleges and pursue higher education based on their hard-work. As per AISHE- All India Survey on Higher Education- Report 2016-17, total 3,45,84,781 students were enrolled in Indian higher education institutions last year, and out of that, a total of 52.56% students were from reserved categories (SC, ST, OBC) and the remaining 47.44% belonged to the General category. These statistics are proof of how the General category students are getting affected and getting deprived of the opportunities they should get. The survey over admissions of students for the past 5 years says that student enrollment in General category has significantly decreased from 53.2% in 2011-12 to 47.4% in 2015-16. Also, on the other hand, student enrollment across SC, ST, and OBC categories has increased over the past 5 years. If one is competent enough, the person can get admitted into universities through his merit rather than through reservation. I completely agree to the point that these backward classes should be allowed to get a scholarship based on their merit. If students are given scholarships in universities based on merit, more students will be encouraged to score better because of various financial incentives. This will increase the level of knowledge and education in the country while, on the other hand, reservation will decrease over time. Thus, even if reservation exists, it should be given after considering factors such as Wealth, Income, and Occupation. This will help identify the genuinely needy people as in the present scenario it is the economically sound people who are making the most use of these reserved seats, in the process, making reservation a total failure. For example, though the Gujarati's and Sindhi's don't require any kind of reservation, they are given reservation in colleges such as Mithibai and HR in Mumbai. It is because of this reservation, many capable students are not able to get admissions in their choice of college and hence decide to leave India and apply into foreign universities. This has led to a lot of brain drain because we are losing out on these sharp minds and this will continue to happen unless reservation is removed from the education system. Also, instead of keeping aside a fixed number of seats as reserved in colleges, the Government should try and increase the amount spent on public schools and colleges so that the level of education can increase. This will help in bringing the backward class at par with the general category so that they can compete with them in entrance exams of colleges. Thus, instead of increasing reservation and making the backward class further ineffective, the government should rather focus on increasing the level of education. If there is no reservation, every person who becomes successful would have achieved that because of hard work and merit rather than because of reservation. Therefore, the achievements of all would be appreciated irrespective of his caste, gender or social status. If we Indians still need a reservation, it means that the government as well as we the people have failed to make all sections of the society equal and what was supposed to be a plan for just ten years is still being required to bring different classes together and at par. If even today some sections are considered backwards and require a reservation, that means the government has failed to eradicate the biggest problem because of which many riots have taken place till date. If we consider the pros and cons of reservation, they look more or less equal. The major pro is that it helps in uplifting backward class who are otherwise are considered untouchable and not given admissions. At the same time, the major disadvantage is that the people of other classes suffer because of this reservation and majority of the times, the students getting admission because of reservation don't know the value of the seat which they received. Thus, after evaluating all the pros and cons, I would like to conclude that caste-based reservation has caused a downgrade of many students and needs to be removed from the Indian Education System.
