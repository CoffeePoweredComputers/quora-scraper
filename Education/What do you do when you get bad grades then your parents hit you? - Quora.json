            "answer_text": "You get worse grades! Right? Seriously, why would an adult physically harm their offspring, their legacy, for bringing home crap grades? If this is a huge \u201cAha\u201d moment for them, then somebody such as your grandparent needs to thump them upside the head and ask what they\u2019ve been doing all semester that kept them from monitoring your school work. Most schools are super tech-savvy. Parents can check daily grades and daily homework. There\u2019s quite a lot of school-parent communication for which the impetus has been the so-called No Child Left Behind Act. So really, parents have no excuse when it comes to monitoring the educational progress of their kids. i have to ask, though: If you knew your grades were lousy, why didn\u2019t you tell your parents yourself, before report cards came home? If the switch is coming down that hard, then you must tell someone you trust. And the two of you, together, must find help. Call Social Services, Children, Youth and Families, or whatever name Child Protective Services goes by where you live. But it\u2019s essential to have a trusted friend or adult as a witness in every encounter with authorities, for your protection. Your safety is more important than any grade, than any parent\u2019s feelings. Please, please tell someone if you are being physically, emotionally, verbally, or in any other way, abused. Your community will have a local phone number, or call the National child abuse hotline: 1 (800) 4 A Child. Hugs, Darling. Love is not contingent on your grades! My heart is with you today. Please get help if you are in an abusive situation. Your parents can learn better ways to deal with a D in Algebra, trust me! But it\u2019s critical that you tell someone you trust, and make the phone call together. ",

By LAW- they have to call the police and report your parents\u2026meaning You MAY be sent to live with someone else for a while until your parents get counseling\u2026 AND IF you are not telling the truth about getting beat- YOU can go to Juvie for filing a false report.
