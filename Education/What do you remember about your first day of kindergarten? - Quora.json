            "answer_text": "My very best friend in the whole world and I were standing next to our moms,who were best friends till the day they died,as very old women I might add. Back in those days I guess a doctor and nurse came right to the kindergarten and administered the set of vaccinations that,is the one on the upper arm leaving a circle scar for the rest of your life. Karen got the shot first and burst out crying,big giant crocodile tears. I got my shot and screamed a high pitched squeal and started crying. All at once I looked at Karen's twisted expression while she cried and started laughing and laughing! She suddenly stopped looked at me with wide full of water eyes and burst out laughing. It was an extremely painful set of 5 shots at once I think. But we cry laughed for about 10 minutes In those days,the mid 50\u2019s they handed you a Tootsie Pop your choice of color! Big Tootsies not like the half size like today. I chose purple. To this day purple is my very favorite color. So I remember karen and me laugh crying! And of course all the other parts of this story.

            "answer_text": "On the very first day of Kindergarten, my best pal Scotty and I were throwing sand at each other in the sandbox. A girl named Kathy wandered into the area where we were in the middle of our \u201cbattle\u201d and soon she was also covered with sand. We simple thought of it as collateral damage, but it seemed she didn\u2019t find our behavior amusing. We were sent to the Principal\u2019s office and our moms had to come to the school where we received a stern warning about continued poor behavior. Throwing sand was certainly not the most ridiculous shenanigan that Scotty and I ever engaged in over the years; that list is really long and sometimes mind boggling, but it does stand as the first time we ever got in trouble together. It wasn\u2019t the last. ",
