            "answer_text": "What can I learn from having been involved in drugs? That everything we do in our lives comes with a cost. Sometimes the cost is very little and sometimes it can be monumental if you have to pay for it with your life. I am paying the cost everyday because of my use of drugs and it will never end until I die. From having to deal with my addiction and praying that I will never use drugs or alcohol again, to having to deal with all of my health problems because of my addiction. I have had open heart surgery, an aortic aneurysm, diabetes, circulation problems, fibromyalgia, nyropopathy symptoms, sleep disorders, and my coroted artery on my right side is 100 percent blocked, along with most recently diagnosed with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. I know that all of these are directly linked to my use of cocaine, opiates, meth, marijuana, barbiturates and alcohol and let's not forget cigarettes. So what have I learned from being involved with drugs? Apparently to little and to late for me to start over again, but it am still alive and kicking and I thank God that I still have time to live and atone for the mistakes that I have made in my life. For today I choose not to use and live a better life than I have been, and not worry about tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "What I learned the most is to just enjoy the little things in life, the simple things. Waking up and not needing a drug, physically needing it. Waking up and not even thinking about it, just get up and start your day and be productive throughout the day without a substance. Not missing family events, or hanging out with friends, or any other thing that you'd really actually like to do but you havent had anything today and feel like you have the flu so your not leaving the bed. I learned to love myself again, addiction will absolutely destroy you. It eats you up and spits you out with no remorse, it makes you hate yourself because your a slave to a drug. It makes you appreciate just being \u201cnormal\" and having any bit of normalcy in your life. But after you pick yourself up again and gather what's left of your life you begin to love yourself again and realize that you are strong, and you are capable and you are worth it. That's the biggest lesson I learned from being involved with drugs. ",
