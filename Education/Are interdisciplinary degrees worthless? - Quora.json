            "answer_text": "It would really depend on how you construct your interdisciplinary program. Like with a computer program: Junk in, junk out. But, if you put the right combinations together, you can get a lot of flexibility that most people won\u2019t have that will allow you to pick jobs. I lucked out by NOT getting into my originally preferred, narrow field!. Chemical engineering is inherently interdisciplinary (chemistry, physics, electronics, some civil & mechanical engineering courses, economics). Those fields connected me to many other fields. So, when I wanted to shift to public health and sanitary engineering (another interdisciplinary field with hydro-geology, political science, and applied anthropology), it was easy. Over time, I shifted into environmental management (another interdisciplinary field with quasi-legal work and touching many environmental sub-fields). I moved from research on commercial explosives to being a WHO sanitary engineer advisor to chief of environmental branch at two major Army commands, to senior fellow at a policy institute. In retirement, I\u2019m able to enjoy geology and anthropology/archaeology! Now, science stuff might not be your thing. That\u2019s okay. Whatever program you design, just do not let someone push you into a box that is too small for your mind - keep some flexibility for later growth. I don\u2019t know what universities might \u201csell\u201d as \u201cinterdisciplinary programs\u201d. Radha P. might be correct for pre-packaged programs. I can\u2019t say. Sarah Lee seems to have been lucky, too. You need to pick the central part that feels comfortable and potentially successful for your innate abilities, then add other coursework around it to make it interdisciplinary. A person interested in finance might add some science (to be able to understand project proposal jargon), political science (to be able to link how society works to the intricacies of $s), and maybe law (to be able grasp what legal eagles are saying in their fine print). As an engineer, three of the most valuable courses I ever took were Elementary Economics in undergrad school and Bureaucracy and Applied Anthropology in grad school! That latter one probably was key to my getting the WHO job, and I used the insights from it very frequently. Along the way, I discovered that learning how to \u201cfollow the money\u201d is extremely important, if yo want to progress in an organization. The details must be learned IN EACH organization. May you be very successful in evaluating yourself and designing a program to fit you. ",

            "answer_text": "No, my major is human services is interdisciplinary. I did the mental health track thinking I would be a social worker. While I was in college, I worked with kids ages 5 and under, high school students, and college students. After college, I again worked with elementary and junior high kids. I didn\u2019t apply for graduate school because my GPA is 2.66 and minimum require is 3.0. It helps me understand domestic violence because I had a friend who was in an abusive relationship. My family were refugees from Cambodia so my class was Immigrants and refugees is useful. I read refugees from other countries as well. I took sociology of families and they are other typical nuclear family. Human services draws from a wide range of social services fields of psychology, sociology, government, and history. I actually started college with biology and then I switched it to business so I feel that my bachelor\u2019s degree in human services and general education is super disciplinary. I also worked in an automobiles market research company, Macy\u2019s (three times), a biotech company, a government agency that helps people register to vote, and now a restaurant. ",
