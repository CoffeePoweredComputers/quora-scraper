            "answer_text": "The purpose is the same as for all other education in schools: To teach children skills and knowledge that is useful to them during the rest of their lives. I think it's especially important that schools teach this well because talking about sex is a taboo in most places and thus the children may very well not feel able to freely ask other adults in their lives about these things. If you don't know how to do long-form multiplication, odds are it's not that embarassing to you to ask an adult about it. But a young person who doesn't know enough about contraception may well feel it's much too embarassing to ask parents or other adults about. ",
