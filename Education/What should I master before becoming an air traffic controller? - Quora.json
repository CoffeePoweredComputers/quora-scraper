            "answer_text": "Creativity, short-term memory, and the ability to multi-task are important. It\u2019s a job where you\u2019re simultaneously working independently and as part of team\u2026 if that makes any sense. You\u2019ll need to be able to remain calm and continue to perform efficiently under pressure, even when things go wrong. You will be responsible for respecting your own limits\u2026 you can very easily get yourself in a lot of trouble. Pilots and other controllers can get you in a lot of trouble too, if you let them. Controlling is not directly related to intelligence or any particular academic discipline. I\u2019ve worked with brilliant controllers who I\u2019m surprised were able to graduate from high school. Math, science\u2026 even any knowledge of aviation is not required. You\u2019ll learn the bits you need to know on the job. Even today, it\u2019s very difficult to determine who will be a good controller and who will not. The FAA has never had an effective screening program, although they have certainly tried. The only way to know for sure if a person is suited for it is through on-the-job training with live traffic. Bartenders, short-order cooks\u2026 those types of workers often transition very well into ATC. If you can be the cook in a busy Waffle House, you\u2019ll probably make a good controller. ",
