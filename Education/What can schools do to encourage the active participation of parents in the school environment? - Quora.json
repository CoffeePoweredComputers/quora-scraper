            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a question that has many different answers, depending on the needs of the community. I knew one (private) school that simply set their parent-teacher conferences for Sunday evenings, a time when most parents were free. That won\u2019t fly if the teacher contract doesn\u2019t allow it. I knew another school that had a clothing exchange, so that parents could drop off an outgrown coat, and choose a bigger one - no money involved. It was a way of making parents feel more comfortable in the school environment. I\u2019ve known many schools that plan parent events where everyone brings food - that\u2019s another way of making parents feel that they have a place. Not long ago I read in a teachers\u2019 magazine the story of a principal who made an amazing dent in truancy by putting a washer and dryer in the school, so that kids and parents didn\u2019t feel embarrassed by dirty school clothes. I\u2019ve known other schools where, unfortunately, the school made assumptions about parent interest - how about getting a translator to tell parents that the school doesn\u2019t approve of the kids\u2019 snacks, but not bothering to get a translator for the report card. American schools often expect a much greater level of parent involvement than do schools elsewhere, so be gentle (and realistic). Some parents have multiple jobs, and they can\u2019t do any more. ",

            "answer_text": "First, schools should acknowledge and articulate what they really want - in my experience schools are looking for compliant parents - schools are not looking for serious parental input. Schools want very structured and very contained parental participation. That model of parental participation is the Stepford model. It runs counter to human nature. Who determines what teacher candidates will be hired? Create a small committee of parents to interview teacher candidates and make a recommendation, Is there a homework policy in the school? Create a small committee of parents to review it or create one for faculty input- have the faculty committee and the parents' ' committee work out compromises and hand a final draft to the administration - That would be a start to having real parent participation - honest gestures of inclusion.
