            "answer_text": "Yes! You can get a seat in Andhra University with a good rank in EAMCET that is you should get below 2000 rank to get any branch like good or bad. If you get below 1000 your chances wil be more to get a good branch you interested. So try to get a good rank so you can get the seat with less fees This is only for Andhra Pradesh people only as they are local students. Other state students are non-local students they can also write exam but ranks may vary. We are having second option, AUEET through this entrance exam you can seat in Andhra University. But fees will be more like from one to two lac Per Year . No remisberment wil be there for AUEET. Thank You. ",
