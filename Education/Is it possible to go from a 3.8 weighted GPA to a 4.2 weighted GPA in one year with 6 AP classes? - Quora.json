            "answer_text": "It depends on the weighting. The question is just why anybody would take 6 AP courses\u2014or any. The AP program was set up by the College Board when they realized that their PSAT and SAT had market saturation. They weren\u2019t going to make much more money with those tests. Offering college credit for courses taken in high school if students passed tests on those courses sounded like a great deal, especially to parents who got both bragging rights and reduction of tuition costs. Colleges, however, have realized that AP courses are a scam. The curriculum isn\u2019t college level and neither is the teaching. Few college courses use multiple choice final examinations. As a result, more and more colleges each year refuse to accept the \u201ccollege\u201d credit from AP. Here it is, from a college professor who has watched this transpire over the last thirty years. If you want college credit, get it through dual enrollment at your local community college. The credits are more likely to transfer and you\u2019ll have earned them in a real college classroom. And I\u2019ll tell you what I tell my students: \u201cIf GPA truly matters to you, it matters to you on the first day of class, not halfway through the course.\u201d ",
