            "answer_text": "In most cases, I would say no. If they had a valid enough reason to warrant killing them (like self defense or defense of another), then they wouldn\u2019t be charged for it. Or they would be charged but found not guilty. If they didn\u2019t have a valid reason, then it likely means something is wrong with them and they need help, likely psychological. That being said, I say most cases not all cases because if they had a valid reason for killing someone but that someone happened to come from a family or group with enough influence to destroy my kid\u2019s life, then I might be inclined to help them hide the body. For example, according to two different studies 40% of police officer families experience domestic violence, while that rate is only 10% with the general public (Do 40% of police officer families experience domestic violence? It's complicated). So, if my son or daughter married a police officer that was abusing them (and/or their kids) and they had tried to report it, but not been taken seriously because they are married to a police officer. Or only been put in counselling (\u201cThe most common discipline imposed for a sustained allegations of domestic violence was counseling.\u201d With over 80% not terminating officers after a second sustained allegation. Both under previous link.) Or they were convicted but it was still not enough to keep them away or off the force (\u201cOf all the cases, police officers who were arrested, charged and convicted of abuse, more than half kept their jobs.\u201d Under previous link). And so if their spouse came back and tried to kill them and in a desperate attempt to save themselves or their kid, they shot their spouse. Then I might be more inclined to help them hide the evidence knowing that the same people who didn\u2019t take them seriously when they accused them of domestic violence, would likely not believe them when they claim self defense either. To be clear, I am using the example of a cop because I am assuming if the spouse was librarian they would take the accusations more seriously. It could also apply to lawyers, celebrities, etc. that aren\u2019t always treated the same under the law and could take advantage of their position to prevent people from taking early accusations seriously or who have relatives/allies that would help them persecute my kid after the fact. So, it depends on the scenario. But the described one is fairly unlikely and hopefully I would be able to help them or get them help before it escalated to that point. I mean, if I am involved enough in their life that they would ask me to hide a body, I am probably involved enough to help in other ways before it gets to this point. Conclusion, 99% of possible scenarios would be a \u201cno\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is going to always be a big no. You are not helping your child by doing this and unless you have the equipment to cleanly dissolve a body with not trace, don\u2019t do it because you\u2019re now an accomplice. If one of my kids killed someone in self defense, I would immediately report it and get them the most expensive lawyer I could afford to help their case of why they had to kill someone to stay safe. I don\u2019t ever see it happening, but if they killed someone on purpose, I\u2019d take care of them for a day to basically mourn them because my baby will have died that day. I would alert the police while they\u2019re sleeping and have to say goodbye to them because I don\u2019t want to associate myself with a murderer and I\u2019ll wonder where I went wrong. My kids know to never fight, so if I ever got called for them doing more than pushing someone for harassing them, it would be a huge surprise for me. ",
