            "answer_text": "I will assume you are aiming for IBPS PO 2017. Now in order to actually improve your Quantitative aptitude for this exam, you need to first learn about the pattern. I will be talking specifically to the quantitative aptitude section. This year\u2019s IBPS PO exam has some changes. Look for the official notification. The major of all changes is that the Quantitative Aptitude section has been renamed as \u2018Data Analysis and Interpretation\u2019. IBPS PO has a reputation of copying the SBI PO\u2019s pattern and taking it to a whole new level. To make a strategy for IBPS PO, we need to first talk about the DI section of SBI PO 2017. If you have given this year\u2019s SBI PO mains, you already know what IBPS is going to do. This year\u2019s DI section was the toughest of all. You can assume the level of the paper by this fact that 10\u201312 questions out of 35 was counted as a good attempt. All of the DIs was missing DI. And all the DIs were based on concepts like Boats & Streams, Speed Time &Distance, etc. Apart from DI, only 5\u20136 questions were from other sections. In fact, few of the questions were from geometry which was a shock. So what is expected from this year\u2019s IBPS PO exam is that the Quant section is going to be mind boggling. So prepare yourself for a tough competition. Since the first hurdle is to clear the Pre, which sometimes seem tougher than clearing the mains because of the time constraint, you need to strategize accordingly. Strategy for Quantitative Aptitude (Pre): Books: Fast Track Objective Arithmetic by Rajesh Verma.Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Arun Sharma.Strategy: Start with 1st and then move on to 2nd. In case of Arun Sharma\u2019s book, you just need to solve upto 2nd difficulty level. Don\u2019t go for the level of difficulty III. That would be useless and time consuming. You need a hell lot of practice if you want to qualify pre. You will know that your preparation is final for the pre when you see a question and you don\u2019t have to think about how to solve it. Your pen must be on the paper right after you have finished reading the question. If you have to think about the question, just move on, attempt the next one. Time will be too less. Now in case of Quant many candidates look for shortcut formula for different sections and they try to mug it. Believe me when I say, that would be lethal for you if you don\u2019t know the basics. Go for shortcut only when your basics are already cleared. Hence study with sincerity. Time required: For those who are below average in Maths: 4 hours of intense study with minimum breaks will be sufficient. Try to complete at least one chapter in two days(theory + practice). For those who are average: 2\u20133 hours would be enough on a daily basis. Remember intense focus is required to excel in Maths. For those who are good: At least an hour on a daily basis. Don\u2019t skip this section even if you are good at it. It doesn\u2019t matter much if you skip maths for a day or two when you have sufficient time. But now you just have 10\u201315 days left. Don\u2019t skip it now. Daily practice with time constraint is highly recommended. Fast calculation is the key to success in such exams. At the end of the day, you need to be able to attempt 20\u201325 questions out of 35 in pre with 99\u2013100% accuracy. Join a test series and give 1 to 2 tests on a daily basis. And then analyse yourself. Practice Mock and Olive board are best because their level is usually a bit higher and it will make you at ease in the final exam. Strategy for DI (Mains): You don\u2019t need to buy any other book apart from those already mentioned. There may be some books available but when it comes to banking, the pattern changes drastically and you can\u2019t really trust a particular book. It\u2019s better to prepare from online sources. The first and foremost thing you need to do is to solve the SBI PO Memory based paper. It\u2019s available on BankersAdda. Solve the quizes of DI available on this site. They have a good standard. For DI, practice is all it takes. Try to solve different types of DI from any sources you can afford. And keep revising the other sections because you never know. This year\u2019s DI section is highly unpredictable. Brush up your geometrical concepts too. You will hardly get a month between your pre and mains. So you need to prepare for the mains from now. Again, test series play a key role. For mains, Oliveboard might be a bit tough. But Practise Mock and Career Power would be more than enough. Don\u2019t forget to solve and analyse at least 1 mock on a daily basis. Start solving for mains when your pre is over. For clearing such exams, your physical and emotional health plays a very important role too. Keep yourself healthy by eating at the right time. Don\u2019t skip your meals or else your focus will suffer. Don\u2019t engage in fights of any kind. In fact I would suggest you not to talk to anyone while you are preparing. Keep your phone off. Engage in those conversations only that don\u2019t distract you. It saves your energy and helps you in maintaining the required focus. Practice, practice and practice. That\u2019s the only key to improve Quantitative Aptitude. ",

A particular sum will consume more time than what you can afford to give it during IBPS PO exam. But believe me its worth it. Once you are good at doing sums in traditional method start looking for shortcuts. There are many books which have \u201cTips and Tricks\u201d section which emphasizes on shortcuts. Now there is some kind of a threshold which you need to cross and and then you will suddenly start liking it and you will feel confident. Believe me once you are confident and you believe that you can do any sum you really can. So what you need to do is rigorous, regular practice and you will improve in quant. Regular is the keyword there. I guess 2 months of regular rigorous practice is enough for anyone to become good in quant. ",

Do not follow the tricks for aptitude problems blindly. The examination can be quite stressful, the questions are often twisted and its quite possible you will stop thinking logically when you try hard to remember what the trick for the specific question was which will lead to more stress. When you get stressed, you're done. So don't do that. Solve questions by understanding the underlying logic. Keep solving lots of them. Keep a timer whenever you solve quantitative problems. Aim for 100% accuracy. Eventually your speed will improve. Hope I helped. :) ",

I was a quant faculty for competitive exams and I always observed that students after going to college, totally forget school mathematics. Quantitative aptitude for Bank PO is based on secondary school mathematics. You should know all the concepts right from divisibility, factorisation, HCF LCM, fractions, percentage. When your basics become strong, you will be able to solve word problems in other topics such as profit and loss, simple compound interest, time and work etc. For few tips about basic maths concepts and speed, please refer to my following answer. Just click below and start reading anytime. Good luck for exams. Priya's answer to How do I improve speed in IBPS PO quantitative aptitude section? ",
