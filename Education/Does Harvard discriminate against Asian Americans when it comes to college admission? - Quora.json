            "answer_text": "NO. I think it's time to re-discuss the \"jelly donut\" model of admissions. I have this on my webpage, but Quora won't let me link there, so you'll have to be patient. Imagine you\u2019re at a conference, and it\u2019s break time. You head for the table where the coffee and donuts are. There are six dozen plain donuts and three jelly donuts. You're bringing donuts back for you and a friend. You're much more likely to pick a jelly donut than all plain donuts. Are you discriminating against plain donuts, or are you selecting for diversity? Even if Asians have higher numerical indicators, Harvard is not looking to run an SAT factory. Harvard wants the kid who climbed Mount Everest, even if his SAT is only 1300. They want the kid from Haryana, India, who worked in a nature habitat breeding a dying species of crocodile. They want the kid who does extreme snowboarding by having designed a way to attach his wheelchair to the snowboard. Many Asians with higher numerical indicators than others in the applicant pool are rejected. By far the commonest reason is that they all present the same file \u2013 the same SATs and SAT2s, the same AP classes, the same activities. Nearly 40 years ago, I was admitted to law school. I was the first LGBT political activist to apply to the school, and was admitted virtually on that factor alone. By the time I walked into my classes on the first day of school, every single professor knew that I was the gay activist. Any time a case even potentially touched on this issue, I was called on. Why? Because I was different! I was exciting! And my view needed to be heard by the rest of the class, because someone in the class was going to become a legislator, and was going to have LGBT constituents. There are very few Asian jelly donuts. Asian plain donuts have brought a suit against Harvard demanding that they be admitted; but Harvard is still holding out for an Asian with pink icing and sprinkles. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on how you see the situation, it can either be outright racist or the complete opposite of it! The main cause of the issue is that Harvard and most of the top universities believe that different background is equal to different point of view. Instead of filling their classrooms with students from one similar background, they make sure that the students in their respective institutions are as diverse as possible so that class discussions can improve with more varied point of views. To make this possible they fix a certain amount of limit of students which they are planning to take from one background/ ethnicity (say Asian). But the problem arrises as the ratio of applications received from various ethnicities is different than the ratio which the universities set for their diversity goal. Universities like Harvard receive thousands of applications from countries like India and China, because of various reasons like population and desire to study abroad. To make you understand the situation better lets take an example with simple figures. Suppose there is a university named XYZ in USA with 100 seats who believes in diversity and wants to get students from as many different backgrounds as possible. It has set limit of students from various backgrounds as follows- American- 50 seats (Any university in USA sets a higher limit for American students as one of it\u2019s primary aim is to serve the American society) European- 15 seats African- 10 seats Asian & Indian- 20 seats Others- 5 seats Total- 100 seats Due to its popularity, XYZ university receives thousands of applications which can be segregated according to the above mentioned ethnicities as follows- American- 2,000 applications European- 700 applications African- 200 applications Asian & Indian- 1,200 applications Others- 150 application Total- 4,250 applications Now, publicly the university announces that it has received 4,250 applications and with 100 seats its acceptance rate is placed at a competitive 2.35% (Calculated as- No. of seats/ No. of applications * 100) However if we calculate the acceptance rate based on the ethnic groups using the formula stated above we get varied results which can be seen below: American- 2.5% European- 2.14% African- 5% Asian & Indian- 1.67% Others- 3.33% As it can be seen, the acceptance rate of Indian and Asian students is lower than any other group, so even though XYZ University tried to preach equality and diversity some might find its admission process racist and biased.    As the above three graphs show, the number of Indian and Chinese students are at an all time high (Even though it may come down now because of the rising racist attacks in USA- For more info on that read this link[1]) Hope that answers your question! P.S.- Most of the stuff which I have written on this answer came to my knowledge by talking to admission officers of different US universities and also my school career councillor, however it is still true that few top universities might not be following a system like this. Edits are welcome! Image Sources- Indian Students in the USA at an all time high, second only to China Are US universities choosing rich Chinese students over Asian Americans? Chinese one-third of US foreign students: report Thank You! Footnotes[1] From an all-time high in 2015-16, number of Indian Students in the USA might fall in 2016-17",

            "answer_text": "Looking at the empirical evidence, the answer seems to be obviously yes. Of course it does. The question is not whether Harvard does or doesn\u2019t discriminate, the answer is, is it acceptable that they do. I was asked a similar question here: David W. Budd's answer to Will Harvard lose or win the discrimination lawsuit just filed by group of Asian students alleging it had purposefully limited the percentage of Asian-American students it admits? \u201cDiscriminate\u201d means to draw distinctions between two (or more) different things - people, shirts, diet sodas. For example, I discriminate between Coke and Pepsi, in that I find Pepsi to be too sweet. That ethnic Asian students (both AA and Asians actually from Asia) who gain acceptance score 180 points (on average) on their SATs, and the fact that Harvard defend their admissions policy by saying that diversity is one criterion that they use to \u201cenhance\u201d their student experience are almost irrefutable evidence that yes; Harvard looks at Asian, Black, White, and Latino students as inherently different. So yes; it\u2019s almost undeniable that Harvard discriminate. Is it \u201cfair?\u201d Is it \u201cright?\u201d Is it \u201clegal?\u201d These are the questions that we should be asking. IMHO, the answer is \u201cno\u201d to the first two. The Courts will decide the answer to the third. ",

Here\u2019s why: Asians (both domestic and international) have the largest enrollment Harvard after whites. You will see this same trend at all of the top 30 colleges in America.Want to complain about colleges discriminating against people of color, perhaps the conversation should be how underrepresented minorities (black, brown and native students) aren\u2019t getting a far shake as their white and Asian counterparts. In other words, let\u2019s focus on who REALLY continues to go through systemic oppression. Not just academically, but professionally.Lastly, and this is the most important part, just because you have perfect grades, test scores, etc DOES NOT mean that you should be automatically admitted to Harvard or ANY OTHER elite school! Getting accepted to a school like Harvard is a blessing and a privilege\u2026.not an entitlement. Speaking of entitlement\u2026.\u2026want to be mad at someone, be mad at LEGACIES getting into Harvard! They\u2019re the ones who are really taking spots away from promising students.

            "answer_text": "In 1989, Asian Americans made up ~20 percent of Harvard undergrad. Nearly 30 years later, Asian American population has doubled and their test scores have gone way up, while test scores for other racial groups, including Whites, have gone down. Yet Asian Americans still make up 20 percent of Harvard undergrads. In the late 1980s, there was a similar lawsuit against Harvard. Harvard reasoned that Asian Americans weren\u2019t admitted at a higher rate because few Asian Am applicants were legacies and even fewer were recruited athletes. Today, unlike in 1989, many Asian Am applicants ARE legacies and there ARE far more Asian Am recruited athletes as well. Yet still stuck at around 20 percent. Which suggests Asian Am legacies, athletes, and children of donors only displace other Asian Am applicants. Which suggests Harvard lied the first time they were asked about the existence of quotas \u2014 no matter what Asian Ams are stuck at 20 percent. Harvard probably could\u2019ve gotten away with quotas if they had increased Asian Am share to 25 percent. But they wouldn\u2019t budge so now Asian Americans are pissed. Whether or not Harvard can set quotas and still receive federal funding, that\u2019ll be the more interesting story. ",
