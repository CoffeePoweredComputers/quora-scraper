            "answer_text": "I've gotten the highest score on the final exam, and overall highest grade, in several of my classes over the years.  I don't think I've ever not been in the top 5. To be honest, I don't really care.  I certainly don't think I'm anything special.  Anyone who wanted to do the same could.  But perhaps more importantly, I like learning.  I would do the same thing regardless of whether I was graded or not.  I'm not in it for praises, or merits.  I really don't care what anyone thinks of me.  I'm simply fascinated with technology. It blows my mind to consider that computers do math at near the speed of light using unfathomably small attractive particles.  Or that they live in another time dimension, where times flies by seemingly billions of times faster; a second goes by in our world, and a microprocessor has lived a lifetime.  Or perhaps that the cookie-cutter, perfectably understandable, and high-level object you're reading this on now is actually an oblate, chaotic illusion of thousands of interlocking systems and threads working together to present a picture of harmony and simplicity.  It is so beautiful, it rends my heart to realize all that is abstracted from us.  And I want to know more. ",

            "answer_text": "It means that they studied exceptionally hard. It does not mean they are the smartest student in the class. It also means they were fortunate potentially.  I think during every test, there's an element of \"fortune\" or \"luck\" involved. Let me take my personal experience in numerous classes to explain this. Imagine you cover 600 pages in a text during the course of a semester. Well, that's a lot of material to test on a final exam that is three hours. Most exams have maybe 5 big questions. You can definitely get unlucky and study material that doesn't get covered. The more you study, the more you put \"luck\" in your favor. But, if you have 600 pages to study for one class and more exams, then you can't possibly study everything. Luck becomes a bigger factor when you study the \"important\" concepts because it's likely that you overlook something because it's not \"important\" enough in your opinion.  ",
