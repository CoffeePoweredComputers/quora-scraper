            "answer_text": "As a Math HL and Physics SL student, I believe Math HL is harder than Physics HL. Not to forget that I even find History HL harder than Physics HL. I am currently doing well on Math HL and Physics SL, according to my teachers, better than what I think I am doing. Physics Paper 1 is basically multiple choice questions, but without calculator. Physics Paper 2 is difficult for me because it requires calculation, but not as much complex calculations as Math HL or even SL. I didn\u2019t take the Physics Paper 3 yet but my Physics IA is mainly focused on Astrophysics and Circular Motion. Math HL Paper 1 takes 2 hours without calculator, but still short answer and long answer questions (it doesn\u2019t take too much critical thinking like ESS or History). Math HL Paper 2 is more difficult even though I scored on my final 11th grade exam better on it than Paper 1, yet the Math HL paper 2 similar to Paper 1, but you need calculator and the calculations are complex compared to Physics Paper 2\u2019s and 0% theory as well. You need to review your calculator perfectly to get a good grade on Paper 2. The Paper 3 in IB Math HL is very difficult as well. My school does Astrophysics as an option and it is considered \u201ceasy\u201d, but I consider it appealing. For the IAs: Math IAs are difficult compared to Physics IAs. My Physics IA topic isn\u2019t considered \u201cvery easy\u201d because it focuses on Astrophysics, but I like my topic in IB Physics IAs and not doing bad on it. Not to forget that my Physics IA motivates me better than my Math IA topic. It is very difficult to score a 7 in Math HL IA, that is the same going for the Math SL IA as well. I didn\u2019t choose a very good topic for my Math IA. Do which topic appeals to you for your IAS. I might get a 4 in Math HL IAs and a 5 in my Math HL papers. Not to forget that Physics has lower grade boundaries than IB Biology or Chemistry, which makes more people get 7\u2019s in IB Physics than in Chemistry, Biology or Maths, and also has less topics to revise when compared to chemistry and maths HL. I have a friend who takes Math SL and Physics HL and she is currently getting 7s on Math SL (5 in Math HL) and at least a 5 in Physics HL (like a 6/7 in Physics SL) and wants to study architecture in UCL. If you are very gifted at Maths and get at least 6\u2019s in Math HL, you would even get a 7 in Math SL without even studying. For me, I would get a 7 in Math Studies without studying anything and a 7 in Math SL with putting in efforts (max 5 in SL without studying). ",

            "answer_text": "I feel like I am very well qualified to answer this question, since I am in the third to last week of doing the IB. I do both math HL, and physics HL, and let me tell you: Math HL is much harder than it seems. You have to know your concepts like the back of your hand. Math SL is like learning the alphabet and basic words.... it is relatively easy and straightforward. However, Math HL is like learning a complex language all on it's own. Yes, you do need to know your 'alphabet'; however, you also have to be a fast thinker and have a passion for solving problems. The jump from Math SL to HL is astronomical. Physics, on the other hand, has its own quirks. Sure, some details may be idiosyncratic, but the difference between SL and HL is not massive. The AHL topics are just mere mathematical and very small theoretical extensions of the core syllabus.Simply put, if you can get a 7 in SL math, you don't know if you will get even a 5 in HL Math. However, if you can get a 7 in Physics SL, you could sure as hell get at least a 6 in Physics HL with effort! ",
