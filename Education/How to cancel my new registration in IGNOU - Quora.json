If you want admission in different course then apply for that course as well , at the time of admission your regional center will ask you personally for your preferred course , other will be cancelled by IGNOU. If you paid your fee by Online/Offline mode (BA/MA) Then visit your regional center they will guide you. IGNOU never refund the fee if student by self withdrew. ",
