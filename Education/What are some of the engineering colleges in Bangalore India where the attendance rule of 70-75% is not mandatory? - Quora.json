            "answer_text": "I suggest you to check out my college's name in my profile.Also, this is one thing that depends on your relation with the faculty and HOD. When I was in my last semester, I had a bet with one of my friend that I won't be attending a single class. This came on as a challenge as he attended one class in his last semester. My friend was from Mech so it's doable for them - you know all boys -mass bunks. Me being from Computers, was bit tough for me. Still, I won the challenge. This doesn't mean CSE Dept doesn't detain anyone for less attendance. A guy was detained in his 2nd year for the same. I did that because it was my last semester and I had a good impression over my HOD. I didn't attend classes but regularly attended tech seminars, met my Project coordinator. Hope you got the point!
