            "answer_text": "The Open University, established in the UK in 1969, was the world\u2019s first open university. It\u2019s the biggest university in the UK, it is ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide, and its degrees are highly respected by employers. However, there are now numerous \u2018open universities\u2019 worldwide. They share the same ethos of making higher education more accessible by having minimal entry requirements and many of them also use distance learning, either exclusively or together with in-person tutorials or lectures. And any university degree is \u2018valid\u2019 as long as it has the proper accreditation. Wikipedia has a list of the world\u2019s open universities here: List of open universities - Wikipedia with links to short articles about them. The best place to find out more about the courses, qualifications and accreditation is on the university\u2019s own website. You should be able to contact the university\u2019s student support team for advice about choosing the right study programme. You may also be able to find out what the current students and alumni think about the university and the course you\u2019re interested in. More importantly, you should find out what employers think. Depending on your choice of career, you may discover you don\u2019t need a degree. Alongside technical competence and experience many companies look for employees with the right \u2018soft\u2019 skills\u2014such as creativity, problem solving, team work and communication skills\u2014rather than a specific degree. So any course that helps you gain the skills you need will be worthwhile. ",

            "answer_text": "In the same way as any British university an OU degree course is written and validated by external assessors, academics expert in their field and who usually hold senior positions in other institutions. The standards having been set, the external assessor is responsible for ensuring that assessment and outcomes meet the rigour and standards expected for an academic qualification in good standing and comparable to any other of equal standing. Because of the scale of the OU student population compared to others, it will differ in that those presenting the course locally will not be the authors of much of the course materials. The teaching materials from the OU for undergraduate courses is world renowned and used as an exemplar for other institutions. Those universities in the UK who appear in the top 100 in the world rankings of universities are happy to utilise the OU for their own academics carrying out additional degrees and continuing professional development. All of the above, to my mind, guarantees the validity of an OU degree ",

            "answer_text": "An Open University degree is accredited in the same way as degrees from universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Sunderland, Durham etc. It is as valid as any. However, just as the brand name of a degree from Oxford or Durham has a cachet that places it above a degree from, say, Sunderland it is assumed to have greater value. A significant part of an OU degree\u2019s value is due to its generally being studied while holding down a full time job and bringing up a family. When it began, the OU had to fight for its place in the academic world and did this by employing the best of the best from wherever in the world they could be found. This is still the case. In summary, an OU degree is as valid as any other but its reputation stands comparison with the best Britain can offer. ",

If you are asking why is an Open University degree valid that is issued by the OU in the UK, I would say speak to the London School of Economics, Imperial College London, University College London and the University of Oxford as they were very happy to accept my degree from the Open University. Typical Open University students work full time and it takes a minimum of 6 years, employers and other Universities understand the commitment that is required to graduate with a good degree (1st or Upper Second).
