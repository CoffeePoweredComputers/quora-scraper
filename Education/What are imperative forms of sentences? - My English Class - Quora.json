            "answer_text": "Imperative Forms  Use:Use the imperative form to give instructions, orders and warnings. Must is often used in signs and notices to give instructions. Form:1) Do not use a subject when giving orders. You wash your hands. => Wash your hands. Always use the infinitive form of the verb, without to. To sit down please. => Sit down please. Use Don\u2019t to make the negative form.Don\u2019t sit there!  2) Written instructions on signs often use Do not, not Don\u2019t.Do not cross this line. 3) When giving instructions to a friend, you can soften the order by using \u2018you\u2019. However, this is usually only done in spoken English. First you put the mixture into a bowl, and then you add two eggs. Then you whisk it. 4) Some written signs use Must / Must not. All visitors must wear a badge. Passengers must not talk to the driver. Notice how plural nouns (visitors / passengers) are generally used in signs. Common mistakes:1) Some students use to after Don\u2019t / Must Don\u2019t to go in that door. => Don\u2019t go in that door. . Thanks ~ Joy Rana \u270d ",
