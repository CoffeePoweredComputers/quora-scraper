            "answer_text": "A2A. I don\u2019t think we can ban the Internet from schools in 2018. Our ways of thinking, reading, researching have shifted. There are simply too many good tools to be used on the Internet. Should the Internet be out and open all the time? Should students be on social media while working? Is there content that is inappropriate for students or a workplace environment? No, no and yes. It\u2019s up to teachers, administrators, tech support, librarians and anyone else who can, to monitor student use, as best they can. No system is foolproof, so adults need to stay vigilant. But we would be doing our students a disservice by not teaching them how to use the Internet appropriately and productively. The Internet is useful enough to keep access open. Here are just a few examples: Students and teachers communicate via email. The school communicates with parents and the community via email, the website, and other sources. Language students can FaceTime with students in faraway countries for practice. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, thesauri and many other resources are available for free. And they\u2019re up to date. We can see primary sources for history research, even if they\u2019re halfway around the world. Communication, learning and sharing happens immediately. We use a lot less paper. I could go on and on.
