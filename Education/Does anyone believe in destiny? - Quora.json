            "answer_text": "Yes something called as destiny is there ,but you have enough power to change the destiny you have brain ,intelligence , thinking capacity, guides ,willpower, hardwork capacity, so you can change destiny .guru also have power to change it, devotion or real bhakti also can change it . destiny is there always but to change it by your efforts is the human being . accept it and fight for changing it.there are lots of people in world having only legs ,no hands, paralised body, in an accidents they lost their legs, hands, still they are living. I will give an example arunima sinha had a very bad acciden t, she became hadicapped after that but still she climbed himalyas Everest . so she herself changed the destiny , stiffen hawking also changed destiny no of examples are there so fight fight and fight lastly the won the race. . between you and destiny .Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "Destiny is a man made concept where certain things are going to happen and we cant stop it.destiny appears to exist to the common man.yes in a society like in congo if u wish to be a world class surgeon then it is not going to happen as such facilities to train u hardly exist in congo.so u have to go to another country say us or uk to train properly in a med school. See in the universe u are just another creature like reptiles insects trying to survive. No matter how much intelligent and purposeful and dedicated you feel in life you are just a dot in the existence. And yeah god and devil doesnt exist. Rationally Chance or probablities exists.chance or probabilities could be beneficial or harm for your existence.but chance is not set in stone before your birth. If u give a med post grad exam to get a radiodiagnosis\u2026you could miss it by 2 or 3 ranks only to settle for other subjects.and this could repeat again and again.but this depends on multiple factors including your performance on the exam day.if u missed radiodiagnosis it means we need to open more seats in that subject.it doesnt mean u r destined to fail at getting radiodiagnosis its just ur sentiment.
