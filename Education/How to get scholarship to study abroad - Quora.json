Most of us already know which one of the scholarships are available for your particular interest and ready to put a race for it. But before we get to do that we have to be sure that we end up with the best results. \u201cGood Luck is a residue of preparation.\u201d \u2013 Jack Youngblood 2. Do proper researchStart your research early. Not everyone of us are last minute heroes and also last minute changes will keep you much anxious about how bad or good your application is going to turn up. Relatively the time spent on researching over the process, the more you will be considering options to put your best. One can actively spend his time prior to an application by researching the past winners profile and match your credentials, look for limitations and plan how to overcome the problems and request information and application forms, submit it right on time and avoid disqualifications due to human error or the worst. \u201cImagination is the highest form of research.\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein. 3. Check your eligibilityOne of the prime factors which decide your success with any application you submit is your eligibility for the said scholarship. Many a times you are not really eligible for a particular domain due to restrictions of country, academic levels, areas of interest etc to name a few. \u201cFailing a scholarship application due to eligibility limitations is the worst experience\u201d \u2013 An Applicant 4.

You can do all of above points but cant keep track of your application and loose track of any information regarding the same is a bad case scenario you would fall in if you don\u2019t keep up your stuffs organised. From forms to certificates, letters, supporting documents, any relevant information and ideas from mentors helping you to get the best from your applications all will be lost if you lose any vital information to put on. Keep stress out of the window by carefully planning ahead and organising the process ahead. If you need a war plan, make it consider this just like any big struggle in your life and you better excel it. Keep a folder organised with deadlines and make backup copies of almost everything and note the dates of application and results on the top of the folder for easy reference. \u201cObstacles are frightful things you see when you take eyes off the goal\u201d \u2013 Henry Ford 5. Keep Calm and get all InformationNow you are almost done, right? No. Make sure you have all the information required with you. The best way to tackle it is to have a checklist of all things required to make a successful application. cross-check, recheck, or chuck it. Spelling mistakes, Illegible writing are some other head turners. Ask a family member or friend to proof-read the application for they may find a mistake that you just didn\u2019t pick up. Last but the best, Provide the correct information as well as alternate contact details. \u201cInformation is power, disinformation is abuse of power\u201d \u2013 Newton Lee  6. Please don\u2019t miss the deadline.Always give yourself a grant amount of extra time and moments to think and contemplate over your application. Thinking is not a waste of time, day-dreaming is potentially one. You may need this if you\u2019re getting your application referred by someone professionally capable of reviewing it and its always the best thing to do. Also remember that late applications are usually not considered. So try missing a deadline I dare you, I double dare you. \u201cAlways strive to Improve yourself\u201d \u2013 A member of scholarship panel. ",

            "answer_text": "Getting a scholarship to study abroad can be the biggest boost for your educational journey and career ahead. It doesn\u2019t just reduce the cost and eases the financial side of your preparation but adds ups to your confidence in your ambitions. Scholarships work two ways \u2013 They are either provided by the home country or host country. Home countries have government and private scholarships and exchange programs with scholarships to encourage students to fulfill their study abroad dreams. The host country scholarships work the same way too - There are both government and privately funded scholarships, with varying values and time period and levels of education.  Student-friendly countries like Canada have many options; some are permanently available, while others open for recipients to apply only in particular years. Some of the government-funded scholarships for Canada are: Canadian Commonwealth and Scholarship and fellowship Plan \u2013 to cover living and accommodation expenses in Canada for 5-6 months. Ontario Scholarship Program \u2013 It is rewarded for a large number of disciplines. The award is valid for two or three sessions amounting to one year or a little over that. National Research Council of Canada \u2013 Provides associateship for master\u2019s degree holders and PhD holders in natural science. Quebec Provincial Government Scholarship \u2013 For candidates with master\u2019s level and above, valued between $3000 to $25000, for different levels. Partnership Grants by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada \u2013 For PhD candidates to support research initiatives in social sciences and humanities. Banting PostDoctoral Fellowships \u2013 For students who wish to pursue PF programs with natural science, social sciences and healthcare. Vanier Graduate Scholarships \u2013 To help students pursue a doctoral degree. Besides that, there are many privately funded scholarships inviting students from specific fields as well.

            "answer_text": "A recent survey found that students indicated high cost was the greatest deterrent to studying overseas followed by the lack of scholarship opportunities. However, with proper information and planning hopefully no student aspiring to go abroadwill face this predicament and compromise on their academic endeavors. There are a number of scholarships offered by schools, universities and external agencies that can help make studying abroad affordable for Indians. Let\u2019s probe into the various options: 1. University Scholarships.One of the best sources of financial aid can be the college you attend. Universities provide aid through grants and scholarships which do not have to be repaid and can be offered based on need or merit. For example: Tata Scholarships at Cornell University\u2013 There is US$25 million endowment from the Tata Education and Development Trust that supports around 20 Indian scholarsat Cornell. To be eligible, it\u2019s necessary to first be accepted into an undergraduate course at Cornell, and then apply for need-based financial aid. The British Council \u2013The British Council recently announced the single largest number of scholarships ever launched in a year in India, by offering around 370 scholarships worth almost 1 million pounds. There are 36 UK institutions participating in this program and scholarships will be offered for 260 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. 2. Current Learning Institutes. The institution you currently attendcould be a resource for financial aid. It\u2019s important to speak to your school and department heads to understand if any scholarships are available and what their admission criteria are. For example: Davis United World Colleges Scholars Program- All graduates of UWC schools who gain admission on their own merits to selected U.S. colleges or universities qualify for need-based scholarship support through the program. The program currently supports over 2,700 scholars at 94 partner colleges and universities throughout the United States. 3. Community Organizations. It is quite common for community groups to encourage and support exceptional members in their academic endeavors. For example: Mustard Seed Foundation (The Harvey Fellows Program) - Provides scholarships to Christian students who are pursuing graduate studies at premier universities in fields considered to be underrepresented by Christians and who possess a unique vision to impact society through their vocations. 4. Private Organizations.There are a number of trusts, foundations and private groups that look to aid exceptional candidates. The criterion varies depending on the ethos of the institution, but you will have to detail why you are the right candidate. For example: RotaryGlobal Grant Scholarship Program - Supports international study at the graduate level and funds graduate-level coursework or research for one to four academic years. It is a partnership between the district / club in the study location and the district / club in the scholar\u2019s home country.The minimum grant amount is US$30,000. InlaksShivdasani Foundation Scholarships \u2013 Provides scholarships of up to US$100,000 for exceptional Indian students to study in North America or Europe. The scholarship covers tuition fees, adequate living expenses and one-way travel.Applicants must be under 30 and reside in India at the time of application. NarotamSekhsaria Foundation - Awards interest-free loan scholarships to Indian students with a consistent andstrong academic record. The scholarship amount can be up to Rs. 20 lakhs and is awarded to students who wish to pursue postgraduate studies at prestigious Indian and international universities. 5. Government.The Indian Government, both individually and in collaboration, have launched scholarships to help finance proficient students looking to study outside of India. For example: Government of Telangana\u2013 Introduced the \u201cOverseas Study Scheme for Minorities\u201d for the benefit of the students belonging to minority community. Financial assistance will be sanctioned to 500 minority students/graduates per year to pursue Post Graduate/Doctoral studies abroad as per the guidelines. Fulbright-Nehru Fellowships- The Master's Fellowships are designed for outstanding Indians residing in India to pursue a master's degree at selected U.S. colleges and universities. Selected fellows have completed the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree, have at least three years of work experience, and are committed to return and contribute to their communities. There are a number of resources Indian applicants can utilize to fund their study abroad. It\u2019s imperative you do your research, connect with targeted colleges, probe into Government schemes, reach out to external agencies and speak to successful students. Start early and thoroughly explore all the options available before making your final decision. Best of Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are few basic requirements which need to be fulfilled in order to get one:(Get more info from the site univadmithelp) 1.The most important of all is hard-work. This may sound clich\u00e9 but there is no shortcut. The application for scholarship requires good grades if not excellent, extra-curriculars. Along with this the scholarships may require from you a few write-ups you need to prepare them well in advance. 2. Research well: Find applications for scholarships which you think you are eligible for. Make a list of all available options. Once you prepare the list of scholarships, go through the requirements. You need to arrange for a lot of things before you can finally submit your applications. 3.There are 2 R\u2019s that are important here. Your Resume should be prepared well and the recommendation letters. These letters can give a great push to your application. The recommendation can be people like your teachers, principal, etc. These are the things you will have to prepare in advance. 4.Essay: Most of the scholarships as I mentioned above requires you to provide them with a write up in order to assess your thinking process. Prepare well written write-ups in advance. These can be on recent topics of general importance or about why you want this scholarship or about why you want to study abroad. This list is not exhaustive. 5.Whenever you apply for scholarship let them know how you are going to contribute to the country or you are going to give them back. Never write about settling there, this will always act against you. 6.Deadlines: keep track of the deadline. Collect all the required data and submit your application as early as possible. Double check your applications before making the submission. Get scrutiny done by a third person. There are many scholarships like Inlaks, Fullbright, Ratan Tata Endowment, etc. Research well and apply to all those where you find yourself eligible. ",

When we talk about scholarships to study abroad we need to keep a lot of things in mind, however, the following are the things to keep an eye for: Scholarships are of two kinds: Merit-based ScholarshipsNeed-Based ScholarshipsThere aren\u2019t any specific tests that one needs to appear for scholarships. All merit-based scholarships are available for the students based on their application. Some of them can have separate essays depending on colleges. Most of the universities assess the applicants and share the scholarships along with the offer letters. Need-based scholarships have separate applications. They are mostly provided by external organizations based on your essays and admits. Similar to the college applications, these scholarships follow a process where you must create an application along with your documents including your acceptance letter from the university. They also have separate essay questions that one must answer. Having said that, the questions are quite similar to the college application questions that the students have written in the past. To get scholarships, a profile must be holistically developed. Thus, an ideal profile must be a combination of strong academia, good work experience, active participation in extracurricular activities, some volunteer work, to name a few. Additionally, you can also pursue multiple online courses that showcase your skills that have developed over a period of time If you need any help with how to apply to scholarships and identify the best ones for your courses, then please reach out to Leverage Edu.

The converse of that, and perhaps a more constructive answer, is: the student should find the thing that that they are better than average at, whether it\u2019s sports, music, art, drama, writing, helping the community, leadership, etc (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not anything academic or they wouldn\u2019t be asking this); or find some other way in which they are outside the ordinary (eg the particular challenges they have faced in life). If they\u2019re lucky, it will match something some institution somewhere will want to encourage by offering a scholarship to match. ",

            "answer_text": "Scholarships are a gift. They are meant to be used. Some countries more than others offer scholarships for students. It is important to take this into consideration while looking at study abroad options. Countries that offer scholarships for international students are US, Canada, New Zealand and Finland to name the top few. That is not to say that the others don\u2019t offer scholarships but it might be fewer. There are different types of scholarships that one can apply for- government and non-government funded scholarships. Other than these most scholarships are merit based. There are also those that are given for music, sports, leadership and community service. What I have seen is that private universities that are smaller offer a greater amount of scholarships for international students. The advantage of applying for these kind of universities is that the competition for getting these scholarships is not that much and the chances of increasing the amount over the years is more.  As a student, what you need to do is take a look at what is required of you in order to meet the criteria that normally is very clearly stated on university websites. Things like academic rigor, grades in 9, 10 and 11, overall percentage/GPA, etc. are normally aspects that are taken into consideration. It might be a bit of work in doing the research but it definitely is worth your time. So whether you need a scholarship or not, if you think you meet the requirements and have put in the effort to do well through school, then go get that gift! You deserve it. ",
