            "answer_text": "Or maybe, go study Philosophy?\u2026You would be surprised how incredibly useful and rare it is to be able to think about life, the choices, the deep questions. Maybe , if you are obsessed with usefulness or monetizability, become an AC technician and go trade time for money?. ..lol,.Many kids make bad choices, choosing topics like accounting just so they are sure to get a job at the end of their studies. Realize that this thought pattern stems from a Mindset of Scarcity. The World is abundant with possibility. Nature favors the Bold. Maybe , you\u2019ll study Philosophy and then become a playwright or author ..and bring you unique spin on events. Step into your Greatness. Listen to your Heart. If you are drawn to Philosophy or French Litterature, Go for it. Go for a semester in France to study. Broaden your horizons. Let life happen to you.The World will always need conscious independent thinkers that know how to communicate. Be the change. Love Life Loud and Clear  ",
