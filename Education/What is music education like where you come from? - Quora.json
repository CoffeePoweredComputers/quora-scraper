            "answer_text": "I am from New York City, where music education varies greatly. As a result of great economic disparity and social polarization, music education is not valued highly across all social groups. Additionally, it isn't a priority in low income areas since it is usually unaffordable for those groups. However, the city provides a lot of exposure to the arts and opportunities to have musical education despite economic status. It is more available than elsewhere. I would say music education is readily available but who receives it is entirely relative. ",
