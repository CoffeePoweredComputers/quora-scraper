            "answer_text": "Its really easy but you need to apply your brain for 10 minutes..Just like you,i was also curious to know the results of whole school so i followed this simple process to know the range: Hit and trial method: For this process you have to enter roll number and see the individual results. You know your Roll number,right?? Suppose its xxxx638 then to know the lower range you decrease your roll number by 20(xxxx618) and see if you could view the individual result by entering your school code. If it displays,then again decrease by 20(roll no now is xxxx598) means your lower range lies between xxxx598 and xxxx618 \u2026now you can check for xxxx608 if it displays then lower range value is between xxxx598 and xxxx608 otherwise xxxx608 and xxxx618 and so on\u2026Similarly do for upper range value. It just takes 10 minutes and I viewed my school results using this method.! Hardwork pays off! Thanks for reading. Edits are welcomed. ",
