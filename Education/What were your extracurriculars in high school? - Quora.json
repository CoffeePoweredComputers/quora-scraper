            "answer_text": "I So far I\u2019m a Junior in high school. If you count sports, I have done quite a few extracurriculars. Freshman CheerleadingDont ask and I wont tell xD but like seriously dont askOk fine ill tell you, As a kid I really loved gymnastics. I joined Cheer for all the stunts that they do. Yes it was fun but it was also pretty gay and not to my liking.Drama ClubFreshman year\u2026 Oh yes we performed an original play called: Clued In. This was a mystery play kinda like the game clue, Hence the name. In this play I was called \u201cMister Maid\u201d and If I remember right I poisoned and killed the main dude.Strategic Board Game ClubMe my brother and another guy created this club. Basically me and anyone else would meet up at the pizza place and we would all play a board game and Pizza. We disbanded after freshman year.Sophomore Drama Club (I spent most of the year with a girl)Since I really did not want to do much extracurriculars I decided that this would be my only one. I was the butler in a play called: The Importance of Being Earnest. I was also secret agent Dirk Smirk in another mini playJunior Drama ClubI quit drama club pretty recently but I did perform in one play. It was an original play written by a student, the play was called: Questing For Dummies. I played King Titus, the father of the quester whom I did not love.Art ClubI only joined because I wanted to hang out with a girl and I didn't really do anything. I quit after the art teacher left and I lost interest in said girl.BasketballBack to the girl again. She suggested that I do some sports so I said screw it and I did it. One of the best choices in my life. For hardly ever holding a basketball in my life, I learned quick and was able to play fairly well.TrackI literally just finished this like a week ago, and I am so glad that its over. My events were: 100 meter dash, 200 meter dash, 4 x 100 meter relay and Pole Vaulting.Pole Vaulting was my main event for over half of the season. My peak was about 10 feet which was an improvement of 4 feet in 2 weeks.I would have gone farther but I sprained my ankle vaultingAfterwards I was too scared to vault again so I became a full time sprinter.Fastest 100 was 13.2 seconds, Fastest 200 was 27ish seconds and our fastest 4 x 1 relay was 45 seconds.All in all I am pretty proud of my extracurriculars. It feels like it was been a long journey and I am on the last leg. If you actually read all of this, thanks xD ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore, so this is everything I\u2019ve done so far. Symphonic Band (9th and 10th grade)I\u2019ve been in band since 4th grade and music is such a huge part of my life, so I really can\u2019t imagine not doing this.Marching Band (9th and 10th grade)Ever since I saw the high school marching band perform back in 6th grade, I wanted to join marching band.Chamber Ensemble (9th and 10th grade)This is basically a bunch of select groups of musicians. Some of the chamber ensembles include Chamber Choir, Saxophone Ensemble (I\u2019m in that one), Select Strings (orchestra), and Flute Ensemble.Indoor Percussion (9th and 10th grade)It\u2019s pretty much marching band but indoors and just percussion. I played marching cymbals during my freshman year, but I plan on doing bass drum this year and snare drum in the future.Pit Orchestra (9th and 10th grade)Musical accompaniment for the spring musical.Academic Decathlon (9th and 10th grade)An international competitive club where your school creates a team of 6 people based on GPA and you compete against other students in categories such as mathematics, social science, literature, and an interview.Sailing (9th and 10th grade)I\u2019m a member of a local FJ sailing fleet. I do two races every week over the summer.Girl Scouts (9th and 10th grade)I\u2019m sure you all know what this is. I\u2019m working towards my Gold award, the highest award a Girl Scout can get. In essence, you have to address a problem within your community and create and implement a sustainable solution.Set Design (9th grade)Set design for the school play. Pretty self-explanatory.Young Politicians Club (10th grade)Also self-explanatory. We discuss current events and have debates and discussions.GEMS (Girls Excelling in Math and Science) (10th grade)Spoiler alert: you don\u2019t have to be a girl, excel in math, or excel in science to be in this club. I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s how it is. You basically do \u201cscience experiments\u201d like creating slime, and then discussing the science behind it. It\u2019s super simple and I pretty much only joined it because it probably looks good for college.Math League (10th grade)A competitive math team that competes at a national level.In the future, I plan on staying in all of these clubs and have leadership positions in many. Mainly, I\u2019d like to be President or Vice President of the Symphonic Band during my senior year, Woodwind Captain for Marching band during junior year, Drum Major for Marching Band during senior year, Vice-President of Academic Decathlon during junior year, President of Academic Decathlon during senior year, and maybe treasurer or secretary of the Young Politicians Club during senior year.
