            "answer_text": "No , I don\u2019t think the cutoff has anything to do with the time given to students to prepare. If students get 3 years for NEET to prepare that does not mean somebody will score 720/720 and cutoff would go 600+. If time was the criteria for selection , that would have simply meant that more you drop , more your chances of selection increase , but in reality reverse is seen as best rankers are the ones who are giving it for the first time Cutoff only depends on the level of paper & number of students appeared that\u2019s it.

            "answer_text": "Whether it may be JEE, NEET or other competitive exams which are delayed due to this coronavirus outbreak are going to raise their difficulty level as more students will score good than usual trend . If more candidates score good then eventually cutoff has to be increased and it is predicted that there will be rise in cutoffs. The cutoff will not skyrocket but significant increase than usual trend of cutoff will be observed. You should not get panic and worry about such cutoff things rather focus on practicing more and more questions in a systematic way in this time to surpass the competition. All the best. ",
