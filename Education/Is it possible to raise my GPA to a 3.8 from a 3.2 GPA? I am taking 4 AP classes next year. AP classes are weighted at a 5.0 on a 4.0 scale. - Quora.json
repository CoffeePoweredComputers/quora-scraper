            "answer_text": "That depends on how many courses you\u2019be already taken to getvthst GPA, and how msny courses you hsve left to take to complete your course work. You need to add up your grades and potential grades and do a dimple average to find out. If you have a GPA of 3.2, you are averaging 1 grade of A to every 4 B grades. You will need to bring that up to 4 grades of A to every 1 grade B grade to get from a GOA of 3.2 to a GPA of 3.8. You need to take every 3.0 grade and get 4 more 4.0 A grades to get to a GPA of 3.8 . If you have three courses that offer 5.0 for a grade of A left to take, each 5.0 course grade of A will bring up 1 of your B grades to 4.0, which will require 3 more 4.0 A grades for each B grade to bring up your GPA to 3.8. I\u2019d say you have your work cut out for you. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a simple math question. Roughly 75% of your GPA is fixed at this point; you can influence about 25% of it. If you get a 5.0 in 25% of your credits, what is the resulting GPA? That\u2019s the best you can expect, unless you are allowed to take more credits. You can dilute your current GPA by adding more credits and/or higher grades. You need to know: how many credits you have attained;how many credits you have yet to take; andhow your school calculates GPA.",
