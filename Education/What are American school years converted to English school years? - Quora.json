            "answer_text": "It\u2019s impossible to give an exact equivalent, as they\u2019re not really the same, and there\u2019s a lot more age variation in the US system. UK compulsory education begins in the September before a child\u2019s fifth birthday, so they can be anything from just four to just five when they start Reception, which is roughly equivalent (academically) to US Kindergarten. However US kindergarteners can be anything from four to six, depending on the State, and it\u2019s also much easier to delay a child who isn\u2019t yet ready. Then the US grades and the UK years are roughly equivalent, as far as the work goes, although even then things are taught in different orders, and there\u2019s a much wider ability level in UK schools, although less flexibility as far as age goes. So Year One in the UK has children who will turn 6 in the academic year from 1st September through to 31st August and there\u2019s almost no flexibility about that. But within a typical Year One classroom there will be at least three different ability groups (not that the children realise it). So some children at that age will already be reading and writing fluently, and some will be doing quite complex mathematics, some will still be at the beginning reading stage, and maybe struggling with basic number concepts, and the majority will be somewhere in the middle. The teacher (plus assistant, usually) will be teaching at two or three different levels, handing out and marking work at different levels, treating each child, as far as possible, as an individual. The US system mostly works by having one standard level of work for each grade, but a much wider age range. If a child hasn\u2019t mastered everything in that grade level by the end of the year, they may be held back. So I knew of one First Grade class, for instance, which had children as young as just-turned-six, and as old as eight-and-a-half. This kind of pattern continues throughout, with the US grade levels similar (but not the same) as the same UK year level, but typically with children about a year older. That\u2019s why the final year of US high schools is Year 12 (mostly around age 18) whereas in the UK there\u2019s an extra year, Year 13, which is for those who turn 18 during that academic year. This also explains why UK students are usually a year ahead as the Year 13 work and A-level exams are roughly equivalent to some AP courses or junior college in the US. It\u2019s also why most UK degree courses are three years, while US degree courses are more often four years. ",
