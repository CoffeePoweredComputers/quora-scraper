            "answer_text": "You want my honest opinion? Alright. Here it is. The benefits you get from doing IB isn\u2019t something the other high school curriculums such as A level or AP lack. Sure, IB has a lot of perks but education-wise, all three (A levels, AP, IB) are pretty much seen as equivalent by universities (if my own research has proven correct). In other words, you\u2019d be fine applying to university with all three (assuming your grades meet the criteria).  The IB program is advantageous in practical ways. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re doing the IB Diploma and all of a sudden, your banker father is caught in a major Wall Street money laundering scandal and you have to all of a sudden move to a new country and hide from them pesky government peoples at the SEC. Assuming you\u2019re innocent, unlike your father, you could enroll in an IB school near you and just pick up where you left off. Academically speaking of course. You\u2019d need to make some new friends obviously. That\u2019s a key perk that isn\u2019t emphasized enough.  Another perk is the Extended Essay and Theory or Knowledge stuff. Trust me when I say this. As much as it sucks having to write a 4000 word research essay, 1600 word semi-philosophy essay, and doing a 10 to 30 minute semi-philosophy presentation, it\u2019s a good thing. At my previous university (before I decided to switch to my current one), we had research assignments that had to be done before starting our group projects. I was pretty much the only one in the group that did the citations. I kid you not, it was only because of that reason that our group actually got grades. The other groups needed to redo their research because they hadn\u2019t cited anything. I\u2019m now at a different university but guess what my current assignment is? Literature reviews. You know why that\u2019s completely and totally fine? Because I had to do one for my Extended Essay. Moral of the story? Yes, it\u2019s tough that high school students have to do university level essays with proper research and citing. That being said, the more you get used to that kind of thing, the easier your first year or so of university will be. If you had been there when we were told to do literature reviews, you would have thought you were attending a funeral. I was probably the only happy one in the room.  This is just my own personal opinion but I think the fact that you can do 6 subjects in IB is also an advantage. \u201cWHAT???!!! Are you INSANE DUDE?\u201d Nah not really. I\u2019ll tell you why. I was previously enrolled at an engineering university for Aerospace Engineering. I hadn\u2019t really thought it through to be honest. I had always thought that I\u2019d be a pilot someday and taking Aerospace Engineering would be my ticket into the cockpit. I never really considered how hard it would be. That was my big fault. But the signs were there all along. I struggled in IB Physics HL. I got a level 5 but I seriously, seriously, worked hard for any grade above a fail grade. I even did a Physics EE in the hopes that this would impress the admissions office for my university (quick tip, it didn\u2019t). Even my Physics teacher was surprised when I told him I wanted to do Aerospace Engineering. The fact of the matter was that I was horrible with Physics. Not the Mathematics part of it per se. Just Physics. So what\u2019s the point of me telling you this? Well Physics HL happened to be, as implied, one of my three HL subjects. The other two, Economics and English Lang. and Lit., I did much better with. I got a level 6 in HL Econ (I was two percentage points off a level 7) and I got a level 7 in HL English Lang. and Lit. I also got a level 6 in SL Business (one percentage point off a level 7). I only took Business SL because it was more interesting to me than the other subjects I could pick. I had never taken business as a subject before so I figured I\u2019d give it a go. I didn\u2019t even try hard to get that level 6 in all honesty. SL Business was the subject I worked in the LEAST. Now guess what bachelor\u2019s degree I\u2019m currently studying. If you guessed \u201cInternational Economics and Business Economics\u201d, you would be correct. If I hadn\u2019t been so stubborn and seen the signs early on as to which subjects I was good at, I would have never needed to go through the headache of applying, and then leaving, an Engineering uni. The fact that you\u2019re able to take 6 subjects at IB, to me, is an opportunity to realize, and hopefully accept, that you\u2019re good at some subjects rather than others. With A-levels for example, this isn\u2019t possible. You\u2019re locked into 3 or 4 subjects for the two last years of high school and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not sure if you can change subjects mid way. That\u2019s my long winded way of saying that IB allows you to explore other potential subjects you\u2019d be interested in. In Dubai, where I did IB, the popular final two year curriculums were A levels, AP, and IB. Had I done AP or A levels, I doubt I would be where I\u2019m at now. I was very unfocused on what I wanted to truly do. I liked traveling and therefore thought that being a pilot would be cool but I never stopped to really ask myself if I had what it takes. Now I\u2019m more into corporate finance. You know. All that boring financial news stuff with Wall Street and glamorous investment banking? Yeah. That\u2019s the stuff that excites me more than the prospect of being a pilot. Sure being a pilot is still cool to me. I\u2019d love to be a pilot but when I consider the fact that being a pilot actually involves sitting for hours and battling jet lag, I get a little less enthusiastic. See what a change that is? I didn\u2019t realize it in IB but in hindsight, it was necessary for me to experience. That\u2019s just my opinion though. The advantage of realizing early on what you\u2019d be good at or bad at is crucial for those who aren\u2019t sure of what they want to do in university or in future.  There are still PLENTY of advantages I could talk about but I think I\u2019ll leave it there for now. From my experience, those are some important ones you could consider if you\u2019re tasked with choosing IB or other curriculums. Remember. I\u2019m not saying A-levels or AP are inferior. I\u2019m not one of those pretentious IB students (or former IB students) who thinks IB is the ultimate curriculum. Truth is, it doesn\u2019t matter what you take in high school. It doesn\u2019t matter when you get to uni and matters even less when you get a job. A-levels and AP have their own perks. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Anyway to wrap this long-ass answer up, I\u2019ll just say this. IB has many, many advantages over the other curriculums. So too do the other curriculums over the IB diploma. It just depends on what kind of education you\u2019re personally looking for. I\u2019ve answered questions related to the \u201cIB vs A-levels vs AP\u201d debate before but I\u2019m too lazy to link them here hehe. Sorry. Right. That\u2019s me done. I\u2019m gonna grab some lunch now. Hopefully that was a half-helpful answer! ",

            "answer_text": "I won't bother talking about the course content because this isn't something unique to the IB; the IB, A-levels, AP, Lebanese Baccalaureate, French Baccalaureate, and even your \u201cunrecognised\u201d high-school program (by unrecognised I mean you'd still have to do the freshman year in uni despite your high school material being equivalent to the other programs) all have very similar course content. In some areas, they probably go even more in depth than the IB. However, the IB does stand out in two areas which were, in retrospect, very beneficial for university. The practical work: Writing all those IA reports, the EE and the ToK essay were much more helpful than I'd imagined back then. Needless to say, lots of uni courses require you to write essays and reports and I was already familiar with the process. In my english course for instance, we were required to write a paraphrase of a text that was to be about as long as the text \u2014 this text was easily 1,500\u20132,000 words long but I found myself very calm at the prospect of typing something long because I had \u201cbeen there, [and] done that.\u201d All those IB essays and reports familiarised me with citation and more importantly IMMENSELY helped with my researching skills. University definitely requires that I learn new skills, but the IB laid a great foundation. The presentations (ToK and the English lit IOP) were also extremely helpful, as they aided me in improving my confidence, body language, and tone in public speaking (to be fair Model United Nations (MUN) also had a role, but my point remains) which I would also need in university. Hell, all these skills would be needed even after university, and the IB lays a strong foundation for that.I never thought I'd ever say this but\u2026 CAS. Yes, you read that right \u2014 CAS wasn't totally useless (in terms of helping me post-IB), contrary to what I was \u201cso sure of\u201d during the two years of IB. Although the effect was somewhat indirect, it was there nonetheless. For starters, CAS was the main reason I decided to enroll in MUN, and that program helped an insane amount in my public speaking skills and confidence which are very important in uni life (I mean outside of courses too). Because of CAS, I also volunteered with Caritas Lebanon which proved to be quite helpful when I had a project to interview some refugees here, Humans Of New York style. CAS also encouraged me to go for my first \u2018internship\u2019 at a construction/engineering company in the summer of IB1 which, looking back, was also very helpful. So yes, in hindsight\u2026 CAS wasn't all that bad.The IB can be a very tough program, but it so can any other \u2014 honestly most of the talk about you going into a phase of depression and insanity while being locked away in your room for the duration of the two years is complete BS and exaggeration \u2014 unless you very stupidly decide to leave everything for the last minute. Yes, the added element of all that practical work makes it quite tough, but I guarantee that if you work diligently and with good time management, you will be telling yourself \u201cwell this is nowhere near as bad as everyone says it is\u201d and it will be totally worth it in the end.
