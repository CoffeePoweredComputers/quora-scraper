            "answer_text": " Simply from the golden words \u201cKnowledge is Power\u201d you can able to understand the importance of education in one\u2019s life. Education is an enlightening experience. Everything in our life is \u201cLearning\u201d. In this modern world, Skills are the major key to sustain in any working environment. The traditional learning system has failed in considering the individual learning requirements. While the online education system focused on offering the best experience of learning to the learners through flexible and comfort methods. This way Udemy had played a very important role in this field and became a pioneer in the E-Learning Business. The worldwide e-learning market is projected to be worth $325 Billion in 2025. The self-paced online learning market in the US is estimated to be worth $15.86 billion in 2021. E-Learning increases retention rates by 25% to 60%. The e-learning market is now more than 21 years old. A survey of 2,500 companies found that those with \u201ccomprehensive training programs\u201d have 218% higher revenue per employee and 24% higher profit margins. So Starting a business in E-learning is a good option either like Udemy nor like coursera. Why don't you try clone app of Udemy for your E-Learning platform business? It is the best option. As a business analyst, I will suggest you to buy the Udemy Clone Apps. All the best !! ",
