            "answer_text": "An amount of Rs.15 lakhs is a big amount, so needs to be invested wisely and cautiously based on your priorities and objectives.Further,an investment of Rs.35000 per month will help you a very good corpus in the long run. First of all,the way you invest your money is based on the following factors : 1.Your Finance Goals. 2.Your Risk Horizon. 3.Investment Period. Now,lets analyse the various alternatives for investing your money one by one : Traditional Investment methods like Savings account,Bank Fixed Deposits,Public Provident Fund(PPF),Post Office Savings Scheme(POSS)or Bank FDs etc.You can get a maximum interest of 6\u20138%p.a. by putting your money in such investment options.But,you can enjoy fixed returns and there is no risk attached to it. As per your details, you are already putting money in PPF ,that is fairly good.Investing in Gold : Gold has been an all time favourite of Indians since ages.We have seen the tremendous increase in the Gold prices over the past decade.Gold prices rise in times of Inflation.If you buy some gold when market is low, then there might be a possibility to get your desired returns in the long run.But,for that you will have to time the market i.e. buy when prices are low.Besides,traditional jewellery there are numerous other ways to invest in Gold like Gold Bullion & coins,Gold ETFs,Gold Mutual Funds etc.Mutual Funds : Mutual funds are instruments that pool in savings of various investors to invest them in shares, debt securities,money market securities etc. In simple words,Mutual funds further invest your money in :*Debt Instruments - Debt Mutual Funds. *Equity - Equity Mutual Funds. You might have heard this line \u201c Mutual funds are subject to market risk\u201d and that is true.There is always some risk attached while investing in mutual funds. Equity mutual funds are linked to equity so carry more risk as compared to Debt funds.But,based on historic data,equity funds perform better and yield high returns if the amount is invested for a longer period. However,if you still want to play safe, debt funds are a better option. In order to enjoy good returns you have to invest your money in Mutual Funds for a longer period and SIP is a good way to do it.For details on SIP you can refer What is SIP? What are the benefits of investing through SIP? ELSS or Equity Linked Savings Scheme : ELSS is a diversified equity mutual fund scheme with a minimum lockin period of 3 years. In ELSS majority of funds are invested in equities. ELSS performs well if invested for longer period.Direct Equity markets can provide you relatively higher returns based on your risk appetite.You can get 14%-18% or even higher returns if you invest in equity.But,there is a very high risk involved and returns are not assured. So,if you are new to investing it might be very risky for you.You have to be extra cautious while putting your funds in Equity since the returns are based on market fluctuations.Real Estate : This is a good Long term Investment Option but involves a huge sum of money.So,practically you should plan for it once you have parked some money for other needs like Insurance,Retirement funds,emergency funds etc.Your property might appreciate immediately or it might take years for its prices to rise based on Market fluctuations.You can keep some of your funds in Fixed Deposits and Diversify the rest to build a Sound Financial Portfolio. Have a diversified portfolio comprising of : Short term Investments and Long term InvestmentsFixed Interest bearing and slightly riskier ones to get maximum returns.Don\u2019t forget to take adequate risk cover in the form of Health Insurance and Term Insurance to protect your family.Consider Insurance as an essential part of your Financial portfolio and not just another investment option.

            "answer_text": " How to invest 15 lakh rupees in India without risk of loss? There is always a threat of \u2018loosing money\u2019 associated with investment. When we invest money there will always be a risk factors associated with it. World learned a tough lesson during 2007-2008 financial crisis. After suffering heavy losses, people have become resistant to equity investing. People are finding solace in keeping their money locked in bank deposits or other debt plans. People are no longer buying direct equity (stocks) or even indirectly through mutual fund. All investment options are risky? Yes, all investment options carry some inherent risk. Regardless of the type of investment vehicles, there is always certain level of associated risk-of-loss. Even our so called risk free options pose risk for investors. But its true that this risk is bare minimum. Savings Account & Term Deposits \u2013 Though being a savings account, it still pose some risk of loss. Recently we have seen how much Indian Rupee has devalued. At one time it was trading at Rs 45/$. Now Indian Rupee is close to Rs 60/$. Such devaluation of currency drastically reduces our purchasing power. It also leads to higher inflation. This further complicates the situation for common men. Banks keep providing the same interest rates on savings deposits (which is already low). Money keeps gets devalued as returns relative to inflation gets negative. In such cases money is depreciating instead of appreciating. Bond \u2013 Bonds are traditionally one of the safe investment option. But the risk associated with bonds is inherited from its issuer. Bonds can be issued by a government or a public company. Government bonds are considered very safe. Not safer than bank\u2019s savings account, but still very safe. Consider the example of Eurozone crisis (like Greece). Generally government issues bonds to public to raise money. The raised money are then used to fund economic growth. Increased economic growth means more taxes for Government. A part of those taxes are used to pay returns to bond holders. In Greece the expected growth could not be reached. The result was, bonds failed to give its expected returns. This situation was not limited only to Greece. Neighboring countries like Italy, Portugal, Spain etc faced the same problems. Retirement Linked Savings Plan \u2013 Our retirement linked savings are safe only if inflation remains at moderate levels. In last 4-5 years, inflation was behaving stubbornly. Net of inflation returns of retirement linked savings are nearly zero. Even though we are contributing judiciously to our retirement funds, but high inflation plays a spoil sport. New Indian government (NDA) and RBI is taking steps to curb inflation. Otherwise, if such high inflation level continues, long term returns (15-20 years) will be drastically effected.So what is the conclusion? When we opt for risk-free investment in India, its only a misnomer. Till government keeps control on inflation (>6%), our invested money is at risk. So in this high-inflation environment, how to invest 10 lakhs rupees in India? Forex fluctuation is another factor that holds us to take advantage of risk-free investment. So how to invest our money intelligently? The only possible escape route for common man in India is to practice long term investment. In long term investment we are not obliged to invest only in risk free options. Long term investment will allow us to invest in Equity. A decent investment horizon should be > 5 years? But which investment to buy? With the time horizon of >5 years, one can try equity investing. Equity is risky but longer holding reduces the risk. But before buying equity, analyze your risk profile\u2026 First Learn About Equity/Stocks: A person who has more knowledge about investment options can manage higher risks. A novice is most likely to loose money in stocks because of lack of know-how. Lack of knowledge about stocks enhances the risk. Investing in options that we know increases our risk taking capability. Informed investors takes calculated risks. A stock may seem like a risky-decision to us, but a professional may still buy it because he know its fundamentals & valuation. Common men prefer more risk-free options than equity. We know returns of bank deposits as we track it regularly. But do we calculate fundamentals & valuation of stocks before buying it? No. It is only these two factors that will dictate the return of stocks. Common men often invests in options they do not know about. It is like aiming in the dark and then expecting to hit the bulls eye. Knowledge of stocks itself helps us to negates majority risks. People should spend considerable time analyzing companies fundamentals & stock valuations. Quantify Ones Minimum Risk Taking Ability: If one can quantify ones risk taking ability it will be best. This is a great tool to mitigate investment risk. The easiest way to understand ones maximum risk taking ability is by asking a simple question. As this to your self, \u201cHow must I can afford to loose without compromising standard of living & financial comfort\u201d? For me, I can afford to loose Rs4,500/month without compromising my standard of living and financial comfort. So my maximum risk taking ability is Rs 4500/month. How ones maximum risk taking ability helps in investing? It helps us to diversify investment portfolio. Suppose, you want to invest Rs 10,000/month. If your maximum risk profile is Rs 4,500/month, then you should diversify your funds like this: Equity (Direct Stocks) = 1 x Maximum risk taking ability = Rs 4,500/monthBalanced Scheme (Mutual Fund, ETF etc) = 1/2 x Maximum Risk Profile = Rs 2,250/monthDebt (Deposits etc) = Rs 10,000 \u2013 (4,500+2,250) = Rs 3,250/month.How to Invest 15 Lakh Rupees in DEBT LINKED PLANS (Mutual Funds) Investing outside stock market does not mean we have to play too defensive. Bonds can be a good compromise between stocks and bank deposits. Though bonds offers risk free return (like deposits) but their yields are better. We can invest in Bond though Mutual Funds. Investing in long term debt funds is best for small investors. A typical portfolio holding of debt linked mutual funds will look like this:  How to Invest 15 Lakh Rupees in BALANCED SCHEMES (ETF) Now, when bulk of your portfolio includes high yielding bonds, you can afford to take more risk. Investment in commodities like gold provides a good compromise between equity and debt. One such investment option available for investors is gold. But it must be kept in mind that even balanced schemes must be held for long term for positive returns. When investment holding period is long term, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF\u2019s) are best alternative. ETF are attractive option since their costs are very low compares to traditional mutual funds. ETF\u2019s are also very liquid as compared to mutual funds. ETF can bought and sold online like stocks by use of online trading accounts. In India some common operational ETF are Gold ETF, Index ETF, Banking sector ETF etc\u2026 How to Invest 15 Lakh Rupees in BALANCED SCHEMES (Balanced Funds) The balance is created due to the portfolio of this mutual fund. A typical balanced fund will invest nearly 65-75% of its funds in equity. The balance gets invested in less risky debt linked investment options. Long term return of balanced funds are also fantastic. How to Invest 15 Lakh Rupees in EQUITY (DIVERSIFIED EQUITY FUND) A diversified equity fund has unlimited potential. The kind of returns that a diversified equity fund can offer is unmatchable. Probably, even individual stocks cannot provide such high returns. But the only precondition is to stay invested for long term. In case of diversified funds, for me, long term means period more between 10-15 years. I personally invest in equity funds through SIP route. Not only it allows me to take advantage of dollar cost averaging but it also allows automatic investing.  ",
