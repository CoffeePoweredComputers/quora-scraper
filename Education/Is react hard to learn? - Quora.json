            "answer_text": "Well it depends If you know ES6 concepts like async, promises, fat arrow functions, lexical \u201cthis\u201d, modules etc. It will be easy. Not really easy per say but still it won't be super challenging to the point where you can't understand anything and you will have to double back a lot. If you don't know ES6 (maybe you paused using js in 2015 and now you are getting back into web or you just started using is) it will be a lot harder, and maybe even impossible. If you don't know the syntax of a fat arrow function, you can forget about understanding it and it's advantages over regular functions, modules are also \u201cimport\u201dant (see what I did there?) And classes can also be challenging to grasp especially if you are a beginner. Object oriented programming is not really as hard as people say. If you have good enough experience with any language, learning OOP in that language is easy but if you are just starting out (less then 1 year of experience) you can forget it. What I would suggest is you go and watch a full tutorial on ES6 orread the documentation or the books or however you learn, just learn ES6 and then you can venture into JavaScript Frameworks and for crying out loud do not use jQuery for everyday tasks. I understand using jQuery for a get request or something but using it to replace vanilla JavaScript when it doesn't pose any clear and overwhelming advantage is just not rational. I say this because s lot of beginners use jQuery to sort of replace vanilla JS which kind of gets on my and everyone else's nerves because when you give me code with jQuery and fat arrow functions and react syntax in it, I will send you back to rework it. Nobody has time to read that, it's like compiling it in your head. Fat arrow functions can be less messy if you use them properly, jQuery is always messy which is why I always avoid using it and try solving the task with vanilla JS before trying to do it with jQuery or whatnot and react is not extremely messy but the volume of files you have to deal with and the jumping back and forth can be nerve wracking especially if that code is messy. I have been a web developer since i was 13. That is 5 years and even though I may be young, trust me I know what I am talking about. I was there when the transition from es5 to ES6 happened so I know how difficult it can be to learn es6 if you haven't learnt anything more difficult then JavaScript so just hang in there and pull through, once one thing sets in place, everything else will make sense. Don't learn by remembering, learn by understanding. You think I know every method and function in JavaScript? Hell no, Google is still what I use most while programming. Also there are sites out there that explain in detail what every built in function and method does in JavaScript so use them. Also I would suggest to use stack overflow but only if you are really stuck with something and you can't don't the answer on Google because it is a toxic community and that is why I don't really approach them very often.

            "answer_text": "It depends a little bit on what you know from before. If you know JavaScript, React might look a little bit familiar and you should be able to pick up the basics quickly. If you\u2019re used to jQuery (and still knows JavaScript) of course, React might be hard at the beginning. They way you approach things using React is very different from jQuery, and the basics concepts when building applications don\u2019t always make much sense. Instead of learning React I would suggest taking a look at Vue.js instead. I did not like React when I first started learning it, but when I first looked at Vue.js it just clicked. ",
