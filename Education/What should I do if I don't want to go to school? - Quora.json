            "answer_text": "For Primary and Secondary schooling (anything at high school or before), school is honestly just a glorified day-care. You are in school for two reasons to introspect (knowing yourself well before you enter the real world arena) and to know how people interact in society. The introspection process is extremely important because the world is a ruthless place, and the only way to win in life is to be completely self-sufficient. School does not do this in any fashion. I would recommend in High school (I assume you are in High school cause skipping is something they would do) to think a lot about what you like and to join clubs and sports that emphasize community like Cross Country or wrestling. If your school does not offer what you want than make the club yourself. My friends and I started doing amateur rocketry over the summer because we were bored, and we ended up making a rocketry club at school. If you want to learn something use the internet. It is an amazing tool where you can get a terrific teacher in an instant. Also in the introspection process, you should learn how to teacher yourself. You are your best teacher because you know how you learn, and you give yourself the drive to succeed. The second lesson is learned by interacting with people. Students learning themselves at the same time as you are when humans are at their most primitive and instinctual. If you can learn their habits, you can predict what people do in certain situations every time when you grow up. You should get involved in school to make you want to go if you are bored of the mundane coursework. If you are trying to not go to school for a day, just don\u2019t go and hand in a \u201cmommy\u201d note to the school office unless your parents will force you to go then buck up. If there is a more serious problem, you need to let your parents know immediately. They will always be on your side, and at least, in American education, the school always caves in to the Parents\u2019 demands. ",
