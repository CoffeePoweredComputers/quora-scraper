            "answer_text": "That's a long time frame: 500 - 1500 AD, and worldwide. As if you were to ask how education was in the 20th century, just a hundred years, and didn't geographically limit the enquiry, your very unlikely to get a meaningful opinion in under 50,000 words, let alone asking for a thousand years of comparative educational history and opinion. Anyway if you were to take just England (not the UK, as it didn't exist), you'd find a largely agrarian population (>80%), with a total population between 1 and 2 million in the period, and before the invention of printing, largely illiterate. Though the 5% or so who entered a high/late medieval guilded crafts would have gone through a 7 year apprentice, starting around their 14th birthday, to become a master: Weaver, Mason, Shipwright, Armourer, Carpenter, Mariner, Dyer, Baker, Butcher, Tailor, Miller, Cobbler, \u2026 see: Medieval London Guilds. Which would likely have involved some rudimentary literacy and numeracy, as well as the craft, if only to be able to order materials, pay your taxes, tithes, fines, ... Though Maisons, Mariners, and Carpenters would require a bit more mathematics, and geometry, than a butcher or baker. But all would have undertaken a form of combined vocational and academic education. There are archives full of deeds, oaths, contracts, wills, witness statements, endowments, \u2026 that show many of these trades turned out bodies who could at the very least write their own name, and or invoice for their labour. Then the church comes into play, as the clergy were nominally litterate, and with upto 800 monasteries, 70 Schools, and 4 Universities in operation in medieval England. Turning out their minions, if for nothing else to occupy their many thousand Churches and calculate and collect the 10% Tithe on the populace of the parish, before you consider their role in collecting ecclesiastical court fines, arranging endowments for church works, selling indulgences, offering an international money transfer service, selling reliques, running guest / bath / whore houses for passing pilgrims, selling burial plots and grave attire, monopolising the freshwater fish trade, the book trade, and possibly reading from a big latin story book, several times a week. Though not all parishes posessed a bible. The church institutions also produced the clerks the Government relied on to record their own tax take, parliamentary proceedings, laws, and the sheriff's and judges to enforce contracts and tax collection, turn out a Domesday Book on a change of administration, and a few tutors for the wealthy. Though the ordained clergy only accounted for ~ 2% of the population, and not all would have undergone a formal latin grammar schooling, but would apparently likely had some basic numeracy and book-keeping tuition. Also a not insignificant number of the secular clergy ignored the new celibacy decrees, and spawned many a bastard in the parishes. Who often had some education from their Rev father, as did the children of the free (non tennant) farmers, as being able to read a few words of latin offered the Benefit of clergy, essentially a get out of compulsory archery practice, on a soggy Sunday, if not gaol card. Possibly accounting for another 5% of the population. The few thousand Jews in England would also likely have been proportionally more literate, for both religious tradition, and their restriction to money lending, pharmacy, trading\u2026 all generally litterate activities. Before you consider the Aristocracy, who would more likely than not had some tuition in their youth, as would some of their household, eg. Robert de Brus had his cooks witness a number of charters and contracts signed at his family estate in Essex (There were Cookbooks around as well). So most warlords by the high medieval period would likely be able to read and write their own name, and a fair proportion would be conversant in bad French poetry, as was expected of a Nobel of the period, and possibly have a little latin. As the males would have also been schooled in ridding, falconry, archery, swordsmanship, dance, \u2026 , before they were Knighted in their own right, and the females in embroidery, and double bad french romantic poetry. Very few would have had an Oxford, Cambridge, Northampton, London college education, and even fewer be exposed to the proto-science of the likes of Roger Bacon, while there. So a time when vocational, rather than academic education was dominant, and what academic training there was was likely targeted at book-keeping. So 15% of the male, and 3% of the female, would be the likely upper bounds for the educated / litterate population.

            "answer_text": "For most part, either practical on the job training, or exclusive. Most commoners never learned to read. Most of them just worked on their parents\u2019 farm until they died, or until they cleared their own land and then died. With luck, they could get into apprenticeships, learning their profession by following instructions and directions from their masters. With even greater luck, you could learn to read and write as part of the apprenticeship. If you were rich and/or noble, you could have a teacher brought to your manor or even send your (usually grown) children to university, where they could learn to read and write. Textbooks were in Latin. The main subjects were theology, medicine or law. The main escape into education was the monestaries. Even lay brothers/sisters learned Latin simply by being in that environment. Many were taught to read and write. This was more often than not the only way that a poor commoner could get something resembling an education. ",
