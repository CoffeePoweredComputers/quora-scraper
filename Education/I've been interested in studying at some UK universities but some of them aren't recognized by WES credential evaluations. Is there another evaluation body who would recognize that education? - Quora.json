WES says that \u201cIf your own country does not recognize the institution or program, then WES cannot evaluate the institution or program\u201d. I would be surprised if, as a reputable credential evaluation agency, they refused to recognise any legitimate UK universities. Legitimate UK degree awarding bodies can be found at Check if a university or college is officially recognised or via Search for a university or college. ",

All that you need to check is that the university has a Royal Charter (meaning that Her Majesty the Queen personally endorses the quality of its teaching and research) and that the department in which you would be studying earned a high score in the most recent Research Excellence Framework (meaning that it is respected by comparable departments around the world).
