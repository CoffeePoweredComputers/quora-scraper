However, many in my school performed very well and scored 90%+ though they used to get very less marks in school term examinations. [So, the thing is you have to have a strategy to score good marks in any examination, I used to study for gaining knowledge (for which, sometimes I receive appreciation and other times no applause at all)]. However, I had performed very well in XII, while most folks performed poorly as compared to their X. This time I had used guide books (besides NCERTs and reference books). And it worked! I was happy with the results because I used to estimate my marks rationally and not like how I used to do in X : KUCH KUCH LIKHA HAI TOH KUCH MARKS TO MIL HI JAANE CHAHIYE. ",
