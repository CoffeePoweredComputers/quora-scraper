            "answer_text": "This is the classic \u201cset-up\u201d question. It sets up the Christian salvation doctrine of exclusivity as appearing to be unfair and unjust, let alone dogmatically parochial and intolerant. \u201cIf you don\u2019t join our club you\u2019re going to burn in hell forever\u201d\u2026 hahahahaha\u2026 (diabolical laughter added for effect) What if what Christians believe and what is written in the Bible is actually true? What if it is not something man-made\u2026 a man-made doctrine, but it is actually true? What if Jesus Christ is really God come to earth to save the race of sinners\u2026 i.e. human beings that have all rejected God , their Creator as indeed being God their Creator. What if sin was the cost of giving us all freedom to have our own wills independent from the will of the One who created us? What if as a result we all blow it big time - because we all- in essence- are addicted to being our own little gods? What if that is all true? If it is then God might have His own exclusive plan and means of opening a door back to fellowship with Him. It just might be a plan He has communicated and executed. Here is the bottom line - if you can and would believe it: Human beings are all equally fallen away from fellowship with God. Each one of us can look at the \u201cnorm\u201d of relationship with God the Father in the Son, Jesus Christ. Reading the book of John can give one a perspective of how disconnected we are from the fellowship norm with our God by looking at Jesus\u2019 relationship with His Heavenly Father. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Even worse we all are born into this sin, congenitally inheriting the original of Adam and Eve. We therefore end up cultivating our own hell with the desires that burn within us during our short stay in this short life. If the afterlife is basically two dualistic options\u2026 i.e. reward or punishment\u2026 Our reward would be having our cultivated earthly desires fulfilled forevermore (heaven) or our cultivated earthly desires unfulfilled endlessly (hell). My answer to this question: \u2026 if God is the reward at the end of this short life and we are cultivating a love for God, we will have heaven in our grasp. If we are cultivating desires other than God - we are cultivating an afterlife of hell. The question is then how does one cultivate a love for God in this life?\u2026 and even more\u2026 does one even want to? If the Gospel is true than the only way is to have God Himself cleanse us of our sinful desires for something other than Him and give us His own Spirit that enables us to love Him in this life and forever more. Jesus Christ died for our sins, taking them upon Himself and in return giving us Himself\u2026 this transaction is done simply through believing it from the heart\u2026 this is very Good News! \u2026a work and sign of God\u2019s grace and mercy in your life. The question then does not in the end rest on answering some theological or philosophical debate, but simply \u2026 Can you believe it? Do you believe this? ",

            "answer_text": "You are asking two separate questions: (1) Are non-Christians allowed into heaven; AND (2) what does \"Christian scripture\" have to say about whether non-Christians are allowed into heaven? Which is a nonsense-question, since Christianity did not exist when ANY of the Bible was put into writing; even the Christian Testament was written by Jews, and a few \"pagans,\" 200 to 300 years before \"Christianity\" evolved. Here are some more questions: What is heaven? Does everyone agree on what heaven is? Has everyone on Earth ever agreed on what heaven is? Has anyone been to heaven and returned to tell us what heaven is like? If so, how do we know the alleged returnee was not crazy, deluded, or hallucinating? (Buffy the Vampire Slayer does not count, alas.) If you're a bibliolater \u2014 that is, if you believe that the Bible, a human artifact, is as perfect and \"inerrant\" as God is \u2014 you need to be able to explain Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Abaddon, Tartarus, \"hell,\" Paradise, the \"third heaven,\" and \"ordinary\" heaven, all of which appear in the Bible as afterlife destinations for humans whether or not those humans jumped through the hoops prescribed by followers of the Christian Testament. The myths that most people believe in today, the harps and wings and haloes on the one hand and the fiery pit of eternal agony on the other, both have virtually nothing to do with either the Bible or what may or may not happen to living creatures when they die. God is perfect and thus perfectly good. God is everywhere (\"omnipresent\"). If God is everywhere, that means there is no place, either literal or metaphorical, where God is not. In other words, if hell exists, God is there, right this minute, suffering the torments of damnation right alongside those who are condemned.  I do not, myself, believe that God is a masochist. When I was in seminary, one of my professors remarked that whether or not you believe in hell, you don't have to believe hell has any occupants. A different professor commented that she had no idea how any Christian could be happy in heaven, knowing that other people were being tortured for all eternity \u2014 for \"crimes\" like eating a strip of bacon on a Friday before the pope gave you permission to, for example. I believe that \"God is love\" (1 John 4:8). If God is good and God is love, it doesn't matter where I \"go\" after I die: God will be present with me, and it will therefore be good. And if God is NOT good and God is NOT everywhere and God does NOT love all of God's creation, then I don't care what happens after I die; in that case, I hope I just dissolve into nothingness. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, I think the first premise to answer this question is to define what a Christian is. According to Acts chapter 11, it states that the Disciples were first called \u2018Christians\u2019 in Antioch. This means, that a Disciple of Jesus and a Christian are the same thing. This is very important. Now, let\u2019s look at what we must do to become a Disciple of Jesus. According to Jesus, he says,\u201d Whosoever does not FORSAKE all that he has, CANNOT be my disciple.\u201d Therefore, if someone has not forsook all that they own, then to Jesus\u2019 standards, you are not a Christian. Now that we have that all cleared up, let me move onto your question. No, it is not possible for a non-Christian to get into heaven. The reason is because, they may not \u2018classify\u2019 themselves as Christians in the traditional sense, but by their actions they show that they are Christians. What I meant is, if someone follows Jesus\u2019 teachings without knowing Jesus taught it, then they are considered Christians in God\u2019s eyes. Furthermore, when someone acts out of love, then they are Christians. The Bible says that God is love. Which means, nobody can do any act of love, WITHOUT God being there. The best example of this is the \u2018Good Samaritan story\u2019. This is a parable of a Samaritan man (heathen in Bible times) who showed compassion on his fellow neighbour, thus fulfilling the second greatest commandment (love your neighbour as you love yourself). Jesus said this man was right with God, while the Levite and Pharisee (highly respected religious people) who just walked passed the same man, were not right in God\u2019s eyes. Can you see what God is looking at? He doesn\u2019t care is someone \u2018classifies\u2019 themselves as Christians. What God is truly looking for are people that are ACTING like Christians. Therefore, whoever acts like a Christian (showing love to others by obeying Jesus\u2019 teachings) will be saved, whoever does not (show love to others etc.), will be condemned. Hope this helps.

Born in Denmark, I was baptized in the Lutheran Church of Denmark, and my Finnish great-grandfather was a prominent parish priest in what is now Russian Karelia, the most fertile part of Suomi seized by Stalin after the Great War. Living in Japan for 30+ years, I like most Danes, did not go to church much, except now and then for weddings and funerals. Instead I was immersed in the native Shinto and Buddhist rites and beliefs of Japan. Stood under a waterfall in a loincloth doing my \u798a\u3002 Misogi. Why not? \u201cBetraying my Faith?\u201d Negatory. It took me quite a long time to realize the great, wonderful and spiritually empowering truth: Whatever gods and Gods there may be, they only reveal themselves via Nature, the cycles of birth, growth, and death, forever. Fortunately they are too grand, too distant, too busy to give one or another human tribe much attention. Life on Earth, maybe, depending on how rare it is in the solar system. Israelite, Mayan, Aztec or Japanese ancient sun-worshipper. Sure why not, all of you are as right as you are wrong. We can all see the Godness in Nature everyday, yet we also seek to wreck it, everyday. There is an original sin - the inability to reconcile our greed with our responsibility for maintaining this delicate green-blue planet DESPITE our greed. Hello. Any true connection to Divinity would have to focus on us humans as spoilers of the grandeur of Nature. Only simpletons think \u201cGod gave this to us, alone.\u201d Most of you will disagree. All religions are political in nature and aspiration. To control you and your thoughts, behavior and beliefs. All are man-made fictions. Oh, no kidding, this guy Peter may be right. They are all fictions. Welcome to the rest of your REAL LIFE. We have problems enough without religious and sectarian strife. Nearly all conflicts are between family members or their kin fighting to gain control of the money, the power, the influence. Seriously. Caesar, Augustus, Cleopatra, Spence, Xi Jinping?

Mark 12:28-34\u2026..There is no commandment greater than these\u2026..Matthew 22:34-40\u2026.All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37\u2026..\"What is written in the LAW?\"... \u201cDo this and you will live.\u201dGalatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201dJames 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself\", you do well;Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.John 13:35 \"By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.\"Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.John 10:30, \u201cI and the Father are one.\u201dJohn 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\ufeffMatthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father\u2019s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.James 2:17-18 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, \u201cYou have faith; I have deeds.\" Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.Thus Christians are to live by the Golden Rule in their behavior and treatment they do toward others in order to go to heaven. And when we look at other religions that also preach the Golden Rule, to then reach enlightenment, Nirvana, breaking the circle of life, Moskha, Samsara, etc\u2026 they do speak of the same achievement from the deed of the Golden Rule. Our deeds of mutual respect and love toward one another is the key and criteria to that afterlife reward. I believe Christianity, is just one of the ways of getting to heaven or whatever one wants to call it, such that in that choice of path, one has to choose to believe in what Christ said to do in the LAW, the Great Commandment, while those who choose other path of other religions (including atheism) to live by the Golden Rule, they also reach the same destination.

            "answer_text": "If you are getting too many No then I think it is time to re-phrase the question with a default answer. Where did \u201cGautam Budha\u201d go Gautama Buddha - Wikipedia ? HELL !!! (I thought of asking here at If true Christian can only reach to Heaven, where did \"Gautam Budha\" go then or any of the great prophets of other religions and all the great son/daughter of the soil? ) And for anyone if answer to the re-phrased question is YES then we have appreciate him/her for fine his/her fine sense religion and heaven and hell. Actually when you hear NO what they basically mean is christian heaven (I can imagine as a fine creation by first generation of christian population when they died by selectively choosing good/obedient set of people & then further to this setting up a selection/screening examination at the entrance & guide book of which goes as HOLY BIBLE) and similarly christian hell. No don\u2019t be shocked, that\u2019s natural human attitude towards religion, first we divide creatures based upon their shape/size,then human based upon their skin color, living standards, nations, gender etc\u2026then we divide GODBad. But, worse thing is that in the entire process we fail to understand that mere reason of existence of so many religion over time is that man never succeeded to fully obey the universal religion of humanity which just instructs us to live & to help others live . Human with a few trillion micro-computer feed in their brain fail to understand that all religion (be it Christian-ism, Islamism, Hinduism or anything else) are mere assistance (ways) to obey that universal religion of humanity. The purpose of religion is neither to find heaven nor GOD, otherwise Jesus wouldn\u2019t have taken birth to revel himself instead would have given this world a puzzle to solve. Now, if you agree to above then you can very easily understand that there is no two GOD & thereby no two religion it is only the dictations from the same GOD over time which differ. Not because GOD wanted to confuse us, but because with the evolution of time human ability to communicate or understand things have changed. e.g. today we understand more scientific/logical/philosophical talks, a few centuries ago we were comfortable on poetry/story/painting etc. If you are still struggling then you need to ask yourself do you think if the same Jesus come back once again (which is also a mentioned fact & much awaited by the world today) will look same & narrate exactly the same sentences. No. Can we be confident we will be able to identify him immediately. No (How many people did identify him on his last visit? Very less. Otherwise why he was crucified?). So, to re-iterate again there is no 2 GOD & no 2 religion. They just differ on face value i.e. name & narration of principle of universal religion. Just imagine if someone name changed from X to Y that very person doesn\u2019t really change from A to B (it is still the same old person), same is the case here for religion, same is the case for GOD & same is the case for Heaven too. Now, we need to ask ourselves a very vital question i.e. What is heaven? I call it a wonder world where no physical body can travel (hence science dealing with gross matter fails to recognize). It\u2019s a perfect world where only purified sole/mind can attain. How do we purify ourselves? Well, detailed knowledge you can just try practicing any religion that fits your fine sense of understanding. But, just to keep it short I can tell you that \u201cHe who trains his/he mind during his/her lifespan here, are the only one who attains to heaven, nobody else\u201d, \u201cHe who finds everything beautiful and GODly here in this planet, which is nasty one for many other millions, are only one who attains to heaven, nobody else\u201d. As Jesus said \u201c I am the truth, I am the life\u201d, now if you read it very carefully you can observe the fine angle which should tell you that \u201cin life only lies the truth\u201d & the ultimate truth is Jesus or GOD himself. Further to this even though there are so many contradicts among religious scriptures (mostly planted by the people who own or they think they own the administrative faculty of a particular religion), but there is one commonality which is LOVE. It tells you to love every being and everything, serve everything with LOVE imagining it as GODly. Someone able to understand & obey this principle has already excelled in all religion & thereby purified his/her soul & hence is the most qualified candidate to attain to heaven, NOT the one who has read thousands of literature & philosophical books and yet failed to cleanse his/her soul.

            "answer_text": "First, some answers are from Christians, some from those who are apparently not. The question is phrased seemingly to solicit \"Christian\" answers.  A very \"hot button\" question. In a broad sense, Christianity certainly provides for people who lived before Jesus Christ being either sinners, but \"pleasing in the sight of the Lord\" (e.g. Abraham, Joseph, David, etc.) or \"wicked sinners before the Lord (Ahab and Jezebel, etc.). This would seem to suggest that one could at least be \"pleasing\" to the Lord, or at least that He countenanced their earthly efforts at pleasing Him, versus those who overtly displeased Him.  However, it is also noted that, once Christ was resurrected, and the Gospel began to be preached, Christianity made it clear that (whatever \"works of righteousness\" we might properly and rightly perform), salvation is by faith in Christ as savior. In other words, we cannot \"work our way into Heaven\" or in any way \"earn\" salvation by dint of sheer effort. We are \"forgiven\", truly, by God's good pleasure, through the shed blood of Christ and His atonement. There is no question of \"paying God back\" for our sins, or \"working off our debts\".  But not everyone who has ever lived has heard the Gospel message. When the question comes up as to \"What about those who never heard?\", many otherwise conservative Christians become contentious. I have heard bible-believing Christians who will flatly state that, \"except they believe, they cannot be saved\", who then conclude that people who lived outside the range of the Gospel are damned. For me, this seems far too \"doctrinaire\" and unjust, and unworthy of God, Who is benevolent and merciful toward all men, and does not take pleasure in judgement or punishment. One sometimes finds this belief among those who are often called \"Calvinists\", since (in keeping with their theories of soteriology... \"how salvation works\") they believe that no person \"accepts\" the Gospel of their own will. Rather, God \"elects\" some to belief and salvation. Hence, for them, the damnation of a Indian peasant who lived 500 years before Christ is no \"injustice\", for the American businessman of today would not \"come to faith\" unless God selected him for such.  This, I must confess, seems not only inordinately unjust and unmerciful, but also extremely contrived. The thoughts of someone who is more concerned that their understanding of doctrine and scripture \"all adds up\", even if it means that countless millions who are no more sinners than we are, should be arbitrarily dropped into Hell. My own thoughts (for what little they are worth) are that God will use the Christian era to establish principles of salvation which will, on Judgement Day, then be applied to all that ever lived. There will be people who did not \"hear the Gospel\" (as we understand it), as they lived before or outside its range. But there was always a \"God-given yearning for it in their hearts\" and, upon hearing it, they will always rejoice in it. (Do not missionaries often find this to be the case... that when the message of Christ is first preached in an area, there is an immediate rejoicing of some upon hearing it, while others are seemingly indifferent or hostile?) In any event, since the observable consequences are the same... some receive it, some do not... the \"Arminian vs. Calvinist\" debate would seem very difficult to resolve \"empirically\". After all, what man could possibly \"see\" what the Holy Spirit of God is secretly doing in someone's heart? One cannot tell what a person who has heard the Gospel \"would have done\" if they had not ever heard it. We must, in faith, leave such matters to the wisdom of God Himself and, for our part, do the best we can to carry out His instructions to us in this life.  But both sides of the debate will tell you this... If you have heard the offer of salvation, rightly presented, warning of impending judgement from God against all sin, and if you know yourself to be a sinner, then the question of what becomes of \"non-Christians\" is simply no longer relevant to you. If by \"non-Christian\", one means (as I have interpreted it) \"a person who simply has never heard the Gospel of Christ about repentance and salvation through faith\", then you are not in that class. People in the western world today are (with perhaps a few exceptions here and there) NOT \"ignorant\" of the doctrines of human sinfulness, of coming judgement against all sin, and of the offer of salvation through faith in Christ. Those in the civilized world today are thus not \"naive non-Christians\". They are, rather, \"anti-Christians\". In fact, I am seeing, with increasing frequency, a tendency for people to refer to themselves specifically as \"anti-theists\". For such people as those.... no. There is, in the light of the Christian Gospel, no hope for such persons at all. They have certainly sinned. They have certainly condemned and judged sin in others, while allowing and excusing it in themselves. They will, therefore, inevitably incur God's wrath and judgement. And they will not be able to say that they were not warned. A very big (and dreadful) difference between \"ignorance\" and \"rejection\". ",

            "answer_text": "There is no doubt, if you have heard the gospel (good news that Jesus Christ, God Almighty, was manifested in the flesh, lived a perfect and sinless life, died on the cross suffering our wrath and shedding his blood to atone for our sins, was buried fore 3 nights and 3 days, and arose the third day, never to die again. He is presently ascended to the right hand of the Father making intercession for the saints of God.) and you reject the gospel which means you reject Jesus Christ and what he did for you, then yes, you can\u2019t go to heaven. If you have chosen a false God or no God, then you have made a choice. Jesus Christ states clearly below what to expect at the judgement. John 3:13-21 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. Now there is what is called generally the age of accountability, and prior to that age, we believe that God will not judge that soul harshly\u2026.I don\u2019t believe there is a set age for this because I can\u2019t find one in the Bible. As far as those that have never heard the gospel, God will judge equitably\u2026 Romans 2:11-16 For there is no respect of persons with God. 12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 13 (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. 14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) 16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. The issue lies in if men have rejected. Their rejection does not necessarily just affect them, it affects their family, friends, town, city, nation. God has sent out missionaries for 2000 years that have faced much persecution, hardship, and martyrdom for their service. Those choices of those men in those days to reject, will have direct effect on themselves, but could also literally affect their family line and country depending on their stature in life for generations. This principle can be seen from the 10 commandments: Exodus 20:5-6 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. This is not a light subject nor easy and pat answer. In the end, God knows. I don\u2019t. What I do know is if you read this, you have no excuse. What has been your choice? God judges the motives of the heart. Every action, every thought, every word spoken is recorded in heaven and you will be judged by those things one day. As written above, God writes his law in our hearts, and by that alone we will be judged. If we look up and see the heavens and all their glory, you have to judge, where did this all come from? By accident, or by a creative hand? We know many reject the notion of an Almighty creator God and his word and his Son. There is a judgement day for this. Just know you don\u2019t have to perish, but Jesus Christ is the only way. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10:8-13 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 \u00b6 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. All Scripture are from the King James version of the Bible. ",

            "answer_text": "No, because no one's works are good enough as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one. There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away; all alike have become useless. There is no one who does what is good, not even one. Romans 3:10-12 msb.to/Romans3:10-12 Try the Good Test http://www.areyouagoodperson.org/ The difference is that the Christian is justified before God because God sees Christ's righteousness, not the Christian's sin. Justification has often been defined as \"Just as if I'd never sinned.\" This thought conveys forgiveness, acquittal of the past sin at the time of new birth.But justification goes even further: God positively declares the person to be righteous. When God justifies us, His forgiveness does not merely make us neutral\u2014moral and spiritual zeroes. His forgiveness brings Him to look on us \"in Christ,\" as having His perfect righteousness. He credits or assigns Christ's righteousness to the trusting person. This does not make one personally righteous, but it declares that person righteous in a legal sense, his debt has been paid, his sins have been forgiven, and he is brought into right relationship with God. Paul stresses that we cannot be justified by the works of the law, for \"no one will be declared righteous in his [God's] sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin\" (Rom. 3:20). He goes on to explain: \"[We] are justified freely by his [God's] grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus\" (Rom. 3:24). The basis, or ground, of our justification, or being declared righteous, is twofold. \u2022 Christ's death as our substitute satisfied the claims of God's holy Law against our sin: 'While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!\" (Rom. 5:9) \u2022 God assigns us Christ's righteousness, based on His perfect obedience: \"Just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] the many [all people] were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man [Christ] the many [all who believe] will be made righteous\" (Rom. 5:19). Christ became identified with us when He was made sin for us on the cross. When we believe, we are given His newness of resurrection life, and we share His righteousness. Justification comes by faith. This truth burst upon the heart and mind of Martin Luther like a bombshell after a lengthy, unsuccessful struggle with self-flagellation to win God's favor. He saw the magnitude of the one truth: \"The righteous will live by faith\" (Rom. 1:17). He saw it was not what he could do to merit God's favor, but what God had already done for him at the cross. There Christ made justification and peace possible. The Protestant Reformation grew out of this discovery. Paul E.

            "answer_text": "The New Testament writings, including the Gospels, reflect a tension between exclusivity (only Christians allowed into heaven) and inclusivity (Christ's sacrifice was sufficient to reconcile everyone to God). In the Gospel of St Mark you'll find: \u201cHe that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he who does not believe shall be damned\u201d which is an exclusive statement, however in 1 Timothy you'll find: \"...we have put our hope in the  living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who believe\" which counts both believers and non-believers in God's saving act. The writers of the Gospels, Acts and the Pauline letters struggled to understand the significance of His death and resurrection, and how far God's grace is extended through it. This tension is also found in the writings of the early Church as well. Origen and Gregory of Nyssa wrote about the \"apokatastasis\" or the ultimate reconciliation of all things to God at the end of time.  The more contemporary writings of Hans Kung, Karl Rahner who labeled non-believers \"anonymous Christians\" (in other words Christians who don't know it yet) and others, explore this as well. The Vatican issued a teaching in Dominus Iesus that touches on the salvation of non-Christians which Pope John Paul II later clarfied by writing: \"This confession does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points  to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom man and God are united.\".  This is one of those doctrines that can' t be proven by simple prooftexting. One problem, is that the Gospels often use poetic language (in a language completely unrelated to English) which doesn't lend itself to literalism. Many Christians translate phrases like \"Kingdom of God\" or \"eternal life\" as meaning \"heaven\", \"lake of fire\" or \"Gehenna\" meaning \"hell\", and \"saved\" meaning going to heaven when 1st Century Jewish Christians may not have necessarily understood or used these words in this way. There is also an assumption (which isn't supported by scripture, which is silent on this matter) that God cannot work God's grace beyond the grave. In other words, once you die, that's it. You can't grow or change.  Most Christians would agree that Christ is the gatekeeper. \"No one comes to the Father but through me\" however whether this means only professing Christians, or whether others will be let through that gate, is ultimately in God's hands not ours. The Eastern Orthodox say: \"We know where Christ is, but we don't know where Christ isn't\" and leave it at that. Christians should be in the salvation business, not the damnation business.  I believe that God's grace overcomes all our limitations - even those of us (which will be everyone in some way, myself included) who believe things that will ultimately turn out to be wrong. At the same time I wouldn't identify myself as a universalist because I believe that God endowed us with free-will, which means we can choose to live apart from God, assuming that we fully understand that choice and still desire to do so - something that may not be possible given our limitations here on Earth. It's hard for me to believe that people can't grow or change beyond the grave, so that perhaps over time, many in hell will accept Christ's call, simply walk out of it and into heaven. Because of that it remains my hope that, while I believe that eternal Hell exists, it will ultimately be empty. ",

No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d Jesus\u2019s work on the cross, his atoning sacrifice, says that there is nothing that you or I can do to earn our way into heaven. Anyone from another religion or even inside the fold of \u201cChristianity\u201d who relies on their own good works will not enter the kingdom of heaven. What Christianity teaches is that each one of us falls dramatically short of the standard of God (Romans 3:23) and that we are fully incapable of getting to heaven on our own merit. We need Jesus\u2019s righteousness to stand in our place before a holy God because we are all wicked sinners in his sight. This is not a popular opinion today even among self-proclaimed Christians. Many of these people would distort the Gospel and say that we are capable of doing \u201cgood: and that even doing \u201cgood\u201d is our primary goal as Christians. Some adhere to universalistic ideas and believe in universal reconciliation which essentially says that the Father will ultimately accept all. This is not only contradictory to historical Christianity but to one of the primary aspects of God; righteousness. Would be want to live in a universe where it\u2019s Creator did not care for those who were wronged and didn\u2019t desire to set all things right? Many would concede to the notion that they do not want this but they merely want their own sins excused. They want God to dole out justice and to help the poor and oppressed as long as he is merciful to them. This is the dilemma that Jesus solves. He stands in our place and for those who believe in him he has taken on and absolved our sin. ",

            "answer_text": "The issue of going to heaven is not whether you are a Christian or not. What qualifies a person to be saved and heaven-bound is faith in Jesus Christ that results in good works. Now I will submit some scriptures to support my  postulation and assertion here. JOHN 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. JOHN 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.JOHN 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.EPHESIANS 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.TITUS 2:13-14Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. So a  person may be called a Christian, but if He is not born-again, being spiritually transformed, he will not make it to heaven (2 Romans 8:6-10; Galatians 5:15-21;  cf. Romans 6:4; Corinthians 5:17; 1 Peter 1:22-23). Bottomline: only those who live for Christ and whose names are written in His book of life will enter into heaven.\"And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life\" (Revelation  21:27 ).

            "answer_text": "I originally posted this as a comment, but thought it was long enough and probably worth posting as a full answer: Christ is not one of many paths. He said this himself:\u201c I am THE way, and THE truth, and THE life. NO ONE comes to the Father EXCEPT THROUGH ME.\u201d (John 14:6) This does not take much explaining; if Christ is who He said He is, then He must be the only way that anybody can get to heaven. This message is repeated by Peter, who said \u201cAnd there is salvation in NO ONE else, for there is NO OTHER NAME under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\u201d (Acts 4:12) With regards to the common claim that all religions teach the golden rule, this does not prove the truth of those religions or that they are a path that leads to heaven. As good as it is, following the golden rule has never and will never earn anybody a place in heaven. Think about it. Have you ever treated anybody else in a way that you would not like to be treated? If the answer is yes, then you have just proven your own guilt before God, who gave us the golden rule. The golden rule is not the only law given by God, but, even so, it is still enough to show that you deserve to go to hell. \u201cfor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3:23). If it is true that you have broken the golden rule (or any other law given in scripture or revealed through your conscience), then you have proven yourself incapable of earning your way into heaven. No amount of trying to improve yourself will work because YOU HAVE FAILED BEFORE YOU HAVE EVEN STARTED. Even if you lived the rest of your life perfectly (if you think you can, good luck!), you would still be sent to hell for the times earlier in your life when you didn\u2019t live perfectly. The only hope in this case is forgiveness, which leads to my next point. God is a perfectly fair judge; He will never give a punishment where there is no sin and will never withhold punishment where there is sin. The first is easy to agree to. I can assume that we both agree that if I am taken to court and it is proven that I am innocent but the judge fines me anyway that the judge is a bad judge. The second is more controversial, but most people will admit it after some thought. If your close friend was murdered and the murderer was taken to court and found guilty, you would be very angry if the judge let them off with a \u00a350 fine. The judge in this case was bad because he didn\u2019t uphold justice, which is his role as a judge. In the same way, as a good judge, God can\u2019t let any sin go unpunished. Which leads to the question: how can God forgive us? The only possible solution to this is for somebody to step forward and switch places with the criminal (us). This is known in Christian theology as penal substitution. The substitute takes upon himself the guilty record of the offender and gives the offender their good record. The substitute, who is now legally a criminal, is punished for the crime of the offender. Once this punishment is complete, the sin is dealt with and the judge no longer has to give any more punishment; both the offender and the substitute are free from the law because its demands have been met. The big question now is who is are substitute? The bible teaches that it is Jesus Christ. \u201cFor our sake he [Jesus] made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\u201d This verse shows how Jesus is counted as having committed the sins of Christians and Christians are counted as having lived as good a life as Jesus, even though they haven\u2019t. This shows that Christians don\u2019t (some do, but shouldn\u2019t!) believe themselves to be better than other people because they are going to heaven instead of hell. The reason for this is that Jesus earned our way into heaven, not us. All that we did was earn punishment for Jesus on the cross. As Jonathan Edwards put it: \u201cYou contribute nothing to your salvation except the sin that made it necessary.\u201d So, back to the question, the answer is NO. Not because Christians are better than other people, but because our sins were paid for on the cross by Jesus. Anybody who repents of their sin and truly follows Jesus will go to heaven. \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\u201d (Romans 10:13) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you want to interpret the Bible. I believe it would be safe to suggest that through most of the Christian Era, it was taught non-Christians could not go to Heaven, and they have scripture to point to backing up those beliefs. I do believe I have noticed a change, even among the more conservative Christian denominations, by preaching less about hell and more about the love of Jesus. Some pick through the Bible looking for justification of a God that will make a way for everyone to enter Heaven. This is a much more palatable doctrine in the 21st Century than the one about eternal punishment, so subtle changes are being created for the old time message. Heck, I could posit that maybe, just maybe, some outside force concocted the Bible, and everything that Christians consider evidence for it is nothing but a giant parlor trick to see whether they can rationally evaluate available observable evidence. Those of us who do, go to heaven. Those who make shit up, don't. Since the Bible can be used to justify ANY position one desires on most any given issue, of what good is it? ",

            "answer_text": "NO one is good enough to go to heaven. ALL people are self-centered and sInful. The Bible says our good deeds are like filthy rags. This is why Jesus came to earth to die on the cross. As the punishment for everyone\u2019s sins. EVERYONE has the opportunity to go to heaven by repenting of our sins, and giving them to Jesus to forgive. We also are to submit to God by inviting the Holy Spirit into our lives to give us the divine guidance and power in order to do God\u2019s will. He gives us His divine guidance and power to do it along with His supernatural love, joy, and peace so that Christians can be content in all circumstances even torture and death. If we believe in Jesus and repent of our sins, which means we really do submit to God and try to do things God\u2019s ways, our sins are taken away, we are forgiven and go to heaven. If we do not repent of our sins, we are then still in our sins, and thereby cannot go to heaven. We die in our sins, are judged for those sins, and sent to burn in the lake of fire eternally. People who really have not rejected or accepted Jesus, because they have not had the opportunity to learn about Jesus are judged for the light they do have. ALL people have the testimony of creation and conscience. See Romans 1\u20132. So if people believe in God, cooperate with the Holy Spirit in general, even if unknowingly, and do the best they know how, they can be saved. There is no excuse for not believing in God because of the testimony of creation and conscience. Revelation 7 tells of multitudes of people, saved, in heaven from EVERY TRIBE and NATION! Obviously, there are whole tribes and nations, especially in the past, who never had the chance to know about Jesus. Yet we can know clearly here, that some are saved! God is merciful and just. He does not punish people for what they could not know, only for what they did with what they did know. ",

No. According to God\u2019s Word, as written in the Holy Bible, the only people who will go to heaven are people who have committed their lives to Jesus and made Him their Lord and Savior. This is commonly referred to as being \u201cborn again.\u201d We are all on equal footing as far as heaven goes. We all have the same opportunity. None of us are sinless, and none are better than another due to works. God is longsuffering and not willing that any should perish. (See 1 Peter 3:9) He wants all of us to spend eternity in heaven with Him. The Bible says that works cannot get us to heaven, that we are saved by grace alone, that is, undeserved favor for simply putting our faith and trust in Jesus, putting Him at the center of our lives, and elevating Jesus above all else in our lives. Because we love Him, we follow His rules, or commandments, but just following the rules won\u2019t get us to heaven. This means that the person who calls himself or herself a Christian, who goes to church every Sunday, but has not truly made Jesus Lord of his life, and constantly sins against God without repentance, will not go to heaven. When we\u2019re born again, we\u2019re changed. We have the Spirit of God living in us, and though we may stumble, we are obedient to God and His Word. Anyone who hates is not a Christian, and is not going to heaven. \u201cIf a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?\u201d (1 John: 4\u201320) Liars don\u2019t get to go either: \u201cBut for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\u201d (Revelation 21:8) So, it really doesn\u2019t matter what someone calls himself or herself. What matters is the status of the soul. If a person is \u201cborn again,\u201d they\u2019ll go to heaven. If not, they won\u2019t. To reserve your place in heaven all you have to do is recognize you\u2019\u2019re a sinner, sincerely ask Jesus into your heart, and accept Him as your Savior and Lord of your life. ",

If fact it was the total unfairness of this attitude that started my move from Christianity. The fact that some kindly person who lived a selfless life caring for his community and always betting others before himself was doomed to Hell by an accident of geography but some vile person who was drunk, violent, adulterous and a thief would go to heaven just because he happened to go to confession one Sunday and got run over outside the church before he could go back to sinning was just too stupid to be taken seriously. Of course once you have had that light bulb moment, you can start looking logically inspecting all the stuff they have spoon fed you since childhood, and in most cases religion withers under close scrutiny. I still ask that question of street evangelists today, they tend to squirm a bit, and I hope, that maybe it sows a tiny seed of doubt that will open their minds too. ",

The plain truth is that most people condemn themselves to hell, even if they are baptized, confirmed Catholics because they do not realize what this life is about and they are trying to get good things out of this life and NOT follow Our Blessed Lord on the way to Calvary as they are commanded. Seeing as most of them, who have the sacraments available to them, are lost; how much more those who don\u2019t even have the sacraments. Plus we must figure in those who openly condemn the Catholic Church (NOT the same as the individuals leaders in the Church!) which is openly rejecting Jesus Christ. The only non-Catholics who stand a chance at heaven are those totally ignorant of Our Blessed Lord who are in good conscience trying to follow God as well as they can know Him. This does not include those who think they know Him but reject the Catholic Church. ",

As a christian, its not just accepting Jesus but it is about changing your life around and trying to live just like Jesus did (eg, selfless, non-judgemental, forgiving, loving, kind etc.) Its not about the good deeds you do, it is about accepting Jesus and declaring for the whole world to know where you stand. You can\u2019t live as a Christian, if you say \u201cI\u2019m Christian\u201d But never try to understand God\u2019s word, if you only pray to get what you want, if you never try to change how you behave and how you live your life (not caring whether you are selfish or rude etc.) and so on. You simply can\u2019t go to heaven, if you don\u2019t do what is stated in the bible verse above and the reasons I listed above. if you wanna go to heaven, you have to submit to God and be a Christian who reads and studies the bible, who wants to know more about his amazing power and creation, who wants to try and live as Jesus did, who wants to be changed and prays to God to help them change for the better (eg, to be less angry, to be more kind and understanding etc.), to be someone who is able to confess to the world that they are Christian, and to also praise God for everything he has done and will do even through the hard times and the good times. There is a lot more to Christianity then saying \u201cI am a christian\u201d. ",

Protestants very generally divide into three general categories. Calvinists, Arminians and Universalists. Calvinists believe that we are fore-ordained to heaven or hell. Our salvation is only through grace, nothing we do can make any difference. The Presbyterian churches are examples of Calvinist groupsCalvinism - Wikipedia Arminian's believe that while one must accept Christ to go to heaven, one's own actions still cannot influence the process any more than that. Salvation is a free gift, but must be accepted. Many Baptist congregations are Arminian in theology.Arminianism - Wikipedia Universalists believe that everyone will go to (some form) of heaven. Mormons, Unitarians and many Quaker congregations are Universalists.Christian Universalism - Wikipedia Some Christian groups don't interpret the idea of grace in the same way that mainstream Protestants do. To one length or another, they require certain activities to be performed to merit salvation. That might be baptism, attendance at meetings or a number of different ritualistic practices. Erik Mojica has covered the Catholic side very well, so I'll leave it at that. The Orthodox view is similar in many ways to the Catholic point of view, some slight differences in practice and authority. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m an atheist. I don\u2019t believe any of this. But I do know what the Bible says. Firstly, \u201cChristianity\u201d doesn\u2019t really agree on anything. People who assert that there are certain core beliefs that Christians agree on, can only do so by defining \u2018Christianity\u201d that way, ie they define those who do not agree as \u201cnot Christian\u201d. This means that they don\u2019t agree on heaven and hell. Many, perhaps most, churches nowadays, particularly outside the traditional areas like Sub-Saharan Africa and pats of the USA, de-emphasise the idea of hell, and may not even admit to believing it at all. If pressed, they will probably say that only God knows who makes it to heaven. The Pope, for example, has repeatedly mused that good, honest, atheists can make it to heaven (Do Atheists Go to Heaven? Pope Francis Says Yes). Now, let\u2019s look at what the Bible says. I haven\u2019t read all the answers on here, but I bet all the evangelicals are saying that the Bible says non-Christians all go to hell. However, that\u2019s not true. There are at least two exceptions mentioned in the Bible. Firstly, we need to understand that we\u2019re just talking about the New Testament. The Tanakh (\u201cOld Testament\u201d) says nothing about heaven or hell. There\u2019s a few hints about life after death, but also a few hints about there being no life after death. The other thing is that the religion of the Old Testament was not universalist. There was no notion that gentiles (non-Jews) should believe in Yahweh (God\u2019s name in the Old Testament). So there\u2019s no notion that non-Jews would be punished for worshiping this God they had never heard of. In the same vein, St Paul, who liked to explain Christianity in terms of the Old Testament, also says that \u201cGentiles\u201d who don\u2019t have the law (it\u2019s not clear if he\u2019s talking about the Old Testament law or some New Testament covenant) will be judged according to their own conscience - Romans 2:12-16 Most Christians interpret this as meaning that people who never heard \u201cthe gospel\u201d will go to heaven if they behave ethically, ie that they will be judged by \u201cnatural law\u201d. For me as a skeptic, this seems to contradict the common evanglical idea that God sends non-believers to hell because he has no option and can\u2019t stand being around people whose sin isn\u2019t atoned for. This belief says that actually, he can. But obviously it\u2019s much more compassionate than for Christians to say that most people will go to hell through no fault of their own. The other exemption that evangelicals mention much less often is in 1 Corinthians 7:12-16, where St Paul appears to say that the spouse and children of a believer are sanctified by the believing family member. This seems out of character with modern Christian beliefs, but is fitting with several cases in the book of Acts where the head of the household converted and all of his family (presumably including young children) were baptised and promised salvation (e.g. 1 Corinthians 1:16, Acts 16:31\u201333, etc.) So according to the Bible there\u2019s at least two groups of non-Christians who can go to heaven, even in the strictest reading.

            "answer_text": "Heaven and Hell exist. To avoid hell and to go to heaven, Repenting of one\u2019s sins and believing in Jesus as Saviour is the condition as mentioned in the Bible. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. - John 3:16 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. - John 3:36 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: - Hebrews 9:27 The parable of Lazarus and the rich man is meant to teach us that there is a life after death. If we still remain in our sins, we will be separated from God for ever. Would we be like the rich man who was described as \u2026 also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments \u2026 In the Bible its mentioned Luke 16:19-31 19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, 21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u2019s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u2019s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father\u2019s house: 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. 31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? \u2013 Mark 8:36 This is what God says. When a baby is born, there is a date set for the soul to be returned to the giver of the life. It\u2019s a fact that all of us would die one day. That doesn\u2019t change if you are rich or poor. It\u2019s a law which is true for all human beings. So what happens after death? Should we think about what happens after death? Shouldn\u2019t we just focus on the current life? We as humans tend to think forward. That\u2019s the reason why we try to earn more money to make future secure. We think in advance and ensure that we have health insurance so that an emergency is taken care of. So we do think in advance.. What about our soul? What when our breath stops? We leave all the money, position, family and everything which we accumulated in this life span. It\u2019s a FACT that we came into this world empty handed and would leave this world empty handed. Our soul returns to the God Almighty. Everything we did in this short life on earth we would need to give an account for. Can we live our lives just as the way we desire and not reap the consequences? As we sow, so shall we reap. The parable of Lazarus and the rich man is meant to teach us that there is a life after death. If we still remain in our sins, we will be separated from God for ever. Would we be like the rich man who was described as \u2026 also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments \u2026 Be concerned about your soul also. Because it\u2019s a matter of eternity. We take care of our bodies by having good nutritious food and exercise. But finally the body will return to dust at our death. Make sure your soul is not lost. There is no point in regretting after death as we can live only one life on earth and there is no coming back. How can I come to God? First of all, we can\u2019t come to God directly. Just think about the head of our country. Can we just go and meet them? We can meet them if we have an invitation. God is the supreme most power and the highest in authority in the whole universe. We can come to God only in His own terms, not ours. God reveals of Himself as \u2013 13 of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity \u2013 Habakkuk 1:13 No one with iniquity or sin can come to His presence. We can come to God after being cleansed from our sins. We cannot cleanse ourselves from our sins. God sent His ONLY begotten son Jesus Christ into this world so that ANYONE who believes in Him should not perish, but should receive everlasting life. If ANYONE believes in JESUS and repents of their own sins and asks JESUS to forgive their sins; He being God himself, has the power to forgive sins. Only the true God can forgive the sins of mankind. Jesus being God who came to earth in the form of human alone has the power to forgive our sins. Be truthful to yourself and do repent of your sins. Pray to Jesus. He knows our heart. He has promised in His word \u2013 in the Holy bible. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. For it is not possible that the blood of goats and bulls should take away sins. Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin. In JESUS alone, we have redemption from our sins through His blood shed on the cross, and the forgiveness of sins and complete freedom from sin\u2019s bondage on us. With repentance tell all your sins to Jesus. Jesus understands all your needs. He will forgive and all your sins will be cleansed. You will receive eternal life and you can be assured that you are in the right way to heaven. JESUS \u2013 the meaning of the name is \u2013 the one who saves the people from their sins. The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. \u2013 1 John 1:7-9 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name \u2013 John 1:12 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God \u2013 Romans 8:15,16 When your sins are cleansed, you become a child of God and then you can come to God, our Heavenly Father. If you are sincere to know if there is a real God, pray if there is a true real God to reveal Himself to you. God Himself has promised - Jeremiah 29:13 13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. If interested, read the Bible with an open mind praying to the true God to reveal Himself to you. You can start with the new testament, Gospel of MARK and then Gospel of John and then the other books of the New Testament. Let the true God, if it be Jesus or Allah or any other God, let the true God reveal Himself to you! I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. \u2013 John 8:24 In my case, I realised Jesus is really God and He is whom He says to be.

I get this from Luke 10:25\u201328, which goes: And a lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, \u201cTeacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d And He said to him, \u201cWhat is written in the Law? How does it read to you?\u201d And he answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\u201d And He said to him, \u201cYou have answered correctly; do this and you will live.\u201d No one on earth has ever done this perfectly except Jesus, which is where the plain straight Gospel comes in, according to Christian theology, where we are unrighteous sinners and deserve death and Jesus lives perfectly. Our punishment is then laid on him, as the prophecy from hundreds of years before Jesus goes: 5 \u201cBut he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way;and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.\u201d - Isaiah 53:5\u20136 Basically, He died in our place. Our sin was laid on Him and His righteousness imparted to us, by faith in Him. Martin Luther called it \u201cThe Great Exchange\u201d. So no, non-Christians do not go to heaven, but neither do those who merely are \u201cchristians\u201d by culture.

They may have called Him by other names than we know today, but as I said only God can determine whether someone is a Christian or not. These kinds of questions always remind me of the C.S. Lewis book \u201cThe Final Battle\u201d. There is a character, a soldier, in that book who worshipped a God he called Tash (if I am remembering correctly). During the course of the story finds himself in Aslan\u2019s land, which is representative of heaven. Aslan talks to him and tells him that all the worship he gave to Tash while he was alive Aslan will accept for himself. And so this soldier got to stay in Aslan\u2019s land.

(I must also note that because the Church is the Mystical Body of Christ there is no salvation outside the Church.). That said, there is a caveat or two. The first is that although we are bound to the sacraments, baptism and the Eucharist, God is not. The second is that Scripture also tells us that God \"desires that all men be saved.\"  What this all means is that a) His mercy is infinite and b) any person in Heaven is by default a Christian regardless of whether this was the case in earthly life. The hope and common wisdom would be that God most likely allows for one final choice of faithful accepting of Jesus to occur immediately preceding actual death or salary ion of the spirit from the body. So all who enter Heaven must accept Christ as a prerequisite. Hope this helps.  ",

In my churchgoing days, my pastor taught that only those who have \u201cheard the word of God\u201d were judged based on their acceptance or non-acceptance of the salvation offer. He taught that those who had never heard the Gospel were judged instead by how they lived their lives. This actually laid the very first stepping stone of my discontent.I posed a hypothetical to my pastor, asking what would happen to some unenlightened soul who, never having heard of God, The Bible, or Jesus\u2019 love, still managed to live a good and upstanding life of duty and service to his family and community, always treating others with love and kindness.My pastor assured me that soul would certainly go to Heaven because even though he did not have Jesus in his heart, he lived a life exemplary of the best we can aspire to be.I then asked \u201cwhat if that man were to be visited by missionaries in his dotage and upon hearing the Gospel he chose to continue living his life as before, without accepting the gift of Salvation?\u201d and my pastor sadly replied \u201cif a man hears the Good News but does not repent and accept Jesus, his soul cannot enter the gates of Heaven\u201d.My pastor was not at all pleased with my assessment that the missionary was doing the poor man no favor at all by spreading the Gospel, as he would have been far better off had he died without ever having heard it.

Now do you have to go to church to go to Heaven? No but it renews your spirit. Do you have to read your Bible to get into Heaven? No but New Testament is a manual on all things essential, in which your question is included in this manual. All you really need is the belief, love and faith in Jesus Christ to be saved and go to Heaven when you pass. Every sin is forgivable because God knows none of us are infallible. The only unforgivable sin that bars you from Heaven is the denial of Jesus Christ as our savior. He died on the cross for you because He loved you before you were even born. He loves everyone, even those who hate him, mock him, and those who crucified Him. But He also gave everyone free will and all for people to love and believe in Him. He won\u2019t force anyone to believe, but the consequence for not believing saddens Him greatly. Some will say \u201cif he loved everyone, everyone would automatically go to Heaven.\u201d If that were the case, what would be the point of believing in Him and why would we need faith? Why would we want to do good good and call on Him in times of trouble if we live consequence free? Think of child rearing. It\u2019s like that. Only difference is the consequence is death. Jesus shows His love for us by giving us His Word and telling us all these things, warning us ahead of time what could happen if we choose to reject Him, He in fact tells us this several times. If He didn\u2019t love us, He\u2019d just let us all burn in Hell and not bother. John 3:16\u201317 is a very commonly used and very true: \u201c\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 18\u201319 continues on to say this: Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.\u201d John\u202c 3:16-19\u202c ESV\u202c\u202c ",

That means we MUST stick to the biblical message like glue or we will be deceived too. See https://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/religious-deception.htm. To base all your spiritual beliefs on the written word of God (the bible), is to be 100% safe. Scripture is final spiritual authority (2 Tim. 3:16,17). Remember that. ",

            "answer_text": "To put it simply, if you do not believe in the Christian god, then as per the bible, then no. You do not. Period. Any sort of slippery/slope, or ignorance-of-god-gives-you-a-free-pass is not something that was in the bible, except for children and newborns\u2026 for obvious, logistic reasons. However, society moves forward and changes, and these days, Christianity is afraid of losing believers or being seen as too antiquated for its own good, so over the years, some have changed the absolute NO, of this question, to something more reasonable and less stupid. You know, as to not sound completely, and bloody irrational. Just like the gay issue in Christianity. For almost 2 thousand years, gayness was considered to be a total sin, punishable by death. Even if not everyone got killed, gay people were smart enough to keep it to themselves, for the most part. However, with our better understanding of science and the current theories about homosexuality today (gay penguins exist, good one, god), wanting to kill them (or treat them like shit) in more civilized societies is akin to being a homophobic, moral throwback to the Bronze Age who should have no business being a source of knowledge, much less personal wisdom. So the Church has change its stand to a softer one. Not because they are wise, if they were wise, or a god was involved in any of this, then they would have been given this wisdom thousands of years ago, instead of in the last 50+ years. Same analogy applies to your question. ",

All others declared \u201crighteous\u201d by God have been so based on their faith in Christ as their Savior (rescuer). Prior to Christ\u2019s death and resurrection, their faith was in God\u2019s promise of a coming Savior. This goes all the way back to Adam and Eve, whom in Genesis 3:15 received from God what theologians call the Protevangelium. This was the messianic prophecy of Satan\u2019s defeat, the first glimmer of the gospel. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, a non-Christian cannot be righteous in the eyes of God. But to be fair, even Christians cannot earn God\u2019s favor by their good works or their avoidance of bad deeds. It is only by God\u2019s grace extended to us through the saving work of Jesus Christ on the cross that any of us can hope to be \u201cgood enough\u201d to avoid his damnation. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is yes. If a person sincerely seeks God in his and her life and wants to reach out to God but there is no opportunity for the person to hear the Gospel and follow Jesus due to circumstances, God judges those people based on what He has revealed to them and how they responded to their conscience. For God will reward each of us according to what we have done. Some people keep on doing good, and seek glory, honour, and immortal life; to them, God will give eternal life. Other people are selfish and reject what is right, in order to follow what is wrong; on them, God will pour out his anger and fury. (Romans 2:6-8) The Gentiles do not have the Law of Moses; they sin and are lost apart from the Law. The Jews have the Law; they sin and are judged by the Law. For it is not by hearing the Law that people are put right with God, but by doing what the Law commands. The Gentiles do not have the Law; but whenever they do by instinct what the Law commands, they are their own law, even though they do not have the Law. Their conduct shows that what the Law commands is written in their hearts. Their consciences also show that this is true, since their thoughts sometimes accuse them and sometimes defend them. And so, according to the Good News I preach, this is how it will be on that Day when God through Jesus Christ will judge the secret thoughts of all. (Romans 2:12-16) ",

The first believers were called Messanic and follow the true Saviour of mankind ,Yahusha. The name Jesus comes from the Latin name Iesous and nothing to do with the Messiah Yahusha. Jesus only showed up about 500 years ago. You only need to look Jesus up a Christian concordance and it quite clearly is written that Jesus means Iesous and a little more research will show that Iesous come from the name Zeus a pagan god. The Bible teaches that there is only one name given to mankind for salvation and that one name is Yahusha Ben Yahuah. Jesus cannot save anyone. So to answer your question the answer is yes \u2026. I'm a non believing Jesus-Iesous Christian and I am heaven bound! Many are called but few are chosen. If you read this then you have been called. ",

And if one does not know how to believe in The God correctly, Jesus said there would be another Comforter, he, he will guide you into all truth. So if one wants to make it to Paradise, one must believe in & follow that other Comforter, & what The God sent him with. For Jesus had much more to teach but the people couldn't bare it then, so he said there will be another after him. And if one believes in & follows Jesus, they owe it to themselves to seek out this other Comforter as Jesus spoke of. One should pray to The Creator as Jesus did, for he didn't pray to himself. So a follower of Jesus will do as he did. Ask The Creator for guidance & protection from falsehood & to tie your heart firm with the faith & belief in The Truth. Then trust in whatever direction He Guides you. ",

If you profess belief in Jesus but you committed a string of armed robberies, there might be some awkward questions at the pearly gates for you. Some believe that both apply - if you\u2019ve heard the news about Jesus and his sacrifice, that\u2019s how you get in; if you never heard about it, this isn\u2019t your fault and you get judged on merit instead.

Even in moments when you\u2019re dishonoring Him by your thoughts, words, and actions, the Bible promises us that we are secure in our salvation (that we\u2019re \u201csealed by the Holy Spirit\u201d) once we have accepted Christ as our personal Savior.You surrender your life to God.

Where as the fact is, nobody has yet seen wither of the two entities as above and presented evidences of those. I guess, before the advent of Christ, every human must be landing up in the Hell and overpopulating it and hence, he was sent to sift good people from bad and send someone to the less-populated Heaven! The idea of Hell and Heaven has been existing in all the religions with the primary aim of preventing humans from committing sins and for encouraging towards the good! But none of the the religion, unlike Christianity, encourage becoming member of the \u201celite club\u2019 that has the sole discretion over the entry gates (Pearly Gate). This entire thing defies logic despite whatever is written in various sacred books of the said religion. All the religions may differ in the definition of Hell & Heaven, but they all agree that the ultimate aim of humans is to assimilate with the Greater Entity called God after the end of Earthly lives. At the same time, there is no one who could ensure or guarantee the proposition made. Many religions believe in rebirth based on Karma in the past life. By this logic, the performance of humans in his present life dictates his next birth! This continues till the person frees himself/herself of all the misdeeds and finally becomes part of the Supreme Being. The underlying theory is to encourage people towards goodness and avoid sins so that the human society remains constant and sane. But nobody can have a remedy for the evil deeds committed and absolved of his sins by joining a particular religion, no one can take guarantee of that. ",

I attended Catholic schools all but half of the 6th, 7th and 8th grades, and graduated from an all boys Catholic boarding school taught by the Brothers of the Holy Cross.  The same order that teaches at Notre Dame.  I had four years of Latin and still, my favorite instructor told me a few months before graduation that he felt I would be the first in my graduating class to leave the church.  I always questioned everything and felt the standard refrain \"it just is, you have to accept it as a matter of faith\" was not acceptable. He was correct I guess, as I have no way to verify the status of the rest of my classmates, but it was questions such as this one that made me leave organized religion.   A person judged by any other standard beyond their honor, their compassion for their fellow human being, and their honesty, is being misjudged. ",

Since becoming Christian I now understand that we are all sinners (from birth) so we would all go to Hell if that were true. This is why Jesus Christ had to be sacrificed and resurrected - to pay the price for our sins so that those who believe in Him could be forgiven.

Even when they are not convinced that there is God, they know the difference between the right thing and the wrong one plus they try to avoid the wrong. How could they act like real Christians but actually they are not Christians? Well, simply because we are all as human beings, created in the image and likeness of God. \"Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.\" Genesis 1:26 .. so, God is not a programmer who stands at the front of heaven gate and pushes non-Christians away although she/he is a godly person with lovely soul. but why should I be a Christian as long as I can be in heaven as a godly person? What distinguishes Christians is that they are the children of God \"Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God\" John 1:12 God understand the conditions of people. but\u2026 \" you are without excuse, O man.\" Romans 2:1 .. therefore non followers of Jesus could never be justified before God by their works, but might be justly condemned by him, nor shall they escape his righteous judgment.

Everything else anyone says is something that\u2019s made up outside of the teaching of the actual Bible (which is heresy according to the Bible). The Bible doesn\u2019t say you get into heaven for being \u2018nice\u2019 or anything like that.

To then say that they will no enter heaven is v ignorant . Now the question then arises is the what comprises heaven, It is union with God . The sacrificial offering of Jesus is one which allows a believer to receive the Holy Spirit i.e. God based on the merits of Jesus. Imagine if all of us had to invent an iphone we would sure struggle so much and most will not get anywhere. Heaven is unattainable unless we become the perfect image of God.The sacrifice of Jesus is the intervention of God to make a way for man to get to him. The historical churches believe in a intermediate place called purgatory which is a place of refinement .I am sure all the righteous men of all religions will know the truth there, ",

How can God be just and let good people who do not hear the gospel or perhaps are pushed away by hearing a false gospel and do not accept Christ not get into heaven? So I looked for an answer. And the answer is that Christ himself says that there are those who will be in heaven who did not accept his message- I would tell any Christian who does not think so that they have not studied the word of God closely enough. So go read the Bible for yourself and ask God to show you. He will reveal more than the words appear to those who study without his guidance ",

What decides if you have hope or not is dependent on what you put your trust in. Put your trust in Jesus and He will claim He paid your debt in full. But don't call Him to defend you and the sentence will be seperation so you don't contaminate the rest of the wheat. ",

However, it is also explained that God judges fairly and knows our hearts, and how much we individuals seek God and follow what we do know, in our heart and conscience. That is in the book of Romans. Now, that is if one doesn\u2019t know the gospel or has had the way of salvation preached to them. If a person knows the gospel of Yahshua (Jesus) and REJECTS it, that is a whole new story. God will judge a person for rejecting Him, now that they know about Him. It\u2019s no longer a matter of following God as we understand Him and our conscience, now we have been given the gospel and reject it, and that becomes a new problem altogether. ",
