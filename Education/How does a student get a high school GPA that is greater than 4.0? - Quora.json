            "answer_text": "Some high schools calculate (or otherwise weight) GPA resulting from honors, AP, or college classes differently than they do with other classes. The scales are highly variable but often give an A in an AP or college course a value of 4.33 in the GPA calculation. Such weighting may be relevant when it comes to a determination of high school class rank* but carry little importance when it comes to college admissions, especially at highly selective colleges and universities. Many admissions officers will look specifically at the grades earned in specific classes. I know some students who obtained GPAs of \"4.0\" by earning enough As in AP courses (carrying a 4.33 weight) to offset Bs earned in other courses. It definitely does not look as impressive as an unweighted 4.0 GPA (with the maximum grade points from any individual class capped at 4.0), which is part of the reason many high schools still decline to use a system that awards GPAs higher than 4.0.  *Systems that award GPAs higher than 4.0 present unique problems when it comes to class rank. Many high schools will look individually at the curricula of the students with the top-10 GPAs or so, but some simply rank the students from highest to lowest GPA, which can lead to some bizarre outcomes. One of my friends, despite having straight As and having taken more AP courses than anyone else in his high school, was ranked outside of the top five in his high school class. It turns out that he had also taken more classes overall than all of the students ranked in the top five. Since his non-AP classes didn't award grade points over 4.0, the fact that he had taken more classes ultimately \"diluted\" his GPA, bring it below the GPAs of his peers who had taken proportionally fewer non-APs (but also fewer APs overall). Meanwhile, a college looking at his transcript would immediately see his unweighted 4.0 GPA and know the difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Some schools weigh certain classes differently. For example, my school weighs AP classes on a 5 point scale as opposed to the normal 4 point scale and weighs normal classes on the 4 point scale. This means that it is possible for me to attain a 5.0 weighted GPA as long as I am able to take all AP classes,  the unweighted GPA ,however, will still be on the 4 point scale.              The reason for having AP classes weighted is to cause class rank to make more sense. Valedictorians should not be people who took all blow-off classes, rather they should take more difficult classes if they actually are somewhat intelligent. This weighting makes nearly mandatory to take AP classes to be high up in class rank. This is the way it should be, it makes challenging oneself more be less risky. This has the effect of increasing the number of students taking AP classes, which causes a school to look more impressive. How weighting works:                                                               (AP)                 Letter                        Weighted Points            Normal Points                     A                                         5.0                                4.0                     B                                         4.0                                3.0                     C                                         3.0                                2.0                                                         D                                         2.0                                1.0                                                    E                                         1.0                                 0.0 ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure what the upper limit is (because it will depend on how many AP classes are offered at a high school), but the way people get GPAs above a 4.0 is by taking AP (Advanced Placement) or IB (International Baccalaureate) classes. I'm not sure how IB works exactly (most American high schools don't offer it), but for AP classes, an A is worth 5.0 points (instead of 4.0, which is the norm), a B is good for 4.0 points (instead of 3.0), a C is 3.0 points, and so on and so forth. So if a student is taking three AP classes and four non-AP classes and gets straight A's, their GPA would be a 4.43 (5+5+5+4+4+4+4, divided by the number of classes). If they got a B in one of the AP classes, their GPA would be a 4.29 (4+5+5+4+4+4+4, divided by seven classes), because that AP B counts the same as an A in a regular high school class. AP classes are worth more because they're college-level courses and require much more work at a higher level than you would find even in honors classes. ",

They are good as of now and hopefully they will remain that way. What I really want is to live a fulfilling high school life and keep doing what I love (that's one of the keys to getting into an elite college. So keep doing what you love to do outside school and be world class at it ;). ) I will graduate in 2018. But never will I look back at my high school gpa.

Regardless of that, you still need to sit your butt down and Do all of your work. Do it the best of your ability. Really put effort into learning and understanding the material, not just vomiting it out for one quiz.Ace all your tests. Do this by studying. A lot. Don't be afraid to ask a teacher, a tutor, or even another student for help. Ask a classmate to explain something to you. You don't even need to pay them usually. Khan Academy and Crash Course are good sources to use.Recover quickly from sick days. A few days away from school may not seem like much, but it really is a downhill snowball from there. Get the notes as soon as you can and finish your work along with your class. Ask your teachers if they can email you the work or ask another student to bring it for you. Don't forget to have a study buddy or a study group.Easier said than done? You bet. But it's your life and if you decide not to grab yourself by the heinie and get to work, you have nobody but yourself to blame. ",

            "answer_text": "Assumption: You are referring to 5.0 accumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale If you want a 5.0 GPA, then it is evident that you must have all A or A+ depending on which one is the highest grade in your school. Additionally, every single one of your classes must be weighted. Which classes are weighted is dependent upon your school. My school only weighs AP classes, but some schools also weigh Honors and IB courses. You will have to ask your counselor on this one. Beware that in some schools, graduating with a 5.0 GPA is impossible. For example, my school requires PE and Health classes to graduate, but there are no AP PE or Health courses. Non-weighted classes like these will drag your GPA down even if you get an A or A+, ruining any chance for a perfect 5.0. Check your graduating requirements to make sure that every credit requirement has corresponding weighted classes. If there aren\u2019t, then it is impossible. Don\u2019t worry though. Colleges get to see every class available in your high school, so they know how much of your potential you have fulfilled given the conditions of your school. ",
