            "answer_text": "I was accepted to four Ivy League institutions and Stanford. I\u2019ll say this: Nobody in my family went to college. Not a single person. In fact, I didn\u2019t even know where Harvard was located \u2013 let alone how to apply. So, to put it simply: Yes, I think you can get into an Ivy League School. I think anyone can. Here\u2019s a personal example to get you started: My first day of high school, I walked into my Spanish class. Sit in the front row? HA. I\u2019ll take the dark shadows in the back, thank you very much.  Right after me, another kid walked into the room \u2013 he sat front and center. He pulled out a planner and started taking notes. Notes?? What is good with this kid? It\u2019s the first 15 seconds of class. Alright, overachiever marked \u2013 plain and simple. As fate would have it, I see him again toward the end of the day waiting on his ride home. I decide to talk to him \u2013 at the very least figure out what was in the freaking planner that was so important.  Turns out, he is one of the friendliest people I have ever met. He was two years ahead of me, but he had one simple goal in mind: getting into a top school. Oh, and he was copying the homework on the board into his planner. I didn\u2019t even realize we had an assignment. BOOM. I\u2019m sold. I don\u2019t know who this kid is, but I can smell success brewing. Over the next year, I asked him a million questions and learned from his mistakes. He is now one of my closest friends. He now attends Princeton University.  Here\u2019s my advice: For starters, find people who are also trying to get in, who have applied in the past, or who have experience dealing with these top colleges. Learn from them! Now, I am not saying that just finding smart people will also make you smart. But my mom always said: \u201cBirds of a feather, flock together\u201d. The quote is simple \u2013 successful people fly around with successful people. So, if you really want to attend an Ivy League school, and I believe you can, find some people that are going to raise the bar for you. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll be sitting front and center in Harvard Hall. Photo Credit: MarketWatch, Princeton, Petersons ",

            "answer_text": "Getting into an Ivy League college is no small feat it is a long and arduous process. However if your going for it you must back yourself! You can get into Ivy league schools. TL:DR at the bottom! There are four key steps factors/steps you have to take and account for going forward. The first step is apply early! Overall Acceptance Rates 2017: Brown: 9.2% Columbia: 6.9% Cornell: 15.2% Dartmouth: 10.0% Harvard: 5.8% Penn: 12.1% Princeton: 7.3% Stanford: 4.65% (not technically an Ivy, I know) Yale: 6.7% According to these numbers, Cornell, Dartmouth and Penn are by far the easiest Ivy Leagues to get into. But what happens when you take a look at the early decision/early action (ED/EA) acceptance rates? ED/EA Rates 2017: Brown: 18.5% ED Columbia: 19.2% ED Cornell: 29.5% ED Dartmouth: 29.4% ED Harvard: 18.4% EA Penn: 24.9% ED Princeton: 18.3% EA Stanford: 9.5% (2016) EA Yale: 14.4% EA All of a sudden these schools look a lot more attainable although these stats are often skewed due to recruited athletes), showing interest in specific universities early on will definitely help you. Step two is to STUDY! Average Ivy League GPA/Test Scores: Brown: 4.08/ SAT: 1500, ACT: 32 Columbia: 4.16/ SAT: 1530, ACT: 34 Cornell: 4.04/ SAT: 1480, ACT: 32 Dartmouth: 4.06/ SAT: 1500, ACT: 32 Harvard: 4.1/ SAT: 1540, ACT: 34 Penn: 3.93/ SAT: 1510, ACT: 32 Princeton: 3.9/ SAT: 1520, ACT: 33 Stanford: 4.18/ SAT: 1520, ACT: 33 Yale: 4.19/ SAT: 1540, ACT: 33 Don\u2019t be disheartened by these numbers. They are averages, which means that universities take students with lower scores and students with higher scores. If your grades aren\u2019t strong, challenge yourself in school and strengthen other parts of your application. Go out on a limb and show these universities that you are not afraid of failing. Step three is finding your passion! As I mentioned above, the worse your grades are, the better you have to be in non-academic pursuits. So find a passion outside of the classroom and become obsessed with it. Literally. Ivy League universities want to produce world leaders, thinkers and doers, and the only way they can do that is by accepting students who have great potential. Therefore, you have to live and breathe your passion, especially if the rest of your application isn\u2019t up to par. Do you love science? Enrol in international competitions, shadow a doctor, work in a lab, teach elementary school kids the basics of chemistry around the USA in the summer. Do as much as you can as often as you can and prove to the admissions officers why are going to be the best scientist ever. Lastly, be you! show the college what they are missing out on with your own unique perspective of the world. A brilliant example of this would be the essay about pizza that helped a girl receive a offer from Yale. 1. Find a creative point of view and run with it. 2. Be authentic (don\u2019t try to be funny if you are not funny!). 3. Be emotive with your writing. The more you make the admissions officers feel something, the better. 4. Give the admissions officers a reason to fight for you. The more you open up, the better your essay will be, but this doesn't mean you have to write a sob story. Contrary to popular belief, writing about the worst thing that has ever happened in your life will not guarantee you a spot at an Ivy League, or any other university for that matter. As long as you write with passion (and correct spelling and grammar), your essay will be great. Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks! They will most likely pay off. TLDR: 1) Apply Early 2) Study 3)Find your passion and show it through your extracurricular 4)Display your unique perspective on the world through your application Good luck, just remember these schools are very selective and there is no shame in not getting in.

            "answer_text": "Hi, a recent admit into two of the HYP here (didn't apply to the other one). Asian female (international student).  A few things:1. You are arguably more impressive than I am - so my answer is 'probably'. That's a 'probably' because NO ONE should be able to say with 100% confidence that a person will definitely get into these Ivy League schools. With schools these selective, it's too much of a crapshoot to be certain. I have seen many friends and seniors that are just as, or even more, qualified than I am who were rejected (intentionally not being specific here to protect their privacy). I'd advice against listening to anyone that tries to convince you otherwise. This is not a 100% meritocratic process. 2. According to my college advisor (the guy has been working on admissions for 5+ years as far as I know), it won't matter a lot that you speak 5 languages unless you have the exams to show it (SAT IIs, APs etc). I was wondering about the same thing too (4 languages). There is only a little section on the Common App where we get to write down the languages we know + rough levels of mastery. Take the exams if you can! 3. Don't forget to make sure that your recs and essays are also good. Basic advice really, but they really are important. I still remember an application of a Harvard prospective my counsellor showed me. That dude's a genius. 800 SATs, 5s on who knows how many APs, perfect GPA, summer research with MIT prof, glowing rec from his math teacher ('he is the smartest student I have ever taught') etc. There was one letter from his humanities teacher, though, that completely obliterates everything by discussing his character (I think it was something like his aloofness and his lack of compassion/empathy). He was rejected. Granted he probably got into at least one super good school, but damn. If I were him I would have thought I'd be admitted.  Just choose wisely who you want to write recommendations for you, and give them a lot of time to do so. Also give yourself a lot of time for essays. How much is 'a lot' probably depends on your work pace. Mine took a few months overall. Damn the tendency to be a perfectionist. 4. This is related to #1: don't only apply to the Ivy Leagues (also extends to other very selective schools like Stanford/MIT/Chicago/Caltech etc.) I don't want this (Rejection from all Colleges.  No acceptance yet.) to happen to anyone.  Let me know if you have questions. Best of luck! Who knows, maybe I'll see you around in the next few years. :) Disclaimer: I am not an expert on college admission. This is simply a genuine advice from someone who recently went through the process. If anyone disagrees with what I wrote, please comment to let me know! ",

            "answer_text": "Log off Quora. You already know what you have to do. Now do it: Good grades, really good grades.Be actively involved in a couple things you truly want to be involved. Do it from middle school through high school: Scouting, a sport where you\u2019re not a star, photography for the school paper.Work (for money to help your family) at something unusual.Do something so well in school that your teacher has to say you were just unlike any other student.Be an outlier: the gay tuba player from Montana who also runs 100 yards at 10.0 seconds. (That is sarcastic, but I think you know what I mean.)Don\u2019t do stuff everyone else does: the Habitat for Humanity thing in whatever Central American country is still safe. The project has its own rewards: Some family gets a house to live. And you work alongside cute girls or guys in tank tops (unless you go on a church-sponsored trip, in which case it\u2019s T-shirts, not tank or halter tops. Choose carefully.).Have an incredible story about what you\u2019ve overcome: single parent household, not a lot of money, an auto accident that made you learn to walk again. Thing is, other applicants have had something special that they\u2019ve overcome, and you can\u2019t come across sounding like you\u2019re playing a sympathy music violin in the background.Be prepared to be enrolled someplace else. Smaller undergrad school schools like Bowdoin are just about as good. Tufts, Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan are as good and it\u2019s just as hard. Nothing wrong with Colgate, or Union, Lehigh or Bucknell. Or SUNY Geneseo - thinking of schools in the area of the Ivy footprint. Also: Small schools need students who do something else. If you play tuba well enough to be in the school band or orchestra, then you\u2019ve filled a slot. Or if you were news editor of your HS paper or yearbook and plan to do that in college, then you\u2019ve filled a slot. If you\u2019re a jock, being a likely starter moves you to the head of the line (85% chance of acceptance at Harvard if you\u2019re a recruited athlete) and/but at a small school (pay attention here to the math): Say the school is 2,000 students, has 20 sports (10 men, 10 women) and each sport needs 25 athletes, then the school needs 500 athletes who won\u2019t embarrass the school academically. If you are good enough to make the team even if you don\u2019t start, and if you are good enough to be able to maintain a personal GPA that boosts the team GPA, you are someone the school could use. Many sports need a manager. At an Ivy school (I know this section is about small schools), a HS football team manager who really wanted to help manage the university team, the coach used one of his wildcards to make sure the kid got in. Even if you get the coach to put in a good word for you, it helps with the admissions committee. If you\u2019re a minority, well hot damn: You fill three slots at once - student, jock/tuba player/manager, and minority. Some of the Ivies actively look for transfers who aced two years at community college. Apply to Tulane right now if you\u2019re from the Northeast. A top 50 school, still hurting from people who think Hurricane Katrina washed away the campus. Good students from the Northeast often hear by Thanksgiving. You\u2019ve got a great school in the bag and you\u2019re in great shape even if all eight Ivies and MIT say no. You may also have work to do at home: If your parents believe only the Ivy League is what you have to attain or the family name is ruined, start preparing them now. The Ivies admit at best one in ten applicants and it\u2019s approaching or past one in twenty at Harvard, Yale, Princeton (also at Cornell\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences, so don\u2019t think of Cornell as a safety school). If your family is first generation American, maybe they\u2019ve put too much pressure on you. Out of the approximately 4,000 colleges / universities in the US, there are fifty that give the Ivies a good run for their money. When I applied to college, I never would have considered BU and now there\u2019s no chance I could get in. BU just blew by Boston College on the WS Journal ratings, and BC is no slouch either. My barber, who came to the US from Italy with not much, offers this: Every school is a good one if you pay attention. Last thing: Consider a gap year and do something really memorable, not just bum around the Caribbean tending bar. ",

You\u2019ve ticked all the right boxes, but no one can guarantee you a spot in the Ivy League, or in any school that accepts less than a quarter of their students. Some thoughts: You won\u2019t be the only classical pianist in the application pile. If you\u2019re going to write about piano, you need to find the story that is uniquely yours. Every one of them has a \u201cI was doubting myself the night of my Carnegie Hall debut, but I played through the fear and did awesome!\u201d essay and/or a \u201cMusic helped me communicate with people I had X language/cultural barrier with.\u201d You will really have to dig to make that fresh. Your goal is a final essay that not only sounds just like you but is a story only you can tell. A good college counselor can help you uncover that.You have great numbers, but coming from a school that sends students to the Ivies every year means you will be competing directly with the other students from your class that are applying to the same programs. The schools just aren\u2019t going to admit ten students from the same high school.I see you attended the USN Summer Academy. Are you applying to Annapolis? Have you considered applying for the ROTC scholarships at your Ivies? Almost no one does, so that can certainly differentiate you.Unless you\u2019re planning to major in piano performance, I don\u2019t see any extracurriculars that show experience with your potential major. If you are planning to major in piano performance, there are probably better fit schools outside the 8 Ivy League schools. (Northwestern comes to mind.)Be sure to sit down with your college counselor to discuss these issues. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Getting into Ivy League University is difficult yet possible if you are willing to work hard. I was able to get into Brown and I did not do anything extraordinary. Some steps to consider to get into an Ivy League University: Narrow down your school list. Spreading yourself too thin by applying to all Ivy League schools or a huge list of schools, will signal to schools that you are less invested in their school. In turn it is less likely to get the attention of admissions decision makers when you apply. Schools want to feel special and try to only admit students that will ultimately attend the school.Be able to meet the minimum standards for the school. Schools publish the profile of the incoming freshman class. This is a good indicator of thresholds needed for test scores, gpa, rank and other stats. Having a really low gpa or falling below median percentile in any category is a red flag. You will also raise a red flag if you do not have outside school activities even though you are extraordinary in other categories. Sometimes these red flags can be explained during the essay portion of the application. And PLEASE make sure to address these red flags in every interaction with the school. Keep working towards at least meeting the median standards but shoot for exceeding each category.Work towards becoming a well-rounded individual. Another way to say this is to get involved in a wide range of activities. If you are not athletic, at least attempt to be part of a sports team. If you are afraid of public speaking try to speak in front of others. This will not only help increase your confidence but also make you more interesting to the school. Prestigious schools like students that can have a wide range of interests. Keep working on your weaknesses because this will show that you are well rounded and willing to take risks.Have a unique story. This is really difficult to explain but there is something that makes you unique and try to highlight this characteristic. For example, my parents did not graduate high school yet I was on the track to becoming valedictorian. This is what I kept reiterating in my application and during my interviews because I knew that is what made me unique. Keep searching, we all have unique qualities. You will just need to reflect and continue to highlight.Show your passion for the school. This is probably the single most important step. For example, you may be a great candidate for both Harvard and Stanford. You apply to both schools but for whatever reason Harvard is interested in you but not Stanford. If your top school is Stanford and did not show passion for attending Harvard, guess what? Harvard admissions team will probably figure this out! Your enthusiasm is a key indicator for the schools. Showing a passion for the school when they are also interested can seal the deal. Think about it, from the admissions officer\u2019s point of view. If they are looking at 2 candidates: one that shows a great passion for attending and another one that is just interested. Guess who will get the admissions packet?Securing an admissions to a prestigious college is never guaranteed. Sometimes it's difficult to understand why people are rejected because schools do not provide feedback. Nonetheless the steps above will help in increasing your chances to get accepted. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. There is no simple formula that you can follow to get into an Ivy League school. If there was, then getting into an Ivy League college wouldn\u2019t be as difficult or impressive. That being said, there are ways to make yourself a more competitive applicant. Here are 4 key ways to know if you qualify for top schools. Academics are an important piece of the equation for top schools. When they are looking for students, they will look at many different parts of your academic track record. Of course, they will look at your overall GPA, but they will also look into what types of classes you are taking. Are you challenging yourself to the highest level? They will look to see if there is an upward trajectory with your grades. They will take into account your class size when looking at your class rank. Your relationships are also an important factor here. Are you a legacy? If so, it\u2019s not always an easier route. They will expect you to know the university better than other applicants and have higher scores than your peers. Your recommenders also play a tremendous role in the admissions process. Your letters of recommendation are the only time that admissions officers are seeing an objective point of view on your candidacy. If you can have fantastic letters of recommendation, it will make a difference. Your essays play a critical role. Your personal statement should show your unique perspective and what you care most about! Your extracurriculars should align with your personal statement and show that you are motivated and passionate about what you\u2019ve pursued. Your supplemental essays need to be tailored to the specific school that you\u2019re applying to. Overall, Ivy League colleges read applications holistically. There is no single factor that guarantees admission or rejection. Try to be the best student you can be and if you excel in the areas listed above, then apply for Ivies and cross your fingers! ",

            "answer_text": "I think you have a good shot, but I don't think you will be able to easily get into the Ivy Leagues due to your GPA and 25th~50th percentile ACT score. You have pretty good extra-curriculars, so that's fine. I recommend that you write good essays and integrate your focused interest in majors within your essays wisely.  Furthermore, aside from GPA and test scores, I think demonstrating a focused interest and \"fit\" to the specific college is crucial. Not only that, but I personally believe that good college essays are a huge factor towards college acceptance.  For example, in terms of demonstrating my interest in Cornell's College of Human Ecology, I made sure to put lots of importance in writing good college application essays and joining major-specific extra-curriculars. There's a supplement essay on CommonApp for Cornell University where I was able to do that. Is this applicant really a good \"fit\" for this school? Does this applicant do specific EC's and demonstrate SPECIFIC interest in certain majors of this college?\"-- These are some questions that admissions officers might ask. And I kept these questions in mind when I wrote my essays. One strong aspect of my application was that my EC's were extremely focused on my major, Human Development, rather than all scattered around. I did gerontology research, Alzheimer's research, and specific sports that demonstrated my interest in sports medicine also. So..yeah. I focused extra-curriculars and compelling essays play a huge role in being able to get that acceptance letter. Of course, however, it is also important to have good GPA and good standardized test scores. Oh, and it's also important to reach out to good teachers who are confident in being able to write a stellar letter of recommendation for you. Good luck! :) ",

As I have said elsewhere, the number of applicants to Ivies is staggering, when one considers the odds of getting in. Also, admissions is only partly a numbers game; it is a far more subjective business than most applicants realize. Many applicants will have your numbers. Perhaps most of them will. And of course they will have terrific LORS too. The students who get in are different from those who don't often because they have communicated who they are to an admissions committee in a way that makes them unique, fascinating, likeable. Often this comes across in the LORS, but the essay is the golden opportunity to show yourself in this light. And there is no one way to do this. Presenting your best, most authentic self is always the right way to proceed, and then you must let the chips fall where they may. Decide carefully which Ivies to which you will apply, btw. They are not all the same, and they appreciate it when you demonstrate thoughtfulness in deciding where and why to apply. You will land in the place you are supposed to be. Perhaps that will be an Ivy. Perhaps not. It will all be all right, as you get out what you put in, wherever you go. Best of luck! ",

Although you may have spent hours on a particular activity in high school, if you do not capture that in the application in a meaningful manner, then you have done nothing in the admission officer's eyes. And that means writing stellar application essays. Of course, getting tip top grades, strong SAT, SAT Subject, and AP test scores, and strong leadership and extracurricular activities help significantly with the process. In this day and age, getting those is almost required and a minimum threshold to get in. Pursue activities that demonstrate your well roundedness and that you\u2019re passionate about - we\u2019ve all heard that over and over again. But you didn\u2019t need me to tell you that, did you? So why do these amazing, well-qualified people still get rejected every year? Because they didn\u2019t know how to write their personal statement. Let me tell you, getting into an Ivy League college depends on how well you carve together that college application and demonstrate those personal qualities through the personal statement. The personal statement is the one differentiating factor that separates the 1600 SAT, 4.0 GPA student from the one who has a 1580 SAT and 3.9 GPA at the same high school. These stats are no longer \u201cgood enough\u201d to differentiate one candidate from another - rather, they are typical scores and grades that the Ivy Leagues expect you to get. In fact, I will bet that a student with a lower score, say 1300 SAT and 3.8GPA with a stellar application and well written personal statement has a better shot than the 1600 SAT student with a poorly written personal statement at getting into the Ivy League. Princeton, my alma mater, states every year that if they could fill their entire class with valedictorians or 1600 SAT score students, they could do so easily. So how can you get into the Ivy League? Carve together a well thought out college application and personal statement that reflects the qualities that define you. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I would very much encourage you to look at range of schools outside of the top 50 universities and colleges. I am not saying you should not apply to any of these schools, but I am saying that any of these schools will fall into the reach category. I am not trying to be mean; I am just trying to be pragmatic based on knowing students who have been accepted to Ivies in recent years.  Almost all the students who are admitted to elite schools have exceptionally strong academic programs, top grades and high SAT/ACT scores. The occasional exception to this are what are called hooked students. These are students who are given special consideration. Among these groups are athletes, a few development cases and legacies, and  some who would add diversity to the class, and a few with special talents. Virtually all other students are outstanding  as far as all the numbers go. Your business acumen might fall into the special talent category, but you would have to have a great pitch in your application, interviews and recommendations.  To give just one example of what these school expect here are, the average SAT scores of students accepted to Penn (which I picked because of its business program): SAT Critical Reading\t690-780 SAT Math\t710-800 SAT Writing\t700-790 ACT Composite\t32-35 Testing means for the middle 50 percent of admitted students The bottom 25% of accepted students have below  a 2100. Your 1710 would put you  below the bottom 10% of those admitted. Your gpa also seems low compared to the almost all A's that most students have who are offered a spot. Even though you have business experience that far exceeds most students, your academics might give schools significant concern as to whether you can do well in a very competitive academic environment.  The good news is  that there are  untold thousands of very successful people who did not attend an Ivy or a super elite school. What is important is that you develop the skills you need wherever you go.  Best of luck ",

You can \u201cget in\u201d if your parents are very famous. Celebrities or politicians. You can \u201cget in\u201d if you would be what\u2019s termed, \u201ca legacy.\u201d (Your parents are alums of the Ivy League college to which you apply.) Of course, having excellent grades, excellent admission tests, and having some kind of special \u201ctalent\u201d or \u201cskill\u201d that impresses the college. Also, writing an excellent letter to the admissions committee of the college can help you \u201cget in.\u201d And now for a question for you: What is your motivation for \u201cgetting in?\u201d Have you visited Ivy League colleges in person? If so, did you sense a \u201cgood fit\u201d for you? Have you talked with students and alums of Ivy League colleges? If so, did what they have to say feel like a \u201cgood fit?\u201d Oh, I almost forgot this next \u201cget in\u201d possibility for you. Let the college know that you would take an \u201cearly admission.\u201d In other words, you\u2019ll immediately take an admission offer, if given an opportunity, rather than waiting around to see if you get \u201cbetter\u201d college acceptance letters. Sometimes colleges will accept a student who has applied if they know, for sure, that s/he\u2019ll commit to their school. Schools sometimes offer admission to these kind of applicants because it helps the schools to know ahead of time the number of students that they\u2019ll still have to consider for admission. An early acceptance student is a \u201csure thing\u201d for admissions staff and it makes their work less stressful for them. Most likely, you already know this next statement. But it\u2019s worth repeating. Make sure that you have a \u201csafe\u201d school in the event you aren\u2019t accepted to higher, more competitive college. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. It\u2019s disconcerting to hear about highly qualified people who didn\u2019t make it into their top choice schools. Unfortunately, there are a lot of those stories, as top schools are more selective than ever. However, if you have excellent qualifications, you can avoid this kind of disappointment by understanding the nature of the acceptance process and also by being flexible and not pinning all your hopes on one or two specific schools. Getting into an Ivy League or other top school is not a matter of playing the odds. Luck can sometimes play a role, but properly qualified people do get in. You need to get a good understanding of what it takes. Visit the schools; talk to the tour guides and anyone else you can find. You\u2019ll get a lot of general information, but try to fish for specifics, not grades and test scores (the numbers are readily available online), but factors like extracurriculars and other activities and talents that the individual might have. Look at a lot of schools (there are a number of highly ranked schools that aren\u2019t in the Ivy League whose degrees command just as much respect), and try to focus on whether they might be right for you. Ignore the rankings and opinions you hear from friends or relatives. For example, everyone knows that Harvard is a great place, but just because it has a gold-plated reputation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right school for everyone, and I\u2019m aware of people who got in and then transferred out because they realized that. You\u2019ll wind up with a list of schools you\u2019re happy with, and when the replies come out, you won\u2019t be among those complaining on College Confidential. ",

            "answer_text": "There are too many variables to this equation, however I'll try my best to summarize three years of searching and hard work. First let me state that, I wasn't accepted at any of the ivy league you mentioned but that's due to a weakness I realized I had but couldn't fix because it was too late, however I got into Rice University which was from my top choices and was also waitlisted by Columbia, Brown, Upenn and around 6 Liberal arts college. Later I was accepted from one of the three former waitlists but I still chose to attend Rice University. You see, Ivy league colleges aren't normal boring colleges right? So don't expect them to admit normal boring people. You must have something to add, a story to tell, a dream to fulfill, a talent to nurture. You must have something, you can't just be the average Jo and get in, it's almost practically impossible to see someone just average and plain I'm Harvard; well there you go that's what you have to do, find a \u201cspike\u201d and grow it. HOWEVER, the above is true given that you have stellar grades and GPA showing that you can actually survive there. Okay, I guess you're now asking, how do you practically show that spike? It's really simple: find a passion and pursue it. For example(it's not merely limited to that example it's just for the purpose of expressing my point), someone may realize at their freshman year that they are deeply interested in mathematics and they learn about the math Olympiad so they join a math course, a summer course or a math circle to develop their skills, they apply to a summer research program by their Junior or sophomore year and later that year publish a research paper, they participate in the olympiad in the summer of the junior year and bam they get a USAMO/IMO Gold, now that's a superstar he pursued his interest and succeeded, that doesn't mean that olympiad medals mean instant-acceptance that's just an example on how someone can pursue his interest and show a spike. EDIT: I'm adding another example, as the aforementioned Olympiad example is probably well-known. One student may have a deep interest in business and entrepreneurship, so he may in his freshman year get stellar grades in business, then apply for an internship and get accepted and taste the practical aspects of the business, then later he may have an idea about a start up that he want to pursue, then during his sophomore year he may have obtained fund and started working on it, later on he was accepted into LaunchX and by the end of his junior/senior year he has a business that's operating and is actually helping the community, now that's a nother superstar, and the list of ways to stand out is infinitely long. Given that you mix that with passionate, thoughtful, well written essays and above average SAT/ACT scores you're ready to go. Don't hesitate to message me anytime if you have any other questions!

This doesn't mean, do the most impressive thing for colleges. It means do the most impressive thing for yourself. Discover your interests and pursue them to the highest level available to you. If there isn't a high level available to you, make it yourself. Carve your own path.Sports. Even if you aren't planning to be a student-athlete, try to have at least one sport in your activities list. You don't have to be super intense and be on your school\u2019s team. Pick something for fun, like yoga, or amateur soccer with your friends. Besides being another extracurricular, it shows that you are an active individual who cares about your health. My Princeton interviewer flat out told me that nearly every student admitted did some sort of sport in high school, and that not playing one was a serious deterrent in admissions.Awesome teacher recommendations. Best-student-in-my-career kind of recommendations. Be friends with your teachers to garner that kind of glowing review.Want more advice?

            "answer_text": "For the best colleges, having perfect \u201cstats\u201d (grades, scores, etc.) does not necessarily mean a student is \u201cwell-qualified\u201d. Think about it this way: if all the colleges cared about were grades and scores, then why would they have you go through the whole application process?!? Kids with 34+ ACT/1500+ SAT, straight A\u2019s in the hardest classes, tons of APs\u2026 who attend the best high schools in the country routinely get rejected by the best colleges. Why? Well, there are literally thousands of these kids applying to all the top schools\u2026 and it\u2019s hard to tell them apart by just looking at \u201cstats\u201d. Top schools can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to admit all of them. Don\u2019t get me wrong: grades and scores are certainly important. But you will need more than perfect grades and scores to get in. Think of the other parts of your application that can help you stand out. Extracurricular activities are very important. Keep in mind that colleges look for \u201cwell-rounded\u201d applicants, those whose extracurriculars include some \u201cgroup\u201d (student government, sports, community service) and some \u201cindividual\u201d (music, academic competitions, honor societies) activities. However, if you\u2019re a superstar in something (say, you\u2019re a one of the best piccolo players in the U.S.) that will trump the need for well-roundedness. Most applicants, however, need some balancing. Worth noting here that a part-time job counts (in my mind) as an extracurricular activity and should definitely be mentioned especially if it\u2019s done during the school year. Anything that shows you can balance schoolwork with a solid commitment to other things helps your case. Do not pad your resume with activities for the sake of activities. Find a few things you enjoy and do them, well. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be a \u201cleader\u201d. Colleges value good \u201cteam members\u201d as well, particularly those who demonstrate grittiness, hard work, etc. There\u2019s also what I like to call the \u201cgood character\u201d test. Colleges want to build a harmonious class of students who will get along with each other and who will learn/grow with each other. Harvard\u2019s website asks the question: \u201cwould other students want to share a meal or a dorm with this student?\u201d Colleges typically find the answer to that question in teacher and counselor recommendations, so its important that the people writing them speak to your non-academic qualifications as well as your academic ones. Other things that affect your chances that are out of your control: colleges look for economic and racial diversity. They give preference to first generation college students, applicants with an interesting backstories (especially those who overcame significant adversity), and legacy applicants. ",

If possible, visit the three you choose and have a campus tour. Complete each institution\u2019s application materials. Think carefully about the questions the application asks. You need to put your best foot forward while completing the application honestly, carefully, and accurately and provide all the information each one seeks. Most, if not all, of the Ivies include an in-person interview with an alum living hear you as part of the admission process.

As a Harvard admissions interviewer, I think you are going about it the wrong way. Don't do things that you think we (Harvard admissions) will like. Do things that you are passionate about. Spend the next two years pursuing your interests as far as you can, overcoming whatever challenges that you encounter, handling any setbacks that occur. It's that focus, zeal and doggedness that we are looking for. Here are my answers to similar questions.

At Penn, there were 38,000 applications for about 2,000 spots in this years upcoming Freshman class. Even back in the day when I attended Penn, it was well known the University could easily fill the entire class with students just from say New York with perfect or near perfect grades, SAT scores, and outside activities and talents. The joke was you needed to be able to play the tuba with one hand and your eyes shut to have a shot at getting in. You need the metrics. You need the grades and SAT scores which are competitive for these schools. If you fall short, then there needs to be some reason the scores are not where they should be. Typically, it is an extraordinary long shot if this is not in place to start. Second, you need strong extracurricular activities. The best level of participation is a leadership position, which typically means being President of the organization. Third, you ideally want some of your extracurricular activities to be athletic activities. The Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships, but students who show leadership, creativitiy and accomplishment through athletics are well admired. It would be nice if I could be Katie Ladecky. Fourth, it is extremely helpful to have strong letters of recommendation. Letters help tie together pieces of the application. The letters are also a way for the real leaders to stand out among the many many students vying for these few select spots. ",

            "answer_text": "Mihir Chakravarti got the basic points. I'd add that the colleges are tending to get more savvy towards people who fill their application resumes with padding, so if you're going to do something, make it a real commitment. Plus, everyone hates the sort of guy who's doing things just to pad their resume - do you really want to be that sort of person? I'd honestly recommend working on one or two projects on the side, whatever interests you. Is it trying to make a game mod? Is it building a kinetic sculpture? Is it learning folk songs from old folks who live in your area? While intelligence helps, a lot of success in college and beyond is a certain doggedness; the ability to try something, persevere, give up after a long night of nothing working and then start right up again the next morning. I've had a few professors tell me that they love hiring people who grew up on ranches/farms into their labs because they are the sort of people to \"get things done\". I've had a guy from a National Lab telling me that he loves hiring musical people because these people already demonstrated that they stuck with a difficult, frustrating thing FOR YEARS. Even if you're not doing something so grand as winning the Intel Science Fair, really showing the sort of commitment to a project and being able to talk about it* will serve you very well. Particularly, you'll want something where you can talk about what you learned, if your project changed from your initial idea and how you dealt with that, and what you might do differently the next time. I'd note that I'm speaking as a scientist/engineer, so my answer may be a bit off if you're looking at getting into the humanities, fine arts, etc. If you can tell me what sort of field you're looking at getting into I could give some more specific advice. *There's two opportunities you'll really get to talk about this: in your college admissions essay and a personal interview, if you can get one arranged. Pretty much every major college will have an interviewer in your local area, generally someone who's an alumnus. If not, it's likely you'll meet one if you go on a campus visit. ",

            "answer_text": "An Ivy League? There is only one. To get in, you need to be qualified. This means high GPA, high SAT scores. You need to interview well, extracurriculars help, but are mainly used to show that you are well rounded. Once qualified, they see how you fit into the class. This means that a well qualified applicant from Wyoming has a slightly better chance than a well qualified applicant from Manhattan, since there are lots of qualified applicants from Manhattan. Similarly, a well qualified Native American may have an advantage over a well qualified Asian, for the same reason. These schools turn down more qualified applicants than they accept. The important thing to realize is that if you don\u2019t get into an Ivy League school, you can still get into a great school. The top graduate schools give a better education than good ones. But any school in the top 50 will give you a similar quality education on the undergraduate level. The main things that you should look for when choosing one of these schools is whether or not your major is offered, and if it is the right environment for you. Some other schools actually have better teaching on the undergraduate level, because they don\u2019t concentrate their efforts on graduate students. I will match my undergraduate education (Villanova \u2014 ranked 45) with any school. I was still able to get accepted at several elite schools for graduate work (I turned down an Ivy League school, but have graduate degrees from Duke and Berkeley). ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Btw, if you are currently a CO 2023 applicant, join the group chat for applicants now! Here\u2019s how - download Mascot, search \u201cYale\u201d and join the group! Current college students: welcome to start your own group and help answer questions about your college! - 1. Start early. If you have time the summer before senior year, this can be a great time to get a head start on your Common App essay. This will give you more time to reflect on your draft and revise more thoughtfully, rather than scrambling at the last minute to make changes. Trust me, it will also save you stress if you have a buffer of a few days built in, just to accommodate for any final pieces you want to change and to avoid concerns like \u201cwhat if my Internet doesn\u2019t work at 11:55PM the day of the deadline when I\u2019m trying to submit!\u201d 2. Stay organized. Know when deadlines are for various schools. Know what supplementary materials you may need (or have the option to include) at each. Set up a reasonable schedule for finishing extra essays or administrative details which ensures that you get everything done, but won\u2019t become overloaded. If you must copy and paste a certain essay, because it happens to fit more than one school\u2019s prompt really well (I generally advise being very thoughtful with every essay, but there were a couple of times I copy/pasted simply because schools\u2019 supplemental materials happened to be essentially identical), don\u2019t forget to change school-specific details! 3. Maintain a healthy balance of following parents\u2019, teachers\u2019, and friends\u2019 advice versus ignoring it. All of it is well-intentioned, of course, and it can often be helpful. However, simply following every piece of advice you\u2019re going to it will lead to 2 key problems. First of all, you will often receive conflicting advice\u2014someone will say, \u201cfocus more on your piano activities than your Boy Scout activities!\u201d while others will say \u201cfocus more on your Boy Scout activities than on your piano activities!\u201d Each will have valid reasons, but always changing things around can lead to unnecessary work. And you have to ask yourself: does it really matter which you focus on more, if they\u2019re both significant and interesting parts of your life? Probably not. The second issue that can arise, is that if all of your application is heavily tailored based on others\u2019 advice, you risk no longer sounding like your true, authentic self. To avoid both of these issues, I advise that if it\u2019s a small, nit-picky suggestion that you don\u2019t immediately agree with (e.g. this wouldn\u2019t apply to a clear grammatical mistake), ignore it. If it\u2019s a big picture thing where you don\u2019t immediately disagree, spend some time thinking about what this change might look like, implement it in a separate version, and compare the two on your own terms, or with a different person. 4. Don\u2019t forget to enjoy senior year! There is a good chance that you and your friends from high school will end up scattered at schools across the country. As exciting as college is (and as stressful as the application process may seem), don\u2019t let this get in the way of enjoying the last few months spending quality time with those you\u2019ve become closest to.

Certainly, apply, but realize that there are a thousand excellent schools where you might be much happier, and where you will get a first-rate education and also lay the foundation for great success in life. Admission to an Ivy League school is absolutely no guarantee of success. Know yourself. What environment best suits you and your learning style. Small school with small classes and attentive faculty (Reed, Swarthmore, Carlton, Grinnell, Bryn Mawr), large research university with many opportunities for collaboration with top-ranked faculty (Minnesota, Michigan, UCLA, Indiana), urban school (Macalester, Wayne State, Carnegie-Mellon, NYU), rural/small-town college (Antioch, Kenyon, Middlebury, Dennison), southern (Tulane, Rollins, University of Alabama, University of Texas, Trinity University) northern (Bowdoin, Bates, Michigan Tech, Binghamton, Rochester). All of these and more are great schools where you will succeed. If you somehow fixate on the Ivy League, you are only setting up a false goal. Your goal should be to get a great education for a great career, and there are so many opportunities to do this if take care and make the choice that is right for YOU. ",

So you want to do other things, like service, to make you seem like a full circle. But that won\u2019t get you to an Ivy these days. You need to really be special in something, or quite special in a couple things, you get the idea. To do this, simply pursue your interests and go as far as you can with them. (Ex: if you like business, maybe make your own!- and also be apart of business-y clubs).Sorta unrelated point: If you get interviewed or have to write something about why the school fits you, make sure you\u2019ve done your research and can give reasons why that school is a better fit for you than another, as well as why you are a better fit for it than another.It seems really easy when you look at it like this.

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t any one answer for this since students who study in the Ivys generally show their excellence in different ways. However, there are a few general rules to follow. If you want to get into the Ivys, you should start preparing from the beginning of 11th grade. Anytime after that is too late. First, always maintain good grades. This is the most crucial point. Your school marks from 11th grade onward is the factor that admissions officials will check first. If your scores are good, only then will they proceed into the bulk of your application. Always be in the top 10% of your class. Second, plan your extracurriculars wisely. These are the basis for the essays you will have to write which form the bulk of your application. There isn\u2019t any single formula, but try to do something that benifits society. They love that kind of stuff. If you have a particular hobby, say guitar, maybe create some sort of music class. Or play for the elderly. One of my seniors got admission into Wharton. He was school captain, the founder and president of two nonprofit organisations, started a Model United Nations and cofounded a web development company (that actually made quite a bit of money). See, the ECs have to be on point if you want to go to the world\u2019s best. (but you don\u2019t really have to be as good as this guy). Third, start writing your college essays well in advance. These will be read very thoroughly as they are the most important factor in securing admission. They will contain all of your achievements and goals for the future, etc. There are plenty of websites available which give guidelines for writing these. My senior who is now in Wharton took two months writing and editing for four to five hours a day doing this. Also get good letters of recommendation from your principal, teachers, etc. Fourth, Give the SAT and Subject SATs and score as high as possible. Don\u2019t waste your time giving more than two attempts each. They aren\u2019t as important as the other factors. It\u2019s more of a formality. You should get a score of 2150 or higher as per the old SAT (I don\u2019t really know what it is for the new SAT, but the college board does have conversion tables on its official website). Try to get full in the subject SATs. This is easier to do. And most importantly, Do research. Read the official websites. Ask around. There are too many nitty-gritties to be explained in just one answer. Only extensive research can help you decide the best way to get there. No pressure :) ",

These include your GPA and class rank if your school ranks coupled with the rigor of courses you are taking or took;two SAT subject tests, one of which should be math if you are interested in a STEM major;your scores on standardized tests that you have taken; andsince I am assuming you are an international student, your English as a second language test results.You should have a standardized test score in the at least the 25th percentile, preferable 75th percentile or higher for the school you want to attend. Your SAT Subject Tests should be in the upper range. A perfect score on the Math 2 test is 800 and 12% of the students who took the test last year had an 800. Your GPA should be over 4.0 if it is weighted which indicates that you have taken honors and college prep courses. If your metrics are in the ball park, you have as they say your foot in the door. But there is much you still have to do to open it completely. You need to create an interesting narrative about yourself that will make the admission officers reading your application want to know more about you and even admit you. You have already started on it in your comments above. The one thing you do need to weigh is how much you want to reveal about your illness. If you are intent on telling the story about a maturing, recovering young adult who battled with depression and illness including anorexia, then I would suggest you emphasize the positives of your recovery and not the negatives of your disease. Ivy League schools are stressful places and you don\u2019t want to give the admissions officials any room to think that if you were admitted you might succumb to the pressures and once again sink into depression. Depression on campus is a serious issue and university officials are struggling with how to cope with it. ",

The things you are doing in addition to coursework are very impressive and certainly show you to be someone who can make a positive contribution to the school. One issue might be how much of your coursework will be accepted by the university. Are you willing to go for another 3 years instead of 2? Obviously, finances are an issue. Also, rather than trying to get into a school based on the reputation, find out which of the schools make a transition from another college relatively painless. Sometimes that transition is actually easier with a larger school (like my school, Cornell). (Unfortunately, while I love Cornell and respect many of the physics professors, I do not recommend the undergraduate physics department and would suggest looking at engineering physics or theoretical and applied mechanics.) I think you have a fair chance of being accepted to one or more of the schools you identified. Harvard and Princeton - probably not. Cornell - maybe. Georgia and U of M - yes. Good luck. ",

That\u2019s common sense. The hardest part, by far, of getting into a place so competitive is DIFFERENTIATING yourself. In terms of supply and demand, they turn away 9 kids for every 1 they accept. Some are not so competitive, but you get the idea. So find your gem, polish it, and start telling your story. Let everyone know about your dream of being a professional cat herder. Post videos everywhere. Have something to speak for your talents. Let the cats speak for you.  ",

            "answer_text": "Simple answer, you need to: Take a very rigorous set of classes from your 9th through 12th gradesAttend a strong secondary school that\u2019s on the radar of all the Ivy League admissions committeesAce those classes and land on the top end of the class you are applying \u2014 these days a 4.5 weighted GPA or higher is a good barCrush the ACT or SAT (or both) \u2014 99% or higherScore 5\u2019s on many AP exams or 800s on a good number of subject testsProve you\u2019re incredible (again, ideally the top 1%) at three or more of the following: extra curriculars, sports, community supporting organizations, artistic endeavors, scientific specialties, computer programming, writing and/or speech, debate, or any activity or endeavor the schools recognize or needBe a part of some ethnicity or underrepresented population that the Ivy you\u2019re applying to needsWrite the most compelling and meaningful personal statements and supplementary essays required by the institutionObtain a plethora of accolades by again recognized organizations like winning the national spelling bee or placing (ideally winning) in the Intel Science CompetitionAlso, be able to obtain the best recommendations possible from your instructors over the years (so, you\u2019ll want to cultivate very meaningful and sincere relationships with your teachers)Be some prodigy in an area like the theatre arts, music, the natural sciences, design, architecture, web development, engineering, business, or almost any subject matter that the university again will recognizeOr anything else that can make you so \u201cpointy\u201d that a University will easily recognize your application against the tens of thousands of others competing against you for the limited spotsAnd if you have wealthy parents or a long list of legacy alumni, your chances could be higher if they donated a large sum or sponsored some part of the school in a significant mannner. The legacy advantage is smaller than ever, but it can still help.The other way is find an incredible and effective college consultant who can guide you through the process. They are paid to help you get in. And the good ones will definitely put you in a better position. Also, make sure they are able to spend enough time with you and aren\u2019t loaded up with too many clients because they are mainly in it for the money. Lastly, the earlier you start, the better. ",

All the information about what is required and when will be on the admission pages of the college itself. There is no substitute. Read all the information on the admissions pages for tips as well as deadlines. Colleges usually accept applications starting in the fall for admission the following fall. Some have optional ED/EA deadlines. Regular deadlines start at year end for most schools but there are colleges that accept application all through the spring. Sometimes you need your application in early if you are applying for aid. Financial aid applications are due at the same time as your admission application or shortly after. There are many exceptions, check the website for each college. Remember that most schools are need blind but do not meet full need (most public colleges fall into this category.) You seem to be talking about need blind schools that will also meet need. If you are an international there are only 6 need blind schools that meet full need.* Yet there are need aware colleges that will meet need if you are accepted. Some schools offer preferential packaging and meet need of just the most desirable students, due to budget constraints. There are other colleges that may give you merit awards. If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident there are at least 30 more need blind, meets full need. At at least 60+ that will meet need.  Then there are cases like the UC system that only meets need for instate students who are low income.  I am not sure what 'class 11' is. *See the citation in this Wikipedia article (Amherst, Dartmouth, Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Yale are the only ones that are need blind and meet need guarantee for all students including internationals. This is well known so they get a disproportionate amount of international student applications.)Need-blind admission ",

It is important to show that you genuinely care about the things you have done in high school and illustrate how Harvard would be a good fit for you and also how you would be a great addition to the school. Being a national champion definitely helps! It suggests that you have countless self-defining experiences that you can draw upon, so use them to your advantage. Your SAT scores do not matter as much as others would suggest...I know people who have gotten a perfect score but failed to get into top schools. I also know people with sub 2000 scores that have been accepted to top ten schools. Basically, schools want to see that you have the ability to succeed in their environment. Think of an acceptance as an investment, and show that you are committed to making good returns. Mainly, spend time think carefully about all your experiences and use them to depict yourself in the best way possible. ",

            "answer_text": "The admissions statistics for the year 2020 for Harvard just like in the previous years show that still getting to Ivy League School is hard. From nearly 40,000 applications, only barely 2,000 will be accepted, which is 5%. To improve the likelihood of getting accepted, besides being an exceptional student with top grades, you need to make an extra effort. Just like you will have to when applying for one of the better trainee jobs at private companies. Reach out to several local alumni for guidance. Perhaps they will be interviewing you during the admissions process. Harvard hires more than 15,000 alumni to help recruit students from all 50 states and from around the world. If you are not lucky and after consulting with the alumni you get examined by somebody else you still have the chance of being recommended form the respected old grad. Don't waste the opportunity. Bear in mind, it's known that the applicants need to demonstrate a fairly pushy nature. You are expected to \u201cmove heaven and earth\u201d to get what you want.

How exactly to accomplish this is often a mystery to students and parents going through the admissions process.

In high school, I got into every school I applied to, including Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and Stanford, and I attended Harvard for college. I also learned a lot about my classmates and the dynamics of college admissions in ways that were never clear to me in high school. Now, I'm sharing this expertise with you. I\u2019ve written the most comprehensive guide to getting into top schools. I\u2019m going to explain in detail what admissions officers at Ivy League schools are really looking for in your application.

            "answer_text": "While there's no guaranteed way to get into an Ivy League school, there are a few things you can do to greatly improve your chances. First off, you need to work hard.  Get and maintain high grades all throughout high school, and they to do as well as possible on admissions tests like the SAT and ACT. From there, look for a way to differentiate yourself.  High scholastic achievement is essentially a pre-requisite for the Ivy League; nearly everyone else who applies will have great grades and fantastic test scores too.  In order to stand out from the crowd, you need to have some distinctive talent--and preferably two or three--that makes you special. Finally, think about what Lori Dunlap said in her response: \"Why do you want to go there?\" Sitting down and thinking about this question has two benefits.  First, it helps you decide if an Ivy League school is really the right fit for you.  Second, if you decide you want to put in the work necessary for Ivy League admissions, a great response to this question can be another way to stand out from the other applicants and give you a leg up. Good Luck! ",

You have to be able to perform academically, and a reader has to be able to independently verify that your business is real for it to add value. It is doubtful that you are interested in all 8 clubs equally, or that together they tell some sort of cogent story. How significant are these businesses if you can still belong to 8 clubs (or conversely how meaningful is your club membership)? I see marketing business and I ask myself if this is doing social media for unsavvy local mom and pop shops - it shows that you get out and find paid work that uses your skills, but not necessarily better in my eyes than working consistently for five years in a mom and pop shop or the local grocery chain with advancement.  You are glorifying your activities with titles that might not be justified - marketing business, serial entrepreneur since age 9 (have you launched anything that is nationally known? do these businesses still exist? how significant were they?). Anything that sounds too good to be true is suspect. It isn't that your accomplishments are not worth anything; rather, you need to present them in their true light and more isn't necessarily better.

Yes, an average student can get into MIT UC Berkley or Stanford. Sounds strange, but possible! All you have to do is, project yourself as a passionate innovator who can bring about new solutions through your out of box thinking. US Universities look for an Einstein, Edison and Tesla inside you. Much more than your academic scores, they are eager to find out the hidden scientist inside you. So, explain in details, your past research projects and future areas of work where you see lot of opportunities. Remember, Edison had been to school for just three months in his lifetime. In middle school, Einstein was a very ordinary student. Thus, the ability to become a scientist depends much more on innovative thinking than on being a class topper. So, think out of box, and you may end up with a path-breaking discovery. So what matters is your passion for the subject and your drive for innovation. By - www.statementofpurpose.co.in ",

This should not be taken as discouragement. Rather, it is a call to action. To be successful, you will have to strive mightily. Not just A\u2019s but A\u2019s in the toughest courses. Not just participation in extracurriculars but leadership and passion. There are lots of bright, hardworking passionate students - more than the 15,000 or so openings in the Ivy League. Nonetheless, if you set your sights on the Ivy League, you\u2019ll achieve better results than if you take an easier path. ",

Read his list. There is an emphasis from some of the Ivy league schools to accept more public school educated students. There is also a move to accept a more diverse student body. Armed with this, you cannot be accepted unless you send an application. The worst outcome will be a rejection. ",

That said, I'd say you've got a decent chance of getting at least one acceptance. Your scores don't disqualify you and if you present your experiences (with water polo and the volunteer work you did) well, they may be compelling to an admissions committee. Or not. Maybe they'll accept some other national polo champion instead. There's really no way to predict. This is all laying aside the option of being recruited to play water polo, which you should be looking into. The US governing body of college athletics is the NCAA, and if you satisfy their standards for amateur status (NCAA Eligibility Center -- it's a terrible interface, I know), college athletic departments often have a surprising amount of influence on the admissions committee.

You should invest some time in answering this for yourself, because it will take a lot of time and energy to do what you need to do to be competitive (AP classes, test prep, extra-curricular activities), so you need to know why you're doing all this work and, at some point (most likely) taking on debt to pay for an Ivy League education. In other words, you need to do a cost/benefit analysis before investing yourself in this path. Another reason to answer this question is because admissions officers at these schools will want to know the answer as well.

You can work to get superb SAT scores, and I believe I have given some advice about this in my blog, \"Studying in America!\u201d You should learn as much American culture as possible. The Asian education system, both in India and in China, tends to focus on a single subject to the exclusion of all else. The American education system, especially in the Ivy League, tends to value broad and eclectic knowledge: a bit of art, archaeology, history, English, music, psychology, sociology, philosophy \u2013 oh, and maybe some science. You should know something about sports. baseball, basketball, and football are the most common, but if you\u2019re applying this year, make sure you know something about such Olympic events as swimming, diving, track and field, and gymnastics. Make sure you keep up with the presidential elections; if you are interviewed, that would be a very common topic for conversation. You might also find it helpful to read some of my posts in Your Academic Evidence. Parke Muth has a blog, and his is much more related to college-level admissions than mine; I specialize in graduate admissions, particularly law school. ",

You need to start clubs, study groups, businesses, non-profits etc. YOU have to be the leader and founder of these things. It makes sense that Ivy league schools look for these skills. These are skills that are real-world applicable, and really the only skills that matter in determining future success. Some people will get into the Ivy league on intelligence alone, some people will get in on athleticism alone, but most people will get in because they display, in their application, their ability to create successful collaborations that didn\u2019t already exist.

Work on the other parts of your application. Give the SATs. Score above a 1400 out of 1600. Give Atleast 2 subject tests, try scoring above 750 in each of them.

You should be amongst the top couple of hundred seniors in the country at what makes you great, prefferably the top hundred, and you should be able to prove this in your application. Students with that kind of strength generally have the other requirements for admission, and the university will try to admit them as long as they can handle the academic rigour and have no red flags. I recently wrote a post analyzing Harvard admissions. Amongst the population I analyzed, nearly 60% of offers of admission came from the top 4% of applicants. These are mostly students who demonstrated that they belong through one or more great strengths. On average, these students were likely to get in. Yes, more than 18% of admissions came from students in the bottom five sixths of applicants. But on average these applicants were admitted less than 1% of the time. If you want to get in, you need to stand out. The filler that round out classes at elite universities have dreadful a priori odds and are basically counting on luck to get in. You should count on strength. ",

Try to join some physics organization or research facility. Basically anyhands-on contribution like research, external examinations or anything related to that will eventually give you prefrence because it shows your commitment to your field of work. I would definitely recommend applying with Early Decision if you have a specidic college in mind. It literally doubles your chances of being accepted. Not figuratively, literally. I went through some statistics that said that Princeton accepted 18% of their ED students and just 9% of the general pool. Cornell too accepted 38% ED but just 18% general pool. So look into scholarships, your major's program and its rigour and other factors too. Buy the Princeton Review's 378 Best Colleges. I found it to be pretty useful when I was applying. ",

Top two things i want in a new grad (1) business culture are they a good fit (2) do they have good critical thinking quick on their feet skills. My next door neighbor is a plastic surgeon did not graduate from an Ivy league school or even close. He is in a practice with 7 other plastic surgeons all more or less performing the same work, same skills, same specialties, etc. There all paid about the same and two of them did go to Ivy league schools-the bottom line difference? about $400K in student loan debt each have so you tell me.

But investment banks or top consulting cos like MBB look at Ivy educated profiles with a much more favourable manner. When they put these candidates before their clients, they expect a certain awe at these profiles. So, these Ivy leagues have the luxury of getting large amount of applications with best possible profiles and have the luxury of selecting a few. . Hence extracurriculars become all the way important. Not list of ECs but excellence in ECs. Ivy leagues are also very expensive. So, excellent academic profile, graduating from reputed private high schools, with near perfect SAT scores and excellence in ECs.

I mean it is hard to say exactly what to do, because they don't want you to do things just because it will look good when applying to MIT; they're not interested in a freshman class composed of a bunch of grade-grubbers who have been jumping through academic hoops because their parents tell them to. Also, it has always been my theory that the alumni interview is more important than people give it credit, the alumni interview being a direct means for the Institute to gauge the intangible I-belong-at-MIT quality that I am talking around.

All you can do now is put your best foot forward when you apply and hope for the best. Each of the Ivy League schools are also different. There's no single type of student who has the best chance for getting into an Ivy League school. Each admissions committee is very careful in how they put together the incoming class and eavh school is unique and different from the others in the Ivy League. Sorry if that's not a satisfying answer. Also, you should know that the Ivy League doesn't have a monopoly in the world of higher education. Acceptance into an Ivy League school does not guarantee success later on. More important than anything is how you use your time in college to grow personally and professionally. For some, an Ivy League school is a good fit, and for others it isn't. It's a very personal decision. Before you decide where to apply, actually visit schools and talk to people to get a feel for what kind of institution you would succeed in.

This shows that you are organized, manage your time well and are a good learner as well as self motivated. This should give you plenty to write about in the essay when adcoms want to see a person behind the high GPA and high SAT. Remember they admit people not just stats. There is no guarantee for admission but you stand a good chance of getting admitted to institutions that are comparable that are not ivy schools. ",

Have high standardized test scores and be a member of a minority or identity group in which the university is interested. As the recent Harvard lawsuit has revealed, Asian applicants are not considered an identity group that needs a boost. To the contrary, they may even face penalties. This makes no sense but biases rarely do. As you can see, some of these point above are things you have control over. Most of them you do not have control over. However, since the common application asks you how you identify your gender, in my opinion one could also identify as a different ethnicity. After all, if you can deny the presence of a Y chromosome why would you not also be able to deny the fact that you are Caucasian or Asian? Perhaps you identify (ethnically and sexually) differently, right? Just my two cents ~ ",

Work with a counselor to develop a plan.  There are NO general formulas.  Each student should find their strengths and maximize them and take their weaknesses and improve them. After you develop a comprehensive plan you will be able to evaluate what schools you should apply too.

The cultural fit is often evaluated by your involvement in extracurricular activities and work for a social cause. They also evaluate your passion for the subject that you want to specialize in. This is because the curriculum in Ivy Leagues is majorly based on the practical and experiential learnings and not theoretical. Admissions officers also evaluate your profile to see if you have a clear vision of your short and long-term career goals. Do you have your heart set on a particular career? What have you done to show your liking for that career? These are some of the aspects they look at while evaluating any student profile. Hope this helps. All the best! ",
