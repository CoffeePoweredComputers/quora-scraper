            "answer_text": "This is a right question to be discussed. Well I have some specific reasons. Highest Youth population: In our nation, most no. of youth people are present. Millions sit to give same examination and that's why competition intensifies.Method of education: In almost whole world and not only an India, doing H.W and going school regularly is compulsory. And it's a bitter truth that no one can get selected with these barriers. This is why people have to drop years for getting selected.Lieing toppers: Freshers often try to know how toppers studies. The biggest lie they say, \u201cStudy NCERT\u201d. Guys, you need some competitive reference to top up the competition.Mental Stress: Biggest enemies- your relatives. Assume after inter you sit in NEET/IIT and get failed since it was your first attempt. Relatives will then surely comment- Leave NEET/IIT and go for BDMS or banking exams. They creates hell on earth itself.In the above scenario, I tried to mention some practical reasons. The best way to over come is: \u2022 Take some leavs in 11th and 12th to have better preparation. Utilize every holidy and specially try to comple half course in summer and winter vecations. \u2022 Use Google and search for one of the best books to ace 12th Boards + Competition. \u2022 Don't tell which competition you are going to appear after 12th. \u2022 Never read toppers view. Make your own view of learning because no topper will like to tell his/her tips and allow you in breaking their records. All the best :-) ",
