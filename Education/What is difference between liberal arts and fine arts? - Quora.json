            "answer_text": "The liberal arts are the disciplines regarded as essential to the well-educated person in the western world. In the 8th century BCE, the Greeks coined the term \"liberal arts\" to define those subjects or skills that were considered essential for a free person (man) in order that he might participate in civic life. These skills included grammar, logic and rhetoric plus arithmetic, geometry, the theory of music and astronomy. These seven liberal arts are often personified in western art. \u201cLiberal arts\u201d come from the Latin \"liberalis,\" or \"free\" and \"ars\" or \"principled practice. Nowadays, of course, the subject areas associated with the liberal arts have expanded considerably. The fine arts, however, are those creative activities that include painting, sculpture, architecture, music (composition and performance), dance, drama, poetry and literature. The fine arts align somewhat more neatly with the Muses of Greek mythology although there is always overlap between the fine and liberal arts. ",

            "answer_text": "I Googled a definition for \u201cliberal arts\u201d and it said this: Academic subjects such as literature, philosophy, mathematics, and social and physical sciences Indeed, I think of Liberal Arts as being pretty equivalent to the \u201cgen ed\u201d requirements. There may be some nitpicky differences but for broad understanding, this idea will suffice. Fine arts, on the other hand, are specifically the visual and performing arts: music, theater, and visual art like painting or graphic design. ",
