            "answer_text": "As an online ESL/English teacher, I\u2019m a bit biased,but why wouldn\u2019t you feel comfortable taking a class online? That\u2019s the question. Are some online classes bogus? Sure. Are some online teachers ineffective? Sure. Guess what? Some traditional classes are bogus. Some traditional teachers are ineffective. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of the delivery system. Like everything else, you have to do your research to get the most accurate picture. I can tell you this: online classes aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. Especially now, in light of these days of social distancing. Many students perform better in online classes. They appreciate the convenience, the less stressful environment and individual attention the format allows. Others students don\u2019t fit in as well. Each student has his or her own learning style. Do what suits you best. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I teach online so perhaps I should not answer that. In my opinion, what matters is that the instructor / tutor / lecturer is qualified to teach his/her subject for the relevant age group, and knows how to design an online session that meets the desired outcomes using the available online tools well and inventively. For me this last word is important: you will enjoy a course a lot more if the content is really engaging. Last, but not least, I would not take a substantial course that does not include live interactions with other students: all subjects benefit from well-designed discussions that help drive learning more deeply, for longer and will even be useful for other subject areas.
