            "answer_text": "I think the most frowned-upon thing would be how we played more than did schoolwork. I actually don\u2019t remember any schoolwork in kindergarten, but there may have been some. Still, there was no worrying about \u201cgetting ready\u201d for school. I recall going out on playgrounds, going on a field trip in the woods and ending up at a lovely spring (natural water source), and when inside doing a lot of finger painting. We also made crafts, such as a jewelry box made from a cigar box\u2014with gold spray paint over glued-on dry macaroni noodles. I even gave it a mirror inside, somehow. I went to a private kindergarten, at the kindergarten director\u2019s home, in 1962, when I was 4. Then I went to another one at a church in 1693, when I was 5. They were similar experiences, with arts & crafts and outdoor time. Everything was organized and well supervised. Both kindergartens I attended were well run. And they were fun. At age 4, I did NOT want to go to kindergarten. I was one of those kids who wanted to stay home or at least with family. But the carpool started (organized by the moms), and the first day of kindergarten, I got into that big ol\u2019 station wagon and just went. Didn\u2019t really know what to expect. But I adjusted fairly quickly, and learned to enjoy it\u2014mostly. Also, and this probably would be frowned upon now, one of the kindergarten teachers (though they didn\u2019t use that word then for the ladies in charge at kindergarten), came to my birthday party! She was the guest of honor. I loved her a lot, and my mom invited her, pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and all. Guess that wouldn\u2019t happen these days. At that time public schools where I lived were for grades 1\u201312. Kindergartens were privately run. So as you may imagine, a lot of kids\u2019 parents couldn\u2019t afford to send them to kindergarten, even though I\u2019d guess the price for attending was quite low. Most moms didn\u2019t work outside the home then (except my best friend\u2019s mom was the switchboard operator at the local mill office). So I\u2019d say only the fairly well-off families sent their kids to kindergarten. Oh\u2014and it was only during the morning. We were home by lunchtime, unless there was a special picnic or something. ",

            "answer_text": "I have no idea what kindergarten consisted of many decades ago in my preschool childhood era, which to be accurate was more than 6 decades ago as I did not attend. I remember there was one in the neighbourhood, but I didn\u2019t enjoy sleeping in the afternoons and I was not permitted to attend if I did not agree to sleep in the afternoon. I refused to sleep where I did not feel secure - I only felt secure in our rented home with my Mother and/or Nonna present. One should heed our child\u2019s personal feelings if possible. My Nonna, despite working five days a week 8 hour days was tasked with caring for me, as my mother worked outside the home, so I needed to be relatively quiet and behave. I amused myself listening to all the women\u2019s radio programs in the morning, Portia Patia's Life, When a girl marries, Dr Paul, and so on, while I cut out pictures and drawings from Nonna\u2019s older Vogue magazines she kept for her clients to view. I can still remember the opening cadence of those radio serials, in the crisp Anglicised English in Australia of that era. I also always had a cat to play with - I used to drag a wooden empty cotton spool on a piece of string along to entice my cat to engage - engage it did. We frolicked around without a care in the world, my cat and I.  Modern day kindergarten photo courtesy of google: Four decades ago our children attended preschool kindergarten, and from what I can remember of their day, which was during the hours from 9 am to 3 pm, it consisted of free play to commence with. Play was organised mainly inside then the kinder teacher and assistants would read children's stories and sing nursery rhymes to their charges, who in our children\u2019s kinder were split into two groups. I can remember much physical frolicking outdoors and indoors, when I collected them in the afternoon, which came with every variety of playground equipment, water toys, sandpit and climbing frames outside. Inside there were various creative works, involving drawing, painting, puzzles, play dough and so forth and many toys. I assume all activities were loosely structured and supervised from afar as it was a preschool kindergarten, not a long day childcare centre which were not available 40 plus years ago. One of our daughters liked to play with the Jacaranda blossoms dreaming up all sorts of magical lands, and travels, she would tell me about on our trip home, and also like her siblings painted up a storm of artworks on the easel on butchers paper which are packed away somewhere needing now to be binned. Lunch was not provided - parents provided their own children\u2019s lunches, and afternoon naps were enforced. A child could lie and day dream and perhaps fall asleep but it was quiet time and lying on fold out hammock type cavass camp beds on frames was the style with no chatter permitted. Now many children attend long day care centres as their mothers work. Indeed, on the other end of the spectrum, I have friends whose grandchildren not only never went to preschool kindergarten they were home schooled until mid to late high school years. There are many variables available today, and many possibilities. I prefer preschool kindergarten of the times our children attended, not long day care and I did not have a yen for home-schooling. I doubt I would enjoy undertaking that and I am not a trained or qualified preschool or primary school teacher which is specialised. Everyone is different and has different and varying concepts and tastes. There is today room for all. I hope my reminiscences are of use.
