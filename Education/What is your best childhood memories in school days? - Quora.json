            "answer_text": "Playing tricks on teachers. I'll relate one here that I though was the most memorable and hilarious. Our high school had an outstanding basketball team. Our games were always sold out.Our Physics teacher was in charge of ticket sales. There were several different colors of tickets and the colors rotated for each game. The rolls of tickets were kept in a back room. One day the teacher left the room for a while. One boy decided to sneak back and steal a roll of tickets.All he had to do was wait until the game where that particular color of ticket was used and he could sell them. Finally the game arrived. It was against our biggest rival and was sure to attract a big crowd. Everyone was looking for tickets. The teacher sold his tickets. The student sold his tickets. When the fans started arriving, it was like trying to stick a round peg into a square hole. It just wasn't going to happen. Fans were packing in like sardines in a can. And here in the middle of the crowd was our poor Physics teacher getting pushed to and fro and shouting at the top of his lungs \u201c I don't understand how this could happen\u201d. I was laughing so hard that I had tears streaming down my face and my sides began to hurt. All the people couldn't fit into the gym and after it was full they had to lock the doors. People were screaming to get in and began pounding on the doors. They had to call extra police to escort people out who had paid for a game that they didn\u2019t get to see. I don't think I ever laughed so hard in my life. The boy never got caught, the Physics teacher never had a clue and oh yeah, we won the game. ",

            "answer_text": "The school days were just irreplaceable . This was the only place were most of us enjoyed our studying .There is no tag of being average .Most of the teachers were our life changers and a very good friends .We got best friends whom we cannot replace throughout our entire life.No fake friendships.People who argues with a teacher and made the day for others.Eating snacks during teaching.The friendly fight in the lunch hours with our friends for taking /grabbing a large quantity of food of theirs .P.E.T period who wants to forget those memories of going late to classes and having a group punishment with all our friends.The joy of writing about our friends in that slam book(where we wrote all.our emotions.)OMG I forgot about the so called parent teacher meeting which we actually fear about but enjoy about it later the same evening .The biggest irony we don't like school in the beginning part of it but almost miss it everyday when we go to our higher studies. - A quora lover.",
