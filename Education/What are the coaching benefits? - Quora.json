            "answer_text": "When the Status Quo is Not An Option! Coaching is not a necessity. People can live out their entire lives without ever having a Coach. They go through life in black and white, being ordinary. And for a lot of people, ordinary is just fine! \u201cTolerating\u201d is an acceptable state of being. For those people, coaching is not important. It\u2019s not a need for them. Other people want more from life. They want to live intentional, purposeful lives in glorious technicolour and leave the legacy of a better life for future generations. They want to live life proactively, from a position of choice. They want to be special. They want more than the status quo. Coaching helps to enhance the quality of people\u2019s lives, whether personal, professional (and usually, both). Having a coach is like being an elite athlete focused on doing everything possible to always do and be their personal best. To always have and meet personal goals. To have ambition and dreams and Vision for a positive, winning life! Even the very best athletes (amateurs and pros at the Olympic level) choose to have coaches help them to operate at peak performance levels, as do corporate executives and leaders worldwide. If they choose to be coached to succeed, what makes us think we can do it on our own? But, people do achieve change on their own, without a coach, don\u2019t they? Absolutely! Many do. Some people will do whatever it takes to reach their goals. They try and fail and keep on trying. Some people prefer to work alone, until they succeed. And so many more don\u2019t - they give up. On their goals and on themselves. Think about something you\u2019ve tried to change and gave up on after a while - losing weight, stopping smoking, changing careers, saving your marriage, etc. What if you hadn\u2019t given up? What if you had reached your goal - what would your life look like now? How would you feel now, having achieved the change you wanted so badly? It\u2019s About Wanting and Choosing Change - It\u2019s all about choice. You can choose to let life \u201chappen\u201d to you or you can choose to be proactive about the way you live this life. With the right mindset of positive, diligent persistence bad, toxic habits can be changed through consistent repetition over time and replaced with new habits focused on achieving goals and dreams. Dreams cannot be achieved without goals. Goals must be SMART and accompanied by SMART Action Steps that ensure the achievement of the goals. There has to be a big \u201cWHY\u201d. The WHY has to be bigger than any excuses you could make to quit and must carry you through the tough times when you feel demotivated and frustrated. The WHY keeps hope and action alive. Coaching offers 3 elements that ensure the completion of the Action Steps that lead to completion and the big WHY - written goals, stated/committed/activated intentions and an accountability partner/process to encourage and ensure that you do what you say you\u2019re going to do. If Change Was Easy, Wouldn\u2019t We All Be Living Our Dreams Right Now? Coaching is a simple process and that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easy. Coaching helps transform lives, through change. And change is hard! Our brains want to protect us from change because change is the unknown and could be harmful. Change is risky! Change is bad! Our brains want us to avoid change and try to take us out of the game before we even start. Change is hard work, which explains why most people fear, resist and fail to change. But without change, everything stays the same. Without change, there\u2019s no growth, no moving forward. And, it is easier and faster to achieve change when you have a thinking partner whose only focus is your success, working alongside you. Coaching has Value and Worth If personal growth and enhanced quality of life is important to you, then change is necessary and coaching is an important tool for producing change easier and faster than you could alone. And that importance as a tool for change has value and worth - What is it worth to you, to have a happy, loving relationship/marriage for the rest of your life, vs fighting, unhappiness and perhaps, divorce?What is it worth to you, to do fulfilling work that you absolutely love and makes you happy every, single day, vs dreading awakening to go to a job you hate and feeling angry and frustrated all the time?What is it worth to you to finally have the body image and healthy lifestyle you\u2019ve always dreamed of, vs hating yourself, avoiding mirrors and bingeing to self-soothe and then feeling wracked with guilt every, single day?What is it worth to you to be the financially successful entrepreneur who has the time and money to be a generous a philanthropist and love a happy, balance life, vs worrying that you can\u2019t pay the bills every month and not knowing how to fix your ailing business and feeling like a failure?For all of the above reasons, coaching has great importance!

            "answer_text": "The benefits you receive from coaching are equal to the amount of work you apply from your coach. First and foremost, a good coach has coaches/mentors of their own. We are all the same and you and I are human. The difference will be in your commitment in diving deep and working on a solution to what you want to do. For me, growth as a person, clarity, courage and commitment, are the first things you may want to coach on. If you need coaching in a specific area of your life that you are focused on, you may seek out that type of coach. Our ability to learn with the guidance of a coach also depends on the rapport you have together. Trust and being open to new ways of thinking are huge factors. If one goes into coaching and refuses to do the work, nothing will change. Makes sense, right? Also, be cautious about who you work with because many people are calling themselves coaches and they are really consultants or they shouldn\u2019t be coaching. I say this because as a coach with integrity, thousands of dollars of training and changing myself, certifications and a desire to truly serve others by providing them with the tools, skills and methodology for success, it breaks my heart to see people getting $15.00 coaching certificates. With that said, there are coaches for personal and business venues and more. The entire person benefits from the proper coaching/mentoring so that they live fuller lives, have better businesses and are a contribution not only to themselves, but to society as a whole. I do hope that this is of help to you. It\u2019s a great question and \u201cit depends\u201d is the simple answer. Here\u2019s to your success! ",
