            "answer_text": "Q: What have you done to protect the environment today? Well, I took the bus, rather than drive. And at lunch, drank from a paper cup with no lid or straw. But those pale in comparison to the project I work on every day of every week of the year, and will do until it is complete. If it is successful, it will have a bigger impact on the environment than anything else I could do in a hundred lifetimes. My project is figuring out how to prove the model of quantum gravity that I conceived a few years ago is correct. It is a model made from an infinite number of identical Planck scale \u201cUniversal Building Blocks\u201d. Close packed in a frictionless field that is purely mechanical. No \u201cforces\u201d, no charges, no magic. Just mechanics. Rotations, frequencies, orientations, interactions. It might be wrong. Every indication I have come across are that it is correct. IF (only IF) it is correct, it is \u201cthe\u201d exact and complete, and final, step towards understanding the nature of physical reality. It redefines our understanding of time, space, energy, mass, gravity. The whole kit and kaboodle. IF (only IF) it is correct, I expect it will force a reassessment of human impact on Earth\u2019s energy budget, and disprove conclusively, the notion that GHG effect is significant after being moderated by fluctuations in volume, pressure and kinetic dissipation. Current GHG theory is based on the assumptions about gravity, barometric pressure, vacuum energy, and atmospheric volume that we cannot justly claim to know are correct.  But in what way would disproving CO2 or methane can have a significant impact on Earth\u2019s energy budget help to protect the environment?? Right now, much money is spent on generating energy without fossil fuels. At a premium. And considerable funds are spent on researching climate. Monitoring change and so on. One example of the funds at play is a report by think tank IRENA. It suggests that the world, to prevent overheating by GHGs, needs to spend in the neighborhood of $145 trillion (TRILLION !!) US dollars on wind turbines and solar panels. Disproving catastrophic GHG theory would allow some diversion of funds from fighting a potential non-problem, into environmental conservation projects. Understandably, not all funds that will be spent on fighting CO2, if determined not necessary, would be diverted to environmental projects. But some could. If even only a few percents, that still amounts to some considerable coin. Maybe we plant some extra trees. Maybe we manage to turn some desert into green land. I don\u2019t know all that might come. Personally, IF (and it is only IF), GHG caused climate change gets disproven, and some future spending diverted, I would like to see a chunk put into a concerted international effort to see fusion become commercially viable. Because even if fossil fuel use can be proven not harmful to the climate, we will at some point in the future need to find alternative energy sources, because fossil fuels do have limited availability. But it can be done passively, not aggressively, and fusion successfully developed in the meantime, then we can go straight from fossil fuel to fusion-based energy generation paradigm, and forego the more expensive varieties of alternative energy we are currently heading towards making common. But again, that is getting a little ahead of myself. I need finish the current stage of my project first. Develop proof that others will accept, confirming that the model I have conceived is correct. I\u2019m confident. But could be incorrect. We\u2019ll see. ",

A PARTNER GIVES PROVEN MORE HEALTH & HAPPINESS; OPTIMUM LOW COST FAMILY is when one partner works or has village business, the other helps family become highly self-sufficient. Swap jobs every 6 months or less! We are not rich because we have the most, but because we need the least\u2026 WE ENJOY MOST ALL THE ABOVE IN TOTAL LUXURY at our healthy ages of 85 & 70, thriving on less than 5% pension!! ANY MORE SUGGESTIONS WELCOME? 1-word GOOGLE: DRPATSAWESOMELIBRARY ; 2nd page shows how to access & download FREE Library. \u20a4 HOMELESS: In several countriesChurch services are followed by tea + loads of cake, sandwiches, fruit sausages etc. Also - including Brisbane's St.Vincent de Paul's gives free or cheap accommodation + meals for those staying there + meals out back for non residents. Over the years in Portobello Road, London & Sydney Markets I have been able to largely feed an entire apartment with market vast left-overs. A tiny folding bike is indispensable, as were British, Yank & Australian Survival books for bush tucker - including Vanuatu villages where hurricanes have destroyed all food gardens. In 1960s & 1970s the book \"Golden Guide to South & East Asia\" fed & housed us from Malaya to Afghanistan & Iran via India, Thailand, etc. TO KEEP WARM IN COLDEST WINTERS: 3 layers of box cardboard insulates on floors under carpets. Also on walls behind Book cases & cupboards against walls facing outside + in ceilings. Long socks on your hands are wonderful in bed etc. Hotwater bottle covered in a knitted bag keeps bed warm all night. Our 46 watt solar panel provides total house power including summer fridge which if outside, will be OFF all winter, blender, fans, LEDs, pumps, TV & radio etc; but best of all a bed warmer comprising a rheostat - variable power resistor - inside a MILO or big coffee can which is placed in the bed. Save bathwater there till cold to warm house a little. In bed we have all 3 meals as well as watch TV, use computer & phone, read books, play & listen to music + radio etc. Our single-stick air-preheating & afterburning Helixtove with flu heats wonders with no wood chopping. Wellington gumboots are real warm outside; fill with water & walk around for a few minutes to clean boots & your feet. Migrate to warm New Zealand, Fiji, Vanuatu or Australia where we virtually have every day cloudless, no violence or guns etc & bananas that ripen all winter in Queensland State. KEEP COOL: We hand-spray our T-shirt with water, then have a small fan playing on the moist T-shirt in real heat waves, that usually gets too cold & we have to slow or redirect the fan. With 2 or 4 watt car fan playing on bare legs is much cooler than if fan playing on face, arms etc; fans can often save more than \u00bd air conditioning power that we find unnecessary even in Queensland. For low-humidity areas we have a tiny 12volt water evaporator; big home units are very economical & take little power to supply cool air ducted around to each room. For outside in the sun, my favorite is a white hat topped with a small solar PV panel powering a cute little fan built into the front brim. Air Conditioning: Simply have a fan blow air into a bucket of ice if available. Cool water drinks help + cool water swim or garden hose spray. All these replies are using the wrong type of inefficient fridge. Our old unit TOP-LOADING FRIDGE: Homemade most efficient 40L plastic trash drum = 12 volt, 2.3 average-watt unit under house, in breeze & shade + part-buried & never in hot kitchen, with 15 cms polyurethane foam all around; uses 30 times less annual energy than other fridges + good ice maker. Power from a car battery used for entire 12-volt house that is charged by the 46 watt solar panel. Fridge takes about 2 days to cool down. In cool climates, this outside fridge can be permanently off during winter. The unit uses a 12 volt DANFOSS Danish kit compressor system. ",
