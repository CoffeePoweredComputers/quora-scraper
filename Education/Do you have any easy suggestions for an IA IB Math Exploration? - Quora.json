            "answer_text": "I had 2 topics which were highly recommended by my teacher but I settled for something wayyy better. I\u2019m an HL student. The first topic is trying to create an algorithm or suggest an approach to cracking passwords and/or credit card numbers using permutations. Second was, exploring Modular arithmetic (applying it as an arithmetic progression or applying it on Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem). If none seem right, you could just approach an unsolved problem and analyse it to give a possible method to solve it. Also here is a link that has 200 topics Maths IA \u2013 Exploration Topics Hope you get it Fun With Modular Arithmetic or visit Khan Academy (link embedded) for a ground developement Easy Permutations and Combinations Fermat's Little Theorem ",

My maths teacher always recommended anything to do with sequences & series. I had a friend who investigated the algorithms associated with rubiks cubes, or another that liked music and so investigated the frequencies of sound waves. In general I\u2019d recommend taking something relatively simple that you enjoy in real life, and ask yourself what kind of mathematical concepts can be applied to it :) ",

I came across a news article a number of years ago about a person who killed all the fish in his pond. He drained the first foot in an hour, and the depth of the pond was 6 feet, so he came back 5 hours later to find the pond dry and all of the fish dead. A news article like this allows for a mathematical model to prove why the guy shouldn\u2019t have waited so long, and then allows each student to explore slightly different models. ",
