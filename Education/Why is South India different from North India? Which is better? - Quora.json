            "answer_text": "First of all both are very important for India and both have there merits and demerits but still in many aspects SOUTH INDIA is better then NORTH INDIA 1: DEVELOPMENT SOUTH INDIA has most of the top cities of india such as MUMBAI , BANGALORE ,. HYDEREBAD , CHENNAI , PUNE and GOA(state) on the other hand NORTH INDIA has very few cities in the list of top cities of India which includes DELHI , JAIPUR , NOIDA ,CHANDIGARH 2: ENVIRONMENT Almost all the polluted cities of india are situtated in the NORTH and according to a survey that most of the forest cover of India lies in the south and east India  and also people being more educated in the south are well aware about the environment and its protection and so the cities in the south are considerabely cleaner 3: LITERACY KERALA is the state with the highest literacy in India followed by lakshadweep  AS you can see that except CHANDIGARH and DELHI there is no other city from NORTH in the top 10 and we all know that if people are more educated and literate then it will lead to the develoment and betterment of the people 3: HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX Human development index or HDI is a composite statistic of LIFE EXPECTANCY, EDUCATION AND PER CAPITA INCOME(PPI) which is used to rank countries as well as states  And again KERALA is number one in HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX and most of the northern states like UTTAR PRADESH , RAJASTHAN, JHARKHAND ,CHATTISGARH,BIHAR are at the last spots in HDI ranking these states lack proper education , medical facilities , awareness about family planing and environment but on the other hand if it comes to economy of india then it is the north india which contributes more than south india and also north india has more resources and agricultural land AND SO AT LAST I WOULD SAY THAT ALL STAES IN INDIA ARE GOOD IN THEMSELFES WITH VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND UNIQUE CULTURES BUT IF YOU WANT QUALITY LIFE AND SAFE AS WELL AS PROSPEROUS LIFE THEN SURELY SOUTH INDIA IS BETTER THAN NORTH INDIA. \\ ",
