            "answer_text": "The only real argument against having to study the liberal arts would be that it is time one could argue would be better spent elsewhere. My university has a history of requiring those studying high-paying professional fields (most notably engineering and IT) to complete a number of elective courses outside of their main field of study. The idea is to broaden one\u2019s horizons, but I could see an argument that time at university is limited and that it could be more useful to complete another subject within the field (in terms of future knowledge and career prospects). I wrote a short story once in which a character (essentially an engineer) talks about building a bridge. Another character (more of a philosopher) asks why he wants to build that bridge. The engineer\u2019s answer is \u2018to get to where the next bridge goes\u2019. This is of course an extreme oversimplification, but the general idea of asking people to study some liberal arts subjects is to add perspectives and to develop thinking beyond one\u2019s domain, to look at a problem from angles that they otherwise might not. In the end, having to study some liberal arts subjects has positives and negatives. The positives include gaining knowledge and skills outside of one\u2019s existing set, and the negatives are that time is taken from other important areas of study. However, there is one other negative, and it\u2019s one I couldn\u2019t really bring up until I covered the basics. The negative is the question itself. The fact that this question has been asked suggests that someone felt strongly enough about having to study a liberal arts subject to ask it. I will make an assumption here and say that this person is likely American (partly because of the argument, and partly because they refer to it as \u201ccollege\u201d). There is a bit of a culture war going on in the United States (and bleeding out into other parts of the Anglosphere and wider Western World) in which one side thinks that the liberal arts are useless areas of study that only serve to push agendas and brainwash the masses, while the other side\u2026 doesn\u2019t, I guess? Putting aside the actual argument, forcing a person to study liberal arts can breed resentment if they are on the anti-liberal arts side of the issue. This resentment could spill over into a general disdain for academia and could cause wider disruptions in those classes themselves. A quick anecdote: during my undergrad years, I took a philosophy class that psychology students were forced to take on ethics. One psych student, so enraged that he had to take philosophy, spent every possible minute of class making snide comments or trying to argue with the lecturer over petty points. It was easily one of the worst classes I\u2019ve ever taken. When it comes down to it, perhaps the strongest argument against having to study the liberal arts is that the people who don\u2019t want to are sometimes dicks about it. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s once again clarify something: The \u201cLiberal Arts\u201d traditionally includes studies in all the big three academic disciplinary areas: Humanities, Social Studies, and the Sciences and Mathematics. I hope everyone notices right there that the \u201cLiberal Arts\u201d thus includes two (Science & Math) of the four \u201cSTEM\u201d disciplines. I suspect that most of the people who are complaining about having to study the \u201cLiberal Arts\u201d don\u2019t actually have Science and Math in mind. (Although maybe they do!) I suspect that what people are really complaining about are not the full range of the Liberal Arts, but rather the Humanities subset. I would have to push back even against that. The Humanities include both our own and other languages. If there is one thing I would strongly advise every student to do, it is to learn to become a good communicator - both orally and in writing. Few things are more critical for career success in just about any field. Given our globalized economy, there is also a lot to be said for becoming as skillful and conversant as possible in another major world language. Effective communication does not just involve words - there is also the visual dimension. Developing some skill in drawing, photography, and graphic arts would be useful, even if one is not going to become a practicing professional in those areas. Effective communication also requires being able to construct a logical argument. It is also hugely important to be able to think logically and critically. Many of the snafus and career-ending mistakes that have been made in the workplace can be traced to people who did not think clearly and carefully. These are all things that one will find in the Humanities departments. One would be well advised to devote at least a little of their time at university studying them. ",

            "answer_text": "The strongest argument against being forced to study the liberal arts (or STEM, or vo-tech, or any college path) is that adults should voluntarily want to pursue a college degree rather than having to study as your question phrases it. We should not enroll people in college against their will to extract money from them. It\u2019s unethical to force people to pay for an education and force them to spend four years doing an activity when they would prefer to spend their money and time on something else besides self-improvement and intellectual development. Ignorance and lack of skill and intellectual variety can be destructive, and these may prevent young adults from reaching their full potential, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should force them to maximize their potential by automatically enrolling them in college. So, the argument should be that people should always have the choice not to attend college and not to spend money on education. They should always be free to opt out rather than being forced into enrolling in a school. So, we should keep our current policy in which students can choose whether or not they go to college, and thus whether or not they have to take liberal arts classes. Mind you, that argument isn\u2019t unique to liberal arts\u2014that\u2019s just about all educational contracts and fields of study in general. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably the best argument is supply and demand. Colleges exist to educate people, but ultimately, they\u2019re selling that education. If enough people don\u2019t want it, they stop offering it. For example, when a department doesn\u2019t have enough students signing up for its classes, it must reduce its size or close down altogether. So some colleges may not offer anthropology or Asian studies. If enough students were to protest having to study liberal arts courses outside their major, if they took only the classes in their major and not any others, colleges would eventually see that there was no longer a demand and stop requiring them. The kicker here is that you wouldn\u2019t get a degree without those courses, if the accreditation authorities required some liberal arts for the awarding of a bachelor\u2019s degree. But again, if people refused long enough, they\u2019d find a way to accommodate people, perhaps awarding a different kind of degree that was only for study in the subject of the major. There is some push, in that most people going to college today do so for the credential so they\u2019re marketable in the job market. They aren\u2019t going for the higher education. Though not everyone chooses a major that\u2019s pre-career, such as engineering or nursing. Some students will always want to major in English, history, psychology, philosophy. ",
