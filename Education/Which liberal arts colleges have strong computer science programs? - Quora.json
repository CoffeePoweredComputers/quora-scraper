            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no expert, but from what I\u2019ve seen of other schools, Williams, Swarthmore, Pomona, and Harvey Mudd have excellent computer science programs. Pomona and Harvey Mudd, being in California, do very well with Silicon Valley, especially Harvey Mudd, as that\u2019s basically the equivalent of MIT in the LAC world. Williams and Swarthmore also do very well partly because both schools have strong mathematics departments and have invested in hiring many faculty in computer science, so you\u2019re not constrained by a limited faculty. Not to bash Amherst any more than it deserves, but there, you only have 6 faculty, two of whom are visiting. In contrast, Williams has 10, 3 of whom are visiting, while Swarthmore has 11, 3 of whom are visiting. Basically, Williams and Swarthmore each have almost double the number of tenure track/tenured faculty, and yes they do serve larger student populations, but on the other hand, it means you have greater investment by the college in computer science as well as greater reputation in attracting other great comp sci students.
