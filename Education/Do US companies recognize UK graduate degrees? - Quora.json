            "answer_text": "You have got to be very careful about this one. The americans basically do not like recognising anything from overseas and only do so if they feel like it. Be prepared for a lot of PC double-talk. I have an Australian PhD. My experience was that they were very happy to employ you as a post-doctoral because they know that British and Australian PhDs are research oriented and so you know how to do research. I never had any trouble getting a post-doc. It is important to understand that culturally the americans want to rent not buy. The other advantage for them is that you are on a visa where you have to leave the country when the job ends. Try and get a real job in the US and it is another matter. They will dwell on the fact that your degree has no coursework component and since american degrees have stupid time wasting coursework then all PhDs must have coursework bullshit as well. They will use it as an excuse to pass over your applications. However, Oxford and Cambridge D Phils also do not have coursework but in the case of Oxford & Cambridge that does not matter of course. It took me over 20years of wasting my time applying for academic jobs in the US to find out from a casual remark made in the Chronicle of Higher education that I was being passed over from consideration simply because my PhD had no coursework.. Another problem is immigration certification. Ivy League and other top notch US universities and international companies have immigration lawyers on staff who fix things up for you. If they want you, you are in. Most universities and other institutions do not have them on staff. That means you have no chance of getting over the Dept of Labor hurdles. Unfortunately, they will not tell you that and just pretend to consider you (for EEO/AA reasons they are unwilling to tell you the realities). ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is yes but I believe there are a few caveats here worth mentioning. If you are not a U.S. citizen\u2026 I know several colleagues from outside the US with degrees from amazing academic institutions (both in or out of the US). But the bigger concern for most U.S. employers (even large agencies/companies) is whether or not they will need to sponsor you.How well connected is the institution\u2026 There are many prestigious schools in the UK and EU with fantastic reputations(obviously). But if your goal is to work in the US, make sure the institution you apply to has connections and/or networking opportunities with companies inside the US.Search professional networks\u2026 For example, check out LinkedIn profiles of professionals in the industry and see where they have studied as well.",

            "answer_text": "As your planing to do Master in Design Management this certainly include standard level of course work as per the Bologna process. Assuming you were picked by a well recognized university in the UK and study well there, and have some worthwhile and tractable experience in digital and service design, it is possible for you to get a job from US companies. I would assume that they are mainly looking at your education and the expertise, experience and profit that you bring to the company. One catching point might be US has 2 years Master and UK has one year Master. However, certain disciplines and sectors it does not matter. This might be an issue in academic jobs, but design management area in a company (for a talented professional) I think that it does not a matter. Good luck! ",

I have known several friends who had to do odd jobs because their UK degrees could not give them jobs in the USA. ",
