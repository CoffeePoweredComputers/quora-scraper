            "answer_text": "I have never taught in one that doesn\u2019t teach it\u2014-and I have taught in five states, multiple districts in each state, and multiple buildings in each district. Personal finance is taught as fold in units in a wide variety of classes, starting at the most basic level by middle school and increasing in content as students mature intellectually. Personal finance is also taught as stand alone classes going by various titles as an elective credit, mostly at high school but sometimes at middle school. One of the most common departments to deal with personal finance is what used to be called Home Ec and is now is often called FACS\u2014-Personal and Consumer Science, again starting at middle school and increasing in complexity through high school. Some examples: I taught a nine week class to 8th and 9th graders we called \u201cThe Wise Use of Money.\u201d the FACS department in the high school with which I am now associated offers a one semester class called \u201cConsumer Education.\u201d Here is the copy/paste of the description of the class in Consumer Ed: \u201cConsumer Education Level: Technical Grades: 9 \u2013 12 Credit: .5 Course ID: 007035 Students will learn skills that will help with becoming knowledgeable and responsible consumers. Included are general familiarity with budgeting and money management; renting, equipping, and taking care of housing; and getting good use of money when purchasing food, clothing, transportation, and insurance. Responsible use of credit is stressed. Awareness of consumer fraud and consumer problems will help students find solutions to poor buying situations. Overall, students should learn to work with money in ways that will assist them in living independently.\u201d There is insufficient time to require every important subject of every student unless we want kids in high school until they are 35, but concepts like personal finance are taught in multiple ways so that no student can claim that it is never taught. Here is the link to the entire course guide, which includes information about what is required for graduation as well as electives, for my high school: https://www.usd383.org/home/showdocument?id=24574 Here is a simplified statement of information to help students at enrollment that summarizes requirements. https://www.usd383.org/home/showdocument?id=22825 The academic counselors and gifted facilitators/special ed facilitators of all types know this book by heart and stand willing to help students know how to get what they want and need\u2014-but students who are willing to do the reading and critical analysis have all the information at their fingertips online. It is absolutely required that one read the individual course descriptions for content, not simply look for a course title one thinks should be there\u2014-and that goes for college as well, and always has.

            "answer_text": "I'll take the question at face value - it's clear from the question that the poster thinks it would be quite valuable to teach some elements of personal finance in high school. I'm not sure how I personally feel about the issue, but let me answer the question by explaining the counter-arguments and practical reasons why it's awkward for any non-professional school to have personal finance as a required class. Academic/pedagogical reasons: Teaching specific regulations, taxes, and financial products is not \"knowledge\" about something stable and long-term. Laws are subject to change. Personal finance strategies will change depending on financial products, laws, how well the public and private markets are doing, and the job landscape, etc.Platitude-style financial advice (\"make sure to save money\") is pretty dry and boring, and doesn't always apply to everyone. General wisdom about savings or spending often amounts to advocating for a certain set of life choices, and deciding the best way to live life is arguably a matter for reflection and introspection, not public education.Personal finance is not really a Liberal arts education subject. The wisdom of only teaching liberal arts in high-school is debatable, but one might argue that childhood and primary school is the time to stimulate curiosity about life's big questions, not a practical guide to an ever-changing world.To be fair, there are clear tie-ins with math and economics, so personal finance is at least partially academic. But other \"life-skills classes\" like Gym and Health already take important time out of the school day. Personal finance is arguably less socially useful than those classes, and certainly less universally relevant to the lives of high-school students (that is, it's not about the human body).If we are only talking about budgeting and not savings and investment products, personal finance is a pretty straightforward application of basic addition, subtraction, and percentages. This is what we teach our kids in school. For many students, the class would be a waste of time, unless it covered specific regulations and financial products, which would get back to my first few concerns.Worse, in public school, lessons about personal finance could be construed as endorsing certain forms of credit, behavior, tax codes, or products. This is a very complex problem, and could make a society less resilient to change. While personal finance education is important, it is arguably a good news topic, not a good school topic. Examples: Social Security is overhauled and now people have incorrect beliefs about how the system works; a very innovative financial savings product becomes FDIC insured, changing the best financial strategy, etc. Practical reasons: The question asked \"why isn't it mandatory\" - in the USA at least, Individual class requirements are not federally mandated, except through indirect means. I'm not a lawyer or policy expert, but a state or individual district probably could decide to do this in many areas of the USA - if they did, seeing the long-term outcomes results would be very interesting!However, a federal bill tied to an untested education program like required personal finance at the moment would be very odd in the current (Dec 2012) political climate, in my non-expert view at least.In any case, most people enter \"personal-finance land\" with very different questions, issues, and educational needs. It would be hard to create a unified curriculum that would help most people from most income levels and social backgrounds, as Fred Landis alluded to.Just to reiterate, I'm not against personal finance education in school. Many of these arguments do not apply to elective classes, or using personal finance as a \"unit\" in math or economics. It's a very complex issue, and doing nothing and leaving it to kids themselves / parents / the media may or may not be wiser than implementing a mandatory class that uses valuable school time. ",
