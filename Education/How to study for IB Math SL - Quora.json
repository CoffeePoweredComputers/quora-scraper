            "answer_text": "I can completely empathise with you. I am in the IB too, and the jump from class questions to test questions is big. Every single time. The reason for that however is because the whole point of the IB system is trying to teach us independence and to do things by ourselves rather than with constant teacher intervention. We learn the minimum in class, it is up to us to find and solve the harder questions and gain exposure to them. The main reason we do poorly in tests is because we have not been exposed to those questions before. Once we gain exposure to them and start practicing, it will be a walk in the park. We just need that little bit extra. By the way... Here's my step by step guide to studying for Maths, hope it helps: Get a copy of the syllabus to get a clear view of the exact topics and their components that you will be tested on. Make a little mark beside the topics you do not think you are very confident in.Get your Math textbook and focus on those topics you are not too sure about. Do about 15-20 beginner/intermediate questions ensuring your foundation is there. Then move on to complete all the hard questions in that topic to ensure you can handle the tougher stuff. You will probably run into difficulties along the way and that is when you seek help from your teacher. Once you have finished the topics you are not confident in and have become comfortable with them, move onto all the other topics you feel neutral and confident in. Do about 5-7 of the beginner/intermediate questions in those topics just to make sure your foundation is still very much intact. Once again, move on to do all the 'hard' questions even if you think they are easy. This will ensure you are comfortable with those topics and can handle the harder questions there too. Do not be complacent and skip topics as that is where you will lose easy marks. Print out all the past year exam papers from all the different time zones along with their respective answer keys.Start work on the past year exam papers under timed conditions. Do all the questions that you know how to do. Leave out the questions you do not know how to do. Once the paper is done use the mark scheme to mark yourself and to fill in the questions that you did not know how to do and learn from and understand your mistakes. If unsure, seek the help of a teacher. Never move onto another paper without understanding every single question and every single method used in the previous paper. This part is very important as it gives you an idea of the types of questions the exam board likes to ask and also shows you how the questions have evolved over the years. The answer key shows you the answers and methods the markers like to see and also gives you an idea of how the answers required have evolved over the years. Knowledge of these will give you a big advantage on the day of the exam. Once all the papers are completed, go through each of the papers to review what you have done and to ensure you remember and understand why you have done what you have done for each question. Just make a little mark on the question if you do not understand why you did something and then seek help from a teacher. Only move onto the next question when you fully understand why you have done what you have done for the previous one. Spend the remaining time before the exam relaxing and having a good time. Do no work at all. No more maths. No more school material. Behave like you are on holiday. Go out with friends, exercise, start a business, get a job, do whatever makes you happy. Most importantly, get tonnes of sleep as there is no better preparation for a Maths exam than to be well rested and have a clear, quick mind. This part is absolutely fine to do and actually good because you have spent the past time working hard and understanding everything, therefore if you were truly diligent about it, everything should make sense to you and there is no point going over stuff you have already completed hence, you are prepared for the exam.On the day of the exam, remain calm but focused and alert. Understand and have the confidence that you have put in the hard work and that the results you aimed for will follow as a result of that. After you finish the paper, check your answers thoroughly. There is nothing worse than coming to terms with the reality of careless mistakes undoing what you have spent the past time doing. And do not forget your calculator!Try to enjoy the journey! Make sure you exercise and have a good time in between as well. I struggle with this immensely too, possibly because I do not see myself as an academic guy, but I try to find a source of enjoyment somewhere inside the world of exams and grades. Try to do the same.Hope the answer has been helpful to you and all the best for IB Maths! I'm in this too and I know its tough, but I am sure with some degree of hard work, you will do well! ",

            "answer_text": "So I am still in IB 1 but recently had a conversation with my teacher. I actually had a 5 on my recent report card but aim for a 6. My teacher told me if you want a 6, you have to aim for a seven. You need 90% of all you do in class and all your exercises before an exam right on the first aim and you are able to achieve that. I actually just revise all the information you get in the chapters and then do the exercises in the revision parts of the chapter. Our teacher also sold us an extra booklet that works with our book that gives you extra exercises. Everybody studies differently but for me it is important to first do the rules and then exercises. My teacher told me it is important while studying to get the questions right in the first aim. Listen in class, ask questions, even ten times if necessary and exercise a lot. You just have to memorize the rules and get used to the idea of questions. That\u2019s all you can really study for math, in my opinion. Or how I do it. I had a 3 in an exam ones and looked for my exact mistakes and then I received a 5 in my Mock exams. So also analyze what and how you do it, so you can get it right. If this doesn't work for you study with friends, you are surely not the only one who struggles with Math. Exercise. Exercise. Exercise. And maybe ask questions too, there is no shame in that. ",
