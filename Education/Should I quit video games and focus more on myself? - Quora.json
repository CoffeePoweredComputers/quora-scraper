            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Video games can be the foundation of your identity and your sense of self. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing; Ask yourself; Why do play them? What meaning do they give you in single-player or multiplier contexts or both? Is there a sense of achievement, competitiveness, creativity, or development of certain skills which you attain from playing games? The answers you give could relate to another part of your life, your career, your studies, your goals, or other hobbies. If they do relate, perhaps that is \u201cyourself\u201d. You may find certain reasons to play games that are similar to the reasons you choose to do other things, and, perhaps to focus on yourself is more to find the same reasons you play games in your future endeavors or the things you are doing right now. E.g; I love the competition of multiplayer games, it builds self-respect for me to consider myself as good at it competing against others in a sportsmanlike way and aim to better myself at the skills involved in playing certain competitive games. It gives me meaning. That same self-respect, competition both against others and myself, I try to find in my own studies, work or exercise. Another example may be playing single-player games for the story and the creativity, maybe you\u2019d like a creative career or other creative-based hobbies or interests. You may, in fact, be you because of games, and casting them aside may be good for you for a while so you can discover more facets of yourself, but the answers for why I like playing games, in my experience, are some of the same reasons I want to do other things. If you are playing too many hours a week (We\u2019ve all been there) that can be bad for you, so if you are spending too many hours a day gaming maybe try and cut that down. Your time is worth a lot, and you should spend it more wisely in that case in order to have time to discover yourself and do something that betters you and the people around you. And as I have said before, whatever you discover for more meaning in your life you may enjoy for the same reasons you enjoy video games, but video games can only be so helpful for yourself and the wider world. If what you discover something you enjoy for the same or similar reasons you enjoy video games you will get more enjoyment out of it than the enjoyment you get out of video games (how often can I say \u2018enjoy\u2019 in one sentence lol) because it might be more worthwhile.

            "answer_text": "Sorry to say this, but this question is so wrong that it doesn't actually make sense! Imagine someone quit watching TV to focus themselves, there's isn't something like that, hobbies are made to be something that relieves your stress and entertain you, if you have reached the point you see it's either \u201cgames or me\u201d then what's wrong is you! Are you letting Video games consume your life? If so it isn't the game's fault it's yours! Video games are a weapon, a weapon to use to make yourself feel better and spend your time, and like every weapon it can be used for good and it can be used for bad, you can make food with a knife or kill someone, whatever you do the knife have no responsibility! What you should ask is how to use Video games to focus on yourself, play less, take more breaks and find new hobbies, when you do new things your life changes and your view of yourself becomes different but you never should lose what you already love in order to change, it is something you love doing!
