            "answer_text": "I learned a valuable lesson dealing with loneliness. Fighting through depression and anxiety, I discovered something about myself that had been holding me back for more than two decades. I used to hate being alone. If I was left alone at home, at work, or even when friends separated during an outing, I was weighed down my loneliness. The weight brought on questions like, \u201cam I even worth it? Do I matter? Why me?\u201d These are questions I asked, among others, for a long time. It wasn\u2019t until I started asking \u201cwhy\u201d and looking through my past for answers. Why did I feel lonely? Why did I hate being alone? Why did I get depressed or anxious when alone? I found answers to all of these questions in a consistent disciplinary routine my parents enacted when I disobeyed as a child. As a child, if I disobeyed, they would send me to my room and make me wait for an undefined period of time, alone. At the end of this waiting, I would either get a spanking or be talked to sternly about what I did wrong, why it was wrong, and why it\u2019s important to obey. The general sadness of disappointing my parents on top of the anxiety of not knowing when I was going to encounter a negative experience turned into depression and anxiety as an adult. I learned two things from loneliness: Ask what is causing the loneliness (search your entire life for examples of the same feeling in different moments).Ask why you still hold onto these feelings, even though that moment has passed.These two steps changed my life. I write for a living. I spend a lot of time \u201calone,\u201d but I no longer see being alone as a punishment or potential negative situation full of depression or anxiety. I see my alone time as an opportunity to better myself, my craft, or the world around me. When I asked what and why of my loneliness, it eventually gave me a reason why it still haunted me. And as most people know, once you point a flashlight at the monster under the bed, we realize it\u2019s an old jacket, not a creature wanting to eat us. Shine a light on your loneliness. Figure out what\u2019s causing it and why it\u2019s causing it. Then, evolve. ",

            "answer_text": "I think what we can learn from loneliness varies individually. To me, it could be any or all of the following: It can teach us to empathize. Everyone experiences loneliness. It is \u201dcommonplace.\u201d We all know how it is to feel lonely. This socially shared cognition makes us capable of feeling for others. It can teach us to be attuned to ourselves. It can be a time for us to understand our emotions, triggers, aspirations, or frustrations, with more depth. If you wanna know what makes you lonely you have to let yourself dig deeper. It validates the idea that happiness requires conscious effort. Life is a constant decision-making process - from the smallest to the major things in life. And when you\u2019re lonely, you know you have difficult and pressing decisions to make if you want to move forward. And you have to employ your resolve because indecision will not bring you any further. It can help us rekindle our values. Loneliness can remind us of the things that really matter to us and give us a new or renewed appreciation of them and a fresh motivation to change the way we tackle challenges in life. It can bring out your fortitude when you finally decide to revamp your life. It also teaches us to be comfortable with being vulnerable. Loneliness does not happen to weak people. It happens to people. When we\u2019re lonely we recognize our need for support from our friends and family, or our need for divine help. It naturally propels us to stay connected. Some people turn to isolation but that\u2019s a different story. ",

            "answer_text": "The Power to be happy without comparing yourself. We might be good at something, bad at other things, and as acclaimed by the world everyone is great at something - which is an utter lie. But if you are all alone, void of any individuals which forced you to compare your life with theirs, then you can be happy without any reason. Our whole life , we find ways to be happy, be it eating our favorite food, or dancing , or listening to music which relates to something which is a part of our life, or maybe money, or as in my case I crave for fame.All this because in our brain somewhere we have calculated that how doing or having that thing will either instantly or in a long term make us happy, but why do we want to be happy - overall what is happiness - it seems is just a vague word.But I thought a definition for happiness - \u201cHappiness is a recursively defined state, which under certain abstract calculation seems to move us to a certain another state in which we are healthier, stronger, wiser or just optimistic\u201d. Still kinda vague. But what I mean is happiness is the manifestation of same instinct that in other organisms is defined as the instinct to live, or try to live.   Image Source : Happiness can be defined in many different ways  Maybe happiness is the thing which has all the answers to what and how life actually started on earth, \u201cA theory I once thought was that initial DNA molecules were maybe some sort of buffer solution which have tendency to maintain it\u2019s pH, so maybe our whole will to live is just the buffer solution in DNA saying to us to maintain the DNA, to not let the DNA die\u201d (I know it sounds absurd and biologically and chemically inaccurate, since it is just some bullshit thought from my mind).  But all in all , what I meant by all this shit is loneliness gives us a reason to be happy without any reason, because being happy is necessary for survival. ",

BUT\u2026 I would add that true loneliness, as I've experienced it, is a feeling of disconnection from everyone and everything around you. It can be incredibly frightening and feeds on itself, as the more you feel it, the more you isolate. I'd say the most important lesson I've learned from loneliness is how much alone time I can have before 'loneliness' sets in. My limit is 2 days. Then I need to be with people, or I start feeling that disconnection. Everything difficult we experience in this life has lessons for us. But I would say the best thing you can learn from loneliness (as opposed to just being alone), is how to ensure you feel connected to the people and world around you. ",

Use it as a time to learn or do something different. Getting out in nature or getting a pet if you do not already have one really helps. Use this time to Read a good fiction book to get lost in. Go to the gym or mall and just be around other people, it really helps, u pk up on their positive energy. Do a class, yoga, dance, book club. Reconnet with an old friend. Go to a movie, or watch a movie at home. Plan a day trip or a 2\u20133 day trip, yes, alone. Its more fun then you think. If a friend wants to go all the better. Journal. Take an on line class or enroll in a class at your local community college. If your an extrovert like me loneliness can be harder since we get our energy from other people. Even people like myself who has a lot of friends gets lonely sometimes. My husband works 12 hour nights and sleeps all day so I know Lonileness. But now I embrace it and call Lonely my friend and me and Lonely will go on some kind of adventure. Before you know it, I don't know where lonely went and all is good in the world again. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally people are lonely because they are not able to relate to people in a manner that allows others to come into their lives in some meaningful manner. The lesson here so far as I am concerned, is to let down the defenses that keep people at a distance, so that true friendship can be made. To find like-minded people, do activities that you enjoy where you can find others - meetup groups, college courses, sports, etc. We can only make friends if we are willing to be ourselves and be with others, allowing friendships to evolve organically. Face-to-face and heart -to=heart in person. (Never over the internet where people hide behind their computers. Hiding behind computers is what creates loneliness, based on the studies done to date on the subject. There is never any agenda involved. Just be yourself and share what you know in regards to the activity that you are involved in.If you are new to it, allow others to help you learn about it. Sharing knowledge is a great way to form great relationships!

The way you see yourselfThe determination of self-esteemHow you feel about yourself1. The way you see yourself: This is the way you see yourself and think about yourself. It is often called your \u201c inner mirror\u201d. It is where you look internally to see how should behave in a particular situation. Because of the power of your self-image, you can always perform om the outside consistent with the picture you have of yourself on the inside. All improvement in your life begins with an improvement in your mental pictures. Your internal images influence your emotions, your behavior, your attitude, and even the way other people respond to you. 2. The determinant of self-esteem: your level of self esteem is largely determined by how closely your self image \u2014- your current performance and behaviour matches your self-ideal. Your picture of how you would perform if you were at your very best. You are always comparing your actual performance with your ideal performance at and subconscious level. Whenever you feel that you are living up at your very best, you you feel terrific about yourself. Your self esteem soars. You feel happy and fulfilled. 3. How you feel about yourself: This is very emotional component of our personality, and is the most important factor in determining how do you think, feel, and behave. Your level of self esteem largely determines much of what happens to you in life. Your self-esteem is best defined as how much you like yourself. The more you like your, the better you perform at anything you attempt. And by the law of reversibility, the better you perform, the more you like yourself\ud83d\udcaf. # Gratitude*(sv)\ud83d\udc99 ",

There is tremendous inner strength gained from building the ability to be alone, and having contentment with and finding joy when in solitude. That is the same environment where loneliness occurs. The only difference \u2014 and it is an BIG difference \u2014 is how one internalizes and chooses to think or feel about the situation and oneself at such times. The above is my own personal lesson from loneliness; not something I have read or heard said by others. But my own firsthand experience at x time, feeling alone and lonely. I changed how I interpreted it; how I thought about it; and the feeling held for it. In essence, I changed and all loneliness ended. What took its place was an ability to be, and passion for spending time, alone. So, yes lessons are there for the learning. It\u2019s not a matter of \u201ccan we\u201d but do we want to, and are we willing to put in the effort? ",

If you are alone and suffering even in a crowd, it is because you are not even pleasant to yourself.
