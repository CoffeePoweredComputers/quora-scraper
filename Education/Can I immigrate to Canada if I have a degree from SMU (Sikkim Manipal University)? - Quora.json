            "answer_text": "You can immigrate to Canada or any other country if you have a degree from Sikkim Manipal University \u2013 Distance Education. The degree will not be a roadblock to successful immigration albeit you must fulfill all other eligibility criteria. The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Criteria for Canadian immigration does not distinguish between a degree from a regular program or a distance education, provided the institution and the degree are both recognized. I think your question stems from the fact that there are many universities whose distance education program are not recognized overseas, especially in nations like Canada and Australia. Sikkim Manipal University, Gangtok is recognized by UGC and offers programs through Open & Distance Learning (ODL) mode. In addition, Sikkim Manipal University is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), the world's first and oldest international university network. Sikkim Manipal University is also a member of the International Council for Open and Distance Education (ICDE), a leading global organization for distance education along with being a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU). Being recognized by UGC is itself an adequate recognition as a premier professional program. Other recommended organisations for evaluation of education credentials for Canadian relocation/work permits are: International Qualifications Assessment \u2013 by Government of Alberta, Canada: International qualifications assessmentInternational Credential Assessment Service of Canada: ICAS",
