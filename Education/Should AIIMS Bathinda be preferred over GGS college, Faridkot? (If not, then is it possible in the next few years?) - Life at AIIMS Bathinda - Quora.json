            "answer_text": "Yes, for sure. Being a resident of Faridkot myself, i have many of my schoolmates in GGS. The thing is that they chose GGS only because they couldn't get into AIIMS Bathinda. On the other hand, all my batchmates here belonging to Punjab had the choice between AIIMS and the GMC's of Punjab. You see, choosing GGS is more of a compulsion than an actual, legit choice. Not only AIIMS, any project of Centre is much more lucrative and high end than a State project. The funding is incomparable, i mean just think: 925 crore rupees!! And that makes the whole difference: Good professors, exposure to high end medical equiments, wide range of cases and whatnot. The culture, the flexibility you have a student, is just unparalleled. I will give you an example. We have this book called Cunningham, which, to tell you precisely, is like a ticket for the Dissection Hall, they won't let you in without it. It is just rubbish and of no use whatsoever. So, instead i would take the Gray's Anatomy (Bible of Anatomy) to the D-Hall. Since our professors understood how good that book was, they would let me carry it instead of Cunningham. It wouldn't have happened in GGS at any cost. Another thing is the autonomicity that AIIMS has. This became all the more apparent in this pandemic situation. Our Worthy Director took the decision to start our classes for the 2nd proff without wasting any time. And then you have the students of GGS stuck in the same place, waiting for any decision by the MCI..you get my point. So, to summarize, yes it is wise to choose AIIMS Bathinda over GGS, even for this year. ",
