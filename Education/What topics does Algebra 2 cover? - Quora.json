            "answer_text": "Generally the first semester is largely a rehash of Algebra 1 but with greater depth. For example, in Algebra 1 you learn how to factor and solve quadratics. Then in Algebra 2, you learn how to do more complex factoring (like sum and difference of cubes), divide polynomials, solve quadratics with complex solutions, and solve quadratic inequalities. You'll review how to solve systems of equations, but now you'll usually have to solve a system of 3+ equations, and they will teach you how to solve it with matrices. In the second semester, you start getting mostly brand new topics which generally include logarithms, matrices, conic sections, rational functions, high-order radicals and rational exponents. ",
