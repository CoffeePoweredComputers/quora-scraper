            "answer_text": "Force yourself to make a commitment to it. At least, that's what works for me. I've tried to learn programming a couple times, starting with Python, then Arduino, then Java. Each time, I got through a hello world program and lost interest rapidly. Then last year, senior year of high school, I took a computer science course. Click. My interest soared. I began to research cs topics way beyond what was asked for or even shown in class \u2014 I remember trying to derive the y combinator for several days in a notebook, those pages are a mess! Eventually, my interest waned again. I had implemented three or four cellular automata-related programs in about as many languages, but was rapidly losing steam. Also, the year was coming to a close. I was also a member of my high school's robotics team (not writing software, I actually did the wiring), and one of the mentors recommended that I apply for an internship at one of our sponsors, a nearby software company. I did so, showing off some of my work \u2014 thank goodness cellular automata are flashy! \u2014 and getting the job. That definitely reinvigorated my interest. Without having to commit to writing code, I think I would've stopped programming halfway through the summer, but because I'm expected to show up and write, I'm looking forward to tackling a nice solid chunk of JavaScript tomorrow morning! Obviously, people with more discipline and motivation can commit to things without forcing themselves into situations which they can't not do something, but as a person who tends to choose the path of least resistance, I find that making writing code the path of least resistance I'll end up doing so, improving at it, and enjoying it.

            "answer_text": "First of all, learning programming is a long process. You should take your time figuring out a few points before you head out there and actually start learning. It will make your learning experience much easier, structured, and quicker. In short: You need a clear plan and the right tools to get you where you want to be. That's what the following points are all about. You can find the entire article here: How to Start Learning Coding? Helpful Tips for Beginners. 1: Figure out why you want to learn programming This first point is by far the most important thing you need to consider. Why are you interested in learning coding? Try to be aware of and analytical about the reasons why you wish to learn programming. I don't mean that you need to spend days or weeks figuring this out. But take some time and make sure you know what's motivating you. Once you figure out what your \"mission\" is, you will know what steps are necessary to achieve your goal. Remember that learning programming is a process that will tie you up for a long time. And things will not always go the way you plan, trust me. Hence, you need to be able to find your motivation over and over again. You will need at least several months or even years to reach your goals. Let's look at two different scenarios here. These two are the top reasons I've heard why people want to start learning coding: Reason #1: I'm in it for the money These days, becoming a developer can give a nice boost to your pay check. Right now, skilled programmers are some of the most sought-after employees worldwide. And also some of the highest-paid ones. Thus, teaching yourself how to code could really change your life. As an added bonus, working as a programmer or web developer could give you more freedom in life when it comes to working remotely, for instance. And the best part is: it's easier than ever to learn digital skills online nowadays, so your timing couldn't be better. Reason #2: I think coding is cool - I'm genuinely interested in tech If this is the case, congrats! You will most likely keep going even when times get rough and achieve your goals in the long run. Perhaps you're trying to learn how to automate stuff at work. Believe me, there's a ton of things you can do to speed up your work with Excel, for instance. Or maybe you're using a simple mobile application and you're not quite happy with its features. (Learning how to program your own mobile app isn't as difficult as you might think.) What sets this reason apart from the others is something called intrinsic motivation. It's the drive that keeps us going without much persuasion, rewards, or incentives. With innate motivation, we simply enjoy what we're doing and we're curious to see what's headed our way next. So whatever your reason for learning coding is, just be aware of it. Having a clear idea of what is driving you to learn coding will help you stick to your learning routine. If you're not quite sure about your long-term goals, it's really easy to slip out of your practising schedule. What matters the most is that you learn coding in a way that keeps you motivated. You will find the right way to achieve your goal once you know why you want to reach it in the first place. 2: Know what you want to create with coding This step will mainly determine the skills you need to learn in order to achieve your goals. Therefore, give it some thought before you start choosing your first programming language to learn. With seemingly endless possibilities, coding can be used to the most diverse projects. You can start by thinking about the following questions: Are you interested in creating websites?Or would you rather build mobile applications?How about some data analysis and visualization?Or developing games or software?Whatever it is that you wish to create, just be mindful about it. Of course, you could simply start learning a programming language for the sheer fun of learning it. However, your approach to learning would be completely different. When you already know what sorts of problems you wish to solve with programming, learning it will definitely be a lot easier. When you're learning about a specific topic, you can already have an idea about what you're going to need that skill for in the future. Therefore, you will be more focused and pay more attention to what you're learning. 3: Choose the right programming language Once you have a clear goal, you come to the next question: what do you need to learn to be able to reach it? Knowing what you wish to create is a problem you need to solve. And a programming language offers you the tools to solve that problem. If you're interested in web development, for example, you would learn a selection of the following languages: HTML and CSSJavaScriptPythonRubyPHPThe first three languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are used for front-end development, meaning that they determine the look and feel of a website, for instance. These languages are the basic tools you need to learn in order to become a web developer. For a kick-start into learning HTML and CSS, check out my review on HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett. It's a great beginner-friendly book that I really enjoyed - highly recommended. The latter three (Python, Ruby, PHP) are used in backend development. These languages are responsible for the logic and the different functionalities. If you're not familiar with the terminology just yet, you will find this post about back-end and front-end development quite helpful. To help you choose a suitable language for whatever it is you wish to achieve and create with coding, I've written an entire post on how to choose your first programming language, too. 4: Start small, track your learning When you start learning coding, remember to be kind to yourself! Start at the beginning and set realistic targets for your projects. I know how it feels when you're impatient about creating all sorts of awesome stuff, but try to keep it cool. Pay attention at the beginning and really take your time to learn and understand the basics. That way you will build a stronger foundation for your future endeavors with coding. As a beginner, you don't need to aim for the stars. Just like a freshly-graduated engineer doesn't know how to build the world's tallest building, you don't need to know how to create the next big search engine or social medium. You don't have to be the best coder in the world. Therefore, try to come up with little motivations for yourself. Start with simple tasks, like writing a small program that only does one thing. Then, while you're writing one program, you will get an idea for the next one. This cycle is a learning process that is fuelled by your curiosity alone. Remember that intrinsic motivation I was talking about above? That's exactly what's happening here, too. You simply keep going because you enjoy solving little problems with coding. With each problem that you solve, you are growing your set of skills and tools in programming. By reaching small targets one by one, things will start to come together. Then, slowly you will develop a skillset that will allow you to tackle bigger projects and solve more complex problems with coding. 5: Understand Computer Science basics How to start learning coding? By learning Computer Science basics first! When you learn how to code, you're telling computers what to do for you. To get a better idea of what computers are capable of, I'd recommend learning the basics of Computer Science right away. Understanding how computers work will make learning programming much easier for you. You can think of trying to drive a car but not knowing what will happen when you turn the steering wheel. That's what it feels like to code your own programs and run them on a device you don't understand. For a more thorough post about the topic, check out Learning Computer Science Basics Before Coding. The bottom line is that you will simply reach your goals faster when you're familiar with the fundamentals of Computer Science. Recommended Computer Science Courses For Beginners To help you out, here are a couple of online courses I can recommend for learning the basics of Computer Science if you're an absolute beginner: Computer Science 101 - this is a beginner-level course on Udemy that will teach you everything you need to know about Computer Science in order to see quicker results while learning how to code.Computer Basics - this course at Team Treehouse is excellent for getting to know what Computer Science is all about and how computers actually work under the hood.

Needless to say, the professor does an amazing job with the course - and it's free!Simply browse through the courses and see which one seems interesting to you. They're all absolutely great, so pick whichever you like and you'll learn all you need to know for now. 6: Start an online coding course Ok, now you got a clear goal in your mind, you've chosen a programming language to learn, and you know a bit about how computers work. Next, it's time to actually start learning coding. Luckily, you will not have difficulties in finding enough resources online to get you started. The Web is so packed with coding tutorials, guides, and courses that it's in fact hard to find the best ones out there as a beginner. My only suggestion is that if you're interested in learning web development, choose one course that will cover several different programming languages and other tools. Also, it should include as many practical projects as possible. To get you started, check out my post with 8 Great Websites for Learning Coding for Free. Once you've found a suitable course, remember to stick to it. Even though there are new courses waiting just around the corner with new, exciting topics, try to finish each course you start. To help you do this, go ahead and read my post on How To Finish Every Coding Course You Start. Summing it up: How to start learning coding Ok this was a long answer, but I hope I managed to give you some helpful pointers on how to start learning coding as a total beginner. The main point is: you're not going to learn how to code by sitting down and saying that you want to learn programming. Instead, your mindset should be more like this: you want to create something or solve a problem, and learning a programming language will be your tool for that. Thus, coding itself is a journey, not a destination. So try to be more aware of why you're interested in learning programming. Simple as that. Once that's done, you will find the right resources for learning and you will be well on your way towards becoming a developer. Learning how to code is an amazing journey that can take you wherever you wish to go - at least career-wise. There are so many benefits from learning coding and exciting opportunities out there for skilled developers nowadays. You won't run out of work anytime soon. ",
