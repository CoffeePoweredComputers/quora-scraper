            "answer_text": "I'm not sure who the \"advisor\" is : Is this person a high school guidance counselor? Or is s/he your son's academic advisor who wrote the recommendation because s/he was supervising your son's research or summer program at the local college?   If this recommendation was written by your son's high school counselor, it should be considered part of your son's school records.  Your son most likely checked the box in the application that waives the right to see the recommendations, so the colleges will not discuss them with you. (Although you can try to call admissions, explain the situation, and ask nicely if they can provide any feedback on your son's application, maybe they could tell you something. They don't have to discuss a rejected file with you, but you never know - maybe you'll get the admissions officer who reviewed your son's application and remembers it.) I think that recommendation letters from teachers and counselors are a bit different with respect to school records. A teacher's recommendation is not necessarily a part of the school records file, because it's a personal recommendation sent directly to the college. But the school guidance counselors write these letters of evaluation/recommendation as a part of their direct job responsibilities. If this recommendation goes into your son's school file, you absolutely have the right to see everything that's in your child's educational records. Read about FERPA rights here: FERPA for Students  Office of General Counsel on FERPA with respect to college applications: \"Q. Are records of applicants who do not matriculate protected as \"education records\" under FERPA? A. The Family Policy Compliance Office has generally taken the position that records sent by the student to the university are not protected as education records unless/until the student matriculates. In contrast, records about a student sent directly from the high school to the university would be covered as education records regardless of whether or not the student matriculates.\" Basically, it means that the college doesn't consider the application materials as \"educational records\" until the student starts classes at this college, and FERPA doesn't apply to the records of rejected applicants. BUT all records sent to the college from the high school are considered \"educational records\" at this high school. The high school records are covered by FERPA, and you have the right to see them.   If you really want to get to the bottom of this, you need to talk to the school office or principal and ask to see you son's file. If this recommendation letter is not in the records, ask why it's not in the file and how you can get a copy of it. If they refuse to help you, you can talk to an attorney. I think the school should be interested in a fair resolution of this matter. ",
