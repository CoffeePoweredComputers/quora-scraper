But, I contacted few of my seniors and they told that they received it sometime in feb\u2026and this year the paper was delayed so it may take more time. Best is to not think so much of it\u2026it shall arrive! Just keep an eye on the ncert website\u2026.where they will announce the start of the procedure of distributing the award letters and user ids for login on the web portal for disbursement of scholarship. Hope it helped! ",
