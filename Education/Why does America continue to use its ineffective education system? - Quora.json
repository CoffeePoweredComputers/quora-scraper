            "answer_text": "What \u201ceducation system?\u201d The grading system is incredibly diverse, both in reliability, documentation, and delivery. Segregation by age is about as useful as it was by race, by language, or by sex. And is hardly universal, with an immense variety of public and private options coexisting. With each state having substantial autonomy, the variety of skills, knowledge, and methods of learning and instruction is more remarkable than any metric of \u201cineffective\u201d outcome. Some of \u201cthe system\u201d is notably better than some other \u201cparts\u201d of that \u201csystem.\u201d A recent piece on higher education cost/benefit studies underscores the lasting value of less prestigious, but more vulnerable community college, for example, measured college enrollment against economic mobility measures. But many people go to \u201ccollege\u201d for many other reasons than money or financial returns. If you don\u2019t generalize so broadly, you may be able to identify the best and worst, but even then, the metrics - money, mobility, wisdom, tradition, and community, for just a few - are far more personal than universal, and any reasonable generalization will fail to capture that diversity. If you want to talk about early education, graduate education, in-service education, or any of many more specific metrics, you might - but only sometimes - be able to generalize \u201cineffective\u201d mobility achieved through enrollment, but, even then, there are enough individual variables with each student/family/community/discipline to make those generalizations suspect.

            "answer_text": "Interesting that you draw this broad conclusion based on anecdote. That\u2019s very, very, very dangerous. (And ALWAYS leads to bad policy in any area.) If we turn around and look at the broader picture, let\u2019s consider what we need education system in the US to do: The US has always had test scores in the middle of the world list - since the 1960\u2019s when such comparisons first became possible.However, throughout that time (and continuing today) the US outpaces the world in economic strength, innovation, and scientific discovery (at a minimum).That sounds quite successful to me. You might enjoy reading \u201cThe Manufactured Crisis\u201d showing how concern about education in the US is heavily a manufactured concern designed to achieve goals for specific interest groups - and started with the baseless \u201cA Nation At Risk\u201d report under Reagan - a report without foundation in any research, statistics, or reality. But let\u2019s take your anecdote at face value and suppose that everywhere in the US our 12th graders are just learning physics concepts that someone from India leaned in the 9th grade. Does that matter to society? I look at education as needing to provide a base from which the INDIVIDUAL is responsible for digging, learning new things, driving for discovery, etc\u2026 In China, for example, the education system relies exceptionally heavy on teaching to the test. So they get nice test scores yet struggle to establish entrepreneurism and innovation as goals. (Read Yong Zhao to learn more about this.) Yong Zhao observes that his goal for US education is to lead to students who are \u201cout of the basement ready\u201d. Yet learning Bernoulli in 9th grade doesn\u2019t contribute much to out of the basement. (Don\u2019t get me wrong: It\u2019s important. But let\u2019s keep priorities.) Let me also challenge your anecdote. Your comparison is one I\u2019ve often heard before. People encounter exchange students and say the same. There is inherent skew: In your class you deal with the cross section of \u201ctypical\u201d US students for your school/neighborhood. However, ANY exchange student tends to come from higher income and educationally more successful groups of people. So you\u2019re comparing average with above average merely by the example. It\u2019s no surprise your anecdote turns out this way. But, that anecdote does NOT reflect truth. Nor do test. There\u2019s a great analysis of the PISA test recently that shows that while the US does NOT get to cherry pick it\u2019s students, throughout Asia it is common that the students taking that test are exceptional - and not reflective of averages.
