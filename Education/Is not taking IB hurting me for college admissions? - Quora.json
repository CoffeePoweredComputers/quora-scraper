            "answer_text": "In terms of IB vs AP, the answer should be - take whichever classes are better for you. As long as you\u2019re challenging yourself and taking advantage of your high school\u2019s resources, that\u2019s what matters. My personal opinion is that while the IB curriculum probably does a better job of preparing you for college-style classes, the AP classes are seen as slightly more difficult in the eyes of an admissions officer (this is just what I\u2019ve picked up on in the past few years after speaking with our former admissions officers). That being said, there is no \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to the question: which is better between IB vs AP? Both programs have strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s pretty subjective towards what will be better for you, individually. As you make this decision, ask questions: Which program is more popular at your high school?Which teachers instruct IB vs AP classes? Where are the best teachers teaching?Where have students from your high school been admitted to college? Which program did they choose?How many AP classes do students at your high school typically take? How many would you have to take to standout at your school?Do students at your school combine the AP and IB programs?Answering these questions will help you understand how these programs work at your specific high school. These programs have strengths and weaknesses nationally and internationally as programs. But when an admissions officer sits down and looks at your application he or she will be evaluating you within the context your high school. Related content: High School Class Rank: Does it Matter? The Admissions Office will ask whether you challenged yourself and showed a love of learning within your high school environment. You don\u2019t have to take 15 AP classes if only 5 are offered at your high school! Finding out the normal practice at your high school and how you can excel within that is what matters most. As with anything in the admissions process, when you choose IB vs AP, follow your interests, and pick the one that\u2019s best for you. ",

            "answer_text": "AP/IB are in similar level. All you can do is take courses that are challanging and help you prepare to take next level courses. If you take AP route - that the most advanced courses (please rememeber content aka what you learn is important). If you take the IB route do the same. The question top school asks is the following How you taken sufficiently challenging courses offered to you.How are you prepared yourself to be admitted to their school (school vary)How do you compare with other incoming studentWhat else have you done other than studying in school (aka activities outside of school)How much did you acheive on the non school activities (school level, state level, national, international level?) - remember most of the students have acieved something at national level - if not you should have overcome something (like being a refuge, voluentered in war torn country during summer and saved lifes, etc) so big to compensate that achievement.",
