For example, if you gave improvement for all subjects, but manage to get better scores than the previous in only some if the subjects, and less in the rest, you will have to reproduce both the mark sheets in front of the college, I.e , the old one and the improvement one. If you score better in all of them, you only need to show the improvement one. If you haven't given improvement for all subjects, you will have to show both. That's how it goes. ",
