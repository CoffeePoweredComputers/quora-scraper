            "answer_text": "On February 19th, 2016, I tried to kill myself. The next day, half conscious, I spoke to my mother. My Maa, who was informed by my girlfriend, told me, \u201cEnough, Hirak. I don't care about your degree. Come back home. I can't lose my only son.\u201d I said, still very hazy, and blurry, \u201cMaa, I'm sorry. I'm such a disappointment. You deserve better.\u201d Maa would tell me, \u201cIt's okay, baba. Come home. Please. I beg you.\u201d In two days, I would leave for home once I was strong enough to move again.  Back home \u2014 my money, allowance, and freedom were all taken away. It had to be. I was a diagnosed alcoholic \u2014 with clinical depression, anxiety, insomnia, panic induced night terrors, visual and auditory hallucinations, and suicidal ideation. I started on getting sober. I was okay for almost a week. My nightmares still weren't going away. I was sweating profusely every day. Sometimes, I'd wake up screaming at night, in tears, shaking, visibly disturbed. I'd stopped taking my meds. Then, finally, one night, to celebrate a week of sobriety, I drank a beer. The cycle restarted. Finally, the next day, it happened. Maa caught me as I was sneaking in half a litre of rum.  That day \u2014 I stole money from my Maa's purse, bought half a litre of rum, came back home and was just about to leave, when my Maa came running. She stood in front of the door, blocking my passage. She screamed, \u201cWhat's in your pocket? Now, Hirak.\u201d I said, without meeting her eyes, \u201cNothing, Maa.\u201d She screamed, in tears now, \u201cHirak, what's wrong with you? What's wrong? Please tell me. This isn't the solution.\u201d I lied, \u201cPlease don't do this, Maa. Let me go.\u201d In a fit, Maa pushed me, and before I could react, she reached into my pocket and took out the bottle. Then she ran to the kitchen, began crying, and screamed, \u201cI can't do this, anymore. I really can't.\u201d Then, as I looked on, she took the glass bottle of rum, and banged it on the kitchen sink. It didn't break \u2014 it cracked. Again. Again. Again. Again. Then, again. The whole bottle broke as she began to cry. Glass pieces pierced her skin. There was blood everywhere. On the floor. On the sink. On the utensils. Glass shards everywhere. Blood drained down her right arm. That night, after borrowing money from a friend, I'd gone and bought Desi Liquor and drank it neat. That night, I cried, all alone, drunk out of my mind.  Three years later, in December, 2018, I was invited to give a talk at a college in Kolkata. It was on mental health and how the organization I'd started had gone on to help so many people.  My Maa was in the audience. I told the audience about my life, my journey, my story, all the lives I'd gone on to save, all the incredible things I'd accomplished since my suicide attempt. I remember glancing at my mother during the talk. I looked at her \u2014 those eyes. That moment, maybe, all those moments so many years ago flashed across her eyes. A single drop of tear escaped, for her to wipe it away, instantly. She looked straight at me and smiled. Her son \u2014 the one she never gave up on. Pride written all over her face. That moment, that instant, I felt this deep throb inside my chest. It took me a second to realize what it was. Happiness. To be able to make my family proud. To be able to walk back from the depths of despair to walk a path of redemption.  Why should you never lose hope? Because, if I, an alcoholic, who people on this very platform have called an \u2014 asshole, drunk, bad son, bad brother, useless, worthless \u2014 who once tried to kill himself could do it, so can you. No one's beyond redemption. Not even a lonely drunk who'd once slept next to the gutter when his world was falling apart. Not even you. ",

            "answer_text": "Everybody, I would like you to meet John Bunn.  He was incarcerated for 17 years, for a crime he did not commit. On Marcy 29, 1998, two correctional officers, Rolando Neischer and Robert Crosson were shot by two men on their bikes. Neischer did not survive the gunshot wounds, but Crosson did. Crosson would then identify Bunn in a lineup. He, along with another acquaintance, Roseann Hargrove, would be sentenced to 17 years in prison. He never stopped pleading innocent. But at every turn, he was stopped by Detective Louis Scarcella, a corrupt detective who was later found to have wrongfully convicted at least 14 men and women. But John Bunn didn\u2019t let that stop him. You see, he started out as being illiterate. He started with no hope or aspirations because he couldn\u2019t read or write. And as it turns out, that started his climb to educate himself. He would start with children\u2019s books and have a teacher help him vocalize the sounds. This process took 18 months. In 2008 he prevented a counselor from getting raped in prison, and was thus released for parole. It was brutal. People didn\u2019t want to hire an ex-convict, and since he missed a time to report back, he was sent back to jail. He never stopped fighting for an exoneration. Throughout this time, he collected books for prisons and for school. He fought for increasing literacy rates in prison inmates. He took the time to teach them and help them read/write. And in 2018, after 27 long years, he was fully exonerated of all charges. Now, he\u2019s 41 and also the CEO of a project called \u201cA Voice 4 the Unheard\u201d. Those books he\u2019s amassed for schools and prisons? He amassed at least 20,000 books. And it\u2019s still increasing. Detective Louis Scarcella is now not only disgraced, but all of his murder convictions are now being reviewed in court.  John Bunn could have been a simple statistic. He could have lost hope as soon as the lawyers placed a pen in front of him and he couldn\u2019t write or read anything. But that didn\u2019t stop him from fighting. He fought for his rights for 27 years. He\u2019s now using that experience to fight for other people. For people like us, who don\u2019t have the same struggle as being in prison for 27 years, what\u2019s stopping us from making a difference too?
