            "answer_text": "Getting previous year papers for VITEEE is quite difficult as there are multiple question papers for the exam. I would suggest you to give mock tests for some other engineering entrance exams. That should familiarize you with the system. Also, go through the instructions given by VIT regarding the exam pattern and how to answer it. It should help. There is a book called VITEEE mock test papers by ARIHANT PUBLICATIONS. It includes previous year question papers and various mock test. You can buy it from any nearby bookstore otherwise it is available online on Amazon as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Since VITEEE conducts it's exam online, there is no genuine place where you can get it. Many books and sites do claim to have it, but they are more of sample type. When I gave it, I found that many questions were from past AIEEE (JEE Main) papers and most of them were based on prescribed NCERT books. ",
