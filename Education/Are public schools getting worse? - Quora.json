            "answer_text": "Depends on which public schools you are talking about. When I was a kid, a teacher didn\u2019t have to pay for school supplies out of their own pocket, or ask for donations of school supplies from parents. (Yes, that is a thing in my school district, one of the wealthiest in the country.) When I was a kid, primary funding for public schools came from local property taxes. That, of course, meant that wealthy neighborhoods had better funded schools than poor neighborhoods. It seems like every election, there is a bond measure on the ballot for funding schools. Why on earth are we borrowing money to pay for schools? Why don\u2019t we have the will to just pay taxes for it? That being said, if you were not a reasonably intelligent, self-motivated student, public schools have always sucked. If you are self-motivated, you now have many more resources available to you. Oh, if they only had Khan Academy when I was a kid\u2026 What makes things worse today is not the schools themselves, but the levels of distraction students experience, with all the media vying for their attention. And the attempts to standardize curricula, and to measure schools with standardized tests, aren\u2019t helping. Teachers teach to the test, because their livelihood depends on it. Good teachers who have the ability to customize the delivery of the material based on their students\u2019 needs are force to use a one-size-fits-all standardized approach. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt it. I grew up in the fifties/sixties in an upper-middle-class suburban community in Northern California when a classroom had one teacher, thirty-five students, and no teacher aides. Our teachers had no oversight or training whatsoever; there was no essay-based testing of faculty or students \u2014rather, graded work tended to be true-false, or multiple choice. Further, I confess that despite my love of reading, most of my own book reports came from the back cover of the book I\u2019d read. Of course, since salaries vary by tax base, one can imagine the exact locations where classrooms have improved and where not. Recent creations such as Teach For America and AmeriCorps have made small inroads into attracting great teachers to the field. Every conference I have attended over forty years of teaching in east-coast independent schools, I have found the public school teachers I have met to be smart, creative, and dedicated. ",

Between the anti-intellectualism coming from some quarters that inhibits the teaching of factual information on a range of subjects to the outright entitlement that comes from some students and parents to the dumb, reactionary laws created by know-nothing legislators and political appointees, schools are at the mercy of dullards, spoiled brats and proud idiots. As a side note: if you think it\u2019s bad now, just wait to see what would be in store from the \u201cpublic schools should be abolished/charter schools are awesome/vouchers for everyone\u201d crowd. Let those inmates run the asylum and you\u2019ll see how bad things can get. ",
