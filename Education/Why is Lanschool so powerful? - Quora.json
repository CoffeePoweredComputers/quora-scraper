            "answer_text": "I honestly have no idea. I've spent many hours researching exactly what the program does and my only response to it is this: \u2018We hear about these teachers who do awful things to their students based on the information that the school has given them. Isn't this just a much more secure way for teachers to do this???\u2019 Don't get me wrong. I suspect NONE of my teachers to do anything that would result in the harm of a school child. This is just an analysis of how LanSchool could be put in the wrong hands. For those who don't know what LanSchool is, it is a program, installed by \u2018Administrators\u2019 to not only spy on computers, but STEAL INFORMATION FROM THEM. No, I'm not even kidding. For instance, say you log into Google with a separate account not managed by the admins. Within 5 seconds, your teacher knows, if he or she desires: User has logged into GoogleUser has clicked the \u2018Sign in\u2019 button.User has typed: ferocious3994943@gmail.con (not a real email FYI)User has clicked \u2018Enter\u2019User has typed: \u2018ChickenPancake593\u2032 into the password bar.User has clicked enter.Oh, not to mention the fact that they can also log just about any program on your computer, like a little audit log from hell. I know this because I helped install it. Yes, in one of my IT classes we re-installed the program to all of the computers. Not cool. From what I know, the program is set to run on startup. Period. Only the admin, our teacher, has the ability to log into the account. It's annoying as HECK. All of those little life hacks that you have learned on YouTube don't help crap. It's not budging. Sorry for the tangent. But let's go back to the Google Login idea. A teacher also knows this: What your computer looks like. LS takes screenshots every 5 seconds.How much battery you have left (laptops apply)ALL of your keystrokes.ALL of your settings, preferences, and extensions(Chrome) and Programs(Windows)Possesses the ability to control your computer, without consent.Possesses the ability to take over your computer\u2026 Even more so than expected. Your computer cannot respond to Ctrl+alt+delete. In my eyes, any program that denies access to system functions should be illegal.Can tell your entire search history, even when you delete it.You might be saying: \u2018Aw, that's stupid, but not creepy.\u2019 We\u2019re not done. Most kids know the boundaries of the program, and all that it accepts. After all, it's our life goal to end the program and/or bypass it. Only about 3 kids in my entire school know this, however: LanSchool has the ability to take over YOUR computer. Yes, your private computer with your programs. No barrier. Every time you login from startup with your school email, ChromeBook or PC, LanSchool automatically downloads and installs, setting a new force in motion: You aren't the administrator anymore. Your teacher is. Now, how fun is that? This program has the ability to literally stalk you wherever you are. Suddenly, your teacher is your vacation. Your teacher is your YouTube channel. Your teacher is the unrelenting know-it-all. Within 2 minutes of logging onto a program in Indonesia for a vacation trip to check your email: Your teacher can pinpoint where you are with an accuracy of 7 meters. Unless your smart and can hide your IP addre- oh wait. That won't make a difference. None of my teachers would do this, but with the combination of IC and LanSchool, your teacher might know more about you than your own parents. (PS: If you need to stop LanSchool on your home computer, just make sure that you don't log into your computer on your school account. You can still log into it on a browser.) ",

Lenovo is a Chinese company after all. Personally I love the fact it focuses on Collaborative Learning and Student Control. That control is so amazingly efficient the teacher is die fuhrer von das klassenzimmer (leader of the class room). It could reduce school system expense by removing the need for physical buildings, administrative and maintenance staff. ",
