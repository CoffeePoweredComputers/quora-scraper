            "answer_text": "As you can see from the little line next to my name, I do not send my daughters to bed anymore. But here comes the twist! I never did! Aaah, you let Mommy do all the heavy lifting! Nope! Truth is, we really never had fixed bedtime for the kids (or ourselves for that matter). Only when they were really really tiny. But once they were out of diapers, walking firmly and able to talk fluently (that was by age 3 for all of them) we would allow them to freely choose their going to bed time. The only reference point for them to consider was that they had to leave for school at 7:30 A.M. Showered, dressed and groomed with a bite to eat before. Before their teen years, they were waked up, later they had an alarm clock. There was never a day they missed school or arrived late. We did some family visits in the evenings, when we would come home really late, but most of the time, our daughters perfectly knew when it was time for them to go upstairs. We also would let them watch whatever we would see on TV, of which the Juarez evening newscast was by far the hardest to digest, specially after 2007. By taking away the mystery from \u201cadult\u201d TV content and staying up late, there was never once any drama at bedtime. And they went to their rooms for sleeping, not doing other stuff at our backs. Our daughters are not prone to \u201csleep in\u201d on weekends and vacations, a \u201cwestern\u201d habit I am wholeheartedly disgusted with. This mostly comes from people seeing their everyday life as tedious and tiring - and one deserves to get a \u201crest\u201d. Sleeping in then will cause the kid to not be tired at bedtime and that is when usually all the drama starts - to make sure they \u201cget as much sleep as the user manual says\u201d We never read a single word in a parental guide or magazine. Even so, on average, our daughters would get some 8, 9 hours of sleep. They were seldom around after 9 P.M. only when all three were in their teen age. As stated, they are all integrated into the Swiss workforce by now, so this lenience did not harm them to the least. But all three repeatedly told us that they have a very favorable view about their childhood. And we are happy to state that all three can cook, do dishes, laundry and run errands and pay their bills on their own just fine. Needless to say that such an approach is EXTREMELY controversial in control-happy Switzerland. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember bedtimes I had at specific ages. In 3rd grade my bedtime was 8:30, in 6th grade it was 9:30. In 9th grade I was usually in bed by 10\u201310:30 but my parents didn\u2019t really enforce it. Since high school I\u2019ve pretty much gone to sleep whenever, depending on how much homework and studying I have to do. My parents were stricter than most, but that wasn\u2019t what I hated. What made me absolutely livid was the fact that my little brother was allowed to go to bed whenever I did. If that doesn\u2019t make sense, let me explain the injustice of so called \u201cequality\u201d: Me: Now that I\u2019m in 6th grade, I want to go to bed later, like around 9:30. Parents: Ok, sure. Me: (in the living room with the family). It\u2019s almost 9:30 (notices brother). What is he still doing up? Parents: You guys both have to be in bed by 9:30. Me: WHAT? When I was in 3rd grade I had to be in bed by 8:30! How come he gets to stay up until 9:30 in 3rd grade? Parents: We\u2019re treating you guys equally. It\u2019s not fair for one of you to have an earlier bedtime than the other. Me: (screams internally) I have been burned like this SO many times. I\u2019ve had to wait months, sometimes years to get a certain privilege, and once I did, boom, my brother, regardless of his age, automatically gets what I get, because \u201cequality\u201d. Ugh. ",
