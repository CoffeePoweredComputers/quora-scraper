            "answer_text": "Read everything! Read business magazines, books, follow sites that share interesting trends, such as CB Insights, or daily feeds from others. It\u2019s a continuing education process. Take business classes, attend workshops. There aren\u2019t enough people in business who understand basic economics and the value of self-interest in customers, employees, shareholder and suppliers. There is no one way to run a company or to build an empire, but think of reading and learning is a way of adding tools to your shop no differently than a carpenter would add tools to theirs. The more you know, the easier it is to leverage that knowledge into a success. It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, there is always something to learn and that\u2019s the fun! If you\u2019re bored, well that\u2019s on you because there are so many aspects to business, that one of them has to grab you. When I was in school, I never ever imagined having this much fun and even in the scariest, worst moments, I was still glad I was doing something that meant something to me. ",
