            "answer_text": "I hope you have found a way to motivate yourself- but all I can do is share my experience. My son just graduated from high school and went thru a very similar situation. He never loved school and even though he is very smart- he could never seem to be motivated enough to get good grades. He struggled thru freshman and sophomore year- barely making it by. His junior year started the same way even though there is all the talk of College, testing, importance of grades, etc. About halfway thru the year- I started to notice a change. I\u2019m not sure if reality had hit, if he started to notice his friends becoming excited about the opportunities they were getting from colleges and other programs or if he just started to mature- but it dawned on him that he was in trouble. He is a soccer player- he got multiple calls about playing division 1 soccer for great schools. He went to visit, met the teams, saw the dorms and absolutely loved it. Then he was told by all of them - one by one- that they couldn\u2019t accept him because of his GPA. He didn\u2019t qualify to play division 1. Upset would be putting it mildly. He realized that this is exactly what i had been talking about. Just because he didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do in freshman and sophomore year- doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t figure it out. And now it was too late. He spent the rest of the year and his senior busting his ass- he barley made it into a division 3 school. His entrance paper was written on how he made such a huge mistake not taking school more seriously- because now he wanted it- and it was too late. He started college last month 6 hours away and is working hard so he can get good gpa and so he has the opportunity to go to the schools he wanted to. It\u2019s hard for him to see his best friend playing division 1 after they had always imagined themselves together. He\u2019s really disappointed with himself because it was right there in front of him and he just didn\u2019t take it. And he can\u2019t go back. You only get 1 shot. The motivation should be you. Your going to want things- you will figure it out, I promise. And there is nothing worse in the world for you (or your parents) to want something so bad but there is nothing you can do to change the outcome. It will happen for you- you will have your moment- but don\u2019t let it be too late to fix things. Your going to get motivated and be excited about something soon- and your going to want to go for it. Please don\u2019t take that from yourself. I know it sounds dramatic- but the decisions you make now will effect your whole like. Even as an older adult- I want to take my kids places, give them things, travel, etc/ and i can\u2019t because I work extra hard at a job that I wouldn\u2019t have to have if I had had a better education. I could have guaranteed myself a better career, more money- i could have traveled, saved, and done so much more. But when you realized that you\u2019ve messed this up- it messes with your head. You feeel like an idiot. You watch everyone else move forward while you stand still. I know this may be over the top- but I am just trying to give you reasons to just not give up. Just fake it till you make it. Who cares what reasons you give yourself - just get it done. Trust me- I\u2019ve been there- and I\u2019ve been on the parent side too. Just push yourself - you will be so so happy that you did. The worst feeling to live with is regret. I pray that one day you will look back at this moment and be so grateful that you didn\u2019t give up. Just don\u2019t give up. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people already gave you good answers about motivation and thinking what goals do you want to achieve in life and how to get there, and start working accordingly, but I don\u2019t see a lot of answers considering mental health issues. Is it possible that you are not motivated because you struggle with depression or other mental health issue? Have you tried talking with a counselor about your issues? You see, when I was in high school, I was depressed. Suicidal attempts depressed. Adults kept telling me \u201cbut you are in high school, these are the best years of your life!\u201d and that didn\u2019t help because what I heard with that is that things were about to get WORSE. I was already living in hell, and THAT was the best that life had to offer me? I thought that if that was the case, I should then end life because why would I want to live if life was even worse suffering? It turned out these adults were all wrong and life got better. When I was in college, I found my passion and now my life is a dream and I\u2019m extremely privileged: I work in the field that I would anyway if I had to do it for free (and had other means to support myself). I realize that not everybody is so privileged and sometimes people have to get whatever job they find. But you have better chances of doing better, if you can finish college in a field you are passionate about, and for that, you generally need good grades. If you\u2019re struggling with mental health issues, please seek help, it does get better. If you aren\u2019t motivated because school is boring, I agree, it is, but perhaps you could make it more interesting? For instance, for history classes, I\u2019d read some biographies in my own time about certain historical figures, and it made me care more about them when I had the chance to humanize them. Even Wikipedia articles could help if you don\u2019t have the time to read a whole book. For other subjects, you could read material that you find interesting and play a game with yourself about how those things relate to each other. Good luck! ",
