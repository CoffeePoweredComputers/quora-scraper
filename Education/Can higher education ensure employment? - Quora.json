            "answer_text": "The answer is somewhat related to both internal drive, determination and passion. Can a higher education open doors absolutely, from someone who achieved a Bachelors Degree latter in life, I wish I had done it right out of High School. I ran into a lot of cases where I was told in job interviews that a Bachelors degree was required at a minimum. So promise a good job, not necessarily but it may get you to an interview someone without was not invited to. Now we have all heard of the Tech Boom where guys like Michael Dell, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college and now look at them - the you can too mentality that I believed fueled the idea that you don\u2019t need a college degree. According to Bill Gates from his Blog: \u201cAlthough I dropped out of college and got lucky pursuing a career in software, getting a degree is a much surer path to success,\u201d Entrepreneurs who dropped out of college: Michael Dell, Dell founder, dropped out at 19Steve Jobs, Apple founder, dropped out at 19Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder, dropped out at 19Bill Gates, Microsoft founder, dropped out at 20Evan Williams, Twitter co-founder, dropped out at 20Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder, dropped out at 20Larry Ellison, Oracle founder, dropped out at 20Jan Koum, WhatsApp founder, dropped out at 21Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, dropped out at 21John Mackey, Whole Foods founder, dropped out at 22I worked at Dell Computer for 12 years and Michael Dell did not finish college but built a great company. I thought he would be open to people that also did not finish college but had a lot to contribute. He attended some of my customer briefings. Exactly the opposite, he stated more than once while I was there he would never hire someone for an important role within company that did not have a degree. He knew there was a lot he did not know in the beginning. I relate it to \u201cpolish\u201d those around with degrees just had more exposure and the fine edges that others who did good work but did not have a degree did not posses in their work. In a development role it was easy to see those who spent a lot of time on a single discipline but did not get the exposure to many different areas from College. They did what they knew not necessarily what best fit the job. They also did not get promoted very far, they were seen as less capable (not because of a lack of a degree although in some cases but mostly capabilities). The truth is a degree paves to road to make success easier to achieve. Now the determination and passion part. If you have enough determination you can achieve anything. However for some the fire begins to smolder at times for lack of direction which is more of a product from lack of knowledge than anything else. You can read about those who dropped out of college that are household names at: Famous Entrepreneurs Who Dropped Out Of College - Infographic Just keep in mind the world has approximately 7.4 billion people, with 318 million in the US. A degree will separate you from a lot of those who don\u2019t in just knowledge and capabilities. You have a much better chance of success. \u201cDon\u2019t think about the promise of a good job\u201d but the enabling to find a great job. No guarantees in life, you have to work for it and earn it. I have met a lot of people who say they have a degree and cant find a job. I believe they have never applied themselves but expected a job upon graduation. You should be thinking about what you want to do all through college researching and looking for internships etc. If you can\u2019t find a job you aren\u2019t applying yourself. If you are getting job interviews with a degree just keep in mind there are a lot who aren\u2019t even getting the interview without a degree. ",

In all actuality more nuanced, as Barack Obama indicated when he said in January that \"people can make significantly more\" by taking in an exchange \"than they may with a workmanship history degree\". A furious workmanship history educator constrained him to apologize, however he was correct. School graduates matured 25 to 32 who are working all day win about $17,500 more every year than their associates who have just a secondary school confirmation, as indicated by the Pew Research Center, a research organization. Be that as it may, not all degrees are similarly helpful. What's more, given the amount they cost\u2014a private four-year degree can set you back as much as $60,000 a year\u2014numerous understudies wind up more terrible off than if they had begun working at 18.

            "answer_text": "Nope, it promises that it will attempt to teach you about the world. This often results in you having skills that will assist you in finding a good job, as by learning about the world you can often perform tasks at a higher degree of competency than if you didn\u2019t learn. In addition, a credential can act as a signal to others that you have some minimum level of competence and the higher the credential the higher that minimum is. But, if you want a promise of a good job, education is not the path. Political and economic structures determine the odds of finding a good job. To use an extreme, right now a degree in computer science is highly employable, but it would have been practically useless 2000 years ago. A match between your skills and the skills that are in demand is what promises you a good job. ",

Then, why do people get educated?  When a person becomes choosy for a particular type of job, then he/she requires understanding of the job and for this purpose, they educate themselves.  If a person goes for higher education, they may be wanting a particular type of job and that may or may not be available at that point of time.   For this reason, after basic education, many will go for a job, get experience and then study further so that they get best out of such education. ",

Diploma of Education since that is more practical ande Masters are too theoretical(With the extra 3 months in practice, come on). Turned down by a dozen of schools becuase of this. However, the higher your education, the wider range your choice of jobs becomes. Meaning you have higher possibility in getting a better job, especially after you have been working for quite some time and gained certain experience. ",

Some small companies will and some will pay for your PE because it helps them when you can sign off designs. If you are in engineering or science it is probably best to wait till your senior year. Take some interviews and talk to some grad schools. I had offers either way but I was tired of Top Ramen so I took a job. I went back for my MS 12 years later on a company fellowship. It was a very good deal. Plus I was able to tailor my program to my job. ",
