            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any math course that\u2019s used in all career fields. For example, my sister is a lawyer. I\u2019m sure she does some arithmetic in her job, but that\u2019s about it. I doubt she ever does any significant algebra, although I will try to remember to ask her the next time we talk because now I\u2019m curious. That said, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the absolute, bare-minimum level of mathematical competence that every college graduate should have is basic algebra. Even if you don\u2019t need to use it in your daily life or career, if you can\u2019t understand it, I don\u2019t think you can call yourself an educated person, and it\u2019s hard to think you\u2019re worthy of a bachelor\u2019s degree. The course that seems to open up the most possibilities, though, is calculus. You can\u2019t really do much in economics, physics, or statistics without it, whereas with it, you can do quite a bit.

            "answer_text": "Basic algebra. Of course, most physics & engineering majors start off with calculus, but nearly all majors need algebra followed by statistics. Technically even those \u201cstudies\u201d courses! Edit: my point is that almost any career that requires a college education will need basic algebra as it foundation. Most technician (AAS) degrees are not calculus-based, but engineering will require calculus. It was also pointed out, if you didn\u2019t sleep in school, you should have a firm grasp of algebra (and trig) before you even step foot on a college campus. ",
