            "answer_text": "Think about any job you\u2019ve ever had, and imagine if getting a promotion or getting fired depended on how well you did on a test you took once a year with no other official assessment whatsoever. Your daily performance doesn\u2019t matter. The projects you\u2019ve completed don\u2019t matter. Whether you know your job doesn\u2019t matter. How did you do on the test? Oh, yeah, if you suck, your boss is getting fired too, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 he won\u2019t get a raise if you do well. How do you think that relationship would change in this Office of Tomorrow as designed by the state school board? Everyone agrees that basing a child\u2019s fate and the capabilities of a teacher on the outcome of their performance over a single day, a day when they may feel sick, a day after their cat died, a day after their neighbors made too much noise all night, a day when they simply aren\u2019t at their best, is not a good system. In fact, almost everyone agrees it is a terrible system, yet legislatures continue to push for exactly that because it offers clear, yet misleading, reporting metrics, so that they can report back to their constituencies on the all important question of \u201cIs are children learning good?\u201d Technology offers a solution that isn\u2019t really being appreciated to its potential. There are numerous apps that allow teachers to create assessments which students can take as they go, which provide instant feedback to the teacher, and can even be instantly reported to parents, or compiled to create for the teacher a \u201cclass report card\u201d to measure how well the entire class is grasping the material. An example is an app that creates a quiz at the end of a reading assignment that instantly allows the student to test if they grasp the subject, where the questions come from a large bank of questions created and vetted by teachers and volunteers. If the student fails, they aren\u2019t stressed or personify themselves as \u201cfailures\u201d, they can just reread the portion and take the assessment again with new questions. This allows them to become aware that they spaced out or failed to grasp a subject, gaining a realistic understanding of their abilities and what they need to work on in the process without the stigma of shame associated with finding out after the teacher returns a failed assignment three days later for the whole class to see. Such a product would do well in the War on Ignorance, not to mention look much more like how the rest of us are assessed each and every day. If we have this method, where peer reviewed curriculum creates assessments that are constantly assessing children\u2019s knowledge of the subjects, then the law of averages dilutes bad days, as well as lucky breaks, in knowing how well children are grasping material, both individually and in aggregate. Furthermore, it allows teachers to see that day if their education was effective or if they need to review. They can even look at their partner teachers of the same subject and ask the all important question, \u201cWhat did you do that worked for you?\u201d Instead, we stick to a method, pray it works, and find out six months later when the state test comes back to discover that a test written by non-educators and politicians says we suck at life. Short answer: regular small assessments over specific material with instant reporting to anyone who has a need to know how the student did.  Thank you for reading.

            "answer_text": "These are two entirely different questions - we purport to measure ability through various IQ tests. Such tests can provide a guidepost as to a student's ability - but it's just a guidepost - it's not definitively accurate. Assignments, tests, projects, papers given in school may - or may not - reflect student's underlying ability. I'd wonder why we're concerned with evaluating ability - school is to evaluate mastery, it attempts to evaluate proficiency and growth - neither of which are to be equated with general ability. There is no single way to evaluate teacher effectiveness - but any attempt to do so would include student surveys - as is commonly done now at the college/university level and for younger students parent surveys would be a part of the process of trying to evaluate teacher effectiveness. Effectiveness is being studied in a vacuum without including surveys from the client base. ",
