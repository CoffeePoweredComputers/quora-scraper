            "answer_text": "Certification and accreditation are recognized by industry well as compared to several diverse non-standard procedures. If a person or an institution is certified it believed that certain norms and standards have been met which provides reliability and high skills.  Example 1 : A lot of universities have Networking courses in curriculum, however it becomes difficuly to judge if those courses meet the high skill set required in industry & hence Networking certifications like CCNA, JNCIA come into picture.  Example 2 : There are thousands of universities across US, how do you judge if a university is genuine or has proper standards ? Accreditation to some bodies would ensure that certain standards have been met. ",
