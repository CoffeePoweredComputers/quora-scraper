            "answer_text": "Arabic is my native language, so I dont know how it feels to learn it as a foreigner, however I've learnt English and in the process of learning french and Korean. Few tips that helps with learning any language includes; Depending on what you want to do with the language can help tailor your learning plan to fit your needs. Are you doing it to understand the religion? If so you need to study classical arabic/ formal arabic. Are you doing it to work abroad? Then you will have to study modern arabic/ general arabic and focus on the dialect of that country ( each country has their own unique dialect. #IamSoSorry).Consistency. Dedicate couple of hours every week to each of the following: speaking, listening, writing and reading (8hrs per week).Travel to an arab country. Or at least practice speaking with native individuals. This is a massive one and I cant stress it enough. Your brain WILL take up the language after few months of constant practice. This is also probably the fastest way. (OR download the HelloTalk app, you can teach someone your native language in an exchange for arabic).If you're young enough you can join arabic schools on weekends. otherwise Qoran schools (if you're Muslim) are also quite useful.Have good reasons to learn the language. If you're doing it for fun that's fine but keep in mind it's immensely difficult. Having goals and motivations helps a lot.Goodluck :) ",
