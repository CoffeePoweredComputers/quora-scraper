            "answer_text": "If you have not yet studied any chapter, it is not possible to cover all NEET syllabus in just 40 days. But it is possible to Crack NEET 2020 in just 40 Days with Seat in Govt. Medical College if You cover those 20 to 30% Syllabus which gives you 80% Result in NEET 2020. Trust me, It is reality that you can score more than 550+ in NEET only after studying those 20% important Topics.After 7 months of research on NEET Past Year Papers with my team, I have found that 80% of NEET questions come from 20% topics. We have completed this research on 80/20 Principle which says 80% of the Result comes from 20% of the effort. Me with my Friend Subhash Gujjar (Physics Faculty) has applied this 80/20 Rule last year in the Physics Most Wanted Series (40 Days - 40 Topics Series). And We have found tremendous result, Total 40 Questions & Concept were asked similar to Physics Most Wanted Series. You will not trust me, but you will trust the given below feedback for Last Year Physics Most Wanted Series.    There are many more such feedback. Let me share a Video of Last Year Physics Most Wanted Series.  If you want to get benefit of this Most Wanted Series (40 Days - 40 Topics) for NEET 2020 for all three Subject of PCB, Then Must Watch the below Video of Subhash Sir  One thing I would like to tell you is that I can give you this strategy here, but I am sure that you will follow that for 2 or 3 days and then you will stop following it. Therefore, It is best to create an environment through The NEET Most Wanted Series, then you will start following it consistently. I hope this will help you to achieve your Goal. \u201cWe have a strategic plan. It\u2019s called doing things.\u201d All the best and keep hustling :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you are a Repeater, you can do it. But if you are a Fresher you can't crack NEET in 1 month. Here's how to crack NEET in 1 Month for Repeaters:\u2014 I hope you are Good in Biology (as many Repeaters are). So you can revise Bio in maximum 10 days if you studied for 16 hrs per day with full concentration. Since your Bio is strong so don't waste much time in Bio.As being a Repeater, you might be Average in Chemistry, so take 1 week for Chemistry. There are total approx 30 chapters in Chemistry. You don't need to prepare all. Just choose 22\u201325 important Chapters and prepare these within 1 week with question practice. I think if you are a Repeater, 1 week is Enough to prepare 22 chapters.Now you have 14 days left. Remaining Subject is Physics. As we all know, almost all NEET aspirants are weak in Physics. But don't worry. Just prepare 10 most important Chapters in just 5 days with full concentration and Practice these while preparing. I think Modern Physics, Electrostatic, Optics and Kinematics will be good choice. As these Chapters are Important and Easy to prepare.Now 9 days are left. It's Enough for your Revision. Utilize these 9 days very carefully because Revision is most Important.For Revision, divide Topics on the basis of your Weakness. Focus more on Weak Topics. Solve MCQs as much as you can. Try to revise all the Tough & Confusing Topics more.6. Make lists of important formulas and important numerical values. 7. Prefer NCERT only for Biology and Chemistry. For Physics, use your Coaching modules and Notes copy. If you will follow the steps which I have given you, I swear no one can stop you from cracking NEET. On following my strategy, you will make 70\u201375 Questions in Bio + 30\u201335 Questions in Chemistry and approx 10 Questions in Physics. This means total 110 to 120 questions which is enough for your Selection. Just be careful about Time Management. Don't waste Time. You need to study 16 hrs per day. I hope this helps you! Good Luck.

Student - Yes yes Ad - Have you started your preparation yet Student - No Ad - Don\u2019t worry we have launched our new machine ( we are the rank producers ) we have hired A+ developers around the globe many scientists were working on it for several years Rank production machine No need of conceptual clarity , No need to start your preparation from class 8\u20139\u201310 ,11 ,12 Now you can crack neet in 1\u20132 days Student - How? Ad - Buy our crashcourse and score 180/180 in physics - many students are even scoring 720/720 in xyz tests series upto rank 1k but for 720 you neet to buy our test series too Do fast 4 , 3, 2 ,1 days remaining sale sale If you don\u2019t have this course you may fail to crack neet Student - Buys the course Student - What is this ? MTG , USS , xyz qb , all questions are copy pasted - Money wasted Can I crack the NEET exam within 40 days? Is it possible? Only when you have studied whole year or Your concepts are clear - In that case you just need to revise them by practicing questions and attempting mock tests And if you are waiting for a magic to happen Then -It\u2019s next to impossible Do you ever thought ? All students including topper have access to same book , module , tests , even ncert Still someone secures AIR 1 while others keep watching their interviews simple answer - Don\u2019t collect too many materials you may get confused also stop following multiple advisers on youtube Many people who are claiming crack neet in one month - they themselves were enrolled into 2\u20135 year classroom coaching Don\u2019t believe just search their name and watch the interview You will get the idea Now the main point behind writing this answer was to make aware of the scam which is running on youtube For every problem - their is a test series -(detailed answer mentioned below) [1] Read this answer too It doesn\u2019t matter you follow me or not Just share this answer - Let\u2019s save people from getting trapped - Footnotes[1] Abhishek's answer to Is it possible to get 720 marks in the NEET 2020 within 2 months?",

            "answer_text": "For the last 40 days before neet you should mainly focus on doing a lot of mcq's. You should solve only mcq\u2019s at this point of time as the time has come when you put your knowledge to test. Then analyse which are the topics you are not able to answer from. Read those topics thoroughly again. Then again solve those questions that you were not able to answer. Write the topics from which you make most of the mistakes and keep revising them. It will not only strengthen your topics but also make a check list prepared for yourself about the topics you have to see before going to exam. Also make a short notebook in which you write all the formulas of physics for quick revision. By doing so , you will not have to go through the entire chapter again and again and it will save your time for solving mcq's. Join a test series and don't miss a single test from it. Analyse your mistakes after every test so that you don't repeat them again. 2 weeks before the exam, you should take full syllabus mock tests. It will prepare you completely for the 3 hrs game and try to complete atleast 3 such tests in a day. These are some of the important chapters from biology that you should focus on- Living world Ecology Cell biology Genetics Plant kingdom Reproduction in plants as well as animals Biomolecules Biotechnology Human physiology For biology mainly focus on NCERT now For physics try solving as many numerical problem as possible. For chemistry focus on both theory and numerical. Since 50% paper comes from biology , so try to make your biology strong. All the best ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends upon what all u have done before that 1 month. See no one can complete a syllabus of 2 years in 1 month. But if you have completed your 11th and 12th sincerely, clearing your basic concepts then u might just be able to do so. The end goal is to crack neet and for that u have to do hard work nothing but pure hard work in that 1 month. U will have to devote 13\u201315 hours a day on preparation. The key to your preparation will be revision. Yes don't waste time on things u haven't studied before. Just focus on what u already know and revise it. Solve previous year's papers of about 10 years. Just Make sure if any question gets repeated u get it right. PLEASE don't join any crash course. U will end up wasting a lot of time learning nothing. U can join test series if u want but please say no to any tution. I am telling u this because I did the same at my time and it was nothing but time wastage and gave me a lot of frustration. Also Don't take too much stress thinking about the time u wasted. Infact just forget everything and give whatever u have to this 1 month. Trust me even if u don't get selected u will still feel satisfied remembering the hard work of that 1 month. So all the best! ",

            "answer_text": "The countdown begins for the end game. The Marvel series of Avenger is going to be run all for 3 hours and 2 minutes. Aren\u2019t you waiting eagerly to know what is kept in store in the grand finale season of Game of Thrones?  April is all packed with Thrones and Superheroes. Herein, concentrating on studies is quite a task in itself. Should I watch my favorite show or prepare for NEET-UG which is 8 days after the release of Avengers? And by the time you get your time out of this, you get the shock of your life about your pending NEET examination. So, before beginning the tricks and tips, the first tip is get away from all the social media accounts like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, (they are powerful to lure you into watching the game of thrones or go for the Marvel end game) But, do ensure your parents don\u2019t cut off the entire internet connection. Because the internet can be useful for other reasons too like for watching NEET online videos and preparation strategies on YouTube and other education apps! So, keeping aside the thought of Avengers and Game of Thrones for a while (for a month per se), let\u2019s get to the hot seat of NEET exam and look out on some tricks which can strengthen your chances of cracking the examination within a months\u2019 time. If you are already studying since some time and worried about what to do in the remaining one month then all you can do is PRACTICE and PRACTICE! However, if you belong to the few who are yet, to begin the study (I hope you are not) then here is a quick crash mantra for cracking NEET 2019. Note: You can crack it only on following your timetable with perseverance without wavering. Day 1 - Spend your first day going through the entire syllabus, and the important topics. List down the topics you are weak at and those which are your strengths. As you have only a month left, going on snail speed can\u2019t be the solution. So perk up and do a good cross-check of each topic. Day 2 to Day 20 From day 2 start your preparation on each topic which you are weak at and go on making notes as you are studying. Amidst this do not forget to revise the topics or chapters that you find easy. Leaving them without revising on the pretext that they can be covered later will only complicate things. So, from here on for continuous 15 to 20 days just do PRACTICE. Read the chapter \u2013 Make notes \u2013 revise previously completed chapters and PRACTICE. Repeat! Refer to online videos and notes Firstly, due to the paucity of time, referring to a myriad of books is unlikely to happen. And thus, zero in on those books that offer precise and concise information. If the book comprises of test series and previous year papers it's much better. Additionally, you can also refer to videos online as watching them can make it much easier in understanding the concepts. Make Cheat notes Okay, so herein 'Cheat Notes' doesn't mean you are to cheat. But making cheat notes wherein you can jot down the important formulae or concepts in language that you can understand is much better. Thus, later during revision you can just pick the note and read through it instead of reading the whole chapter. Refer to previous year papers If there is no way for hard work, it's better to opt for smart work. By smart work, we speak of referring to previous year papers. Past year question papers render a better understanding of which questions and topics were asked frequently. Through this, you can concentrate only on those chapters which carry more weightage based on the previous year question papers and save your precious time. Stay Calm and DO NOT PANIC! All this while, remember not to stress or panic. A calm mind will aid in retaining what you have studied in a much better manner. As necessary is covering the exam, equally important is keeping one\u2019s mind healthy. So sleep well, eat healthily and indulge in some physical exercise like Yoga, Meditation, etc. Count Down \u2013 Last 10 days left! Now that the last 10 days are left, stop starting with newer chapters and concentrate revising the topics which you have already covered. Practice them, again and again, to build your strength in the subject. 1 day before the exam! Just chill and do not touch your books. This will only raise the panic level making you forget what you have already learned. So a day before the exam, keep your book aside, listen to songs or watch a movie. But do not touch your book. Go to the exam with a relaxed and calm mind. If your exam goes well, you can anytime go back and watch Avengers End Game with peace without the fear of ending your NEET-UG test in repentance. All the Best! ",

Cracking it opens the doorways to the top-ranked and the most prestigious medical institutes of India. Yes, you can prepare for NEET in one month. You just need to make a proper strategy and follow it with dedication. This is the most crucial time of your preparation time. This is the time when you can self-evaluate yourself and work on your weaker sections. First of all, make a separate schedule for the month and add meditation to your routine because it will help you very much with your health, as many students go into depression due to lousy schedule and ill health. Further, go through previous year question papers to get to know about the type of questions usually asked in NEET. I\u2019d also recommend you to: 1. Work on weaker areas; don\u2019t let them get the better off of you. 2. Practice as many mock tests as you can, but take breaks in between because we don\u2019t want you snoring off between the exam. 3. Stay positive and confident. 4. Take proper and weather-appropriate diets; stay healthy. 5. Don\u2019t indulge in guesswork at all; it\u2019ll harm you more in reality than it will do an imaginary good. 6. Get all your doubts cleared before the exam. Toppr has a 24x7 doubts on chat facility that could help you. ",

I just you to avoid coaching at this point of time and give more time to yourself. The best thing you can do in a month is Self Study. This will help you a lot in coping up. Now the question is what all is included in self study. The first and the foremost thing make a note of chapters you are not confident about.

Then you will get various videos explaining you the course or important notes. Go through them as they are very beneficial. The best app that will help you is the M LEARNING video streaming app. You can also go through their YouTube channel and if you find the app good for yourself you can go for M LEARNING study materials or M LEARNING study plan.

If you able to do these things you can prepare for neet within a week. All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to take this: 1st are you going to start afresh- i.e you have not studied for past 2 years or you just talking about revision and brushing in the next few days. For the 1st part frankly speaking, its very easy to clear NEET Entrance exam. Cracking NEET 2018 means you are talking bout mere qualifying NEET 2018, which I would suggest you is not a big thing. Because if you see that NEET 2017 qualifying marks at 50 percentile you will find that you require only 131 Marks out of 720. So I can tell you for sure you will be able to qualify NEET 2018.  For the 2nd part we are talking of revision: 1st start by giving mocks and after that analyse you paper properly, get to know exactly what is your weak area and which are your strength. Than start revising your strong area and give extra time to the subjects or topics you are not comfortable at. 2nd in a week try and give 3\u20134 mocks, and give it as if you are writing actual NEET Paper. with the same 3 hour duration and start giving full fledged test. 3rd please do not give mocks only of ALLEN but take other coaching institute mocks also which will give you more holistic approach and let you now exactly where you going wrong. 4th, Start getting confident and do not get disheartened because end of the day those 3 hours will matter on your D DAY. But yes qualifying in NEET will not be an issue for you what is more important is the kind of college you are looking forward for in NEET. Are you just planning to just qualify or at the same time looking forward for a top colleges in INDIA. Because its just not about getting a medical seat but a lot about whether you are looking for Government Medical Colleges, Private Medical college or Deemed University.

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by crack NEET in a month? If it is qualifying in NEET then yes it is possible with one month\u2019s preparation. Since you need about 150 marks out of 720 to qualify. All you need to do is score enough to be in the top 5 lakh or so students out of the 10 lakh who write the exam. If you want to be in the top 5000 ranks in the country then it is more difficult unless you have studied exceedingly well for the board exams. Revised at least 10 times for each subject and understood all concepts and know your bio and chem like the back of your hand and now you have to concentrate on solving thousands of mcqs before the exam. solve previous year papers and so on. You get a rank in top 5000 if you have scored 518 or above out of 720. If you want to get a seat in top 3000 of your state also the same rule as the above applies. You need to score around 480 to 500 probably. depends on the level of competition in your state. ",

Give more stress to previous years papers and mock test papers. Solve limited good quality MCQs from MTG books if you don't have Coaching modules. Don't waste time by writing unnecessary stuff, watching topper interviews, have faith in your dream. And March forward towards it. Set a target daily and crush it. If you have joined any test series then practice the test paper once again after the test. Solve Previous JEE previous years questions of at least 10 years,to get total mastery over the topic. Don't panic just study, do your best. If you are stressed then you are in the path to get success. Just don't get saturated. Work hard honestly with proper planning.

But the fact is, NEET is secret which is solved by many hardworking students every year. And, with every passing year new experiences are been shared towards more efficient preparation of NEET. Students really have to understand that SUCCESS in NEET is not an overnight story. It\u2019s a 2 years long journey which starts from 11th standard itself. It\u2019s a dream which is seen from childhood. Don\u2019t just make this dream a joke. It\u2019s a roller coaster journey of emotions, hard-work, expectations, fears and courage. Fears of not doing well and courage of overcoming those fears. The happiness that one aspirant gets after clearing entrance exam, only he can know it. Others can just estimate the level of satisfaction. Be serious from first day itself. Don\u2019t think what could happen in 1 year, 1 month or 1 day. Follow NCERT as your standard textbooks. Refer to as minimum books as possible. Different book have different answers and concepts. Continue with your preparation and be confident. Thank you! ",

Assuming you are appearing for your board exams too and you will have around 40 odd days to NEET after the exam Don't delve into a topic you have not touched before. Revise the topics properly on which you have command and practice the question sets that you have already done before , that won't take that much of time considering you have solved the questions properly the first time. Then take out your previous test papers and analyse it well to know where you do a lot of mistakes. Then appear for Aits of any institute and after taking the tests analyse it.take atleast 8\u20139 Aits to know where you stand among the mass.. And 1 day before the exam don't study .Go and watch a movie or so. On 5th May exhaust yourself the whole day wandering here and there ,so that you will have a nice sleep at night. Then on D day just have confidence that you can do it and give it a best shot. Rest leave on God .You will be taken care of as labour never goes in vain. All the best! ",

So the best strategy to crack the NEET that too in 40 days is in choosing a college from the type of MBBS options and working towards that. Consider this scenario for example: if you want to reach Delhi from Mumbai and if time is important for You, you will choose the air travel instead of train. Likewise, if your priority is learning new knowledge and skills instead of repeating the same subject again. So you can choose the type of college where you can do MBBS based on the projected NEET cut-off and you can crack that score in 40 days.  When affordability is the issue, prepare in advance and 40 days will not be sufficient to crack the score for government and AIQ colleges ",

You may think I\u2019m kidding, but gotta believe this moron after you analyse a bunch of scribbling I\u2019m about to do\u2026 firstly, I had appeared last year, but didn't qualify with flying colors and so gonna sit this time again.. and if any brain has to say why to believe a guy who couldn\u2019t qualify himself, Huh.. you have a good argument man! there\u2019s no failure, rather more experience and maturity! and one most important one, For NEET exam, there are few things that are equally important just like the ingredients of Tea.. if even one is missing you wont have something called Tea, similarly, patience, hardwork, knowledge, being away from distractions, memorising and confidence are important EQUALLY for qualifying NEET. To be honest, you don\u2019t need to read all these with popped up eyes or an open mouth as if some kinds of secrets im here to reveal, but its just simple analysis which most of time we do without using our cerebrum! So, for inorganic chemistry, certain portion are pure memory based, have them listed down to mug up doing daily chores. It requires question solving, since this will give you the idea of how question is derived. Read the chapter notes thoroughly once a week. for organic chemistry, analyse different segments it has; don't be depressed by the storm of reactions, because there isn't any such thing so! Yeah! Let me clarify it: the total reactions are just a quarter of what you see! Coz preparation reaction of alochol from caroboxylic acid is nothing but the chemical reaction of carboxylic acid! So this way, reactions are simply repeated frequently! Also, to be able to do questions better, catch the concepts. Eg. Grignard reagents give alkyl group but with -ve sign, i.e nucleophile. This will make solving questions easier. So have a list of reagents & their way of acting. memorise physical chemistry and physics formulae and know the chp concepts. This requires nothing but practicing! Biology is all time job. Requires NCERT reading as a must plus question practice. What are you doing? Studying physics or chemistry? No Eating, sleeping, refreshing or any urgent work? No That means you are studying biology! will i be able to finish ALL the chps and will i be able to retain them?? never think about this at this high time\u2026 well the answer is NO, neither will you finish them all, nor will you remember them.. satisfied?! Dear, the truth is.. it doesn\u2019t matter.. but what matters is.. has these thoughts put a full stop to your studies or you still continue? coz if you do, Insha Allah you\u2019ll see victory either today or tomorrow.. but if this thinking is enough to stop you, there\u2019s a sure stamped failure destined! as it isn\u2019t just you on this planet who has this feeling, its millions out there freaking with the same issue.. wanna join them or shine out of them is what you decide today! best of luck ;) ",

How to prepare for NEET with Board exams ? How to prepare for NEET with Board exams is a common question which many aspirants have in their mind. Here is a tried and tested NEET preparation strategy along with Board exams. Gradually focus more on NEET Preparation: Initially, you will be able to balance your school and your coaching but gradually, you might find yourself unable to cope up with all of school, NEET coaching and NEET preparation at home.

But, it's only for passing, not to get admission in AIIMS. Do u think, that passing marks are enough for you. If I were you, for me it's not enough. Passing marks bhi tabhi aate hainn, jab concepts clear hote hainn. So, Try to clear all your concepts without any doubt left. Sometimes, miracle happens, what if you got selected in one month preparation. Miracle happens only when you study hard and smart. So, Practice NEET in a smart manner. Stay Focused and prepare well.

In one month, you can just do revision nothing else. If you have good concept of physics and chemistry, you can do it. So I suggest you to revise NCERT Biology as much as you can. Solve previous years papers of NEET. You'll definitely get good marks. If you belongs to any category, may be you'll get seat in MBBS ",

            "answer_text": "Solve the papers\u2026.. Paper solving is the most crucial part of any entrance exam preparation whether you are preparing for medical entrance exam , engineering entrance exam or any civil services exam . If you have avoided paper solving you won't be able to score best according to your knowledge . Let's take a basic example that you are preparing for marathon for that you need extreme amount of energy and stamina . Energy can be stored through food consumption but for stamina you must run and practice for the same distance. Reading is like eating but solving papers on regular basis builds your stamina . So whether you are preparing for medical , engineering or any civil entrance exam , you must solve the previous years paper on regular basis to develop similar level of mental stamina to perform exceptionally well in entrance exam. Here are the few benefits of solving previous years papers on regular basis 1) Solving a complete 3 hours paper build your mental stamina for the main exam. 2) If you are a dropper student or reattempting any exam , solving paper help you to revise complete syllabus as most of the competition exams cover whole syllabus through a paper 3) Solving a 3 hour paper on regular basis enables you to improve your study hours and stamina for main exam 4) solving papers on regular basis decrease chances of silly mistakes in main exam , silly mistakes can be improved through regular practice only , most of the students who create silly mistakes in paper are who those don't solve enough papers during their preparation journey 5) solving papers make easier for you to find out your weakness , if you are struggling on same chapter's question again and again then you must revise and learn that topic again 6) Most of the Pre-medical aspirants are comfortable with biology but not with chemistry and physics so they feel little awkward to solve full syllabus paper . Even in this case you must solve biology full syllabus Paper but in case of chemistry and physics you can go through chapter wise previous year papers. 7) Having vast experience in teaching to premedical aspirants , i feel that most of the pmt aspirants should solve previous years papers of Kerala PMT , Karnataka CET , AIPMT , JEE mains and AIIMS . These exams contains most of the conceptual problems which are NCERT based too Thank you ",

In the limited time left, this is what you should do: Practice previous year questions many times..Appear for a test series and analyse it properly (Giving 2\u20133 hours)Revise your notes multiple times till they enter your soul :)Find your strong points and chapters, work on them..Solve other people\u2019s doubts.

Also, I recommend all my students to practice Sudarshan Kriya of the Art of Living. It gives you very good clarity of mind and keeps you focused in exams.

            "answer_text": "**Below are a few tips provided on how to crack NEET** Download past few years' papers of AIPMT and see the pattern. By now you must be aware of the concepts and now need to focus on practicing the problems (like conceptual/numerical questions in Physics). For Biology and Chemistry, read from NCERT books Join a crash course (if possible), where you will learn about the important NEET topics and you can clear your doubts using a professional help For those studying on their own, in last couple of weeks before the exam, focus on revision As the exam is more Biology centric, you must allot at least 2 weeks to it for proper revision and one week each for Physics and Chemistry While you prepare, create notes formula sheet for Physics, footnotes carrying important keywords for Biology and equations sheet for Chemistry, you can then solve papers and mock test in the remaining days of your revision. Mock test will help you assess the level of your preparation and will give you a better understanding the exam In the end, just go through all the key words you've noted previously so as to revise every concept as quickly as possible. Remember keep the last day of preparation light yet productive. **The important chapters of each subject ** **Physics: **Oscillations and Waves, Magnetic Effect of Current and Magnetism, Kinematics, Heat and Thermodynamics, Electrostatics and Current Electricity. **Chemistry: **Organic Chemistry (IUPAC nomenclature is a key type of question), Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure, Coordination Compounds, p-block elements, Equilibrium, Biomolecules, Aldehydes Ketones Carboxylic Acids, Alcohol Phenol Ether and Chemical Kinetics. **Biology: **The Living World, Biological Classification, Chemical Control and Integration, Principles of Inheritance And Variation, Molecular Basis of Inheritance, Cell and Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants.

First of all prepare formula cards and reaction cards for physics and chemistry, And stick all the cards in Ur study room, near your television, near Ur basin( where u brush Ur teeth), in the toilet. This would save your every second. Where ever you will turn your head, \u201c books are already opened, and will save Ur time from opening books, roming and searching for it. Now make a decent time table you could follow, In which sleeping time should be only five hours a day. And rest of the time should be utilised in studying only. Morning time- for learning and mugging Rest of the time for practice and solving problems. Thank u Good luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "Solve the papers\u2026.. Paper solving is the most crucial part of any entrance exam preparation whether you are preparing for medical entrance exam , engineering entrance exam or any civil services exam . If you have avoided paper solving you won't be able to score best according to your knowledge . Let's take a basic example that you are preparing for marathon for that you need extreme amount of energy and stamina . Energy can be stored through food consumption but for stamina you must run and practice for the same distance. Reading is like eating but solving papers on regular basis builds your stamina . So whether you are preparing for medical , engineering or any civil entrance exam , you must solve the previous years paper on regular basis to develop similar level of mental stamina to perform exceptionally well in entrance exam. Here are the few benefits of solving previous years papers on regular basis 1) Solving a complete 3 hours paper build your mental stamina for the main exam. 2) If you are a dropper student or reattempting any exam , solving paper help you to revise complete syllabus as most of the competition exams cover whole syllabus through a paper 3) Solving a 3 hour paper on regular basis enables you to improve your study hours and stamina for main exam 4) solving papers on regular basis decrease chances of silly mistakes in main exam , silly mistakes can be improved through regular practice only , most of the students who create silly mistakes in paper are who those don't solve enough papers during their preparation journey 5) solving papers make easier for you to find out your weakness , if you are struggling on same chapter's question again and again then you must revise and learn that topic again 6) Most of the Pre-medical aspirants are comfortable with biology but not with chemistry and physics so they feel little awkward to solve full syllabus paper . Even in this case you must solve biology full syllabus Paper but in case of chemistry and physics you can go through chapter wise previous year papers. 7) Having vast experience in teaching to premedical aspirants , i feel that most of the pmt aspirants should solve previous years papers of Kerala PMT , Karnataka CET , AIPMT , JEE mains and AIIMS . These exams contains most of the conceptual problems which are NCERT based too although for an exam like NEET early preparation is always worthwhile. Anyway all the best for your exams. ",

Since you have limited time, I would recommend you to devote maximum attention to the topics you're familiar with and try polishing and perfecting those topics. Also I will also refrain you from going for the highly expensive stress building crash courses or go for the books which require a lot of time commitment. Devote your time towards mastering what you're familiar. As an effective and efficient alternative you can go for an online medium offering the advantage of convenience and choice of selecting the topics as per your preference. They offer online lectures ,quality study material and practice test series making studies easier for students. For a better preparation, I would recommend you to check out M learning India YouTube channel. They offer online lectures and study materials prepared by experienced faculty. Also download the M learning application from the app store which offers the advantage of preparing your study schedule , gives an access to the study materials and online lectures. Best of luck!!

If you joined the best course crash course, but you have not prepared anything before, then, of course, it won't help you. Please Take A Pause and Think for A Second that What Does Best Mean? There will be only Generic Definitions which will come in your mind. So let's focus on what do you need? 1st type of students who started studying from zero now, then you will waste money by joining crash courses. 2nd type of student who studied hard but few parts remain weak. Then a crash course will help you a lot. 3rd type of students who studied but are nervous about exams, syllabus, and revision, then a crash course will help you to be exam ready. Crash courses are launched to support students quickly cover the syllabus and be exam ready in limited time. It means the faculty will quickly cover all. So you have to work diligently with your teacher to grasp all concepts rapidly. ",

You need to begin the preparation from the very beginning of your +2, so that you have enough time for learning and understanding the concepts of each and every topic. The last month preparation that you are planning for, should be for solving previous years\u2019 question papers prioritizing those questions or concepts that have repeatedly appeared, brushing up the formulas and facts, making a list of the areas of your weaknesses( specific topics) and rather than keeping those aside try to cover them up as much as possible. There\u2019s also a very important thing that many are negligent of, and that\u2019s time- you need to manage your time when you are solving sample papers. When you are writing your exam, your brain is not just racing with calculations and thoughts but also with time. So staying composed and steady is crucial too. Hope that helps, Thanks. ",

Limit your sleep to 6hrs per day. Eat healthy but limited. Work hard, but smartly. Best of luck!

Aspirants who are preparing for the examination would also be looking to score more in their board exams. As you mentioned your examination is ending on April 29, all you need to do is to focus on what you need to read for both of the examination. Figure out the common topics that you have to study both for your board exams and NEET. Give preference to what you study in Biology, because the most number of question are going to be from what you read in your Biology classes. There is no reason to feel depressed and loose hope, because just like you there are lakhs of students who are fighting for striking a balance between the two exams as well. All you need to do is to make a proper routine and start studying for the exams. Curtail your free time for a while and focus on what you have to deliver at the end of the examination. Best of Luck.

The crash course is only meant as a quick revision for those who have already covered the syllabus and have all their basics covered. It is never meant to be a substitute for the long-term preparations. I hope this answers your question. ",

However, I would like to recommend one more approach. There is a new App in the market, where you can register and take NEET challenges. NEET challenges in this App are timed NEET exams, which are taken by many Students on the same day and at the same time. So, you will be getting the feel of a real NEET exam when you take these NEET challenges. The best part is once you submit the exam, will come to know your score within a short period of time after you submit your NEET challenge, you can also gauge yourself and you can also gauge where you stand in the competition among your peers.
