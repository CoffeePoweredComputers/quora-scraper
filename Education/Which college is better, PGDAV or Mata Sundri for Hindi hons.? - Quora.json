            "answer_text": "I believe I can answer this question better as I did Hindi honors from PGDAV (DU). Teachers are really good and supportive if you want to learn really something they are always ready to help you out. College is also very good just stay away from politics and it will just waste your time if you are going there to study as you may be approached by someone to help in their campaigning so they can win elections sometimes due to this you have to leave your lectures . So just keep this in mind and focus on your study and PGDAV is good college with good teachers, a bigger ground and college canteen etc. ",
