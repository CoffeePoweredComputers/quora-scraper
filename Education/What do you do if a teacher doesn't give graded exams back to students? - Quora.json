            "answer_text": "Find out why it is not returned as it may be because someone or several have not sat for the test or, there is evidence of cheating or worse, a faulty question. In schools, in Australia, many if not all state or country wide tests are not returned as this allows questions to be reused to see if over time performance for a given age group is getting better or worse. It helps prevent grade inflation. Ask your teacher and they should give a reason as above. Faulty questions do occur. We had a statewide question with three correct answers. Apparently the question should have read which of the following is NOT equal to and the not was left out. So the three incorrect responses became correct responses. Oops! Hence the paper was released later with the original question changed but student answers had already been destroyed. As schools can\u2019t mark their own students to avoid cheating, imagine returning marked papers to their correct schools. We have nearly 800 high schools alone in our state, imagine the numbers involved when you do all states and all levels of schooling ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what type of test it is that you want back. If you are in high school and it is a state mandated standardized test, given to assess how students in a specific grade level are doing, then you'll get a report, usually with a summary of what your score was in specific areas. However you won't get the test back. If it is an end of term test, you may have to wait until after the term is over and all students have been assessed. It is also possible that you will not be given the test if the questions are going to be reused. In AP History, Political Science, and Economics the practice has been to give you a score, but not return the test. So you may be out of luck if you are expecting the tests, cited in the paragraph above, to be returned. However if you are taking quizzes, end of unit tests, or other assessments that are specific to the class you're taking, you should get the graded test back in a reasonable amount of time. In college and university, the speed with which exams are returned is notably quicker. In the setting of higher education, teaching assistants may help the professor or instructor grade the exams. If you are in grade school, middle school, or high school and not getting graded exams returned, make a formal request of the teacher. If there is still a problem enlist the aid of your parents and have them speak with an administrator. Just remember that everybody has to take the test or exam before any can be returned. ",
