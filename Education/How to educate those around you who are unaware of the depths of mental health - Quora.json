            "answer_text": "Oh this is such a good question! Honestly it\u2019s hard to educate people, not because it\u2019s something difficult to help someone understand the depths of mental health, but because people don\u2019t ask for more understanding. This is something very frustrating for me as I suffer from depression and anxiety and my twin brother, although he loves and cares about me, has no idea what it\u2019s like and doesn\u2019t ask me any questions that he has, or challenge stereotypes he thinks is true. So my advice would be to first, open the floor to questions. Tell whoever u want to learn more about mental health that they can and should ask you if they need help understanding something. Second, come up with examples of situations where something has affected your mental health or someone else\u2019s that can convey what it\u2019s like. Journal I find that for myself, keeping a log of my emotions and well being helps me remember specific examples of how my mental health has affected me, and also works for tracking how I\u2019m doing and what triggers my depression. For this I use an app called Daylio which I highly suggest. Outside Sources Something that really helps me when I\u2019m depressed or having a panic attack is to watch ted talks of people who have struggled with mental health or who are trained professionals. These videos and other articles or websites could also help friends or family understand what you are going through, maybe better than anything that you could say to them. I will leave some links at the bottom for those who want it. Artwork As someone who loves drawing, painting, and the arts in general, I find that this is a great way of expressing how you feel. Art is something that brings an understanding that words can\u2019t, and believe me I\u2019m not the first to have figured this out. Loads of people have created artwork, creative writing pieces, dance routines, etc. that express what mental illness is like and could be a great resource for education for the depths of mental health I hope this helps, and here are some links to videos that have helped me:        ",

Does this person feel career criminals couldn\u2019t be suffering from a psychosis and they\u2019re capable of standing trial and innocence by reason of insanity is off the table? I\u2019m a former psych nurse. I taught psych. It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around the thought of thousands or millions of criminals being incarcerated without any hope of getting out while the system lets them suffer behind prison doors. I can\u2019t offer you much guidance because people who are irrational about the plight of the mentally ill just blow me away. If you feel strongly about this, appeal to their sense of reason. Jeffery Dahmer was NOT a sane man, nor was Charles Manson. I wish you luck. ",

I've learned this the hard way, over many years of trying to get several family members to understand. Some just don't want to understand and I've had to (grudgingly) accept that and limit their presence in my life. If the people around you want to understand, explaining it is easy. Start with the facts, such as what's causing a particular mental health issue, then work your way up to explaining your personal experiences and perceptions. Then ask if they have any questions. For example, when I'm explaining my anxiety to someone who wants to understand, I'll say, \u201cmy brain processes stress more strongly than it should. Something that shouldn't be threatening at all is often perceived as a major threat to my safety and my adrenaline kicks into overtime, which makes me react like I'm being chased by a chainsaw-wielding serial killer. Do you have any questions?\u201d ",

I compared my mental illness/abnormal brain chemistry to my diabetes. I pointed out to her that I can\u2019t control either and take meds for both. If my sugar had dropped and I ended up in a coma and in the hospital would she blame me or tell me to \u201csnap out of it\u201d and she said no. She has accepted my mental illness symptoms and is much more understanding now. Thanks for asking. ",

Ask them to read them. Tell then after they have read them, if they want, they can ask you questions.Also, having a family therapy session with your psychiatrist or psychologist can help. I did this with my psychologist, my mum and my son. My mum knew 'everything about depression because she had one depressive episode years ago. But my psychologist set her straight. Explained words that are hurtful for me and don't help. It made a big difference to my mums understanding of why I couldn't just get up and do things. ",

I am curious about how this impacts on you as I guess this someone is important to you and if you have a mental health issue, them not believing you have this must be distressing? Do they believe in physical health problems? I don't know how you could educate someone who is so resistant or closed off to this. I would suggest you consider using a phrase such as \u2018 when you say you don't believe in mental health issues I feel\u2026\u2026.\u2019 and think about how you feel is it sad, angry, dismissed, distressed, fear? Rather than try to educate them let them know how they impact on you which is a more powerful intervention. I hope this helps. ",
