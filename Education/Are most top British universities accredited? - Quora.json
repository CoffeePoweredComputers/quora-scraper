            "answer_text": "In what regard? They are accredited as universities, yes. Schools which are not accredited as universities offer degrees which are awarded by an accredited university however these schools are not universities themselves and cannot call themselves as such. For subject accreditations, usually yes however there are some exceptions. For example new courses usually can\u2019t be accredited until the first cohort has completed their studies. Also for Biomedical Science the situation is a bit more complicated. Accreditation for Biomedical degrees denotes the suitability for being a Biomedical Scientist in the NHS, but fulfilling this accreditation means the university has to cut out a lot of content for e.g. research and pharmaceutical development, and so many top universities do not have subject accreditation for their Biomedical Science degree.
