            "answer_text": "Thank you Ahmed for your question. I too am fascinated by this thought but I am afraid I do not have a clue. I look at all the young teachers in the classroom. They have skills that I did not have at their age. I think the internet has allowed them to find answers to problems that I had to solve in a haphazard way back in the day!!! Computers have revolutionized the classroom. So many innovations such as flipped classrooms and elearning. However, I think the results are not as good as the founders expected. Everything works with motivated students, but few ideas work for the majority of students. I remember many years ago in a staff meeting our administration was talking about the push to have master teachers\u2026.one teacher leading a class of 200 (more now that the internet is here) and 4\u20135 assistants to work with the students when the teacher is off teaching another group of students. Well, that is common in university but I have never seen it in a regular classroom. If you have ever been in an auditorium where you have a few hundred elementary students sitting in a group, you will see a presenter and every single teacher in that room. They are always watching their own group of students and making sure there are no pokes and shoves and phone watching. Really\u2026.kids are kids not passive receptacles of knowledge ready to have their heads filled with all that wisdom. The best teaching involves a passionate teacher with a group of students who are engaged. I do not think the old model will ever be replaced soon. However, I do not have a crystal ball to tell me when the next great invention will be that will revolutionize our society. And of course, if there is ever a Black Swan event such as a nuclear war or zombie invasion \u2026well\u2026that is an answer to a whole different scenario. Thank you for the question Ahmed. ",
