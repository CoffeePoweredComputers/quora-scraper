            "answer_text": "I WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU GUYS A ROUGH IDEA OF PREPARING ORGANIC. BEFORE WE BEGIN TO APPROACH CLASS 12TH ORGANIC CHEMISTRY WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE FOLLOWING -Organic chemistry is entirely logical !NCERT will do the job PERFECTLY ! Yes , there is no need of OP Tandon,Pradeep etcetera.In Board Exam all the questions are from NCERT For Organic . There is on exception this year in ALL INDIA set one of the conversions in the 5 Marks Question was out of the bookIt requires A LOT OF CONCENTRATION because it is TRICKYAPPROACH :- Breakdown the entire organic into - IUPAC NamingName ReactionsCONVERSIONS (Imp)Distinguish TestsMechanismsReasoning Based QuestionsLet's not be vague with * Understand the concepts * and do something that would really fetch you marks ! If right now your summer breaks are on please hurry up and start understanding how to name a particular compound . What are the essential rules to name a particular compound\u2026the groups ..their priority table\u2026prefix suffix..use of bis/tris etcetera . For this part ( IUPAC) ReferCLASS 11TH NCERT BOOKWatch videos on YOUTUBE for IUPAC Naming. There are few really helpul videos that give some tricks and tips to decrypt the IUPACTHIS particular part is very tricky as well as time taking but SUPER IMPORTANT . Actually IUPAC will give you only 2 Marks in Boards (Directly) but 16 Marks Indirectly because entire organic is all about carbon compounds if you dont know what is the difference between Aldehyde and Ketone there is no point in studying organic so gear upSPEND ATLEAST 2 WEEKS SOLVING CLASS 12TH INTEXT AND EXERCISE QUESTIONS AS WELL OR ELSE EVEN AN YEAR WILL FALL SHORT ! SO DO EACH QUESTION TWICE THRICE BUT DO IT ITS IMPORTANT ! VERY VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANTNext basic thing you need to do is understand effects likeResonance Effect(+R,-R)Inductive Effect(+I ,-I)HyperconjugationElectromeric EffectStability of any compoundElectronegativity of compoundAcidity and Basicity of CompoundsWhat is the concept of Double Bond Equivalent ?IsomerismWhat is the meaning of iso-,sec-,tert- etc or bis and tris where to use them etc ?Electrophiles,Nucleophiles what are they ?What is an alpha carbon ?What characterizes that ELIMINATION OR DISPROPORTIONATION REACTION Etcetera ?Lewis Acids,Bases ,Bronsted bases and acids etcetera.What is pH ,Ka ,pKa etcetera.THE ABOVE LISTED EFFECTS AND PHENOMENON ARE VERY IMPORTANT SO YOU HAVE TO REFER CLASS XI NCERT FOR THESE,BUT MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THEM,THEIR EFFECTS ON STABILITY , ACIDITY,REACTIONS AND WHAT NOT ! You have to master the above ones ATLEAST ! Reasons are :- They are mentioned in every second paragraph of Class 12h NCERT.All the reasoning questions almost are based on theseThey are elementary steps to understand ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.NAME REACTIONS :- For those of you who do not know what are name reactions , these are reactions with perhaps the names of scientists who first performed it or discovered. Like - Aldol Reaction,Wurtz Reaction,Hell Volhard Zelinsky Reaction (HVZ) Etcetera. What you have to do is Learn all the 28 Reactions with the reactant..the CATALYST and the END PRODUCT ! For your convenience write each reaction 10 times atleast.You must know that whatever REAGENT you put on the arrow the consequences are different for each.For eg : Dil NaOH and Conc NaOH mean two different reactions (Aldol and Cannizaro ) respectively. [Although presence of alpha carbon is an indicator] anyways so you must under stand that REAGENTS ARE VERY VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR CONVERSIONS !Important- Always learn a Name Reaction keeping in mind that you will get it in indirect form ( In the form of a CONVERSION or Fill in the blanks or Distinguish Test or Word Problem ) so learn it by heart all of you !Distinguish Tests - Well these questions are of the type like - Distinguish between the following Propanol and Isopropyl Alcohol .Remember most of them are based on Iodoform reaction , tollens test,fehling test, but its not always these three so you have to by heart learn most of the reactions , understand the implications of using a particular reagent,and how contrasting two compounds and there properties are. On the basis of these you will be able to solve these questions ! PRACTICE IS THE KEY TO UNDERSTAND AND SOLVE THE QUESTIONS !Conversions- Afraid right ? Well i can understand . Conversions test your knowledge aboutName ReactionsOther Reactions Which Under The Heading Preparation of CompoundsUse of catalysts / promoters / poisonsHalogenating ReagentsOxidizing Agents (Mild/Strong)Reducing Agents(Mild/Strong)Friedal Crafts Reaction (Alkylation/Acylation/Benzoylation)EsterificationAldol Reaction (Important)Your knowledge about resonance and other effects etcetera.Remember each conversion takes not more than 3 steps (max)so it is good to make three Arrows with initial compound and final compound and now you have to use the above 10 wisely to convert initial into final. I cannot give you tuitions but I guess this will help. Please just try to be thorough with above 10 things and use them wellPLEASE DON NOT BE AFRAID REMEMBER CONVERSIONS ARE MOST CHALLENGING BE STRONG AND ACT SMART . 3 STEPS AND ABOVE 10 . THAT'S IT (LOOK FOR EXCEPTIONS)Mechanisms - Look I would suggest try to understand them . Okay ? Please do they are all based on the basic effects and phenomenon I asked above to understand just do them . Okay the ABOVE MENTIONED BASIC EFFECTS THAT'S IT.If you're facing difficulties try to understand them let them take your time but please, Do them they are very important.If you're still facing difficulties since you cannot leave them. Ummm sorry but mug \u2018em upReasoning Based Question : Purely based on the above mention basic effects and the textbook . So be selective and smart while reading .To understand and spot what is important and what not ! READ THE QUESTIONS OF THE EXERCISES FIRST AND THEN THE TEXTBOOK. UNDERLINE WHATEVER IS IMPORTANT FROM THE QUESTIONS\u2019 POINT OF VIEW AND YOUR JOB IS DONE.That's how you approach your Class 12th Organic Chemistry for Board Examinations specifically . PS:- I have considered word problems too as conversions best of luck Edit 1- Thankyou everyone for the 100 upvotes ! ",

            "answer_text": "In Organic Chemistry, it is important to understand why and how a particular reaction takes place. Memorizing reactions won't help. Go one chapter at a time. Every chapter may have numerous reactions. Try and understand how each reaction takes place, e.g. if there's a nucleophile that attacks, read the chemistry behind it. This will make not just understanding easier but will also help you remember the mechanisms without having to put in specific efforts. Make flow sheets of the reactions and their mechanisms: like Aldol Condensation or Polymerization using Zeigler Natta, etc. Put up the flowsheets on boards or around your study area so that you can have a look at them simply while you pass by. It really helps! Another important aspect is knowing the uses of certain products formed. For e.g. say, uses of CCl4. While you're studying uses of just one product, it may seem easy. But when there are too many to remember, it becomes difficult. So hit the Internet and read about these compounds. Find examples that you will he able to relate to, from everyday life. That will make learning very simple and enjoyable. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "See, Organic chemistry is not like other two(physical and inorganic chemistry),that you can simply learn it and memorize it or can solve the numericals. You have to first understand the reactions then try to memorize them. As there are so many reactions so you can\u2019t simply learn them because it is very difficult to keep memorize them. Class 11th concepts should be clear. Chemical bonding concepts,mesomeric effects,inductive effects and isomers play a major role in comparison between reactions. You should know about carbocation, carboanion and free radicles. Concepts of hyperconjugation and resonance should be clear. Hia, there are some tricks which you can use to learn them. 12th Ncert of organic chemistry is enough for that. Don\u2019t be confuse between other study materials. Last 3 chapters polymers,Biomolecules and chemistry in everdaylife are very easy. So you can simply learn them. These chapters are also scoring chapters. Jee mains contains 3\u20134 questions every year of these 3 chapters. Conclusion- concepts should be clear. ",

I will state a funny fact that even if dont revise whole of organic from ncert and revise only the notebook that ive stated your will easily score 90 percent. now for the coversions again revise your notebook and also youve to have a copy of all ncert coversions along with their solutions just attempt them and re revise them again and again . THE WHOLE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL HARDLY TAKE 1 MONTH IF YOU DEVOTE ONLY 2 HRS DAILY AND PROVIDED YOU ARE SINCERE regards ashish BTW I GOT 88 IN CBSE 2018 CHEM BECOZ I LEFT SOME PORTIONS OF INORGANIC CHEM BUT I SCORED FULL IN THE OTHER 2.

            "answer_text": "Please don't memorise. There are two ways- Knowing mechanisms, understanding electrophile and nucleophiles. This can ease the pain of organic reaction.There is another way I have seen some of my student do it. We develop this way for our classes which involves a concept called \u201cFeelchemistry\u201d. They do it by feel which ebables them to learn. It's not universal but it works very well to a large periphery of organic reaction. I would suggest you a old school method which will definitely work. Write all reaction while you study. It has much to do with retention. Definitely you will succeed. Organic chemistry is about doing not reading. If you keep on writing it will improve. Special emphasos to named reactions. Best of luck.",
