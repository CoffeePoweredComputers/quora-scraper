            "answer_text": "As I look back at my high school experience, here are 13 best things about high school\u2014that happened to me, personally:  (Me taking pictures of my friend\u2019s back during our Graduation trip. See #4.) 1) Graduating from high school. I know some people are like, \u201cGOODBYE HIGH SCHOOL. GOODBYE I DON\u2019T MISS YOU.\u201d Once people get their diplomas, some are happy that they don\u2019t have to come back to the school that was once called a shithole. 2) B*tching about high school. Once you graduate high school, b*tch, rant and vent all you want how shitty, amazing, or neutral your high school experience is. It just feels great to rant. Kind of therapeutic. 3) Making friendships that last forever. I have met many new friends throughout high school. Certain friendships come and go and some last forever, and some do not. 4) High school trips. I love high school trips. Although we may skip class for a day and go somewhere, it feels great. I remembered having a bunch of school trips, such as Graduation trip, grade 7 snow trips, visiting religious places for Ethics, Religious and Culture class, school sleepovers, ah so many to remember! 5) Participating in school extracurriculars. I joined the Student Council, the Yearbook committee and occasionally D&D club. I think that was the best choices made. Social interaction, yeah! 6) Less homework or no at all. Ah, just for one class, no homework? Right on! 7) Winning in class/friends debates. That great feeling when you win an argument\u2026 ah. 8) Class group pictures. Memories that last forever\u2026 on photo.  (My graduation trip group shot.) 9) Senior pranks. Didn\u2019t apply much to my school, because my graduating class failed it but senior pranks are memorable. 10) Revolting against the authorities. I used to do a petition about how unfair our lab exam times were and made 100 high school students in my grade and sign it. 11) Getting good grades. Good grades mean a high average. 12) The high school experience. Whether it be meeting your boyfriend/girlfriend, making new friends or being the top\u2014the high school experience makes it the best. 13) Goofy pictures with friends. Ah, half of my gallery photos are times spent with friends\u2026 or even sending secret pictures of each other.  (Me taking secret shots of my friend, Jeff.) Cheers,\u2014Britney Vu \u2665\ufe0e Images: My photo gallery. ",

            "answer_text": "      The one thing that I learned from high school was something that came to me many years later after graduation. It was something that was not realized in school(I wish it would have been); it was the idea of how your schooling would change at this time.         In all of the previous years of my formal education like anyone else I saw learning as that through the text book. This continued for many years from the time one entered school to that of high school. It was at this point of ones education that things would change for us all. Once one entered the high school it appeared that you learning of new things went from the textbook to that of actual experiences within the building where one attended school. In his realm of learning there was mass educational experiences to be done. There was still the book knowledge,but, it was fading out with each year that passed by you. Upon graduation year/day one was learning more from actually doing than that of books. The textbook was still present in ones life, at this point,but, it became more as reference than anything else in ones schooling, at this time.         I wish that this was understood by me when in high school, than many years later. For if it were known by thyself, schooling for me would have been better and more enjoyed than that which it was. I learned much in schooling at this time,still it could have been better, much better. I think for me it would have been a happy time. What I mean by this is the ideas of going to Friday night football games, Prom nights,Parties with students for fun, and so on. Instead, there was still in me this need to study and work at all my subjects, constantly.  In this sense the schooling that I created was one where I lost out on many things that made the high school experience what it is suppose to be and not what I thought it to be. Now I am stuck getting caught up on what should have been done years ago. What a bummer! My social interaction is better these days,yet, it still has a ways to go. I hope it gets up to others my age. It was just recently I attended a Mardi Gras Party for the first time in my life. It was through church and I enjoyed it. This is different for me, that is for sure! Hopefully this pattern will continue in the future. Through this process I am hoping that socialization will improve. I think it will.        Anyhow, this is the main thing I learned from my high school experience of many years ago. For those in high school do differently than what I did. ",
