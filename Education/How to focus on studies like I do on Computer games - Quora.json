            "answer_text": "It's all about interest. You have interest in playing games so you can spend hours and hours without feeling exhausted. But you need to realize that simply playing games will always keep you hidden behind the screen and nobody would ever know who you are. What's the best people would know about you- your gaming name and a high score. But will that earn you a living. What would you introduce yourself to anybody- I am a computer gaming expert( is that even a career) I am sure your parents must have already given you a good dose of this conversation. So now how to get back to studies. Be strong and hide the keyboard/ joystick or anything that is an important part of your gaming and make it inaccessible. Preferably hand it over to your mom.Decide and understand that you have no choice but to study for now. And once your exams get over, you have loads of time to get back to gamingTry reading for not more than 30- 40 mins at a stretch. Just get up from your seat, walk till the kitchen, drink a glass of water and gget back to your seat. Nothing more.After every 2 hours of study, take a longer break. Play a game in your mom/ dad's cellphone, eat your lunch/ dinner/ snack. And complete all of this in a 30 min break.Do not touch any game in any device 2 before bed.Reserve 1 hour of your day for revision. Divide it in to two sessions of 30 mins- one immediately in the morning when you wake up and the other before bed.Read your content aloud. Allow your ears to listen to what you are reading. This will help you a lot with distractions.Try preparing a time table and follow it.Most importantly- start meditation. Just do simple deep breathing for 10\u201315 mins a day to start withI am not asking you to stop playing games. I am only asking you to be strong enough to avoid it for a few days. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "I once had the same type of problem. I just couldn't concentrate while studying . Here are some tips which were useful for me : You'll not be able to concentrate for hours and hours just in a day or so, Change takes time so be patient.Increase the time of your studies slowly . Start by studying for half an hour without an break , then next day (or day after next day as you feel comfortable) make it 45mins .. and just like this increase the time slowly.Reward yourself with every break you take. As you've mentioned you play games you can reward yourself by playing games. For example . Tell yourself to study for half an hour and when you successfully do it, go and play coc a little while and come back again to study. (Dont take breaks which cost you whole day xD )Increase the studying span a little every day, that's important!!Once the habit of studying is generated, you won't find it that difficult to concentrate.Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "Think what is the difference between playing games and studying subjects. The main difference will be INTEREST. You play games with full concentration. Even your mother is calling you, but have no idea what is going in living world. You are totally into the game. The same you can do with your studies. Only the problem is interest. How interest you show while you are studying depends on it. To keep the concentration like gaming, you should develop interest in studies. Think about the topic. VISUALISATION is a must. While studying physics think about how the things is progressing. While studying biology think how the hormones are secreted. From where does it come, where does it go, what are it's effects. If this is not help use educomp or e-class. This will help you to visualise. ",
