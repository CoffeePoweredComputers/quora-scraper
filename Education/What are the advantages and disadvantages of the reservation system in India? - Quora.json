            "answer_text": "Reservation is a form of affirmative action to uplift the status of socially and educationally backward communities in India. Let\u2019s talk about its advantages and disadvantages. Advantages:- Increase in no. of people from backward sections in various decision making i.e.,Increase in representation from different sections of society.It has helped some people from backward sections to achieve higher posts or services in the public sector as well as in some private institutions.It has encouraged the people to fight for the justice whenever there is violation of their human rights.Meritocracy is meaningless without equality.First of all people must be brought to the same level whether it elevates a section or decelerates another regardless of merit.Reservation has slowed down the process of forward becoming richer and backward becoming poorerDisadvantages:- It is a form of ethnic discrimination.It\u2019s working as a barrier for inter-caste marriages.It\u2019s a biggest enemy of meritocracy.It\u2019s resulting into the degradation of quality of students and workers enrolled in different institutions.It\u2019s propagating notion of caste based society instead of eliminating it.Poor people from forward castes don\u2019t have any social or economic advantage over rich people from backward caste.If this prevails,it may result into the formation of another backward caste of people belonging from poor people of forward caste.Beneficiaries of reservation are largely from dominant class in backward castes.Marginalised section still remains marginalised.Thank You!

            "answer_text": "Reservation is the system in which people belonging to backward community (Based on caste) are given reservation in government jobs and government colleges. It helps them to get a seat in government institutes despite having less marks or merit than the general class. The current scenario of reservation in India is- 15% seats are reserved for Schedule castes (SC).7.5% seats are reserved for Schedule tribes (ST).27% seats are reserved for Other backward classes (OBC).Total constitutional reservation percentage is 49.5%. And the rest 50.5% seats are open to all i.e. general, SC, ST And OBC.Now let's see the Advantages and Disadvantages of Reservation - Advantages - There is no doubt that reservation has helped the people of reserved class to improve their social and economical status. The proportion of SC, ST, and OBC has increased in government institutes and hence providing them a chance to raise themselves.More number of SC, ST students have been enrolled in Undergraduate, Postgraduate and other higher studies. It shows they are now understanding that education is the only way of salvation from their miserable situation.Seats are reserved in Lok Sabha for SC&ST so that they get a chance of decision making and present their views and ideas on different aspects of society. Because they had been deprived of these right for centuries.Disadvantages - It divides our country on the basis of caste, religion and gender and hence threatens our national unity.The attempt of goverment is that all the people in our country live without any discrimination on any basis, but reservation will not let that happen. It creates the feeling of superiority and inferiority among different class of people.It did not do justice with the unreserved class because despite working hard they didn't get the desired seat and it fill them with anger and feeling of enmity for reserved class.It often subvert the society and disturb law and order which leads to loss of life and property.Recent incidents arePatidar reservation agitation in Gujrat 2015.Jat reservation agitation in Haryana in 2016.I personally think that reservation should be given to the needy people but at the same time the people who belongs to reserved class but are financially strong enough should be stopped to enjoy benefits of reservation because many people who belongs to general category are not financially strong enough to support the education of their children. Financially weak people should only enjoy the benefits of reservation. ",
