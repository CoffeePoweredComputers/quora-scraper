If it is not possible to get help from the teacher, do your best to avoid giving the answers to your classmates. This is NOT because you have worked on the assignment all night and you don't want them to simply copy your work without putting in any effort. Even if you happily hand over the answers, do you think that by copying your work, they will develop their minds the way they need to be developed to face the exam??? No! If you hand over the answers to your classmates, they will most likely FAIL in the exams!!! Please don't do this to them! Try your level best to avoid giving the answers to your classmates! All the same, if they won't listen to your logic, and try to blackmail you, please protect yourself by giving them the answers for the sake of your mental wellbeing. But please- as far as possible, try to prevent them from copying your work. ",
