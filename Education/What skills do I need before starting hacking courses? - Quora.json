            "answer_text": "You do not need to be a programming genius of sorts to be a \u201chacker\u201d. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to start with. Hacker mindset: A hacker is always looking for flaws and vulnerabilities in a system. It\u2019s not for computer systems alone.Will To Learn: Let me tell you this right now. THIS STUFF IS FRUSTRATING. So, you need to stick with it. You will get errors in your kali platform about outdated repositories and other kinds of errors. You just need to go with it, everyone does.Now, with that being said, let\u2019s get to the fun part. Get a basic knowledge on the following. Linux Based Operating Systems.: Don\u2019t just jump right into Kali from the start. Kali is not a basic Linux distro. I\u2019ll suggest install Ubuntu in a virtual machine and LEARN the commands in Linux. Get a hang of the file system and get into habit of doing stuff using your command line instead of the mouse.Googling efficiently: Learn to google your problems efficiently. Here\u2019s an advice - Don\u2019t search \u201chow to hack Facebook accounts.\u201d That is just plain stupid -.-After all of that..get into Kali Linux and try out the following \u201cON AN AUTHORIZED MACHINE\u201d. 1. NMAP 2. AIRMON 3. REAVER 4. METASPLOIT ( How this can be missed? ;) ) 5. SQL INJECTION 6. SSL STRIPS After all of this, you must possess the basic knowledge of vulnerability assessment and exploitation. Once you master all of that. Learn about the following to expand your skills. Networking.Programming (Python, Ruby, C++, PHP, JAVA )Social Engineering.Cyber Forensics. Well, this is not necessary, but a hacker must know how investigation is done in the cyber world.Listen, no one is going to teach you how to hack a website. All you can learn from them are the tools. The ones I have mentioned above are only few of the many tools available for pen testing. Learn the tools and use them for good ( pfft ). Well, good luck with your journey. ",
