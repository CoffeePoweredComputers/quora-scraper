            "answer_text": "I have a few problems with this, that I\u2019ve only seen one other person bring up. Though I may be biased, as someone who\u2019s had technology in his life for quite some time AND seen the effects of different parenting styles. First of all, getting a bad grade doesn\u2019t exactly mean you weren\u2019t \u201cworking hard enough\u201d[1] . That could be one cause yes, but that\u2019s not the only thing it could be. Perhaps you can\u2019t focus for other reasons? Maybe the teaching style being presented to you doesn\u2019t make sense? Maybe the content is just too complicated for you to understand. None of those would be your fault. Unless a teacher says that you\u2019re misbehaving or on your device during class, I see no reason why you should be punished. Instead, the parents should be asking if something was making it difficult for you to focus, open their hearts and ears instead of assuming the usual cause we hear in media. If the child has had a habit of lying, then yes I understand taking the technology away right away. But if they don\u2019t have that history, discussion should happen first, otherwise the parents are telling their child(ren) that they don\u2019t trust them. If the parents don\u2019t trust their child, the kid is going to learn how to lie better, smarter, and quicker to avoid punishment to make the best situation for themselves, and that starts creating problems in itself. Technology can also be used to relieve stress, as it helps maintain contact with friends. I know the common excuse of \u201cback in my day we had to deal with a few hours without our friends\u201d. Isn\u2019t the idea of growing as a society to make life easier and more enjoyable for our children, not stay put in the past? Children need to work in school, but they also need to keep their creativity alive, maintain social experiences, and there\u2019s more knowledge and more pressure from school than ever making that difficult. Again, am I biased? Likely. But I\u2019ve seen parents abuse their authority over their children, and I\u2019ve seen parents treat their children like equals with minds of their own who just need a little help figuring out what to do next. I\u2019ve got a clear preference, and just taking technology away because of a simple letter based on an institution designed to teach children to work in factories is not what I would do as a parent. As for advice to the poster, play nice and keep working hard. It makes things easier, losing your technology sucks (especially if it has personal information), but it\u2019s better than fighting with them.

            "answer_text": "Dismantle your device(s)( I don\u2019t mean breaking them) before you get your grades. If you get a bad grade and your parents come to take your device(s) away, show them the dismantled parts. Tell them you wanted to dig deeper and know what\u2019s inside. We could have the possible outcomes from here - They believe you and are impressed by your curiousity and let you rebuild it. You fit the parts together and power on the device(s) and show it to them. They are super impressed and let you have it. This is very good, because you have learned how to strip down and build back a gadget and also get to keep it inspite of your bad grades.They believe you and are impressed by your curiousity and let you rebuild it. You fit the parts together and power on the device(s) and show it to them. They are super impressed, but yet take it away from you due to your bad grades. This is still pretty good, because you have learned how to strip down and build back a gadget, although you don\u2019t get to keep it.They believe you and are impressed by your curiousity and let you rebuild it. You fit the parts together and try powering on the device(s). But it doesn\u2019t. You nervously show it to them. They are really impressed by your motivation.

You fit the parts together and try powering on the device(s). But it doesn\u2019t. You nervously show it to them. They are super pissed. First, you have got bad grades. And now this. This is still not bad, because you learned dismantling something and reconstructing it is not as easy as you thought.They do not believe you and are angry at your actions. You tell them that you are speaking the truth and will prove them wrong. You fit the parts together and power on the device and show it to them. They are super impressed and feel sorry. They let you keep the device(s).This is extremely good, because you not only learned how to strip down and build back a gadget, but also won their good will and got to keep your device(s), despite the bad grades.They do not believe you and are angry at your actions. You tell them that you are speaking the truth and will prove them wrong. You fit the parts together and power on the device. But it doesn\u2019t. They are extremely pissed at your actions. First, you have got bad grades. And now this. This is not all that bad, because although you are gonna feel their heat, you just learned that dismantling something and reconstructing it is not as easy as you thought.Irrespective whether they believe in what you just told them or not, they take away the dismantled device(s) from you. This is quite bad, but then you just learned that getting bad grades does little good.There might be few more possible outcomes that I have not listed. But you most likely have got the idea here and can deduce those other scenarios. Remember, you can ignore everything that I just wrote and avoid all of the above cases by working a lot more harder and getting better grades. Good luck!! ",
