            "answer_text": "I have experienced everything in your question except two items; low self esteem and a belief in fate.  Believing in fate is a cop out...plain and simple.  My fate is a direct result of whatever I have done to bring it on.  If I do nothing, then my fate holds no reward.  If I try to the best of my ability and fail, then I know it wasn't a good plan, or the timing wasn't right, or the son-of-a-bitch I was trying to impress was a prick.  None of those results however, reflect badly on me.  That understanding is of paramount importance in dealing with your other condition. I have a step son with low self esteem, and I cannot understand it.  He graduated with a 4.0, is a member of the Junior College National Honor Society, was successful in a business he created, and then decided to take up code writing and is trying to launch a web site that, IMO, has a very limited appeal.  He cannot handle the isolation he has self imposed upon himself, and the intermittent rejection of his idea.  All of my conversations with him end up with a dismissal because I am a dinosaur and just don't understand the modern world.  Oh well, I think he needs professional help, but his mother, my spouse, doesn't agree, so there you go. So, while not a mental health professional, I have 'been around' as they say, and it seems to me that your only real problem is your lack of self esteem, and that as I've said above is something I cannot comprehend.  I have been down to my last dime (literally) so many times it is laughable.  In a way, that is a time of absolute freedom.  If you have no dependents, then you are free to do as you wish, and if not, then it is time for a real family 'come to Jesus' meeting.  You are not in this alone if you are part of a group.   Find someone to talk with...in person.  I can't see you or touch you on line, and that is important.  It may be a priest, or preacher, or a homeless person you see all the time, it doesn't really matter.  What matters is discovering you are not alone, because without the DGAF personality that I possess, feeling alone is a dangerous place to be.  Talk to someone, befriend someone, and move on.  I truly wish I could do something to help you, as I feel your pain. ",

But you got no choice. Yes, you can definitely do what you love for sure. Little things :) Life doesn't always work based on fate. It's you always remember that. And i can bet on it that you can still be happy. ",
