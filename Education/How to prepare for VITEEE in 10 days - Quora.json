            "answer_text": "Yes and no !! It all depends upon the current stage you are in your exams preparation (by this I mean whether you are aspiring only for VITEEE or preparing mainly for Jee mains and advanced ) It\u2019s a YES If you are busy practising and working hard for your JEE Mains (JEE Adv preparation is a boost though).then you will need only 10\u201315 days to study the types of questions it\u2019s difficulty level ,speed required in solving questions etc. I did this and scored well in VITEEE-2015 But its a NO If you wanna do prepare from scratch and you are thinking to start each chapter and each portion of VITEEE from scratch Now I would suggest you not to panic VITEEE syllabus is very easy just stick exactly to it and for basics of chemistry use NCERT rest JEE Mains level questions are enough for its preparation.

            "answer_text": "If you've been preparing for mains, VITEEE doesn't really need extra preparation. But if you haven't, you can make sure that you do your best in the boards. Most questions asked are from the board syllabus. Familiarize yourself with the exam pattern. Check out a few logic and English based questions which should be easy. Just make sure you know your basic class 12 syllabus. ",
