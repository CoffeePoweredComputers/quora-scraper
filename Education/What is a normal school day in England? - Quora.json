            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: I go to a free, all girls grammar school. I also get there pretty early compared to most people. This does not mean that I go to a school that us overly strict/makes you get to school at this time. This was my exact day, I'll try to be as honest as possible. This was also an easy and fun day compared to most. 6:25: alarm goes. I get out of bed and into my uniform as quickly as possible. I check the weather, it's going to rain so I put on my tights. I head downstairs and make myself breakfast. I eat with my parents most days but we make our own and it's not really a family occasion. I pull out my school shoes, get my backpack and say goodbye. 7:20: I walk down the street, and one of my friends is already there (let's call her Monica). We wait for the other (Rachel) and eventually call her mobile. She's overslept, no biggie. We walk down to the bus stop and catch the 7:28 to the town centre. On the way, we look for our friend Pheobe but she isn't here today. 7:35: the traffic isn\u2019t very bad, so we catch our second earlier bus to school with Ross and Chandler, people in Monica\u2019s form. 7:45: we arrive at school and play some weird multiplayer mobile game I downloaded the night before. It's called Werewolf and it's really fun. Eventually more people arrive, and by 8:30 we have around 9 people playing! 8:45: form time. Yawn. Saw one of my friends, Lisa. 9:05: it's time for first period, which is maths. Our teacher is late as usual, so me and Rachel colour in our new timetables in order of preference. Maths is a yellow. When he arrives, we start doing our worksheet. It's revision for our end of year test everyone's stressing over. We're set 1, so the pressure is quite high for some. 10:05: Religious Education. Ugghhh\u2026 need I say more? We're doing buddism which is interesting, but me and Lisa zone out a bit. 11:05: Breaktime! Yessss! Me, Monica, Lisa, Bart, and a few other peeps play Werewolf. It's pretty chilled. 11:25: French. At least it's in a computing room so we can mess around a bit. We log onto the computers and wait\u2026 a substitute teacher walks in and, no exaggeration, everyone including me cheers. This particular teacher is, as one famous instagram post dictates, the real g. I go on linguascope and do intermediate english, because why not. 12:25: it's computing, a green on my planner. We watch a video and play Kahoot. 13:25: Lunch! Yummy. I have pasta in a cardboard bucket thing and a vanilla milkshake. Not my healthiest choice, but I don't usually get it, oh well. 2:25: our last lesson is Enrichment, which sounds great, but mostly envolves a lot of mental suffering. today we are doing geography, so we spend the whole lesson looking at maps of the school and trying not to fall asleep. 3:25: Hometime!!! Time to sleep and hugs cats, and try and avoid and signs of homework.   Thanks for reading, I know it's quite long but I tRiEd My BeSt. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies depending on the school, but my secondary school (ages 11\u201316) and adjoining sixth form (16\u201318) went like this: [ got up at 7:20, bus at 8:05 ]8:45\u20138:55, registration.8:55\u20139:45, first period.9:50\u201310:40, second period.10:45\u201310:55, break.10:55\u201311:45, third period.11:50\u201312:40, fourth period.12:40\u20131:40, lunch.1:40\u20132:00, afternoon registration.2:00\u20132:50, fifth period.2:55\u20133:45, sixth period.[ got home at around 4:20 ]My brother\u2019s school had five lesson slots per day, and finished a little earlier because of it. 3:45pm seems to be a pretty late finishing time compared to others \u2014 many finish at around 3:15pm instead. So, for mine\u2026 Monday to Friday, six lesson slots per day of fifty minutes, five minutes between each so you could get to the classroom. Lessons could be single, or double. If it was a double, the teacher would usually let you have a five minute breather in between. You only got free periods in sixth form, and were only allowed to leave the premises at lunchtime (still sixth form only). Twice a week in lower school, afternoon registration was replaced with assembly with the whole year group/multiple year groups (I think once a week is more standard). Have I missed anything? I don't think so. ",
