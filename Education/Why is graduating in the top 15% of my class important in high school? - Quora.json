Despite my gpa being just as high or higher than others applying to the same colleges as I did, my class rank caused me to lose scholarship money. Of course, if you have a smaller school, getting a higher class rank may be easier and that could be a good boost to put you into the next bracket up for academic scholarships and save you money in the future ",

When I do work I don\u2019t have any objective to graduation within any percentile or range, I just do the work and go the fuck home. Honestly, if it\u2019s inportant to you, then go for it. But people often overestimate what colleges want from them and make things that are unimportant important. My brother had about a C average and never took any SATs and he still got into college. This probably doesn\u2019t answer your question. Bleh. ",
