            "answer_text": "It\u2019s everything it set out to be and more. What is changing is what people expect from it. You might as well ask why can\u2019t it do everything. Schools were set up to keep little kids from having to report to work, for creating more competent workers in the future. Along the way we started to hope for more, and to some extent, we got it but there is room for higher hopes than ever now. The egregious part is that the hopes we put upon it are often reasonable and kind. I\u2019d love it if we could all be reasonable and kind. It\u2019s just not that way, not everywhere and in the places it is not that\u2019s where those qualities are needed most. I don\u2019t know how to fix the grip mean has on our system. I don\u2019t know how to fix greed. I don\u2019t know how to fix narrow minded selfish back stabbing public or private figures. Most all the people I know would like to see more assistance for people in need, more teaching, more support, more kindness. The circles I travel in are not that wide. I stay away from mean greedy people but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t take a stab at me, or you or even little kids. I would like to wake up and find Betsy DeVoss was a bad dream. I\u2019d like it if every kid had the same excellent chance at at least primary school. We cannot overhaul a system that is not under our control. The public is too divided on what to do and how to do it. The people who control where the money goes are not that keenly interested in a redistribution towards those most in need and frankly, those who don\u2019t need help get the most help, that\u2019s the way money works. Nothing trickles down but waste water. As a nation we\u2019ve been stupid and self centered shirking the hard work of putting mean people in their place. Now they are hugely powerful. Don\u2019t expect it to change easily if at all. Mean people don\u2019t respond to nice people. ",

            "answer_text": "For one thing our education system, or systems isn\u2019t broken. It has a major PR problem, we have an excellent education system which attempts to educate EVERY child in the United States, not just the best and brightest. Why do you think so many high school and college students use foreign exchange programs and come to the United States? In 2016/2017 over 1,000,000 foreign exchange students were studying in the US. That is almost as much as the next 3 countries combined, the UK, China, and Australia. Like I said previously we have a much maligned set of education systems in which our weaknesses and failures are much published and talked about, but not much is said of all of our many successes. And as to it being a system. It is a set of systems. Our national government does not run our schools, our schools are run by the individual states, so we have a set of 50+ state, district, and territorial systems which operate independently by setting their on rules plus operating under the mandates of our federal government.
