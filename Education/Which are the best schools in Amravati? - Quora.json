            "answer_text": "Well, every school has its own share of pros and cons. A choice should be made based on your idea of near perfection. My opinion in this case would be none other than \u2018The Golden Kids English School.\u2019 I will point out the reasons: Most of the faculties are well educated and do have good bonding with students.(But they also turn into fire breathing dragons when one talks a lot or disturbs them during the lecture :P)The teachers are always ready to help the students not only with the academics but also with other exams like NCO, NSO,IMO,ISO,etc.An all round development of the child can be expected as sports are also valued.Drawing, Essay-writing,Handwriting,Recitation of Sanskrit verses,etc. competitions take place all round the year.This enhances various skills of the child.Not only English but for some section of students the course is taught in Semi-English also.(i.e except maths and science the other subjects are in Marathi.)Last but not the least, the talent of students is recognised there!",
