            "answer_text": "Berea College (Kentucky; berea.edu) has been tuition-free for over 125 years. Founded in 1855, it was the first coeducational and non-segregated college in the South. All students work 10 or more hours a week in the craft industries, food service, buildings and grounds, as T.A.s, etc. Pay from your labor assignment enables most students to graduate debt-free. B.A. cx 1972 in French and worked in weaving industry. So I taught high school French for 2 years and was a professional weaver almost 30 years. Just so you know, they accept applications from primarily low-income students from southern Appalachia. 80% SA, 10% rest of USA, 10% International. Focus is always on outstanding but impoverished students from southern Appalachia. ",
