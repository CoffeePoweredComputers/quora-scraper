            "answer_text": "A2A I could tell you what was traditionally in grade 3, but the quickest way to the current answer for your question is a web search. Pick a state, because things vary somewhat by location. Search for that state\u2019s Department of Education and go to their website. Find the link for the state standards and open the standards for grade 3. The things on that list are what teachers are legally expected to teach in that state. The challenge for a good teacher will be helping the child who is not ready for that list catch up, and the child that knew that list two years ago not hate school from boredom. But, the list is the required curriculum for each grade. ",
