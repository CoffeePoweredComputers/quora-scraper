            "answer_text": "Absolutely. God promises us a better future. First tho, you need to understand why things are the way they are. God did not intend for humans to suffer. He gave mankind a wonderful start.\t(Genesis 1:28, 31) Satan, a rebel angel, called God a liar and influenced the first humans to reject God\u2019s authority. When Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, they chose to follow Satan. They rebelled against Jehovah and decided for themselves what was right and wrong.\t(Genesis 3:1-6) Was Satan correct? Could humans rule themselves successfully without help from God? Time would be needed to settle the crucial issues raised by the rebels. Think about this illustration: A rebellious student claims that the teacher\u2019s method of instruction is wrong. He insists that he knows a much better way. Some of the students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? He has the authority to reprimand the rebellious students. But what effect would that have on the other students? They may lose respect for the teacher, thinking he may be afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose the teacher allows the student to show his method to the class? Then it would be proved to all present who is qualified to teach. Jehovah God has done something similar to what the teach does. When Satan challenged Jehovah, many angels were watching. How Jehovah handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. (Job 1:6) Knowing this, Jehovah allowed Satan to rule this world for a time. Satan\u2019s rule has caused untold pain and suffering. (1John 5:19) However, once God\u2019s right and ability to rule is established beyond any doubt, Jehovah will undo all the damage caused by Satan\u2019s rebellion. He will get rid of suffering, sickness, pain and death. (Revelation 21:4) At that time, only people who choose to follow God\u2019s standards will inhabit the earth. The wicked will be gone. (Psalm 37:9\u201311, 29) Until then\u2026What does God\u2019s patience allow us to do? How can we show that we choose God as our ruler? The Bible tells us.

            "answer_text": "Climate change spells Armageddon for our younger folk and their children. Don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll cope with that. But Nicolas Kristof of the Times noted that if you look at the stats on major world problems, 2017 has been the best year of all time. 2017!! That\u2019s saying something. Dire poverty is almost wiped out in the world. Enormous progress is being made to end human trafficking, child marriage, sweatshop labor, HIV. We can be more hopeful if we take a world perspective. Some of the worst off countries are developing. Much of Africa is alive with development and eradication of disease, deaths in childbirth and such. Education is moving forward. At the same time there is concern to preserve cultural traditions. That more problems are being reported in the news is not necessarily a sign of things getting worse, but of them coming to light and people mobilizing against them. This is not to say that humans are not now endangering life kind as a species and that our dominance should not be cut back. If do-gooder aliens were to come along (AI?) it may turn out to be better for everything on this planet. We can easily design beings like us with far fewer flaws and animosities\u2014non-predators.
