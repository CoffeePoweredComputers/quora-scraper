            "answer_text": "Well, your entire x1 class organic chemistry plays a role in your 12th organic chemistry. Eg\u2014- There are reactions which depends on stereo chemistry of the reactant & stereo chemistry is taught in x1 class.Basics of resonance energy and aromatic properties(taught in x1 class) are the tools of mechanism of several reactions.Sometimes in question, IUPAC name of product in concerned reaction is asked. So you have to be clear with basic principles of IUPAC.Ring expansion and contraction has a wide usage in the mechanism of reactions or explaining the products in many questions.Basics of SN1 / SN2 and the priority of the reaction in choosing any of the above two paths is taught you in x1 class.Hence you have to be very clear with your x1 class OC concepts to apply them well in your x11 class OC.
