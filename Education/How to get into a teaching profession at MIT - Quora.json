            "answer_text": "Having once been offered a faculty position at MIT, I think I can weigh in on this\u2026 There are really two kinds of opportunities to join the faculty at an elite university like MIT: 1) as an Assistant Professor coming straight from postdoctoral training, or, 2) later in career, moving from a faculty position at another university. I think in many ways the second is easier (and the type I was offered). I was honored to receive it, but ultimately decided I was better off staying where I was (I also think that MIT was better served by the person they did end up hiring, but that\u2019s a different story ;-). The first avenue is probably more difficult, because the competition for open positions is so broad. Elite Universities typically get hundreds of applications for an open faculty position, meaning the odds at the outset are not great. But what will make you stand out will be having conducted an outstanding research program as a postdoctoral scholar, having shown a lot of independence in conducting that project, having that project be on a topic that is deemed important and which fits well with the needs of the hiring department, and perhaps most important, being a leader of the scientific progress in that field -being the one making the important progress in that research. In addition, they are looking for someone who has outstanding scientific vision - has a research plan in place for what they would do the first several years of their faculty position, who has a demonstrated ability to raise grant money, and has shown excellence in teaching. Very strong letters of recommendation from close advisors who have seen you in action in a research environment are critical. The second avenue: I say it\u2019s easier only because these types of hires are usually more targeted. A department might be looking for someone in a particular area of research, so they will make a short list of faculty at other universities who have established an international reputation in that area of study. The criteria are not that different, but the \u2018ease\u2019 comes from the fact that as such a candidate, you have had a few years in your current position to establish your reputation; and, of course, the targeted nature of the search means you start out already on a short list. Bottom line: MIT is on the very short list of the world's top universities. If you want to gain a faculty position there, you will also need to be on a very short list: The list of persons among the best in the world in your field at the career stage you are at, or at least showing obvious potential to become that.

I believe the easiest route is probably as a humanities professor but even that is not easy. I suggest you find a discipline that you are passionate about and spend most of your waking hours becoming one of the premiere experts on that subject in the world. The question was merged after I answered it. The new question about \u201cgetting into a teaching profession\u201d instead of becoming a full professor at MIT is a much easier task. If you are an MIT grad student you will probably be given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant at MIT. ",

Expertise and activity in an area considered important to the field and to the base of human knowledge. Recognition of research credentials reflected by successful applications for grant funding, especially from federal organizations like NIH and NSF. Having a strong reputation as a leader in your field, attested to not only by colleagues at MIT, but also by recognized leaders in the field at other top institutions (e.g., Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Stanford, Berkeley, etc.). In addition to the above, evidence of some success as a teacher, both in the classroom and in the laboratory, and some record of service to the institution and the community (e.g., serving on editorial boards of prominent journals in the field, participating in administrative duties in the department and the school). There aren\u2019t a whole lot of people that can make that cut. ",

MIT seems to love entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, too, and their recent CS hires seem to demonstrate that. Also, just as a casual observation, they seem to hire people from the top 3 (or so) universities in the nation. Very few universities. Update: the original question asked what it takes to become a mathematics professor at MIT. ",
