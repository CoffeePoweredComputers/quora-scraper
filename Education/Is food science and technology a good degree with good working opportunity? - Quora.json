            "answer_text": "I graduated a LONG time ago (1980) so YMMV. All (reasonable intelligent) Food Science majors had multiple job offers. This was DEEP in a recession at the tail end of the Carter Presidency, and many, many other majors had a hard time finding jobs. The professors at the best schools (Purdue, Cornell, Michigan State, Illinois, UC Davis, etc.) are closely tied in to industry and open many doors. Careers tend to fall into 4 broad categories: Production/Production Management: The professionals who run our nation\u2019s food factories!R&D: The scientists who design, develop and launch the latest and greatest food items. (The food biz is one of constant innovation.)Quality Control: If you have heard about Blue Bunny Ice Cream or Chipotle, then you know that maintaining the highest quality is of utmost importance for a food company.USDA/FDA: Many government agencies hire food scientists.I give it a thumbs up. The book that inspired me to go into Food Science was Upton Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle. Read it and you will understand. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean & what you want to do. Food S&T hasn\u2019t perhaps had the highest status, but that\u2019s changing drastically. Food as a subject has gained in status over the last years, presumably in relation to i) the increased awareness of the impact that the food production chain has on sustainability ii) the gradual shift from \u201cpush\u201d to \u201cpull\u201d systems and iii) the impact of diet on non-communicable diseases (e.g. the global increase and burden of type 2 diabetes and other diet-related endpoints). So if you\u2019re interested in being a part of the solution for healthy foods for a sustainable future - then I think you\u2019ll find that the food sector will be a hot place to be in. However, if by food S&T you are talking about more of the same that\u2019s already being done, then I think you\u2019ll be disappointed. I mean\u2026 these products too will surely continue to have a huge market share - but it won\u2019t be nearly as interesting and rewarding :) ",
