            "answer_text": "I want to parse terms a little bit. Some of the answers seem to be arguing that the government has the right to mandate a certain curriculum that public (and in some cases, private) schools must teach. I think people mean to be arguing that the government has the right to mandate which standards a school must teach its students. Here's a nice, tidy little distinction: \"Standards  define what is to be learned by the end of a school year. Curriculum is  the detailed plan for day to day teaching.\" - See more at: Common Core Fact of the Day: Standards v. Curriculum - Foundation for Excellence in Education\nGiven this distinction, absolutely the government should be able to set standards for children in the public school setting. Before the Common Core, it was state governments setting standards for all their students. Now, we have the federal government setting those standards. It makes the argument, \"Government foots the bill, of course they can make the rules.\" Public schools are funded primarily by state funds, although federal funds play a really big role in every school's budget. Every dollar counts, so schools, districts, and states apply for every type of federal aid they qualify for. Setting national standards, I believe, is fair because we can now compare student outcomes from state to state more equitably. We can also placate ourselves by saying that a graduate from Arkansas had the same quality of education as a graduate from Wisconsisn. We know that's not always the case.  Part of the reason that not all educations are created equal (on the state level, district level, even school level) is because these standards are taught by teachers. Teachers are people who have different educational backgrounds, diverse cultural experiences, and different professional opinions.  It is for this reason that I believe that the curriculum should only be decided upon by teachers.  What happens at my school is this: our curriculum coordinator at the school or district level will decide to invest our school's money towards a particular curriculum (meaning textbooks, computer programs, or other educational materials). Sometimes these decisions are even made with the input of a committee of teachers. The teachers are then presented with the option to use the curriculum that has been made available to them, or to develop their own learning materials. But nobody will presume to tell an educational professional exactly HOW to teach their classroom. Principals and administration will do evaluations, and depending on the district and local union, those evaluations may or may not have serious consequences for a teacher's professional career. But the result of a teacher evaluation rarely results in significant changes to how a teacher teaches (I'm talking from personal experience, I'm sure there are studies out there that quantify the effectiveness of teacher evaluation systems in changing teacher behaviors).  So to make a very long answer short: government absolutely should have a say in the learning targets or standards that a school teaches (at least in the public setting, I'm less convinced that private schools should have much obligation to the government.) But the reason why our school system employs human teachers, instead of just turning on Bill Nye the Science Guy or Kahn Academy in every classroom, is because teachers are educational experts and are able to rapidly adapt to the diverse needs of their students. That's why most teachers have either a Bachelors degree or a Masters degree in teaching, so that we can be prepared to make decisions, based on evidence, to meet the needs of our students. Curriculum should be decided by teachers. Schools and districts have the right to decide upon a curriculum option from which teachers may choose to teach, but the final decision is up to the teacher.

            "answer_text": "No. Well long answer version - it depends on a variety of factors.  In Australia for example all schools regardless of whether they are public or private recieve some level of funding from the Government.  Part of this funding is a requirement that schools will follow the State mandated curriculum - so that all students across the country are recieving the same level of education. I think the danger of allowing schools to establish their own curriculum is that there is no community oversight of what is taught in those schools.  While that could be fairly harmless, knowing human nature, there's a good chance they will indoctrinate kids in a way which will be dangerous to society. While there may be a lot of griping about State mandated curriculum and what it does and doesn't include - I think about it this way.  Those suicide bombers you see on the news?  Chances are they weren't the recipients of a well rounded state mandated education. ",
