            "answer_text": "None ever did. COVID-19, a fake meme that originated in Wuhan, China with US CDC funding and flooded through the world media by WHO, is fraudulent claims by Neil Ferguson predicting that 2 million Americans and 500,000 Brits will die from the novel betacoronavirus before he withdrew the claim but not before governments adopted as basis for strict lock down policy. Every civil restriction, every mandatory surgical mask demand, are adopted from a retracted paper; non-reviewed prepublication fraudulent junk science from Imperial College and Lancet. COVID-19 is a false belief held by 99% of the world\u2019s population that the deadliest ever germ in history is circulating throughout all of habitable civilization. Countering the meme are scientists with decades of experience and repute, department heads, stating they have found no conclusive evidence of any novel virus causing acute respiratory distress syndrome or even ARDS in alleged COVID-19 deaths of nearly all octogenarian and older with existing multiple chronic illnesses. No viral pneumonia or viral RNA discovered. The 80\u201390 year old mortalities claimed to be COVID-19 are cancer, heart disease, renal and liver failure of elderly at end of life, the worst regions being in long-term high to dangerous level industrial smog. Most people are conditioned to unquestionably believe every word from MDs and, of all the incredulous errors, the media. Scientists do the opposite. They take claims under consideration and subject to rigorous test to determine accuracy or lack of. Department heads are declaring COVID-19 criminal fraud. If this alleged pathogen were real, you would know it. Not unlike a major earthquake or tsunami, the destruction and devastation would be unmistakable. Every day one would receive news of someone they know or know of, healthy up until, stricken and rapidly dying from pneumonia, all across the human spectrum from family, friends, acquaintances, famous athletes, actors, politicians, musicians, poor, wealthy, in between. None of this has happened. The tsunami warning was issued, no waves made shore. All of the hundreds of millions around the world in absolutely useless surgical masks that each manufacturer disclaims as incapable of blocking germs, being cattle herded by store security, fully believing surrounded by deadly germs have no idea that they are the virus in the eyes of the frauds behind the invention and marketing of COVID-19. Every civil restriction, revocation of fundamental liberties, so much for D-Day, are to psychologically beat down into docile consumer sheep by nurturing and pressuring populations into hopelessless, confusion and fear. Where once people could freely walk into places of businesses, are being forcibly contained and herded. The lock down and \u201csocial distancing\u201d scams have no association with disease prevention from an alleged pathogen with zero scientific evidence to support. The restrictions are population control to break down human will; force business insolvency, personal bankruptcy, domestic abuse, suicide, disperse the rising tide of public protest against crooked government. And it works beautifully as the inventors know that most people are that naive, ignorant and gullible to eat up every word. Being forced outside a grocery store to stand on a 6\u2032 marker in a useless mask, waiting for some uniformed security guard to admit inside, is about snuffing out the human spirit and turning people into frightened sheep, much of which that already were. The only \u2018herd mentality\u2019 at work, and working to plan, are the ignorant and naive observing a sea of surgical masks from their 6\u2032 dot or line believing that a deadly germ abounds from the immediate presentation and reinforcing visage of ignorant, naive, irrational humans behaving as the predictable sheeple most are. Nearly all animal disease, unless shot, stabbed, beaten, poisoned, asphyxiated, is internal human cell breakdown from cell differentiation, vascular plaque buildup, congenital defect or bacterial imbalance. Humans who die from natural causes die from the biological flaw of cells to fail to replicate or cells starved of vital nutrients and energy and die as a result. No human has ever been beset and destroyed but what are called viruses, which are all made by animal or plant cell with the host\u2019s genetic and structural material. The term \u2018virus\u2019, a very recent inclusion, through huge expenditure and promotion, has convinced the human race to be terrified of or regard as icky and gross, when are 100% natural cell process for host animal or plant benefit. Most people, being scientifically ignorant and naive, do not know that a fragment of RNA, if even did originate from a real deadly pathogen, could never negatively affect any human of any age or immune system integrity. A partial RNA sequence is too tiny to cause any trouble. In their ignorance and naivete, all it takes is one MD of perceived authority and repute to claim that some partial fragment of RNA poses a decisive threat to their health to believe every word, because that is how, from being ignorant, are conditioned to react. There is no such thing as even one human COVID-19 case. Only the duped presumption. ",

            "answer_text": "Coronavirus will never, ever be over, just like Influenza will never, ever be over. Since that fateful day when somebody in Wuhan decided to snack on a bat, or a snake, or a wolf or whatever it was, the course of history was changed forever. The Coronavirus as we know it has found a good host. And when a virus finds a good host, it is part of the host species\u2019 existence forever. It appears that this Coronavirus is very adept at mutation, which is how it got to humans in the first place. So no matter what vaccination is brought out, Coronavirus will circumvent it with mutation, just like the \u2018flu does. However, and this is the important point, every day it becomes more and more likely that the danger of the virus is massively overestimated. The reported death rates of 3% are clearly massively overestimated. It\u2019s now thought that there are tens of thousands of unreported cases of Coronvirus around the world. Remember, 100% of deaths caused by the virus are reported, but the amount of people who are carrying the virus is unknown, and the reports are based on the worst possible scenario. When we look at the deaths, we have to look at where the deaths have occurred. Wuhan was hit pretty hard, but 70% of the male population are heavy smokers, and they live in the some of the worst air pollution in the world. It won\u2019t take much to put these people into respiratory distress. Then there\u2019s Italy. The people that have succumbed have been elderly, since the elderly will not have access to social media like the young have, and villages of old biddies will get together for Sunday mass and a cup of coffee. Then there\u2019s counties like the UK and Australia where the deaths are occurring in nursing homes. The remaining life expectancy in nursing homes is months, and patients are way more likely to die of aspirational pneumonia from inadequate oral hygiene. But the fact is, only a handful of people have been tested. In America it is around 500, in Australia it is no more than 100, and a diagnosis cannot be made without a test. So just think of all the undiagnosed cases that bring the death rate down. The fact is that this is just my opinion, and nobody knows the truth just yet. It is the fear of the unknown that is worse for many people. Edit: It appears that some people haven\u2019t read the last paragraph. It is my opinion. You\u2019re welcome to yours, even if it differs from mine. But if you start getting all angry and insulting and are unable to keep your emotions in check, you\u2019ll just get your comment deleted and get blocked. Be nice people, it\u2019s free. Edit 2: The first line isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s a scientific fact. If your mind works that way, that\u2019s a shame for you, but don\u2019t assume that everybody else\u2019s does. ",
