            "answer_text": "Simple answer is yes. The majority of colleges/university that offer online education do not indicate on their transcript or degree that you took online courses, just that you attended their courses and completed them. So given that, you should have first asked the college/university if they indicated online vs in class on their transcripts and degree before you signed up with them. Otherwise, you can send off for your transcript and submit them to the oversea institution with your application. Good luck. ",
