            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t ever forget that you asked this question, and don\u2019t ever forget the motivation you felt to ask it. The road is long, the hours tough, and the money\u2019s not that fantastic. The temptations to do other, simpler, more rewarding things will be ever present. Your friends will want you to skip your studies, take a break, and share a Pepsi. Girls will try to get you to buy them necklaces instead of buy that new telescope you had your eye on\u2026.. Sounds austere\u2026..? Well, maybe buy the odd necklace, the stars aren\u2019t the only things worth looking at! Lots of advice will come from these pages, and from well-meaning friends and mentors\u2026 \u2026remember your motivation, this, is the REAL DEAL, nothing can compare! Go for it, you CAN do it, don\u2019t have doubts. Best wishes, rafe ",

They really are important for a good research in Astrophsics. Otherwise, keep reading interesting books and keep asking questions and be curios! :) ",
