            "answer_text": "In the US an undergraduate degree will require 4\u20135 years. After that, if the student is accepted into a medical school, they will have another 4 years there. After med school, they\u2019ll still have to complete a residency and possibly one or more fellowships before they can truly begin working as a board-certified physician. The residency and fellowship take different amounts of time depending on the specialty - to work as a family physician might require only a few years as a resident and no fellowship; cardiology or neurosurgery might require another decade of work to complete. With regards to the degree itself - the US does not have a PhD in Medicine - some will earn a PhD and then an MD (or vice versa) while others will enroll in a combined MD/PhD program that takes 5\u20136 years. Other countries might do things differently. I met a woman from somewhere in Latin America who only spent 6 years between starting college and starting her practice as a dentist. ",

            "answer_text": "Just to avoid confusion, let me note that while medical schools do award PhDs, the degree that practicing physicians hold (in the US) is an MD. The admissions requirements for the two programs are sufficiently different that if you want to have the option of going after either of them, you need to start planning early. In either case, you\u2019ll need to finish a bachelor\u2019s degree first. This usually takes four years, although it may be possible to finish slightly more quickly. A PhD in medicine generally takes 5\u20136 years, but it\u2019s possible that it will take longer. It\u2019s very rare for someone to be eligible for a professorship immediately after that, so most people who want to continue in academia will take a series of short-term research positions to build up their profile. Others drop out and go to industry. An MD takes four years, but there\u2019s extra training post-graduation. I know that everyone has to go through a three year residency, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the end of training for anyone. Specialists definitely have to go through extra training after that. ",

            "answer_text": "Mine was 8 years\u20144 for an undergraduate degree and 4 to wrap up my PhD research. However, my case is unusual, and it\u2019s more common for a PhD these days to take 5\u20136 years in the US. It used to be shorter in the past and all the professors I worked with finished theirs in 3\u20134 years, but this is far less common today than it was >20 years ago. Another common route is undergraduate to a master\u2019s (2 years) and then a PhD, which is a total of 10-11 years, although taking 12+ years isn\u2019t too uncommon. How quickly you finish depends on luck and on your self-awareness. If you find the perfect adviser for you and a great topic that suits your ability and temperament, then you can finish fast and also do a very impactful PhD. But if you don\u2019t know your strengths and flounder around for a bit while you learn about yourself, then it will take longer. And I would advise against prioritizing speed of completion over quality of work. Create something that you\u2019re proud of. It shows, and makes getting a job much easier. ",

Two years (typically) for a master\u2019s degree. 4\u20135 years (or more) for a PhD. \u2026 for a total of 10\u201311 years (or more) after high school. Sometimes, you can skip your master\u2019s degree and go directly into a PhD program. In such a case you might save a year.

My PhD program was almost entirely research based so when you had acquired the skills and could do a respectable dissertation you were good to go. No one bothered with a Masters degree. Today a PhD is more likely to be for 5 or more years \u2014 research skills are more complex and many students stay in grad school to accumulate publications before they try to get a job. As others have pointed it it varies with the school and the type of program. Typically degrees in the humanities take longer. ",
