            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t easy. Many jobs that pay anything require at least a HS diploma or equivalent before they\u2019ll even consider you (no matter what other qualifications you have). Getting other qualifications will be hard since most community college programs (even career track diplomas) and vocational schools require a high school diploma or equivalent. Today, you can\u2019t even join the military without a HS diploma or equivalent (and I think it may only be the Army now that will consider you if you have a HS equivalent, i.e. a GED, instead of an actual HS diploma). So, what can you do? You have a few options. Get your GED. That will open a lot of other options. I knew someone in high school who dropped out, got her GED, went to a Community College, then joined the military, and eventually became an officer (she went to the service academy for the service she joined after her 4 years of active duty were up) and now has 2 masters degrees (and I think she is about to start her third). From the GED, you can get any HS grad job (most of which don\u2019t pay well without a skill), you can go to vocational school to get a skill if you don\u2019t want to go to college (some job skills pay very well), you can go to a 2 year college and get your associates degree (some AA/AS level skills pay quite well), you can join the military or you can even go on to college and get a 4-year degree or beyond. Start your own business. If you have a skill that is useful this is a possibility. Depending upon what you want to do, you may have to find a way to raise a substantial amount of money, and there is definitely risk to this route, so it is not for everyone. If you are lucky enough to land a good sales job (not retail) without a HS diploma, sales is a skill that doesn\u2019t necessarily require much formal education. If you can develop the skills, one can make a lot of money in sales without college. If you are under 21 and can finish HS before you are 21, consider going back. It may not be fun to be 21 in class with 14\u201318 year old students, and it may be hard to convince a school to let you in. It may be easier if your local school district offers evening school since those students will mostly be on the older side of high school students. This way you can get your actual HS diploma which will open more doors than a GED (and far more than nothing). Many students who struggled in day school find evening school works better for them. ",

If you find that your skill isnt getting it done, time for the next stepGED. This was my route. got mine while i was in jail at age 18. best 4 hours i ever spent taking that test. Note: the GED is written at a tenth grade level, if you were a successful student to that point, dont bother with the whole extended study session, take the test. you can always try it again.Get passionate! Whether you have a PhD or no education at all, if you have a deep passion and love for what you do, you will tend to (TEND TO) be successful, not just surviving. Now success to some is borderline poverty to others, but the tempered American dream still lives.Choices, you have got to make some really good ones and SOON, or things will not be looking good. Start with a small one today, can you enroll in (or take) a GED Exam ASAP? if not, ask yourself why and what the other option is today. From #4 to #5 above i went to community college, got my AA. spent a few more years in limbo until #5 took hold, then went back to school to get my teaching degree. Satisfied for now, but raises are based on credentials, so its a Masters degree sometime soon too. and on it goes\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I wish I had more information about your situation, so I could give you a better answer. Where I live, once you are considered a mature student, you can get credit toward your diploma for work experience, and will only need 4 actual high school classes to get your diploma. Is it possible your city offers a similar arrangement? What about night school, online courses, or correspondence courses? Are any of those possible? Some colleges will accept students who do not have high school diplomas if they can pass an admissions or equivalency test. If school is out of the question, try and find a job that has the possibility for promotion by hard work. You might have to start at the bottom, but if you show you have talent and are willing to work hard, you will be promoted. Have you thought about apprenticeship? Again, if I knew more about you, I could give you better advice. Some trades do not require a high school diploma, and you earn your qualifications (and get paid) as you learn your trade. Is there a small business you could start on your own? Do you have a special skill that you could turn into a job? Whatever you end up doing, remember that there is always dignity in honest labour. Good luck to you! ",

Please keep in mind that high school drop-outs are not necessarily illiterate or bereft of math skills. There are a number of tradespeople who do not have a high school diploma. In my area, family businesses employ individuals who have not completed high school, but every one of those workers have distinguished themselves as capable journeymen in their walk of life. Sincerely, AJG. ",
