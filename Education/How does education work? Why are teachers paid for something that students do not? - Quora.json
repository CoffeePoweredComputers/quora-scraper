            "answer_text": "If you mean \u201cWhy are teachers paid but students are not,\u201d well, stick a bunch of students in a classroom WITHOUT a teacher and see how much smarter they get. Students grow more and more capable of teaching themselves the older they get. Teachers both impart content knowledge and direct the collective efforts of the entire class, in a perfect world. This requires both a high level of knowledge of the subject and the ablity to be responsible for multiple other people. (If this sounds easy, explain the national shortage of teachers!) Even the smartest seniors in high school are usually not as smart as they think they are, however. Their usual deficit is in not knowing their own weaknesses, or what they don\u2019t know, which only the bigger challenges of college can show them. The \u201cI should be paid to go to school!\u201d logic gets brought up by kids starting in late middle school through high school. Here is a conversation condensing how it opten goes: Student: \u201cWe should get paid to go to school!\u201d Teacher: \u201cWhy?\u201d S: \u201cBecause I\u2019m here and I\u2019m working!\u201d T: \u201cAh, so, is this like a job?\u201d S: \u201cYeah, a sucky job.\u201d T: \u201cDo you have another job?\u201d S: \u201cYeah, at McDonalds.\u201d T: \u201cSo you thnk you should be paid here the same way McDonald\u2019s pays you?\u201d S: \u201cAt least!\u201d T: \u201cOkay. How much do you get to sit down at McDonalds during a shift?\u201d S; \u201cOnly like, twice.\u201d T: \u201cGood! That will save us a lot of space. We\u2019ll get rid of the desks and you can stand all period.\u201d S: \u201cWait, what?!\u201d T: \u201cDoes McDonald\u2019s give you an hour for lunch where you can go play basketball?\u201d S: \u201cOh, hell no.\u201d T: \u201cWell, good. That will shorten our day then, since we\u2019ll eliminate lunch hour and give you maybe 20 minutes. And of course, we won\u2019t be feeding you the way we have either, since McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t just give away food. The market value of lunch is about 3\u20134 times what you pay for it, so the cost of lunch just trippled.\u201d S: \u201cWait a minute, this isn\u2019t what I meant\u2014\u201d T: \u201cDoesn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s expect you to wipe the floor and take out the trash, plus clean up any messes created by anyone else? S: \u201cUh, yeah \u2026\u201d T: \u201cMan, this is starting to sound like a great deal for the school. Now we can save a LOT of money on janitorial staff! Every time one of the toilets overflows, guess who we can put on the job, since now we are paying you?\u201d S: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same!\u201d T: \u201cWhy?\u201d S: \u201cAt my McDonald\u2019s job I don\u2019t have to just stay at one place all day, the customers are coming and going, and they\u2019re different all the time. Even the worst stuff only happens now and then. T: \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you\u2019d strongly prefer a job that didn\u2019t require you to stand most of the day, put up with the same jerks day in and day out, clean up messes created by other people, and gave you a whole hour for lunch? S: \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d T: \u201cDon\u2019t go into teaching, kid.\u201d ",

You might find one here or there, but to find enough unpaid, yet qualified teachers who have invested tens of thousands of dollars in themselves through their own university education, certifications, etc, would be a fruitless pursuit. The reason students do not get paid money is that they are the beneficiaries of an education system that is there to teach them and grow their intelligence and knowledge. The payment to the students is the growth in knowledge and learning. A price tag cannot be put on that. The person that does not realize that is missing the big picture. ",
