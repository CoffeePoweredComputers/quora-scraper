            "answer_text": "I'm not sure exactly what you mean by \u201cSponsor \u201c your child's education. So, I'll give a broad definition. K-12 education in the US is supposed to be free for students. If your child has special needs, each state has programs to help meet needs of special needs kids. Check with your state's Department of rehabilitation services. Those departments often go by varying names, i.e. State Commission for the blind, State Commission for the deaf, Early intervention for physically disabled. Just keep trying different Google searches for your state. If you meet guidlines for income, or severity of need, the services can be quite extensuve, including physical, occupational and speech therapy beginning as young as age 2 or 3, and all free of charge. If you are talking about higher education, certain Disabilities qualify an individual for services including waivers of University fees, and tuition, reader services, O&M services, sign interpreters, adaptive technology provided. If your child has no special needs, then look for scholarships and grants offered by universities. There are millions of dollors in scholarships that go unclaimed every year. All it takes is a lot of research on your part, and filling out applications. I hope this was helpful. ",

Those can be based on your child\u2019s aptitudes and achievements, your religious/social/political/club associations, or your geographic associations. I\u2019d recommend asking your reference librarian at your local library for help in finding directories, in print or online, of scholarships you can apply for. You can also ask through crowdfunding (gofundme, etc) but you\u2019re facing more competition with the same story there. Most parents do not actually research scholarships. If you want to put some effort into it, you can nearly certainly find some help at least. ",

Generally, a history of good grades and community service of some kind, will give the applicant entry into the world of financing a college education. Grants are very popular because there is no payback. Work study will pay a student to work for the university, while earning money for tuition. Many students have part time jobs. It depends how resourceful and persistent a student is and how much effort they are willing to put into the process, that determines their success graduating without incurring massive debt. Good luck. ",

I would give America as one of least priority due to high tuitions fees and difficult scholarships. Japan, European countries have lot of fellowships, company sponsorships which you can try. I suggest to get your children to decide the country which they wanna study and then prepare the necessary documents. Japan has JICA, MEXT scholarships and company scholarships. Similarly European do have. Please Check in the ministry of education website in those countries. ",
