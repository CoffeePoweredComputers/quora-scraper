            "answer_text": "I spend so much time thinking about how to increase literacy and being literate , I am unsure of my answer to this question. I think one is illiterate if they are unable to read, write, communicate and view media to a degree that inhibits their success in their culture or environment I am literate in my English speaking culture, less literate in France as I only have a basic understanding of the French language. And I would be illiterate in Japan, as I have zero ability to read, write, speak or view media in Japanese. I would not be successful there among Japanese. On the other hand if I found a community of people who understand English in Japan my literacy would increase within this group, but as soon as I am without this group in Japan, I would fall back to being illiterate. Japan may not be the best example, but the basic idea I\u2019m attempting to communicate in this answers is that one might be illiterate if they cannot speak, or understand, or read, or write, or view, or listen in a given language or culture.

But if the reading rate is too slow they will not be able to comprehend what the sentence was about, and will have no clue what they have just read. ",
