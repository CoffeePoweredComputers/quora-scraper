            "answer_text": "Same answer for almost exactly the same question you just asked earlier: No. Corporal punishment is physical. Like a spanking or cracking the knuckles or palms with a ruler as was sometimes done in ages past. Why? Because sitting in front of the clase is not the definition of corporal punishment. From dictionary: Corporal Punishment - physical punishment, such as caning or flogging. No matter how many times you ask the same question the answers aren\u2019t going to change. ",

Something along these lines:  It comes from the Latin \u2018corpus\u2019, meaning harm to the body. I am old enough that I was subjected to corporal punishment a fair bit during my school days (I was not a well behaved child). The only \u2018hot seat\u2019 was when you tried to sit down again afterwards. Corporal punishment - Wikipedia ",
