            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve got this. Since young my grades have not been fantastic; I even have to drop subjects and also on the near edge of repeating my junior year in high school because of my grades. But gradually, I improved in my senior year. Subsequently in college, my grades are above average. The first thing to take note of is that, studying is a consistent effort. If you are constantly revising materials, then it will be easier to study when exams are coming. However, if you do not listen attentively in class and understand the content, then trying to squeeze all the knowledge into your brain in the last week before the test will be useless. Second, understanding is the most important thing. You need to understand the materials and not just purely memorize (but this also depends on the subject). For subjects that require more application skills, such as physics and math, then understand the logic behind them is important. For subjects that require some memory work, such as history, geography and biology, then put in consistent effort to revise them from time to time so that you are familiar with the concepts. Thirdly, you need motivation to study. I realize that my grades are bad not because I\u2019m less intelligent than my peers, but because I am lazy in general and do not have the motivation to learn. The situation will be worse when you got bad grades, because you have no incentive to improve and the rewards of good grades are slow to come. Yet there\u2019s a need to ask yourself what do you want to achieve at the end of the day? Then work from there. Coming to study methods: (a) Read-up on class materials before lessons, take notes in class, organize the notes after class for easy revision. (b) Be clear about the concepts and definitions. For memory work, familiarize and revise them day to day so that memorizing won\u2019t be an issue when exams are near. For more complicated ones, practice more revision papers so that you will learn how to apply the concepts. (c) Get help from your peers, ask them to test you or try to explain the answers to them. (d) Approach teachers to help you identify what went wrong and areas that you can improve, especially after you\u2019ve gotten back your test paper. Overall, this really takes consistent and deliberate effort. On my side, my attitude towards learning had a huge change and that\u2019s why I\u2019m able to improve quite a lot. Yet, I do think that not everyone is a \u201cstudy material\u201d, meaning no matter how much you study, you still can\u2019t get the desired results. But this doesn\u2019t stop those people from achieving, they tend to do very well in college courses which they have strong interest in. Therefore you can see if you are considered as this group of people who just couldn\u2019t accommodate to the usual high school education curriculum. ",

I guess I was wrong.\u201d \u201cWhy don't you TRY at least?\u201d I've heard everything. My parents and teachers considered me an overconfident, procrastinating waste of immense talent. I didn't feel I was wasting myself though- I felt I simply was not challenged appropriately. School was boring and pointless; my teachers idiots who simply read from the text book- I could teach myself everything they spent the year droning about, a day before the exam. How could I be expected to do well in assessments for subjects I found pedantic and unnecessary? Now that I'm a teacher, I see how I was failed by an unsatisfactory education system. I did extremely well in subjects where I felt inspired by the teacher, or the material. The rest? I didn't give a shit. If you feel unmotivated by your curriculum or the faculty, chances are you won't do well. But here's the catch- nobody cares that your school sucks. They won't ask you WHY you didn't do well in high school. So how do you do better? Motivate yourself: Find a way to like the subject. Connect to it. I hated chemistry until I started going to the lab.Find out what your teachers require: Understanding concepts means nothing if you can't translate your knowledge onto the paper (or screen). How must you structure your answers? How much research is required? When should you cite? Who should you cite? Ask for help.Take notes: Trust me, even with a photographic memory, a person forgets. Learning is not simply visual, it is kinesthetic and audio as well. Whatever you hear that is new to you, note it down. Whatever you did in class, should be in your notebook for later reference.Come prepared: Read a few chapters ahead, or find alternate sources of information. The more you know, the better impression you'll make. Which brings us to our last\u2026.Impress your teacher: I'm going to be honest; we tweak grades. I push my students into A territory if I feel they've worked hard most of the term. An exam is such an arbitrary way of judging a student's potential and seasoned teachers don't give numbers the same value as a student's year round effort. If we see you focused, we will help you get that grade.If your teachers call you brilliant even though you're failing, you must be a prodigy, and regardless of what people tell you, geniuses are taken seriously primarily if they do well in school. Work on yourself. ",

Until you get a professional tutor or seek help from the guidance councillor who can put you with a special how to study skills program you are going to continue spinning your wheels. You needed to start this in Gr. 6 so you went into high school with skills and time management skills. Trying to get them 3 wk. before finals is not enough time. Do your best for now and take the grades you get as a lesson learned. Start with a new fresh time and start working with a tutor on study skills over the summer so that you have a good start to next year and the rest of high school. Your summer is not playtime. It\u2019s serious catchup on learning how to study and getting some basics in Math and English and Science learned! Money that will be well spent. All the anxiety and time you spend here will bring you nothing but more anxiety and waste of time. Where are your parents in all this. Why are they not trying to help you? How is it that you got this far without some signs that didn\u2019t indicate that you were on the wrong track heading for failure? When every out don\u2019t understand something go to your teacher. IF you don\u2019t get help then find a student tutor. If that doesn\u2019t work then start paying for a private tutor. STOP WAISTING YOUR TIME HERE AND START GETTING THE PROFESSIONAL TUTOR. BUT IT IS TOO LATE FOR THIS YEAR!! THIS IS SOEMTHING THAT HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND YOU NEED SERIOUS HELP! ",

See, potential is a word that people love to throw around, but in the grand scheme of things it really means nothing. No one is going to pay you for your potential (unless you are a professional athlete LOL). They are going to pay you for your production! So what are you actually producing right now? Failing grades is not production. You need to get some help organizing and your teachers are the first place to start with getting that help. Perhaps a well organized classmate might be an asset as well, but YOU need to be the one who takes ownership of your organizational challenges. Perhaps you have a learning disability? No fault of your own\u2026but again, you need to be able to come up with some strategies for dealing with that. So I guess what I am trying to say is, you need to get some help. YOU need to get some help. That means you need to seek it out. It is not going to chase you down. It is not going to tackle you and make you do it. Go, and ask someone to help you (teacher, friend, guidance counselor, school psychologist) because it is not going to get better on its own. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there buddy! Here are some study hacks I can think of\u2026 Attendance comes first. Do not miss classes or days at school unless it is absolutely necessary. There is information given in class that you cannot get later. Keep notes and handouts organized, and in order. When you are given a handout, put the date at the top so it stays in the right order in your binder. If you have to read and make notes on a chapter, do it right away, the same night. Don't let reading assignments pile up; in fact, don't put anything off. If you stay on top of it, you don't have to worry about going under. If you don't understand something or are struggling, get help right away. Don't give up until that teacher has helped you figure it out. The only stupid question is the one that isn't asked. I hate to say it, but teachers are human, and when they grade work their feelings about the student do come into play to a small degree. Do not grub for grades, make a pest of yourself, act up in class or do anything else that will lower your teacher's opinion of you. Review periodically throughout the term - you will be better prepared for exams. Start studying early for exams, and do not study the night before a test or the day of it. If you don't know it by then, you haven't done it right. Don't cram. Study in an area that has everything you need. There is no need to eliminate television, music, etc. unless it interferes with your concentration. Some students study better with a bit of activity around them, others need absolute quiet. Determine what works for you. Time management is critical. Set a time period to do homework and study that is consistent, and do not go beyond it. Say from 7 - 9 p.m. This is after dinner, and allows for you to watch a little tv, read, get ready for bed, and still get to sleep early. It is important to have a set schedule and stick to it, or your studies will run away with you and you'll get burned out. Let things go. If you're hung up on a 13/20, you're not focusing on getting a higher mark on the next thing. Don't belabor your work - if the essay is done, and it looks good, let it go, don't keep picking at it. Perfectionism and obsessiveness will do you in if you're not careful. That's about all I can think of, hope it helps, and have a good day! ",

Imagine, you will be wrong at times but you will gather the right facts.Disregard the people who put you down. Surround yourself with people who you think are creative and smart. It might make you look dumb at times but that's the price you pay to grow.Oh and did I tell you , you are not depressed. You are wonderful the way you are. Go on my friend.

OK they matter when you are trying to get into some school maybe; when you have no work record maybe someone will care about them. But it\u2019s not all that. It\u2019s certainly NOT worth killing yourself over! Besides you will figure this out. If you are of average or better intelligence you will be able to get decent grades. Might be worth looking at whether you have learning disabilities but there other first steps. Talk to your teachers, talk to your school counselor. Tell them you feel you can do better but really don\u2019t know to study effectively. Ask for help. Almost any teacher, every teacher, will want to help. If you don\u2019t feel they are helpful tell your parents that you want to find a tutor or after school study program that can help you learn. ",

In any event, if you have bad grades there are several things you can do about it: ask the teacher for help, especially if you don\u2019t understand something. Perhaps there is some extra homework you can do to practice more before testsstudy longer hours. If you are getting Cs when you study say 2 hours, then it makes sense that to get an A you would need to study a lot more, say 6 hours, provided you understand the material.get a tutor. This is probably the best idea because then you can get one on one help to understand the material.Even in a worst case scenario if you flunked out of high school, it isn\u2019t the end of the world.

Keep that in mind, get over that stupid crap, do your homework regularly, and you will succeed. You\u2019ll feel GREAT if you do so, trust me.

Since you already know about all the \u201cstudy methods\u201d and still you are not able to work you way of this problem I would suggest you take time and understand what you are studying first. Understanding your ciricullum is the most important thing. For that try reading the sentences in your mother tongue to understand it better or take help from your teachers, friends or/and family, hell even internet. NEVER be shy to ask questions to clear your doubts. At first it might go all slow but slowly as you get an understanding of the subject you are studying you can write on your own in your exams and better your grades. Hope that was helpful to you, Good day! ",

            "answer_text": "When you have depression, it's hard to find motivation to do the things you need or want to do. Having depression is not a curse or a mistake, that's the first thing to realize. Depression can be overwhelming and very draining and that's okay. The best way to be productive while you have depression is to take small steps. You might just study for ten minutes but that's better than none. Slowly you can add another minute to those minutes. Also it helps to try and make studying fun if you watch interesting videos on the topic or have someone to motivate you. Other than that, meditation helps to refocus your mind. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "To me it seems like 1 or 2 problems. 1) You might be trying to cram, study all this the day before. Studying days or even a week before would practice moving that info from short term memory to long term, so you can remember it for the test. 2) You might not be making a connection to the material. Brute memorization doesn\u2019t give you an understanding. What helps me is I try to make the info fun and relate-able. The weirder/funnier you make the connection the better (remember Roy G BIV for teh visible colors in science?). And lastly as a tip, study the material ahead and then meet with a friend (one that gets this stuff) and explain the material to him. If you can explain it to someone, then you can explain it on a test. Plus, because he/she gets this, that person can correct you if you don\u2019t get the material completely. Best of luck! ",
