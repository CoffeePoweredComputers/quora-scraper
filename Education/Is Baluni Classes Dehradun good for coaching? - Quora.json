I had been there, actually i have studied 11th and 12th with coaching for JEE and trust me those two years are the worst years of my life. I regret every single time whenever this thing passes through my mind. I was good in academics, so my parents thought I should join their coaching + schooling program, but what they did to us was horrifying. I won\u2019t suggest at any cost BALUNI CLASSES to anyone. ",
