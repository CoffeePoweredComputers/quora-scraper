            "answer_text": "Hello I think the classes will begin soon after admission procedures are over . I think that they will begin in Online mode as it is going on for other previous batches as it is the best feasible way to begin with without wasting more time . As currently offline classes aren\u2019t feasible , since IITs , NITs etc etc have students from all over India , so it would be difficult for everyone to move from one place to another . Also following social distancing is almost impossible in classes and hostels , mess and everything will be mess then . So it is quite impossible currently , but can\u2019t say for sure , when government takes another step towards this , as in the last phase , it was left to state govt to take the decisions for schools and colleges . Hope that currently in December hopefully or after Diwali , classes will begin in Online Mode . Rest let\u2019s see. Thanks Do comment your views. ",
