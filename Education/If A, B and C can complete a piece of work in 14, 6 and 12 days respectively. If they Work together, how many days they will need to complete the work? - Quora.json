            "answer_text": "Well it depends. If 3 people are constructing a wall or some physical labor then the work per day of each person gets added up to give an estimate. Mathematically that would be about 3.11 days.  But if 3 people are involved in an intellectual work, say solving a mathematical proof or creating a new algorithm. If there is an eureka moment then the work could get done within a day. If it is a harder problem or a problem which does not have a specific correct answer, it may take much longer It is like 9 women cannot get pregnant together to give birth to one child in one month.

Alice and Bob have an ideological disagreement about the implementation and they sabotage each other constantly. It\u2019s an open secret that Bob and Carol had an affair a few months back and the fallout has been nasty. Alice likes Carol but Carol thinks Alice is the one stealing her lunch every day so she tends to be passive aggressive about everything. Together, the work gets completed in about 3 months. But is actively on fire when they declare it finished. ",
