            "answer_text": "There are two parts to this answer: First, there is the Summer School program.  This is an extension of the school year, in some districts as corrective action for failing students, in others it's a parent-option for a little extra help.  These programs are usually pretty distinct from the regular year.  Classes are smaller and there is a greater emphasis on basic skills.  In my district, it is often seen as an opportunity to try out new programs - often computer based.Then there is the \"take home\" work that some districts assign to children to help prep them for the upcoming year.  This is the same sort of stuff kids see during the year, mostly based on grade appropriate reading.  The big difference is that it's self-guided. ",
