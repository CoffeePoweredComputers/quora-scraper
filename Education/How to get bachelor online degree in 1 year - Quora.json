            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see how, if the bachelor\u2019s degree requires you to take and successfully complete 120\u2013128 credits. If you began at a community college, and after two years transferred to a four year school, then took an overload of courses during the two semesters, plus took summer courses and, if the school offers winter session courses, took courses then, you MIGHT be able to cram two years of coursework into a little more than one year. That is still a big maybe, because the school might not offer the courses you need when you need them (they might only be offered during the semesters, never during the much shorter summer sessions and winter session, if there is a winter session. Most schools don\u2019t offer courses during the January intersession.) Online doesn\u2019t mean \u201cfast\u201d. It just means that you go to your computer and the college\u2019s online platform for classes instead of a lecture hall or a science lab. If they\u2019re an accredited, reputable college, you\u2019ll follow the same academic calendar as the campus based students, meaning that courses last the entire semester or even a whole year if your major requires you to take year-long courses. It sounds like you\u2019re looking for a diploma mill rather than an actual degree program. Diploma mills aren\u2019t reputable, which means prospective employers don\u2019t respect them nor accept them if the jobs require college degrees, nor will future graduate and professional schools accept them. You could shorten the length of time it takes you to complete your Bachelor\u2019s degree if you can CLEP your way through some courses/credits, and if you took and did well enough on some AP courses in high school. Another way to try to chip away at it would be if a local community college had a program for high school students. What they do is let high school kids take college courses, usually during their senior year, and if the kids take enough community college courses (they will have to be college level courses, not the remedial/developmental courses) and do well enough in them academically, those courses will transfer towards their Bachelors\u2019 degrees. I knew a student who did that, and she will complete her degree at Smith College in three years instead of four years because she got almost a whole year\u2019s worth of college credits in during her senior year in high school. I also believe she was able to get some college credit for her high school AP courses. But even then, she couldn\u2019t finish in year\u2019s time. ",

            "answer_text": "Someone once created a website detailing how to get a legitimate BA from a regionally accredited college, starting from scratch in\u2026.4 weeks!! Lawrie Miller's BA in 4 Weeks. Online degrees by distance learning. BA degree and graduate degees The main point of this approach is to test out the degrees by taking AP/CLEP/DANTES exams and also GRE subject tests(which had a credit value of 15\u201330 credits at that time). Unfortunately, all the Big-3 schools mentioned on the website stopped giving credit to the GRE subject tests, so BA in 4 weeks is not possible anymore. Nevertheless, this website inspired (and still does) many adult and independent learners towards non-traditional degrees. Degree in one year is very very ambitious. I can\u2019t say it is impossible, but it requires lot of time, patience and dedication. Having said that, please go through the following wiki created by many successful non-traditional learners. Degree Forum Wiki I am a proud member and contributor to the following forums, which are dedicated to earning college credit (and degrees) by non-traditional means. Please join, read the stickies for newbies, and post any specific questions there: DegreeInfo Distance Learning - online degree forum Online Degrees and CLEP and DSST Exam Prep Discussion ",

I just had to transfer in three years worth of credits from a different institution. If you're starting from nothing, I'm sure there are online diploma mills which will sell you the degree. Of course, it won't be worth the paper it's printed on, but such is life. ",

            "answer_text": "Beware of any online university which claims to have accelerated programs of study for matriculation especially in technical fields like engineering or science. This same should hold for just about all other majors. And here is why. Every real world college or university worth its merit has all majors accredited by an independent accreditation board for that field of study. For example I studied mechanical engineering at CSULB and all their engineering programs are accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). If an online university offers an expedited course of study to get a degree the chances that what they offer is either not accredited, accredited by a loosely accepted accreditation board, or a completely bogus accreditation board altogether.
