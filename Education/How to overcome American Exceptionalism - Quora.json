            "answer_text": "How do you overcome American Exceptionalism? I don\u2019t know what the textbook definition of American Exceptionalism is, but the strangest thing happens to people that uphold the idea that America is exceptional when confronted with its history in the slave trade, its decimation of the indigenous population in order to grab territory, and maintaining slavery while extolling the virtues of freedom to the world. They start to recite how these acts have happened in so many other countries and civilizations, failing to see that this flies in the face of the America as exceptional concept. There are things that make America exceptional in the sense of it being unique. But when people suggest that America is exceptional meaning better than or superior to, then their argument becomes weak when American history is reviewed, compared, and contrasted with the histories of other nations and empires. One thing lately that has gotten a lot of attention lately is the president\u2019s \u201cshithole\u201d comments about the continent of Africa, and the countries of Haiti and El Salvador. Nobody has asked if things have been done by \u201cexceptional\u201d America and European nations to retard the growth and development of these places. It certainly would make a good deal of sense if \u201cexceptional\u201d America honored Haiti for having overthrown slavery and championed freedom and human rights when it did. That didn\u2019t happen. Is there any American (as well as French and European) complicity in the poor condition of Haiti, El Salvador, and nations in Africa or would that information be classified for national security? ",

            "answer_text": "Easy: become a progressive. Here are some of their major points: Is it a bad idea to write a college application essay about how much one hates America? I loathe American capitalism. I loathe the school system, and most other bureaucratic institutions. I loathe the fucked-up political system. What should I expect if I submit such an essay to an American college? And here are some thoughts on American Exceptionalism: Things that have made America exceptional in recent years: 1 - the most citizens incarcerated in prison; 2 - the highest per capita cost of health care for poor outcomes; 3 - the number of countries invaded and/or simply bombed with massive civilian casualties; 4 - the number of citizens who believe in creationism and who think the sun orbits the earth; 5 - the number of guns held by citizens and the belief that these guns could prevent a tyranny; and 6 - the number of citizens who cannot find their own country on a map of the world. And on the U.S. Constitution: What important ideas has the U.S. Constitution contributed to the government? None. The US Constitution was cobbled together from other ideas that had been floating around about governance and compromises that deferred the resolution of our sectional rivalries so long that there was a civil war. But don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 talk to them. ",

What is worse is that the very people who should know this almost instinctively refuse to listen. So, education particularly a good education in modern world history and some geography should eliminate the idea that the US is all that exceptional. ",
