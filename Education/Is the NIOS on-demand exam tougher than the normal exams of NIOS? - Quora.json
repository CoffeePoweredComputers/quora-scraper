            "answer_text": "The truth is that it's tougher than public examinations, People say it's easy but the answer is NO.Marking and Question patterns are pathetic. Sometimes you may think that you may get above 80marks but end up getting just above pass marks.Since there is no TMA you have to pass with THEORY AND PRACTICALS alone which makes it tougher to pass the exam.After every on demand examinations you have to wait 3\u20134 months for results if it's failed or low marks then again have to apply for another On demand exam and wait for the results in next 3\u20134 months. So in short it's a cycle. After the results been declared again wait for 2 months for certificates.",
