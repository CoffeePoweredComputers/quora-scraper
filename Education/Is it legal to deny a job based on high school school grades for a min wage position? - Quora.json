            "answer_text": "I remember that when I was 16 and a junior in high school, and I was offered a part-time job during the school year (McDonalds on the weekends)., I had to go to my guidance counselor and get some signed forms, then my father and I drove over to the school district headquarters, where I had an interview and then they took the paper-work and issued me a work permit. Without a work permit, if you were under the age of 18, you were Not allowed to have a job at the same time school was in session. And having poor grades was the primary reason for the school district to Deny you a work permit. Just a point. Also, when I applied to that job at McDonalds, I had to provide the manager a copy of my high school transcript. They only wanted the Best and the Brightest to work with the customers and to work in the store. ",

It\u2019s perfectly legal, in fact it\u2019s largely expected that there will be discrimination on other grounds. For example, discrimination on the grounds of likely to be capable of doing the job is very much encouraged. ",
