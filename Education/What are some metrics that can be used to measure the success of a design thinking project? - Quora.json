            "answer_text": "The success of a design thinking project depends on the kind of design and the goals of the brief. Every project - whether it\u2019s the design of a poster, a staircase, a traffic flow system, an event, or a chair - will have a different set of goals which will be determined by the brief. The success of a project is measured by how well it meets these goals, which should always be clearly defined before any design project starts. There is not one set of metrics that can be used to measure design success as a whole as design is such a broad world. ",
