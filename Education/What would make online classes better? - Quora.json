            "answer_text": "It has me thinking about what it would mean to improve online classes. A few ideas come to mind: Use multiple platforms. I\u2019m not against using an LMS as a central hub. However, I think it\u2019s valuable to experiment with the types of productivity tools you will actually use outside of a classroom. Use Google Docs to share ideas, create surveys, and ask questions. Use Google Hangouts to meet as a group.Go project-based. I haven\u2019t figured this out entirely with my first class but my hope is that we can go fully project-based in the same way that my face-to-face class is. In fact, the asynchronous nature of online classes actually means there is a better potential of creating a project-based culture that mirrors the way people actually work on projects.Make something together. I use a collaboration grid with co-creating and communicating on separate spectrums (x-axis) and multimedia and text on another spectrum (y-axis). This has been an effective way to think through collaborative tools that allow students to co-create.Embrace a synchronous/asynchronous blend: I love using Voxer because students can speak back and forth in the moment. However, if they miss it, they can listen to it later. The same is true of using a Google Hangouts On Air.Make it more connective. We tend to treat online instruction as if it is a linear process and we don\u2019t do enough to link things back and forth and connect ideas, resources, discussions and content creation in a seamless, back-and-forth nature.Incorporate multimedia. It\u2019s a simple idea, but I create a short video at the beginning of each week and I encourage students to create video and audio as well. This has a way of making things more concrete. There\u2019s something deeply human about hearing an actual human voice. I know, crazy, right?Go mobile. I don\u2019t simply mean use a smart phone. I mean assign some things that allow students to get out in the world and create videos, snap pictures, or simply experience something without technology that they reflect on later.Find connections outside of class. If you are on Twitter or you are blogging and you have a network of people you can reach out to, then do it. Ask them to join a discussion or leave a comment or join a hangout. I love the connected community and I want to expose my students to some awesome people I\u2019ve met online.Get input from veteran faculty. I know this sounds counterintuitive in a culture that celebrates youth and perpetuates the myth that younger means more tech-savvy. However, I have a list of things that I am trying out because of a professor who has been at my school for awhile. She has been thinking deeply about this subject for a few years and she\u2019s sharp.Figure out where technology works better. The other day, I was talking to a professor about an online class on classroom management. It\u2019s tough to do that in an online format. However, video recording one\u2019s approachable and authoritative voice can be a great tool for reflection. Use Sketch-Up to design classroom space. There are certain areas where the tech version works just as well or better than the off-line version.Embrace technology criticism. Look, there are things that suck about our digital world. There are real problems with staring at a screen and missing the world. So, find ways to incorporate media criticism into the online classes you create.I don\u2019t pretend to know all the answers to online learning. For what it\u2019s worth, I am a huge fan of using a blended approach. However, my experience in interacting with the connected community has taught me that we are far more human online than we\u2019d like to believe. ",
