I struggle to remember the faces of those children who have not been doing their work. Next week they will probably be back at school. I will have to retest all my students to jiggle the groups. Those who have done the work each day will be put in to higher groups. Those of my academically at-risk students who have not done the work may well have gone backwards. ",
