            "answer_text": "There isn't a specific type of person. Teachers come from all walks of life, and just like every other profession, there are many types of teachers. I think if this question were worded differently, such as: \u201cWhat characteristic is common amongst strong, passionate teachers?\u201d\u2026 you might get a more accurate answer. In response to my revised version of the question, I would say that typically people delve into the world of education because they truly want to help students become successful. So a common characteristic would be an intense drive. Someone who is tenacious, and doesn't give up easily. Education goes through many ups and downs, and for the five years I've been in it, I've seen a lot of people get burnt out and leave. It's not an easy field to be in these days. With that said, watching the light bulb go off in students' heads never gets old, and being a small part of someone's life that helps to shape who they are is magical. ",

            "answer_text": "Most common reasons I have heard so far. It's a practical fallback for many educated graduates when their first career option did not work out. Schools will always need new teachers and so long you are someone capable of finishing university, it is relatively easier to get a teaching position compare to jobs of other fields. This in turn provides a stable income.They enjoy working with children as well as nurturing them. This is particularly true with many females who choose to become a primary school teacher.For many females (and some males) , they tend to feel that their nurturing skills, organization skills and perhaps their ability to manage a household compliments with their ability to be a teacher.For those with a family, the formal working hours of a school teacher allows for them to have more quality time with their family.They inherited many of their teaching skill sets from their parents, who themselves are teachers. So it seems practical for them to become teachers.The not so common reasons I have heard are They like teaching and sharing knowledge with others.They had a good experience learning with a teacher in their former school.Something happened at one point in their lives that inspired them to be teachers.",
