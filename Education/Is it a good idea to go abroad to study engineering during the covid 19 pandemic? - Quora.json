            "answer_text": "Just to tweak your question a bit. Going abroad during Panademic and Studying engineering irrespective of situation are two different points. For the current scenario, most universities have started online classes until situation is under control and International universities opens door to welcome students on campus You might not want to waste a time of your life wondering whether Studying engineering is right or wrong unless you have a job in hand and time to study later. If not, I recommend not to waste year or more to figure out when will situation be okay. PS: universities have not stopped their admissions neither classes. Everything is running smoothly and all students enrolled are right on their timeline. Yes, with a little difference (not been able to enjoy university life). If you need any further guidance on your application, courses, scholarships etc. Feel free to connect with me on Instagram (Link given in bio) Happy to help :) ",
