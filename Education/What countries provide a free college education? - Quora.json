            "answer_text": "These are few countries which offer free education: Germany In 2014, Germany\u2019s 16 states abolished tuition fees for undergraduate students at all public German universities. This means that currently both domestic and international undergraduates at public universities in Germany can study for free, with just a small fee to cover administration and other costs per semester.  Sweden Because Sweden is a member of the European Union (EU), the tuition fee rules for nationals also apply to citizens from the EU/EEA, other Nordic countries, and Switzerland. Exchange students are also exempt from fees, as their studies follow agreements between Swedish and foreign universities.  Norway Public universities in Norway do not charge students tuition fees, regardless of the student's country of origin. This is a unique opportunity to obtain a degree at a quality university at no cost, and one of many reasons why Norway has become an attractive country for foreign students.  There are few other countries but their fee structure does contain some other forms of fee. ",
