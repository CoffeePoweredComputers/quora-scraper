            "answer_text": "in my opinion, private schools should not be banned since it can be a last resort for well off or middle class parents to send their kids there if they\u2019re living close to public schools that's known for being dangerous, low staffing, a well known gang presence in that school, lack of school supplies and materials, and poor teaching quality. most teachers working at these private schools would be shattered once they lose a job with good pay that can pay off their student debt and ensure great financial success. they would have to go to a public school, if unlucky, where the pay is bad, students constantly being unruly towards the teachers or to a student during class (i\u2019ve witnessed this when i was a student in middle to high school in the city), having to deal with low numbers of textbooks and supplies either due to low funding caused politics or the school test scores being so bad the government cuts back on the funds and grants on that school. public schools are far more stressful to the teacher and demoralizing the worser the school is. of course there are private schools that are subpar due to greed or just scams that are being beaten by other public schools if they\u2019re are less dangerous, teachers paid well (rise in quality teaching), low amounts of students being part of gangs will do little harm to school safety, the students not having problems at home will do better in school, funded generously where new textbooks are abundant and teaching teachers how to use technology efficiently will have an easier time explaining to students. the idea of banning private schools is a lazy plan. the problems some public schools are facing will still be there once private schools are banned.

            "answer_text": "I think all the people here without realising answered why should private schools be banned. EQUALITY From several different perspectives we can see that private schools are dangerous for the greater good. Capitalistic perspective  Capitalsim is in essence a method for establishing meritocracy for the production of goods and at the same time a stick with carrot on it. But for the %100 percent usage of the societys potencial everybody should get a good education which private schools indirectly sabotage through redirecting capable tutors to other schools, presudo-solution for education problems which prevent education systems evolution, and allowing rich to have a safe heaven for their childer while others suffer etc. Protection of social harmony  Now i dont feel the requirement to explain why seperating people to classes is bad, i believe there are many historic cases and social movements enough to make people be aware of this. White, black, rich, poor, left, right, german, jew, turk, armenian\u2026 There has never been a case in history which making people group up against other groups has been peaceful. Its effective for production, raising soldiers etc. but humanity has grown out of that phase and we shouldn't repeat the mistake of the history by seperating children from a young age. Not to mention to the extend private schools are good at science education they are terrible on raising proper humans with morals and respect because teachers don't have any power over the students and they know it. Imagine being a private school teacher and in front of you there are 10 students one of the kids father is a drug baron, 4 them are kids of high goverment officers and other 5 are kids of jillionares how the duck that teacher is going to even give bad notes to them without dying in a pit let alone not loosing his job.
