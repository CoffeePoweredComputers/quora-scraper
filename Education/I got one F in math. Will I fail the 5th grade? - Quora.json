            "answer_text": "No, you won\u2019t fail 5th grade. But honestly, you may be missing the point. If you made an F in math, you really need to find out why and correct your performance. Elementary math skills are the building blocks for Algebra 1. Without strong skills in arithmetic and a solid number sense, Algebra 1 can be harder than it already will be due to the more abstract concepts you will be learning. So my advice? Talk to your teacher and get outside help. Be a self-advocate and talk to your parents/guardians about getting more help with your math class. And never, ever, quit or give up. Good luck, and cheers!
