            "answer_text": "Seven- eight months is a small line in the life of our children to give up on hopes. COVID will ultimately end and humanity will find an answer to this pandemic. And life will become normal again, although with the learnings from Corona virus incorporated into our life style. Children are less prone to attack by Corona. However, their health and life is too precious for every parent even to allow them exposure for any possible infection. Therefore, it is for their good and our peace of mind that schools are closed and out door activities including sports are temporarily stopped. But we can\u2019t lock up the physical energy of children so as to stop them from out door sports. That would not just be cruel but unacceptable to human civilisation. Things will change, must change and will change. Just have hope in human ingenuity and nature\u2019s kindness. ",
