            "answer_text": "the Quote \u201cThe whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows\u201d written by Sydney J Harris gives a great meaning.  As far as my understanding is considered here the mirror indicates barriers.The barriers may be a belief that education is just getting marks rather than acquiring knowledge and skills and confined classroom teaching.The purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows that means once the barriers are removed then the mirrors would turn into windows.Different students may have different goals and every student sees the world in a different perspective.Real education makes students potent to utilize opportunities in the world in which they excel.There should not be any barriers then mirrors would turn into windows. So many students are not getting into the fields in which their natural interest lies.It may be because of a societal belief that if they choose popular courses like engineering,law, medicine etc,they would be settled faster but actually they kill their creativity and forcefully enter into other fields. let\u2019s explain it with an example.Albert Einstein Noble laureate in physics. He is best known for his theory of relativity which marked a revolution in physics.Actually Einstein at school was considered as dull student and even got expelled from his school.He did not like his school,because he hated the conventional form of education which would concentrate much on getting degree and getting into a job.he thought it would not impart any skill.he was creative in science later he succeeded in his career.He could succeed because he removed his barriers and he studied in which he had natural interest.There are so many people who could actually find their interest in the world and created histories in different fields. So what should be done in order to make the quote \u201cthe whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows\u201dtrue. First all the students should be left free to choose their own careers in which their actual interest lies.Learning process in education should not just confined to class rooms,it should be expanded beyond class rooms and should be more practical.All educational institutions should enrich their resources to encourage students in different research fields.They should be in a position to utilize the opportunities which the world presents to students.I believe all these things would remove barriers and help them to turn mirrors into windows.

            "answer_text": "\u201c What is education? Is it book-learning? No. Is it diverse knowledge? Not even that. The training by which the current and expression of will are brought under control and become fruitful is called education. Now consider, is that education as a result of which the will, being continuously choked by force through generations, is well-nigh killed out; is that education under whose sway even the old ideas, let alone the new ones, are disappearing one by one; is that education which is slowly making man a machine? It is more blessed, in my opinion, even to go wrong, impelled by one\u2019s free will and intelligence than to be good as an automaton. Again, can that be called society which is formed by an aggregate of men who are like lumps of clay, like lifeless machines, like heaped up pebbles? How can such society fare well? Were good possible, then instead of being slaves for hundreds of years, we would have been the greatest nation on earth, and this soil of India, instead of being a mine of stupidity, would have been the eternal fountain-head of learning.
