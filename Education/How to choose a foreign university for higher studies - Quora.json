            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. First of all, decide what exactly you want to pursue your higher studies in because this aspect of your decision massively affects your applications and future prospects. If you\u2019ve already done so, you can go ahead and decide what country you want to pursue your higher studies in. For selecting the country for your higher studies, I suggest to refer to the different prospects for international graduates from universities in different countries. For example, I\u2019ve done my Bachelor\u2019s in Mechanical Engineering, so if I\u2019ll prefer New Zealand as my destination if my niche is Aerospace Engineering or US/Germany if its Advanced manufacturing. Here\u2019s a list of a few countries you may want to further your studies in: United States of AmericaUnited KingdomGermanyCanadaAustrailiaBased on this, you need to prepare and give the required tests, viz. GRE/GMAT for Master\u2019s and SAT/ACT for Bachelor\u2019s, in addition to IELTS/TOEFL/PTE language tests. You can refer to numerous test guides and blogs on the internet to get information on them and prepare for the same. Next comes university shortlisting. For me, I relied entirely on Yocket\u2019s services to list out the specific courses and which university offers them. I\u2019ve answered a question on comparing two countries with the help of Yocket\u2019s services which you can refer to here. For this, you need your test scores to gauge the level of your profile and estimate your chances of landing an admit letter from the shorlisted university. You can use Yocket\u2019s Profile Finder tool to go through the previous profiles who received an admit from the concerned university. Furthermore, you can look into the scholarships offered by the university and other financial aids once you are in the campus. After shortlisting, you have to start applying for the universities before their deadline. You can check out the deadline for courses on the University\u2019s website, or you can refer to Yocket\u2019s website and use their University Deadlines tool. For this, you need to be prepared with your statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, resume, transcript, certificates and ofcourse, your test scores. If you need an expert to help you with all your application process, profile building, loan/scholarship applications, you can schedule a free 15 mins appointment with an experienced individual on Yocket and ask them all your queries regarding the whole process of applying for higher studies abroad. Hope this helps. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "When deciding on which university is right for you, you need to look at a number of factors. Don\u2019t base your decision on rankings alone; this is only one point of reference. You need to identify and evaluate other criteria too. Some may play a larger role than others, so prioritize what\u2019s important to you. Some examples of factors include: 1) Facilities & Faculty: Are you looking to pursue entrepreneurship? Do you wish to take courses in health care or real estate management? Are you looking for a semester abroad? It\u2019s important to choose a program that not only offers you facilities and faculty in your area of interest, but also has a strong reputation in it. Research the curriculum at the school and determine the school\u2019s expertise and focus areas. 2) Proximity to Family: For example, if you have family that you want to stay with in New York, choosing a university in California means that you are six-hour flight away. 3) Size: If you flourish in a small classroom environment with personalized attention, choosing a large university with a class size of nearly 1000 students will hinder your learning experience. Check the school website and brochures to find out what the student: teacher ratio is. 4) Campus or City University: If you prefer college grounds to encompass everything you need, from where you study to where you eat, then a campus university may be a better fit. However, if you are more inclined towards a city life, and are comfortable with public transport, then a city university may be for you. 5) Cost: If attaining financial aid is a priority, then you need to select colleges that are known to offer scholarships to international students. 6) Employment Opportunities: If you are looking to find a job in investment banking then will the career services department be able to help you with that? What types of companies are recruiting at the university and for what types of opportunities? You should factor this into your decision, based on the career path that you have in mind. 7) Location: Pursuing a degree in the UK vs. USA vs. Singapore vs. Canada can have very different implications. Even though the curriculum may be similar, your overall experience will be significantly different. When you evaluate all the other factors stated above, you will also begin to narrow in on the geographical location \u2013 for example if you are looking for a one year course, then Europe has more options available. If you are looking to be close to family and home, then perhaps a University in Singapore would be a right fit. Or, if you wish to work in the country after graduation then Canada may provide more opportunities. Make sure you can answer these questions: Why do I want to go to THIS University? Does it meet not only my academic needs, but also my professional strengths and preferences? Your MBA experience is an important stepping-stone towards your long-term career goals, so it\u2019s imperative you find an environment where you can thrive.
