            "answer_text": "Yes , anyone can start business without education but,  He/she should have the knowledge related to the business , official education like going to school , University, etc are not necessary but unofficial education like reading biography , autobiography, business books , personality development etc is necessary for running a successful career in business . But basic education is must required for a business, If you start a business you must know all the fundamentals related to your business, You must try to discover loopholes of your business, try to manage people, I know people who were college, school dropouts, yet they build a successful business So official education is not necessary but with help of unofficial education one can start a business.
