            "answer_text": "British universities tend not to have fraternities or sororities; students generally spend their first year of university in a 'hall of residence' which will consist of individual rooms, frequently with an en-suite bathroom and shared kitchen facilities. Many of these are mixed-sex, and generally there is just one student per room. Some universities provide meals to students but not many; most cook for themselves. In their second and final years, students will generally share a house in small groups, although it varies. We also rarely have 'Greek' organisations. A large majority of students will graduate with an honours degree, so being an 'honours' student isn't the, um, honour that it may be elsewhere. If anything, an honours degree is the 'norm'. ",

            "answer_text": "American students constantly talk about how much work they have to do/how long they have spent in the library.  This is deeply uncool in the UK  where people pretend to have been lazing around even if they've been working hard e.g. 'I haven't done any work, I'm so going to fail this exam'. It's part of the Americans being 'can do' and Brits being self deprecating thing. ",
