            "answer_text": "Will you be moved to the next grade if you failed 2 core classes in high school? Students do not fail a grade in high school. BUT you also do not graduate until you have passed ALL required classes AND additional electives to bring up the number of credits passed to the minimum required by your district to graduate. If you have not accomplished that by the end of the senior year, you will not graduate and will be what is often called a fifth year senior. If you fail a core class which is a prerequisite for another class, you will either have to pass the class you failed before you can move to the next one OR you will have to take the two classes simultaneously. It is a decision each individual school makes and it may be different among departments. For example: If you fail English 9, you may be required to pass it before you can take English 10\u2014-which would mean either a summer school session or an additional year before graduation\u2014-OR you may be allowed to take English 9 and 10 at the same time. ONLY your own school can tell you what their policy is. I have taught English in high schools that did it both ways. If you fail, say, algebra 1 you will almost certainly be required to pass it before you can take the next math class in the sequence. Each department may well have its own policies. The decision sometimes has to do with the perception of how necessary the skills taught in the class you failed are to pass the next course in the sequence. It is perceived more often that English or social studies.can be doubled up better than math or science, but there is no guarantee. As an English teacher, I can only say that students I have had in class who failed one year and took two hours of English the next year did not find it to be a great time. In any case, if you take two classes in a sequence in the next year, you will give up one of your electives unless you go to summer school or take an extra class online. TALK TO YOUR COUNSELOR! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the school. Here are some possibilities: 1). You have to repeat the year. This is unlikely, but if the school handbook requires you to pass your classes, you might have to repeat. 2). Make up the classes. You might be able to do projects over summer or take tests, etc. to make up for the failing grade. 3). You could be taking the same class again next year along with your other classes. For example if you failed algebra 2 in freshmen year, then you might just re-take algebra 2 in 10th grade instead of precalc. Again these are only possibilities, you should check your handbook on class requirements or ask a school official. ",
