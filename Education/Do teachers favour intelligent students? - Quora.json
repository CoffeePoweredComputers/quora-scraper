            "answer_text": "I favor efficient students. If there is one thing I despise then it\u2019s explaining one thing 2+ times when I\u2019ve explained it twice for the whole class and you just didn\u2019t feel like listening. I will leave you hanging for not paying attention - you are literally wasting time. Oh no, not my time. But yours and your classmates\u2019 time. Honestly, maybe you should start by actually reading the question and trying to think for a change. I\u2019m not your mother that I must literally spell it out for you and I won\u2019t, either, unless I\u2019m at my wits end. Intelligent means capable of learning. Perhaps I do favor students that are capable of learning. I mean, if you aren\u2019t, then your place isn\u2019t in public school but somewhere more specialized to teach you important life skills so you can maximize your independence. If this is not your case, then I suppose you are intelligent as in capable of learning. I favor students who are polite and respect other people\u2019s right to study in a calm and safe environment. Just because you don\u2019t enjoy it doesn\u2019t mean you get to ruin it for everybody else. That\u2019s violence and bullying and I will not stand for it. If you don\u2019t feel like you have a talent for it, then news flash, talent means nothing. Begin by making an effort, and sooner or later you will be good at it if you let yourself. It\u2019s not about talent, talent is brushing off responsibility, and if it comes easy, you\u2019re not really learning. ",

            "answer_text": "This actually depends more on the personality of that \u201cintelligent\u201d student. However for me it comes across that they are somehow - I wouldn\u2019t call it in favour - \u201clike\u201d the student more. If the student have let\u2019s say a quiet personality (I think) the teachers have this mind set that they wouldn\u2019t cause any trouble so they always tries to be nicer to those students. I also notice that some teachers tend to either call on intelligent students or just ignore their raised hands completely until there is no other hands up (sometimes they just answer the question themselves).
