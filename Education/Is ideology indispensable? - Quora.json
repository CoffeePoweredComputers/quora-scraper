            "answer_text": "Yes, but not just indispensable. Ideology is unavoidable as part of our basic thought process. In order for one to have no ideology, one would need to be able to stop thinking all together. For some of us, our ideologies are malleable and able to be adjusted to suit current situations. For others, our ideologies are absolute to the point we would rather die than to do something that opposed our ideological beliefs. Then there is every degree of ideological belief between those two extremes. What fascinates me about the ideologies of members of mankind is how much we deceive ourselves into thinking we have strong ideological views only to behave in ways that offend our own ideologies. For example, a father of daughters may believe his ideological belief is that it is degrading for women to use their physical attributes in ways that father may believe, ideologically, are immoral. Yet that same father may also enjoy going to a strip club where daughters of other men do exactly what he believes is wrong for his own daughters. A more harmful and hateful example is the person who believes their ideologies prevent them from doing harm to others unless those others are not believers in their brand of ideological belief; then it is justified to do as much harm to others as one can get away with, including killing others.Our ideologies are a measure of our souls.

            "answer_text": "Ideology is indispensable insofar as a moral code and foundational principles are necessary for a society to function. Without a moral code, a society cannot function. For example, I am an adherent of the Jewish religion - that is my ideology. This brings me to believe that morality comes from God, and all people are made by God, therefore all people have certain inalienable rights which cannot be taken away without violating the laws which God has set for us. We all have the right to the pursuit of our own happiness, as long as we do not deny other this same right. If a society were to suddenly not recognize any of these values, we would end up with societies similar to those under Communist and Fascist tyrannies, where man is seen as a utility as opposed to a being in his own right - a means to an end. And if you think that's bad, imagine a society which has never even been exposed to a moral ideology like Judaism or Christianity! It would be far worse, as not only would the central authority (assuming there would be one) abuse rights, but we would commonly abuse each other's rights without a second thought. Therefore, yes, as much as I might hate to say it, ideology is necessary, because it teaches us how to behave. This does not at all mean that all ideologies are benevolent, but a society cannot exist without a uniting foundational principal. Even societies we would consider grossly morally inept, such as the aforementioned USSR and Nazi Germany, were able to survive for a time because they had foundational ideologies. Ideology is necessary not just for a moral society, but for any society at all. ",
