            "answer_text": "You may be exhausted because of different reason, most likely due to your inability to get enough sleep. To fall asleep faster, it\u2019s recommended to relax for about an hour before bedtime. This means that you should avoid any stimulus such as technology. It may be a cliche, but you could try reading a book before you go to sleep. Other options may be to listen to some calm music. There are plenty of options at YouTube for example. Watching TV or sitting in front of the computer, will only stimulate your brain and make it harder to wind down. This means that it\u2019ll take longer for you to fall asleep. If you still have issues falling asleep even when following the advice above or similar, then it might be due to an excess of energy. To release energy, so to speak, you need to remain physically active during at least one period of the day. Perhaps go for a walk, run or take a swim during the day. If this is not an option during daytime, you can do this a while before bedtime. Choose what works best for you. I personally recommend swimming since it\u2019s easy on the body and you tire fast. Swimming is the recommended option IMO if you have joint issues or trouble walking for long periods of time due to being overweight. As always, it\u2019s important to eat regularly and avoid stimulants here as well. It might be a no-brainer, but don\u2019t consume products containing caffeine. This includes the obvious coffee as well as tea. Eating before bedtime may affect your sleep as well. Alcohol may work to fall asleep quicker, but it will affect your REM sleep. If nothing else work, consult with your doctor for other alternatives such as sleeping pills. Though this should only be used as a last resort. Most of the time, sleeping issues can be resolved by following the above suggestions. Another useful tip if you have a lot of thoughts and they keep you up, is to simply write them down. This helps getting those thoughts out and it\u2019s a proven method. This may or may not work for you, but it\u2019s definitely worth trying. The recommended sleep is about 8\u20139 hours, but the human body can do well with 7. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going below that. In the end it\u2019s up to you to see what your body and mind can handle. I don\u2019t know how old you are, but I assume you\u2019re an adult. Then 8\u20139 hours should work. If you\u2019re a teen, aim for 9 hours. The amount of sleep you need generally increases the younger you are. This is why small children generally sleep longer. If you\u2019re having trouble finding out why you are awake late, simply check what you are doing at that moment. If you\u2019re at the computer and the computer is in your bedroom, then it might be a good idea to move the computer to another room. Same goes for anything else really. This allows you to distance yourself and keep the bedroom exclusively as the place where you rest. Poor self-restraint/control may also be a part of the issue. If you have someone you entrust with reminding you, then ask this person to remind you of your bedtime; ask them to text or call you half an hour before. With this reminder, you should drop everything and start relax and then go to sleep. I know this myself from experience that a lot of things can interrupt your ability to sleep or get to bed in time. Some times it may be because of addiction. In such case, it can be quite hard to admit it to yourself in order to start working on the problem and finding a solution. This is also a cliche, but the first step is always admitting you have a problem. If that\u2019s the case, there are some drastic measure you can take, but talk to a professional about this first. I\u2019m generally not talking about physical addiction such as foods or drugs, but mainly psychological ones. A therapist can help you with these ones. For the other ones, talk to your doctor. I wish you luck and hope my advice is of any help. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "You first have to ask yourself, what are you spending your evenings doing? You say that you're going to bed around 11 or 12, but it is necessary that you stay up this late? Doing so will make the process of waking up at 5:30 much, much more difficult. I would suggest developing an evening routine. When you come home, make a list, even a mental list, of what you want to get done. Put the top-order items first, and get them out of the way. That way, you won't have anything on your mind that would disturb you as you're trying to go to bed. However, once you finish all your necessary tasks, you can spend your evening having fun! But just remember that now, you have a \"bedtime.\" If you want to wake up at 5:30, your \"bedtime\" is going to have to be 9:30 or 10:00. One suggestion that has been very helpful for me is to read for 30 minutes or an hour before you turn off the lights. Rather than watching television, which can strain your eyes with exposure to the unnatural light at a time when your body is naturally suited for darkness (Is watching TV before bed a bad idea?), open up a good book and lose yourself in it. Just make sure to set a timer to make sure that you don't read past your \"bedtime\" (though 5 minutes or so wouldn't hurt, if you really want to finish the chapter!) Other things that may help you with falling asleep early: Turn on some relaxing music. I find that nature sounds, classical, and either brown or pink noise is best for this. (Rainy Mood / Free Brown Noise / Classical)Make your body warm. It's much harder to fall asleep when you're cold. Wrap yourself up in the sheets and get all snuggly :3Get a sleep mask. It sounds like a simple thing, but it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep. Blocking out all light is the key way to let your body know that it is time to get some serious slumber now. It kind of puts you into a routine. The mask goes on, and you realize, \"Oh, guess it's time for me to black out now. Here we go.\"Take a nice shower about 30 minutes to an hour before turning in to bed.Meditate for a few minutes just before sleeping - this will clear your mind and allow you to slip into a deep sleep much more easily, unperturbed by the worries and thoughts that swim through your head on a daily basis.Do something really really boring. The activity is up to you, but make sure that it's boring enough to rock you into a stupor. (just kidding, this is a last resort!)And if you're still not sleepy, or just not ready to go to bed at this point, it helps to take five minutes sitting in the dark with your eyes closed, repeating to yourself exactly why it is essential that you go to sleep now. Because you need to wake up at 5:30. And you want to be a healthily functioning human being. I'd say that those are pretty good reasons(: Best of luck with your sleeping habits! I really hope you find something that works for you :D ",

            "answer_text": "Hah! I am working on this very thing at the moment! Isn't it curious how we easily stray into getting to bed later and later?  My current excuse is that I enjoy being in my husband's company and he is awake the most between 7-11 pm; he sleeps most of the rest of the time. The price of being a caregiver, perhaps. But, you know, I am still in control...the only one of us two who is in control. So, what to do? Our sleep/wake hormones can get way out of whack even to the point that, though we may be walking zombies, there is that \"second wind\" that we get at night. That's the cortisol ramping up to keep us awake! Is there any hope? Yes! Get as much fresh air, sunshine, and exercise as possible during the day. This may mean taking coffee and lunch breaks out doors, walking around the building. The sunshine will help reset the day/night hormone balance, and the exercise sufficiently tires the body. After work, try to do something physical outdoors as well. If not gardening, hiking, or bike riding, take your free weights out back and spend a few minutes pumping a little iron. Switch off the electronics at least an hour before bed and switch to reading a book. When I do this consistently, truly, I start yawning almost as soon as I reach for the book! Talk about Pavlov's dogs! Also being stressed about sleeping hours makes going to bed, falling to sleep, and getting up harder. To address that, I also work on a small section of a coloring project for 5-10 minutes before getting ready for bed! Don't laugh. Applying color to paper brushes out all other thoughts and concerns. In sum, I spent at least an hour outdoors today. The sun was out, the air fresh, and I fully anticipate getting to bed earlier than I did last night. One day at a time. Let's see where this takes us!

            "answer_text": "5 STEPS TO GET YOURSELF TO GO TO BED EARLIER What if there were a precise scientific way to get yourself to go to bed on time, that was also practical enough to implement? Good news! There is. Follow these steps (seriously, all of them) and you\u2019ll be getting to bed earlier before you know it. Step 1: Reduce light exposure before bed. Your retinas serve two purposes -- receiving input necessary for vision, and housing sensors that detect the rise and fall of daylight. Your body uses light to set your internal clock to a 24-hour cycle, regulated largely by the hormone melatonin. Your body produces melatonin at night, which tells your body that it\u2019s time to go to bed. But when your retinas take in light, especially blue light (emitted by energy-efficient light bulbs and most electronic devices) this light suppresses the production of melatonin, messing up your circadian rhythm. Step 2: Make the change gradual. If you\u2019re currently going to bed at 11 pm, don\u2019t decide that tonight you\u2019re going to get to bed by 9 pm. First of all, your internal clock resets at a rate of about one hour per day, and somebody systems may take even longer. But more generally, when you\u2019re making behavioral changes, instead of trying to jump all the way to the finish line right away and then missing, you should aim to take smaller steps to build up to your bigger goal. It\u2019s also important to give your body time to adjust as you start bumping up your bedtime. If you\u2019re not tired enough to fall asleep after 10-15 minutes of tossing and turning, get up and do something else. One core tenet of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is stimulus control, which aims to associate the bed with sleeping, and not with stimulating behavior (like watching TV). Stimulus control principles advise that you only go to bed when you are tired, limit activities in bed to sleep and sex, and move to another room if you don\u2019t fall asleep within 10 minutes of being in bed Step 3: Set up your environment to avoid objections. One of the biggest reasons we don\u2019t do the things we intend to do is that we don\u2019t plan for them appropriately. First, walk through exactly what your evening will look like in your head. Something like, \u201cI\u2019ll have dinner at 7 pm, then I\u2019ll do a little more work, I\u2019ll watch an episode of this show, brush my teeth, and go to bed by 10 pm.\u201d Great! You\u2019ve got a plan. But\u2026 by the time the end of the day rolls around, your attention and ego resources are already depleted, and your willpower may not be strong enough to stick to your plan. So what you\u2019ll need to do before the time comes to put your plan into action is to think through your specific plan, and identify and rehearse potential objections. The idea is to plan around these -- to design your environment to make it less likely that you\u2019ll get distracted and ditch your plan. Think of Ulysses binding himself to the mast in order to resist the temptation of the Sirens\u2019 song. What can you do to resist watching TV tonight? Perhaps hide the remote, or move the TV to another room. Or even set a timer to shut off the TV at a certain time. Step 4: Set reminders for yourself to stick to your plan. Once you\u2019ve mapped out a plan for your evening, you can make it even more actionable by setting reminders for yourself. (Remember the point above about losing track of time?) The idea here is that reminders not only alert you at the moment, but they also help you build tiny habits by creating triggers for certain behaviors. For example, you can decide, \u201cas soon as my alarm goes off, I will cozy up on my couch and press play on Netflix. As soon as the show ends, I will brush my teeth and get into bed.\u201d Creating triggers for each part of your sequence of events will help you succeed with each next intended behavior. Step 5: Make a public commitment. Making a public commitment to getting something done is a great way to create accountability for yourself. Because you don\u2019t want others to see that you have failed to follow through on your commitment, you\u2019ll make it much more likely that you will, in fact, follow through. Studies show that once we make a public commitment, we are more likely to honor it. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is one big, simple tip that is reasonably easy to implement: we are actually more sensitive to artificial light and computer screens than we realize,  so stay completely away from screens and any brightly lit environments for 3 to 4 hours before going to bed. Living in an age of  24/7 artificial lighting interferes with the body's circadian rhythms, which were originally based around natural daylight and darkness.  Being in front of a computer screen for even five minutes is a lot like taking a cup of coffee before bed for many people.  Instead, darken all of the rooms you're in and use dim light sources like candles. Avoid full spectrum UV lights before bed, they're helpful for maintaining your rhythms during the day only. Reading will help you get drowsy, but if you read, read from a book, not a backlit screen. If you want to write or draw, do it on paper only, or use a voice recorder (don't stare at your phone, your phone has a screen with the same stimulating effect). Listening to music is also a helpful way to wind down the day. Drinking water is fine, but avoid sugary drinks and food within two hours of your target bedtime. It also helps to let the people in your life know what you're trying to accomplish so they can help to accommodate you, or at least avoid interfering with your progress. If you do need to cheat and go back on screens before bed you will destroy your progress, but you can minimize the damage by wearing filtered glasses with orange lenses that reduce the amount of light that gets through to your eyes. If you're on a radically different sleeping schedule than the one you want to adjust to it may take 4-10 days before it becomes substantially easier to consistently reach your target. In the meantime you can expect to be tired during your awake hours because your sleep schedule is in a state of flux. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few things you can try. Turn off the television, computer, iPad and put down your smartphone after 8pm. Our eyes tell our brains that the light from these devices is daylight, and that it is still daytime. So your brain emits less sleep hormone than it normally would.Take a melatonin supplement 30 minutes before you wish to fall asleep. Melatonin is the natural sleep hormone that your body emits in the late evening. If you aren't producing enough, you can supplement without side effects.Keep a pen and paper next to the bed. Often thoughts like \"I have to remember to do this tomorrow!\" will keep our brains from settling down. Writing down the thing that you don't want to forget will get it off your mind.Try focusing on your breathing to stop the thoughts from racing. Think \"in\" as you breathe in, and \"out\" as you breathe out. Your body will start to relax as your breathing gets deeper.Have your doctor perform some blood work. Often, difficulty sleeping is a symptom of an underlying problem. Make sure everything is working correctly in your body!Sometimes medications can keep you awake. Evaluate any that you are taking and see if that is a side effect.",

            "answer_text": "Aim for 8 p.m., that way the part of you that doesn't like to go to bed, get's 90 minutes of defiance time to play around.  Also, give yourself happy thoughts to think about at bedtime.  I've made some new connections in life recently whom I like very much.  One's a fella, one's a nice lady counselor type, one's an old high school friend, and one's a college buddy.  I think about them when I lay my head down.  And I try to ask God, \"What do you want to be in my life right now?\"  and leave some of the details to him.  It gives me some excitement at bedtime... some mystery and anticipation.  It's helpful to be happy at bedtime.  Then I settle in to how good it feels to go to bed.  I also am in a city where pollution is not too bad, so I can keep the patio door open at least a tiny bit, even if it's kind of cold.  That way I can also take a minute to tune into the weather and think about the whole big wide world.  I like knowing the fresh breeze will be blowing gently over me and that that big old Silver Maple will be outside my window when I awaken and so will the various evergreens in the big courtyard and there will be birds too, even when it's really cold.  Now, we all know, including you, how much better we feel if we let go of the day sooner.  Rest when it is time to rest.  When it is time to rest tonight, think: Rest and Peace and Safety and Comfort.  Think those four words and feel how good that sheet feels next to your cheek.  Yum.  Sleepy time. ",

            "answer_text": "I just overcame severe insomnia two months ago. Looking into that experience, I think it was due to the fact that I cannot go to bed early and I cannot fall in sleep. Here I would like to share on how I push myself to go to bed early. Why do you have difficulties in going to bed early? Here are two reasons I once had. First, the most important one: I was just too nervous to go to bed and I feel I have a lot of things to do. I feel blue at night when I looked backward at what I did today. I usually criticize myself like why I cannot focus on my duties etc. So I would suggest behaving yourself in the day time. Then you won\u2019t have difficulties in going to bed because of guilty. Also, please tell yourself efficiency is the most important scale. You will complete the task better if you get enough sleep. You cannot hide your laziness in strategy with your diligence in enforcing your strategy. It is no use to be touched by \u201cI started till 3 am T^T\u201d. Instead, it is crucial how much you finished actually. Write a to-do list. Choose 3 most significant ones to be your task today, although you may want to finish 10 at one day. By the way, it is useful to complete important tasks which are valuable in the long term. Always chasing by deadlines is not beneficial for yourself. Second, I thought I could not fall into the sleep so I gave up. Even when I was on the bed, mobile devices killed my time. You actually take a rest even if you are not in deep sleep. So I suggest set an alarm and go directly to the bed, regardless if you can fall sleep immediately. For example, if you cannot sleep the whole night, do not be nervous. Get up at a time you wish to get up. DON\u2019T take a nap during the daytime. Then it would be super easy to fall asleep the next day. As for electronic devices, apparently, lights from the screen would damage your sleep. In addition, they are harmful to your sights. So keep them away! Maybe you just need to change the places where you charge your phone. Move it to the corner of the room so that you cannot reach it on the bed. Hope this helps! ",

PS: You have to discipline yourself:) You really need to work on it! So, Before I answer your question. Let me share you my routine. Get up by 6:30 amMeditate for 30 minsHit the gym to stay fit.Prepare the content for my classes [I have 2 jobs]Go to office by 10:30 am and work till 7:30 pm [I work in IT company]8:30 pm go the class11:00 pm is my dinner12:30 am is the time I sleep.My day is full of hustle and I have not taken a day off. Most of my days are monotonous but I never had a thought of taking a break or running away from it. My energy is still the same because I try to live in the moment consciously. I just live for one day! I really don\u2019t force myself for anything. The reason I had to tell you this is because you are getting distracted with a lot of unnecessary stuffs. Social Media has given us knowledge but it taken away our wisdom. You have prioritize things that don\u2019t matter over things that matter. Example: Texting people late in night.Watching YouTube videos which won\u2019t add value to your time.Thinking about something that happened on the day.Thinking about past and future!Always Remember: Past has gone and there is no future. All we have is this moment right now. Do the things that matter to you! You can sleep for 5 hours and still stay healthy. You can sleep for 9 hours and still stay sick. Remember: Learn to value your time.Learn to meditate.The moment you master it you would not have to force yourself to do anything! Thank you for reading! I hope I was able to give you the clarity to your question. If not shoot me in the comment section. Hope this helps!! If you liked this answer, say hi on: INSTAGRAM || FACEBOOK || QUORA || ",

So long as I receive the amount of sleep I need in any given day? I provide a link to this question for you: How do I get more out of less sleep, i.e. how can I optimize my sleep so that I feel less tired on the nights I sleep less? In terms of myself.... Exercise tires you out. However! Don't exercise at night!!!!!! Exercising right before bed will actually have an adverse effect; you will actually be less sleepy. So, choose a time of day that works for you to get some exercise. Aromatherapy can help...doing meditation can help...and, even, listening to this track can help:   ",

            "answer_text": "Have a planned ritual starting much earlier to go to bed (not the time you sleep but about 30 minutes to one hour as a test). Drink some hot camomile tea, and get a good book to read (no ebooks on iPad as the light will keep you awake). Hoping you can be sleepy drifting off to bed. Try to find an average time you need to this ritual (say you have an average of 45 minutes). Then on the next day go to bed for the same ritual 30 minutes earlier. Do this until you reach the time you want to actually fall asleep. It goes without saying don't drink too much coffee in the late afternoon so your body will be caffeine free by the time you are ready to go to bed, and drink lots of water throughout the day. I sometimes like to write everything down that is on my mind so that it clears the mind for sleep. Also I recommend using a Sleep app for your smart phone where it can wake you up at the right time so you don't feel groggy and tired. It really helps to have a better day by waking up at the right time and the app helps. ",

Also, with this, please try: Eating dinner early, and eating light.Stop snacking in between dinner and your sleep. Do away with themGo for a short walk after dinner  Read a book, it works 2 ways. one, your eyes feel tired after sometime, and you feel drowsy. Two, you're reading a book, ultimate entertainment, GUARANTEED  Make your bed beforehand, and put the rug/bedsheet fresh ones(maybe even sun dried ones) and enjoy the warmth :)  Make the room a little dark.The sleep waves come in at this times usually, i have noticed : 9 ~ 9:30 and if you miss that, the next one is at 12:30~ 2. Seriously. Think about it.There is an app that plays the sound of that waves, try it. It worked well for me. But then my snores woke me up. I am a light sleeper.Hope that helped. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few things you can try.  Turn off the television, computer, iPad and put down your smartphone after 8pm. Our eyes tell our brains that the light from these devices is daylight, and that it is still daytime. So your brain emits less sleep hormone than it normally would.Take a melatonin supplement 30 minutes before you wish to fall asleep. Melatonin is the natural sleep hormone that your body emits in the late evening. If you aren't producing enough, you can supplement without side effects.Keep a pen and paper next to the bed. Often thoughts like \"I have to remember to do this tomorrow!\" will keep our brains from settling down. Writing down the thing that you don't want to forget will get it off your mind.Try focusing on your breathing to stop the thoughts from racing. Think \"in\" as you breathe in, and \"out\" as you breathe out. Your body will start to relax as your breathing gets deeper.Have your doctor perform some blood work. Often, difficulty sleeping is a symptom of an underlying problem. Make sure everything is working correctly in your body!Sometimes medications can keep you awake. Evaluate any that you are taking and see if that is a side effect.",

Some involved mathematics or convoluted history will do.5:00~10:00: When your eyes sense light in the morning, your brain will begin to wake up naturally.IMPORTANT: When you program something, it\u2019s tempting to think \u201coh, now this thing will wake me up at 5:00\u201d. Such thoughts of targetting when to get up may distract from getting a good sleep. Therefore, direct the light away from your eyes before sleep: to hell with light, I will sleep as much as I like. In other words, the lamp should be ignorable, just like the morning light is. This is so that you don\u2019t care about anything waking you up before you yourself want to wake up. Having light away from the eyes will make yourself feel like you will be able to ignore it in the morning. Nevertheless, keep the program running, and over time, you will naturally shift towards waking earlier, sleeping earlier. ",

In fact, to use force may back fire against you with more vigor.  Instead, control your Time with effective activities that will train your mind and body to obey your orders.   It's all about training the mind and body to sleep and wake up whenever you want. You've conditioned your mind and body over a period of Time with specific habits that caused you to have a certain sleep schedule.  One way to break the current cycle and to replace with your earlier wake-up schedule is to integrate an exercise program during the mornings or afternoons so that your mind and body will feel the need to be rested. Otherwise, if you're like me, if i don't exercise, i'll have more than enough energy during the evenings to keep me awake all night not just thinking about things but feeling restless to move around.

Making your bed as comfortable as possible - think soft pillows strewn over your bed. 3. Have a cup of green tea to relax. 4. Try taking a bath around the time you want to sleep . It will definitely put you at ease. 5. Listen to some soft music on low volume until you fall into slumber. 6. Switch off the lights and you would automatically relax. 7. If you don't live alone. Politely ask  others in your family not to disturb you at that hour. 8. Snuggle in bed.Voila! Problem solved :) ",

Relax buddy if you don't feel sleepy.No matter what don't take small naps in a day .Pledge to yourself that no matter what,you are not going to sleep even if that means you are unable to do your work properly. Just resist the sleep for some days . Do whatever you want, if you can't focus on your work due to lack of sleep, then listen to music or watch a movie or talk to your friends but not be tempted to sleep.Read books while on bedTake a walk after your dinner so that you feel tired and sleepy.Switch off the lights before going to bed because a hormone called melatonin becomes active in dark which induces sleep.Exercise everyday .Sleep at the same time every day . Your biological clock will command your body to feel sleepy at around the same time.Avoid using mobile phone while on bed.Blue lights prevent your sleep.Keep any electronic gadgets away from your bed.",

So for the most part I don't have to get up at dawn. There's also the matter that I'm a night person. During my programming years I loved to work at night with no distractions. I was more productive  during nighttime than daytime. So,  first evaluate if you are a night person or a day person and if you can, find a job that adjusts to your way of being.  Now, regardless of when you are at your peak, yo do need to sleep a good 8 hours as an average. If you sleep less than what your body requires (and each one of us knows how much that is) you'll be tired, your immune system won't have time to make the cells needed to fight infection and repair your body, you'll be cranky and enjoy life less.  Plan a sleep-time routine based on some of the good advice I see down here, and stick to it, for at least a month, so it becomes a habit.  Good luck! ",

But work it will!)  Set a time you want to wake up everyday.Use an alarm, a friend or a relative(who will feel like your enemy) to help you wake up at that time.The other important thing. Sleep as soon as you feel sleepy. This may change from day to day based on how tired you are. So some days you may feel sleepy early and other days you may not feel sleepy till very late.Keep away from laptops and mobiles when you wait to fall asleep on your bed. But reading a book till you go of to sleep is ok.Ensure you get of the bed at the stipulated time in the morning no matter what the first few days.In 4-5 days this is become normal and you body clock will adjust easily.",

We got a new tv that bothered my eyes, so I ordered a pair of yellow colored glasses to cut the blue light. It solved the eye problem, but\u2026.after half an hour with them on, I couldn't stay awake! Terrible if you're watching an exciting basketball game but great if you are trying to get to sleep. However you have to block all bluelight until you are in bed with your eyes closed, or you wake again. The plain almost clear glasses for bluelight dont work as well by the way. See link for the explanation. How Blocking Blue Light at Night Helps You Sleep ",

I started making sure that I woke up when I wanted to (6 a.m.) everyday, no matter what and within about 10 days of doing this consistently, I would find myself easily asleep by 11, 12p.m. I didn't need to work on falling asleep at the right time once I handled waking up at the right time.

If you are used to sleeping at 2am, try to put your self to bed by around 1am. Do this gradually until you reach your goal time. Do the same thing when waking up. Waking up early will make you tired till the evening and will help you in sleeping early.  Do something calming before your bedtime. Listening to music and reading books are the best thing also turn off or dim out your lights an hour before you want to sleep. This will make the ambience cozy.  Always reward yourself for your discipline. This will make you stick to your routine more rigorously.  Remember, you only have to do this for a couple of weeks. Your body will  adjust itself to the schedule and you will automatically start feeling sleepy at your desired time. ",

I would have already spent 3 hours of whatever I was doing and I would feel tired/lazy and then slowly drift to sleep max by 11. Waking up early wouldn't be that hard for me when I slept around this time. My normal waking time is 5:30 - 6 am.  To me its just a matter of 'shifting' all my activities to an early slot in time. It works for me quite well! ",

Meditate, or if you are religious pray, in my religion praying means emptying the mind so that works. Do not use internet or TV before bed. It just stimulates your mind, so half an hour before you want to sleep you should stop. Keep a regular bedtime. ",

It's truly amazing the control we have our thoughts. It takes just as much energy to believe waking up early is difficult as it does to believe waking up early is easy. To answer: 1.) Have a great mental attitude about going to bed and getting up early.2.) Set an early morning appointment that you cannot miss (running date with a friend, coffee date with a church member).3.) Just do it. This may be over simplified, but you have what it takes! ",
