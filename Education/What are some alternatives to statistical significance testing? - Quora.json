            "answer_text": "You can use Bayesian methods (instead of frequentist hypothesis testing) to find the distribution of the unknown parameters. Instead of trying to reject the notion that [math]\\mu = 0[/math], you can actually construct a distribution for mu if you're willing to subscribe to Bayesian ideology and say that an unknown parameter can have a distribution that reflects one's uncertainty about the value.   For example, lets say that you're trying to estimate the probability parameter [math]\\theta[/math] of a binomial distribution (say, click-through rate). You set an initial flat prior for [math]\\theta[/math] to be[math]\\theta \\sim Beta(1, 1)[/math] Through Baye's Rule, you get your posterior distribution for [math]\\theta[/math] to be[math]P(\\theta | data) \\propto P(data | \\theta)P(\\theta)[/math]. Conveniently in this case, the distribution [math]\\theta | data \\sim Beta(1 + y, 1 + n)[/math] Where y is the number of observed successes (e.g. clicks) and n is the number of trials (e.g. impressions).   I've illustrated three Beta distributions below to illustrate what has happened. We start off with a Beta(1, 1), or flat, prior for our belief of the distribution of [math]\\theta[/math].  After observing 1 click in 4 impressions, we can update our belief of of the distribution of [math]\\theta[/math] to be Beta(2, 5). From the posterior distribution we can make judgements about what [math]\\theta[/math] is likely to be.
