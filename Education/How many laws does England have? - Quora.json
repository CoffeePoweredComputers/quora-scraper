            "answer_text": "Well, you always count them, here are some of legal scrolls held in the Victoria Tower archives of the Houses of Parliament.   Although most of the archive is packed full of rather generic documents in boxes on shelves, there is one room which is the one most likely to feature on the news if they need generic footage of old legal documents \u2013 and that is the archive where all the Acts of Parliament are stored. What makes it so special is that each Act has been, and still is, hand written on calfskin \u2013 known as Vellum \u2013 and rolled up for storage. Although paper copies of the Acts are printed on normal paper for distribution, and can also be read online at the Parliament website, the scrolls are still printed on calfskin, produced in a single factory near Milton Keynes. An attempt by a Labour MP to \u201cmodernise\u201d and scrap the use of Vellum was wisely rejected by the Commons in 1999. The Tower itself holds documents dating back as far as 1497 \u2013 although sadly, most of the archive for the House of Commons was lost during the fire that destroyed Parliament in 1834. The House of Lords archive at the time was stored in a separate building across the road and so escaped the conflagration. As far as I could establish the oldest formally written law still in force in England is the \u201cDistress Act of 1267\u201d. This made it illegal to seek \u2018distress\u2019, or compensation for damage, by any means other than a lawsuit in a court of law \u2013 effectively outlawing private feuds. So the actual answer to your question is A LOT. ",

            "answer_text": "I seriously doubt that anybody knows. They do sometimes have a tidy up to get rid of known anomalies and no longer applicable ones, eg the requirement for every adult male to attend archery practice on Sunday was abolished in my lifetime (60). Also there are by laws. These are local laws and may be as simple as not playing football in the park kiddies play area and can be introduced by any statutary authority. For instance Dartmoor National Park prohibits feeding animals or driving more than 15 yards (?) from the road. I have read that it is illegal to use a pram or pushchair on the pavement in our city as in Victorian times a law was introduced to prohibit wheeled conveyances on the pavement. We\u2019ve been making laws for a very long time, It may once have been legal to kill welshmen/scots in Chester/York but it isn\u2019t now irrespective of whether the original law was rescinded (or even existed).
