            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the best time to take a subject test is in June after completing a similar AP course. So, if you\u2019re taking AP Chemistry and plan to take the AP test in May, schedule the subject test for June. This way, the information will be fresh in your mind and you will already have experience taking a similar (if not more difficult) test a month prior. Also, the only subject tests not offered in June are language w/listening, so there\u2019s a good chance the subject you want to take will be offered on that date. The only subject for which this may not be the best strategy (at least as far as I know) would be Physics. Since physics, whether you choose to go for the algebra or calculus based version, is split into two parts, some later concepts that are on the subject test may not be covered in a Physics 1 or Physics C: Mechanics course. That being said, if you aren\u2019t/don\u2019t plan on taking AP courses, I would recommend doing some extra studying before taking a subject test. You\u2019d probably still want to have some type of formal classroom learning in the subject (like taking a regular chemistry course), but you could use test prep books and other practice options to get you fully prepared for the test. To answer your second question, I think that subject tests are more difficult than the SAT. I never took the Literature one, so I can\u2019t really say whether that is more or less difficult as the SAT reading section, but Math II was definitely harder for me than the SAT math section. The problems were more difficult (think pre-calc/trig level vs Algebra 2/geometry level) and I was not even able to complete all of them in the hour allotted for the test. The only upside is that you can use your calculator on the whole test, which makes it slightly easier. For the rest of the subject tests, it\u2019s kind of hard to compare, since you\u2019re being tested on a subject that\u2019s not a part of the traditional SAT (I guess that\u2019s kind of the point). So, if you\u2019re really good at U.S. History, then you probably will find the subject test easier than the SAT. If you\u2019re not so great at it, it will likely be hard for you. An upside to the subject tests is that each is only one hour long, meaning that you can take 3 in one day and you will only be spending an hour on each subject. If you dislike the SAT because it\u2019s super long, try just taking one or two subject tests. If length isn\u2019t a factor for you, you can do three in the same day. Choose the strategy that works best for you and your test-taking preferences. Hopefully this helped and good luck on your tests! ",

In terms of difficulty level, yes it is difficult than SAT tests, at least Math 2 / Science SAT subject tests. ",
