            "answer_text": "Hopefully you were a member prior to becoming President and have served either in leadership or in committee before ascending to the Chair. Schedule a meeting with the outgoing President, your Campus Advisor and then your leadership team(other elected officers) separately. Each meeting should be spent listening to gain perspective about their insights, opinions and suggestions for the club. Have an audit of the club's finances and change signatures for any bank accounts, student contacts and updates with Student Affairs. Set out a vision for the organization for the year and a budget required to accomplish your goals. Meet with a representative from the Student Affairs department to understand what reporting, compliance and funding opportunities are in place. Look for consensus building and partnership to maximize your student impact. Now you are ready to seek new members and schedule a meeting of the organization. Update the social media prescence of the organization and look for increased branding opportunities and visibility on campus. Determine if dues are allowed and make them modest, but sufficient to purchase a t-shirt for members. Best way to brand is to be visible. Now you are ready to see if any Constitution and by-law changes are warranted and to learn how your organization functions. Schedule regular general meetings after reserving space for the semester, and have executive meetings in an appropriate interval to follow-up on action items from and in preparation for the next meeting. Attempt to raise funds half as often as your club does projects. This way your organization is not looked upon as a social club, but a service/social that gets stuff done. The best way to overcome limited funding is to provide manpower in partnership with other funded clubs. I hope this helps. Good luck! ",

You might begin by gaining some consensus on meaningful goals and establish committees accordingly. Listen respectfully to all suggestions and concerns and let relevant members know how you propose to address them or why you cannot\u2026email is fine. Always be appreciative of their ideas and concerns. And consult with previous leaders about their experience\u2026probably should start there! Congratulations! ",
