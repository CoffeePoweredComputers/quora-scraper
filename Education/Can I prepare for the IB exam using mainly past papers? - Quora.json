            "answer_text": "YES! This is the best way to prepare for exams. You can\u2019t really rely on notes (at least from my teachers) or even textbooks (say Oxford or Cambridge) because they aren\u2019t published by the IBO, and they include so much irrelevant information! For example, the Cambridge IB Econ Textbook includes all three levels of price discrimination, when I only had to learn third degree price discrimination! Therefore, the best way to prepare for IB exams are with past papers and mark schemes, which you can easily find from Exam-Mate: Digital Learning Platform or Free Exam Papers For GCSE, IGCSE, A Level, IB and University Students, as well as the official IBO subject guides, which contains all you need to study for the exams! (You can find IB subject guides here: Index of /All Files/Guides) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the course. IB is constantly changing the curriculum; subjects will change test styles from year to year. If I am not mistaken, IB History used to require a DBQ, though I do not remember having a DBQ on my exam. Some exams are drastically different from their previous counterparts. As far as I know, Group 4 and 5 Subjects tend not to change too much, though I do remember my teacher saying that ESS was different in the past. Time yourself when doing them. It puts pressure on like real exams. Despite changes, past exams are a good way to test your knowledge. You are not going to learn from them, though you are going to learn what you do not know.

I highly recommend using past papers, but when you use past papers, be very structured about the way you go about them. Time yourself while doing them, and try to prevent yourself from checking the mark scheme until you are completely finished the paper. I\u2019m not sure how much extra time the teachers in your school have, but if possible, try and show your work to them. At my school they\u2019re quite open to receiving extra student work and most of them give good advice. ",

            "answer_text": "You can definitely use IB past paper to prepare for the final IB exams, in fact it\u2019s one of the best way you can be spending the last few days before the exams. Be it for getting a feel of the question paper, realising your preparedness for the exams or outright experiencing the exam like stress, past papers provide the perfect opportunity to test your knowledge and understanding about the concepts you have learned. But there\u2019s a catch that you must be aware of. It might be the best way to revise about the things, but too much dependance on it can cause you to lose your big-picture focus. Only solving past papers and not revising the concepts alonside, can result in the \u201cillusion of success\u201d. You might feel as if you have attained the holistic understanding of the whole course, but there will be conceptual gaps in your mind and that might not be such a good idea. ",
