            "answer_text": "Every single chapter will be easy as long as you remain restricted to NCERT for studying the chapters. In Class 10th, you are given a very basic insight about the chapters which are to be studied by you later on in your higher classes, but restricting yourself only upto a basic level in your 10th Grade isn't something which I'd recommend to you. Push, your limits and study topics like Trigonometry, Height and Distances, Arithmetic Progressions, Quadratic Equations and Probability at a decent level in your 10th Grade Itself. These topics when studied only at board level, are easy as hell but become so much challenging once studied at higher level. Get some good books (not the ones meant for your boards) and master these topics at an early stage. ",
