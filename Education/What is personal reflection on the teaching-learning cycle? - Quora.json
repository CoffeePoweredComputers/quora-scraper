            "answer_text": "Reflection is nothing but analyzing a process or a situation. In a teaching-learning cycle, a teacher has to compulsorily spend time reflecting on his class hours. Some pointers could be: *Was the teacher sufficiently prepared for the lesson? *Was the classroom teaching effective? *Were the objectives met? *Was the AV tools used appropriately? If not, what could have been better? *Has the student been able to grasp the concept? Were the examples sufficient, relatable and of value? How could those be improved? *Was the preparation for the class made well in advance? Did the teacher struggle at any point? If so, what was the area of concern? How could that be addressed? *Was the teacher able to make the class an engaging learning experience? *What modes of assessment was used to test the effectiveness of teaching-learning process? Were they appropriate? Were the instructions clear and communicated at the proper time? What could be done better? *What activities have been planned as a follow up or to reinforce learning? Reflecting on these areas and maintaining a journal of the same will help the teacher to grow in his/her profession. ",
