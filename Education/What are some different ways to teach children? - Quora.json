            "answer_text": "Finally I see someone asking an excellent question. Thank you so much for this question. So first of all I didn\u2019t read any answers who gave\u2019em before me. If any points match up, please excuse me. I\u2019ll tell you some points if I were a teacher for kids. So, before I interact with kids I will have a session with their parents. Because kids hardly spend 6\u20137 hours at school, and remaining time at home. And let me tell you (as this is THE TRUTH) that today\u2019s generation to be spoiled, main reason(s) is/ are parents and/or teachers. At home they were not grown properly. At school they were not taught properly. So these two people [teacher and parent] must change their attitudes. Once parents leave their children at school they feel like teachers will take care. Once the children go home, teachers think that parents will take care. And one fine day the kid is asked \u201cis this what you are taught in school?\u201d(if at home) or \u201cis this what your parents tell you?\u201d (if in school). Blaming each other and in between the kid goes mad. So both need a great change. At school and at home there must be the same atmosphere for kids. How a parent receives his/her child, the same a teacher has to do. But none of them does, in this so called \u201cE- GENERATION\u201d and say they don\u2019t have time to spare everyone. Coming to the teachers\u2019 point, (according to me) they must be like a kid along with the kids in class. Explain anything they ask with utmost patience. Expose them to reality at their level. No kid is different. Every ones are tender hearts. Make them feel special among all. Make them study with pictures, actions, expressions. Never ever express anger or any kind of frustration on them, not one bit. When they ask you something answer patiently even a hundred times. Attend their calls (not phone calls) in whatever mood you are. Once they start growing up you can make them understand when to attend people and when not to disturb them. Encourage any kind of activity they perform. See that they are treated the same even at home with same love. I don\u2019t say that parents don\u2019t love their kids. But today\u2019s scenario, when I see even in public places, a kid was after her mum to buy something and she went on hesitating and at one point she slapped him. I really felt sorry for that kid. Every where it\u2019s the same. If any parent comes and tells that \u2018no, we don\u2019t treat our child like that\u2019 I won\u2019t accept. First I\u2019ll see the kids behaviour and there itself I can understand how he is nurtured at home. Childhood is the most sensitive part of one\u2019s life, only where you can feel that you are special. And that feeling can be continued only when parents and teachers encourage kids. Sorry If it went too long. And I mean no offense to any parent or teacher. As they always do love their children. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no one way to teach, or to learn. My oldest was social, liked learning in groups, loved numbers, was messy, was into cartoons and comedies, liked to argue, wore black. Next kid was 2 years younger, one year behind in school, an inch shorter, and a pound lighter, wore day-glo colors, and kept his thoughts to himself, and his room was extraordinarily neat. The greatest incentive to get him to learn something was to tell him his brother could do it. If his brother\u2019s class finished a textbook, kid 2 finished it and made it half way through the next year\u2019s book. Kid 2 was a wordsmith. Kid 3 was too much younger to be in competition. Kid 3 liked nonfiction, National Geographic, Geography, and liked grown-ups and dogs, and he travels light. If 3 brothers are so different, imagine 25 students. And over a couple of decades, Wow! So, I kept rock collections, animal books, all kinds of tools, a few mermaid and princess storybooks, lots of measuring stuff, dinosaur bones, magnets, trains\u2026if I had a kid who was excited by something, I\u2019d acquire some of that. While there are quiet and sedentary kids, there are more who need to move to think, or at least to have a lot of variety \u201cshort attention span theater\u201d. In preschool, you have to practice a lot of skills over and over, but \u201ca\u201d is for apple every day is just plain lazy when there are alligators, agates, and can you find a place on the map that starts with \u201ca\u201d? My oldest was exasperated that his kindergarten class always stopped at 10. There should have been some kind of expansion for him, so he didn\u2019t feel shut down every day, not necessarily counting to 100 or 1000; that would be boring, but a little place value, maybe measuring could have kept him happy, and impressed his classmates by counting 102 floor tiles of a dinosaur\u2019s length. What you are looking for is a teacher who can intrigue kids who like machines, and kids who want to grow up to be a rhinocerous or elephant. Someone who knows something about many things, and is interested in learning more with whatever kind of class got assigned to the class this year. Also, fear is not a good motivator. You don\u2019t want a kid to work to avoid failing. ",
