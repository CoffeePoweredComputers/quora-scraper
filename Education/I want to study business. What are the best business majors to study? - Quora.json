            "answer_text": "My advice as a business senior right now: (Acct & econ) Pick what you think is interesting. Some general rules: Accounting/Finance: Just do accounting. Accounting majors can do finance and finance majors cant do accounting. Marketing: Solid, have to excel as supply is high. Economics: Great on the resume, but no jobs. Couple with another major. Management Info Systems: Strong but you are kinda stuck in that kind of a role, make sure you like it.  General management: No go, not specialized enough to get a decent job so I would suggest never doing this unless you have a specific plan for a specialized field. Supply chain: great if you like that stuff, first job sucks but job market is super great atm for supply chain majors. Entrep - couple with another major for the resume boost. All depends on school as well, my school has a very strong supply chain program so it's a good move here. Work with your universities strong suits and you are better off. ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend a different way to approach this question. Choose the major that you feel excited about.  Try to learn as much as you can about it. But your future career will not necessarily be related to the major you have chosen. Most people I met on various levels of management do work unrelated to their major. ",
