            "answer_text": "Online learning is nothing but a virtual learning. Many people have a different concept about the online learning. They say that the online/e-learning is not effective as the offline learning. But' it's not completely true. If you take the present scenario of the world, people do not have time. So, unlike the offline classes, the students do not have to waste time in travelling and then reaching the institute. The online course is taught in many ways like Pre recorded videos, webinar or through skype etc. The interaction is the same like the offline classes. There are a few institutes, who let you access their online course eve after you are done with their courses. I believe, this flexibility is not given in the offline class. In short. Online course is nothing but a virtual scenario of a real time/offline classroom where the knowledge shared/given is as same and effective as the offline classes. If you ask me, online is more effective. And about the institutes and universities offering online courses, depends, what kind of course are you interested in. Just google it. You will find plenty.

            "answer_text": "Online learning is earning the education using internet as a medium instead of attending the classes in the physical classrooms. Online learning brought tremendous changes in the field of education. Anyone can earn the education from any corner of the world by just enrolling with the school, college or an institute and get access to theclasses online. I\u2019m so impressed with online education and as a result of that my kid is earning the online school education from Ogburn Online School. Online earning allows you to learn whatever you would like to and from wherever you wanted to. ",
