            "answer_text": "A few years ago, I worked with quite a few teachers who were implementing bleeding edge pedagogical philosophies. One of these philosophies that I saw implemented that seemed most effective, and was a good answer to this question, was assigning work in class with some time to complete it while the teacher went around helping students. If the student did not finish the work in class, the rest would be \u201chomework\u201d. The students benefited from having the teacher present to answer questions, and a diminished out of school work time. Add to this that the school built in \u201cfree\u201d periods for study into the schedule, and the students had less homework than most. The question of homework is a question of time and effectiveness. There is a long laundry list of articles that imply that working too many hours is ineffective for people and companies. I am sure, also, many of us have anecdotes relating to when we have been overworked, and the quality of our work diminishing when that has been the case. So the question is: if this is true for adults, why would it not be true for our children. With the pressures of today\u2019s college admission process, kids are pressed more than ever for time. If you want your kid to get into a top tier school, its likely you want them to: Get very very good gradesBe prepared for all testing situations: ACT, SAT, PSAT, IB, APVolunteer somewhereDo some sort of sportDo some sort of extracurricular in the arts (music, dance, painting, sculpting, theater, etc.)So how much time then\u2014when you add homework to this equation as a necessary portion of the first bullet\u2014does a child have to decompress? To destress? To do what they want to and have chosen to do (to be fair, hopefully sports, arts, and volunteering are what they want to do, but often times what they want to do is play Minecraft with their friends). However, this situation surrounding homework is more complex than it may seem, and has to do with more than just a students learning: homework might actually be a class issue. Sometimes, the idea is that a parent might be able to help with homework should a child find themselves stuck. But what if the parent works long hours and isn\u2019t home to help? Some parents can afford tutors, others can\u2019t, there is an equity issue there. Worse, perhaps, the student has to have a job after school to help pay the family bills? What time does this student then have for homework, or even to do the laundry list of other things to get into college? Worse, what time do they have to decompress and relax? This being said, there are even issues with the assumption that parents can help with homework. Let us suppose this family all has a very healthy work life balance, and so the parents are home to help with homework if necessary. To be fair, the way that teachers are teaching subjects, especially STEM subjects, is changing.  Parents, taught subjects years and years ago, may not be able to help the student through the current curriculum needs, and may not know the new methods used to teach and learn a subject. In this case, either the teacher, or a tutor provided by the school, is likely the best candidate to help with the homework. It is possible that the parent, helping the student by showing them the methods they were taught as students themselves, may do more harm to instruction than good. But it is also prudent to ask, when answering this question, what use free time from homework is to the learning process. Well, it has also been shown that downtime is necessary for the brain to process what learned. This begs the question that if a student spends their afternoon and evenings either doing homework or extracurricular activities in order to prepare for college, when do they get time to decompress and process what they have learned? It could be that a constant state of being busy could damage their learning, not improve it by repetition. So homework, should it be assigned? Maybe, but maybe not. There is a reason why their are whole schools that teach nothing but how to teach. Learning, teaching, and the science surrounding it are much more complex than we believe. A well wrought class may seem to be simple, to be improvised, to be approachable and casual, but often this masks a deep, well thought out, and pedagogically sound structure. We also often have a disadvantage as adults: we went through school, we had teachers, and so we believe we know how teaching should be done and how our kids should be taught. This, however, is not the case. It is akin to saying that, because you live in a building, you know how to build one. All of this is to say: should homework be assigned? A quick search will reveal articles on both sides of this debate. To cut to the truth of the matter, I would see what the current research and studies in pedagogy say, and pay attention to what teachers teaching in the new methods do, and follow their lead. After all, it is their life\u2019s work to learn about how we learn, and to think about how we make the process of learning better and more efficient. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was teaching I felt I assigned too much homework. The problem today is that many students simply do not have the time after the school day to work on home assignments. I decided that the best solution for my students was to limit the amount of homework. I tried to make assignments that would only take appropriately 30 minutes. I told my students to begin the work the last ten minutes of the class period so that I could answer any questions. I discovered that this was a good solution because the students who needed my help would receive it and there was less confusion about what was expected. ",
