            "answer_text": "Well, a few things first. Saying that Christianity \u201cconquered\u201d Rome is inaccurate. Roman culture absorbed Christianity, just as they absorbed just about every other cultural forc they encountered. Specifically, Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and decriminalized it with the Edict of Milan in 313 CE. He did so to consolidate power and win supporters, as rulers do. If you're asking why Christianity replaced Roman paganism, the simple answer is it had a more appealing message. Paganism had heroes and tradition, but Christianity had a narrative that it claimed was still unfolding and which anyone, from the emperor to the slaves, could play a part in. Riches could be won (in the next life, that is) and standards of living could be improved, or at least be seen from another angle, now that everyobe had an eternal soul and the afterlife was a pressing concern.
