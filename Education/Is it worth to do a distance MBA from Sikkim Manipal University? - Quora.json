            "answer_text": "No No No\u2026Not at all I did MBA from SMU 3 years back. Any company public or private which has an established name does not consider it's degree value. Even if when u plan to go outside India and show the MBA done by SMU, they do not consider it(not even giving a look at it). However the way they take exam and all, my god it gives a look like we are seated in board exams. Whats the point of getting such degree with such great effort when it is of no use. Beside this my cousin did BBA in distance from SMU in 2012 and did MCA in regular. When he got a job in a leading IT MNC in India,his background verification failed stating that they do not consider the degree provided in distance.His joining got refused So better I would advice is either do a regular MBA or BBA...or if u do in distance or executive do it from a really reputable organisation like XLRI. or just don't do it. I wasted my money due to lack of knowledge. Hope my post help you.... ",

            "answer_text": "Any degree from SMU is not worth at all. Believe me Reasons This university is not recognized by any multinational companies , Immigration offices, international universities . The degree which you get from SMU is not valid for higher studies /PHD in India and abroad .They have freelance marketing and sales consultants who work on behalf of university and try to get admissions. These people get commission for every admission.To attract they offer free iPad and other fees .There are many other reasons . But ultimately this is not recognized anywhere.You can search for other review in Google.The best and safer way to earn any degree is IGNOU . This is recognized by all colleges in India and abroad . Also recognized by immigration offices and you can pursue higher studies or PHD with degree from IGNOU .",
