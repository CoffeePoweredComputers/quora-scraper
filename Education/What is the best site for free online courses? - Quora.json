            "answer_text": "Massive Online Open Courses These are websites that offer a wide variety of courses generally provided by legitimate universities. Most sites have a majority of free courses with an option to pay a small fee to receive a certificate including a grade upon completion of the course. Some have courses that cost money to join. The classes may be work at your own pace and start whenever you like, or start on a particular date and require you to follow along and learn and complete work each week. Not only do you have access to the material, but also you can communicate with other students and the teacher. https://www.coursera.org/ \u2013 Coursera was the first of these sites that I found, and still my favorite. Offers nearly 2,000 courses with 147 partners, it truly provides a massive amount of information to its users. The majority of classes are free to take or at least audit, with the ability to receive a certificate upon completion for a nominal fee. Classes start on a specific date with assignments usually due each week. https://www.edx.org/ \u2013 Another major player in the field. Over 1,000 courses from 90 partners. Majority of courses are free with a paid option for a certificate. Some specialized course series must be paid for. https://www.udemy.com/ \u2013 Courses can be offered by anyone. A larger amount of courses on this site must be paid for but it still includes many free sites https://www.udacity.com/ \u2013 The courses primarily focus on computer programming and web development https://www.futurelearn.com/ \u2013 Universities are primarily based in the UK Open courseware There are several top universities that offer a small number of classes for free online in the form of video lectures of the actual classes. Quiz and test material are not available but it still offers very in depth knowledge Yale \u2013 http://oyc.yale.edu/ Stanford \u2013 http://online.stanford.edu/ MIT \u2013 https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm Additional Sites https://www.khanacademy.org/ \u2013 Another favorite of mine. Everything is completely free with no ads; the site runs on donations. Videos started off covering just math and science but have since branched out into a wide variety of categories. Some even help tutor exams such as the SAT, LSAT, and MCAT. Similar to massive open online courses in its span. http://patrickjmt.com/ \u2013 Over a thousand free math videos from basic to high level math. https://www.codecademy.com/ \u2013 Learn how to code for free https://www.freecodecamp.com/ https://www.ted.com/ \u2013 Thousands of fascinating lectures. They won\u2019t teach you skills like other websites listed here, but they are still very interesting. http://www.wolframalpha.com/ \u2013 A computational knowledge engine. Kind of like a search engine for calculations and information. A massive amount of information. Really interesting what you can find on here. https://www.gutenberg.org/ \u2013 Primarily free e-books https://librivox.org/ \u2013 Free Audiobooks https://www.memrise.com/ \u2013 Flashcards that are designed to help you to better learn topics. Language https://www.duolingo.com/ \u2013 Simple easy to use website and app that teaches dozens of languages. Makes learning the language fun and addictive. Mostly free with a few minor additional paid features http://www.lang-8.com/ \u2013 Offers the main services for free with upgrades to premium. The internet has opened us up to the acquisition of knowledge and skill like never before. Take advantage of that as much as possible. I write on Post Grad Survival Guide about business, investing, job hunting, productivity, personal development and other skills and knowledge that recent graduates should learn to make it in the real world.
