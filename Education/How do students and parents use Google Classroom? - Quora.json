            "answer_text": "Students use Classroom to check assignments, complete assignments, and turn them in. They can send private messages to teachers. They can access whatever teachers add to the assignments: worksheets, links, etc. If the teachers allow it, students can see their grades. (I don\u2019t use the gradebook. I have a separate one.) My school made a decision to not allow parent access to Classroom. If the student wishes to show an assignment to the parent, it\u2019s the student\u2019s choice. (Perhaps to ask for help.) In any case, Classroom is simply a platform for homework and information regarding the work. That\u2019s it. ",
