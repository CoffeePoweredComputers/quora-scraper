            "answer_text": "Getting into veterinary schools in India is a process you start after 12th exam. 1. Score 1st division in 12th exam with Physics, Chemistry, Biology and English as your electives. If you are SC/ST/OBC- this rule doesn\u2019t apply to you. 3rd division is good enough. 2. Find a veterinary college in your home state [here is the link to find one - VCI ] and appear in entrance exam. Your own state will fill 85% of the seats in that college. 3. Appear in All India Pre-Veterinary Exam AIPVT 2016 which fills up 15% seats in all the veterinary colleges in India. 4. Ace the exams, choose college and have fun for next 5 years. 5. If you are OBC/ SC/ST or one of the privileged category and are reasonably good, changes of getting into veterinary college are very high. If you are a General Category, competition is extremely tough. ",
