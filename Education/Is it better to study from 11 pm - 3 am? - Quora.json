            "answer_text": "What is the best time to study? It\u2019s one of those endless debates among students; is it better to study at night or during the day? Each side has its own loyal advocates who will speak at length of the benefits of their preferred method to try and convince you of the benefits of their choice. Everyone thinks they know what the best time to study is but the reality is that each person is different and there is no clear winner from a scientific point of view. There are some people who get more out of studying at night while others find the best time to study to be the morning or the afternoon. In terms of objective reasons for both sides, we\u2019ve researched the following benefits to try and answer once and for all what is the best time to study?! Benefits of Studying During the Day 1. After a good nights sleep, you\u2019ll likely have more energy and a higher ability to concentrate the next day. 2. Society is structured around being active during the day and sleeping at night, so by sticking to this norm there are undeniable benefits such as being able to go to the library or book shop. 3. Most people are contactable during the day so it\u2019s easier to communicate with your friends or teachers during the day if you have any questions. 4. Natural light is better for your eyes. Artificial light hurts our eyes and can affect our natural sleep rhythm. Benefits of Studying at Night 1. People are more active, louder and intense during the day. At night it\u2019s only you and the night owls so you can study in peace and quiet. 2. If you\u2019re lucky enough to live near a library that\u2019s open late, you will notice that thelibrary is near deserted when you want to study late. 3. At night there are fewer distractions than during the day. Most of your friends are asleep and your social networks will be less active. 4. It is true that things look different by night. The night can increase your creative efficacy and help you see concepts differently. There are possibly more reasons why each of these options could be the best time to study. It\u2019s important to note however that ultimately it all depends on your individual preferences. Sadly, there really is no objective \u2018best time to study\u2018! It all depends on your personality, what you\u2019re studying, your resources, time management and your natural sleep cycle. Personally,I would not recommend to study from 11 pm to 3 am. It is the time for sleeping and not for studying. If you studying in these hours then certainly your time table is not correct. Try to make a time table for the whole day . Specify the time for each and everything you need to do. Don\u2019t make a time table which you cannot follow. Start with a simple time table. Allocate study hours before 11 pm. Best time for study is in the morning from 5 am to 8 am, as our mind is fresh and also normally it is the time of sunrise in most parts of the country. But still if you want to study at night, or are interested in starting, then read the tips below. 6 Tips for Night Time Studying If you know that you study better at night, follow these tips to get the most out of your preferred time of study: 1. Establish a Routine: If you decide to study at night, don\u2019t do it sporadically, establish a study routine. This way your body will get used to it and you can get the best study performance possible. If you study for a few days and a few nights, your body will go crazy! Pick one and stick with it. 2. Rest: If you study at night, this does not mean you should be sleeping less. A well rested mind is key to successful study so make sure you don\u2019t neglect your sleep by catching a few zzz\u2019s during the day. 3. Lighting: It can happen to us all; you start studying during the evening and next thing you know it\u2019s night time and you\u2019re studying in the dark! Make sure this doesn\u2019t become a common occurrence. If you\u2019re a night studier, work in a properly lit room as it will improve your study. 4. Time Management: It\u2019s easy to lose track of time when studying at night. This makes it even more important to create a study timetable outlining when you will take breaks. It\u2019s recommended that you take a 5 to 10 minute break every 50 minutes when studying. Also make sure you keep hydrated! 5. Music: As mentioned above, one of the benefits of studying at night is the increase in your creativity levels. Many believe that their creativity becomes more pronounced at night. That is why many artists work through the night. A good idea to induce your creativity is to study while listening to music that inspires and motivates you. 6. Organise a Study Group: Studying in the dead of night lacks a lot of the social aspects that daytime studying may have. With this in mind, it may be a good idea to organise a study group with other night studiers to help you keep motivated. ",

            "answer_text": "The better time to study depends on your body cycle. By body cycle, I mean the process of your body\u2019s \u2018high and low\u2019 time. Nobody knows your body better than yourself. You are aware of the time when you usually feel sleepy and when you usually feel fully energetic or charged up. And that\u2019s why I divide people into 2 categories : Morning peopleNight peopleMorning people , yes you may call them the better ones since they work according to the sun, can wake up early and they consider it as the best time to study. Whereas, the night people start in the night and end in the day time. Personally telling, I\u2019m a night person and that\u2019s why I prefer to study or concentrate in night only. That\u2019s the time when I find utmost peace in my home. So 11 pm to 3 am has always been the best time for me to study or to think about some important stuff of life. And it doesn\u2019t really bother me to hear the positives of morning study time coz I know my body cycle. May be, I would try to change my body cycle later due to situational changes but for now, I work and study according to the current cycle only. And it ofcourse gives me result, the most important thing. Summing it up, the \u201cbest\u201d time to study is when YOU feel charged and when you find peace. Just try to manage the number of hours you require to study. Nothing else matters then. :) ",
