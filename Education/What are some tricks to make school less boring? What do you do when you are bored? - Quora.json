I like to invent knew shapes and logos, and I have a few characters that pop up constantly.Writing love letters between Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore-I don't know. Just don\u2019t judge.Pen gymnastics-super easy but impressive.Blackout poetry-So, you write some passage you know by heart or find one online or in the work, then you cross out all the words except leave a few words to spell out some cool sentence.Write all the random stuff that pops into my head or that I find in my commonplace book (on my google drive).Sleep-Hey, it happens. I don\u2019t try, but I also don\u2019t sleep every night.Text-it isn\u2019t that hard if you use your computerDo kahoots from other classes-I have my friends send you the code from another classroom and participate in the kahoot with some spooky nameWrite letters to a pen pal- I actually don\u2019t do this one, but I know someone who does, and I thought it was worth mentioning.File my fingernails with my teeth-I know, gross, right?Tie my shoes-because when else am I supposed to do it?Draw all over yourself-and I mean all over.  13. Typing or writing up lyrics to Hamilton songs, Dear Evan Hansen, random songs I have stuck in my head, the new Ed Sheeran album, etc. 14. Converting melody charts which I wrote at home into sheet music. Sometimes I convert it into keyboard letters which you would need to type in order to achieve those notes on my computer guitar. (I assigned each key on the keyboard to a note which I recorded on guitar so the note will sound upon the typing of particular keys.) 15. Writing stories and poetry, etc. 16. Playing computer games-or basically doing anything on the internet 17. Asking the teacher long random questions-it wastes all the class time. ",

            "answer_text": "Alrighty, here\u2019s my guide to surviving high school boredom! -Music Yep, that\u2019s it! Works for me, at least. The second the teacher is done lecturing, I put in the earbuds and kick out the jams! It really does help the day go by faster, as everything goes by faster and is more enjoyable when there are some favorite tunes to go along with it. Instrumental tunes are usually the best for this purpose so you can still get some work done. You could also bring a good book to catch up on some reading while the teacher isn\u2019t teaching. As far as boredom while the teacher is teaching, try to relate what is being taught to something you are interested in. For instance, if the subject is Richard Nixon and Watergate, and you are really into tape recording, you might note that the Nixon taping system ran at 15/16 inches per second, one of a few reasons why the audio recordings made with the system are so hard to understand. If you\u2019re really into psychology, you could use that to analyze the characters you are reading about in Language Arts. You could also try and think of someone you know that would fits each character in real life. It\u2019s amazing how interesting even the most boring books can become if you can find a way to make the characters leap off the page! Or in Chemistry, if the subject is balancing chemical equations, try and think of times you\u2019ve created a chemical reaction yourself, such as making a baking soda and vinegar volcano, or lighting a fire. You\u2019ll find that if you can make personal connections to what is being taught, you\u2019ll find it much more interesting. In summary, there are many ways to make High School more interesting. Very few people will enjoy all of their classes, but there are ways to make almost all of them more enjoyable. By the way, I highly recommend this album for some background funk!  ",
