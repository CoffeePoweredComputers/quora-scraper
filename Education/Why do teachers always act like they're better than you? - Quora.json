            "answer_text": "Let me answer this as a teacher. Also, I will assume you mean \u201cbetter than students.\u201d I do not want to come off as defensive in any way here, so if I do, I will apologize in advance. First off, I am not sure that teachers always act like this at all. Good teachers help their students to grow. Good teachers know when they are unable to answer a question and are not afraid to say \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe we should learn about this together\u201d rather than giving an answer to make the student happy. Teachers do hold many answers, but not all. Teachers are the ones with the qualifications to be in the classroom educating you on a particular subject. The reality is, no teacher needs to feel threatened by a student, so why would they need to act like they are better? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am sure it happens, and some teachers make their students feel \u201cdumb\u201d or like they don\u2019t belong. But, I am pretty sure that this is not the norm. Personally, I run an inclusive classroom and try to make all students feel welcomed and like they are on a level playing field. I teach mathematics, and I know it makes many students uncomfortable since lots of people claim they are not \u201cmath people,\u201d so I want all students to feel like they can do it. I want all students to feel like I am including them in my lessons in some way, whether they are strong or weak in math. I don\u2019t have all the answers, and never claim to. If a student asks me a question, and I am uncertain of the answer, I will try with what I know, then tell them to get out their phones - let\u2019s Google it! In no way am I better than my students, and MOST teachers probably feel the same way. If you have a teacher that does make you feel like a lesser person in their classroom, they likely have the same attitude outside of school. A truly terrible character flaw, but I wouldn\u2019t lose too much sleep over it. Get through the semester / school year and move on. If it is really bad, maybe try talking to the teacher to address your concern. ",

            "answer_text": "Without an understanding of what you mean by \u201cbetter than you\u201d, it is hard to give you a good answer. This is as close as I can get. If you mean of more worth, then they are not and should not act as if they are. However, I have not met any teacher who acts like that. If you mean more knowledgeable in their subject matter. then that is likely true. They have spent years acquiring expertise concerning their discipline and should be acknowledged for that. If you think something they have presented is wrong you should be able to research an argument citing multiple unbiased sources explaining why they are wrong and you are right. Unbiased sources are generally considered peer reviewed journals or mainline news sources. Instructors I have worked with would take time to at least address your objection if presented in this form. I am not addressing race or other prejudices because those do not seem to be indicated by the question. ",
