            "answer_text": "After the bachelors degree it\u2019s time to go to seminars, workshops, inservice training. Get certified in ACLS. Earn certification in the area you choose to focus your career on. Do this gradually as you proceed through your career. After settling into your chosen specialty then work toward certification or begin a masters degree. Good luck in your career. After retiring from a fifty year career, I can still say it\u2019s the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done. ",
