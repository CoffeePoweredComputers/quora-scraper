            "answer_text": "Thanks to Internet, you don\u2019t need to pay a fortune to attend meetings, conferences, and training courses. In fact, you don\u2019t need to spend any money to learn. Embrace the amount of knowledge shared online. 1. BLOGS & WEBSITES Publishing a book among professionals seems to be a new trend. But did you know that most of the authors don\u2019t write their books from scratch? They base on (or even use) their existing blog posts and online articles. Find blogs, websites or online articles of people who you would like to call your mentors. Study them carefully. If you want, print them, so you always can easily refer to them. Throw paper guidebooks out\u200a\u2014\u200athey get outdated too quickly. Replace them with equally, or even more, informative online content that can be updated instantly. 2. FREE EBOOKS E-mail addresses, likes, comments, and shares are the new currency online. You can exchange them for access to even more valuable and useful content that your mentors put much work into. Don\u2019t want to share your e-mail address to receive free knowledge? No problem, create a new one and use it in more beneficial ways\u200a\u2014\u200asee the next point. 3. NEWSLETTERS This is one of the most powerful tricks that I\u2019ve been using for a while. Create a new e-mail account and dedicate it to one field that you want to become professional at. Let\u2019s say it will be \u201cphotography\u201d. Now find websites of all your mentors and photographs that you want to learn from. Sign up for their newsletters, using the new e-mail address. This way, you will be receiving exclusive and highly informative content directly to your inbox completely for FREE and with an easy access any time you want. I find in it more value than in standard online or traditional training courses. 4. YOUTUBE VIDEOS With over 18 000 hours of videos being upload every hour on Youtube, there must be MUCH valuable content that you can learn from. Again, find your mentors and subscribe to their channels. Watch their videos regularly and have fun\u200a\u2014\u200amany of them are created in a really entertaining way, so you can also have a great time. 5. PODCASTS I don\u2019t like wasting my time (who does?), so I find podcasts really beneficial. I listen to them, doing something else at the same time. Are you going by bus or tram? Listen to a podcast. Are you cleaning your room? Listen to a podcast. Are you waiting in a queue in a supermarket? Yes, listen to a podcast\u2026 Even if you don\u2019t focus on it fully, your mind will pick up what\u2019s important for you unconsciously. 6. LIVE VIDEOS Video is the future of media on the web. And so live videos are. You can see more and more of them when you scroll your Facebook wall or browse Instagram Stories. And I tell you, that\u2019s just the beginning. Smart people use them to have their knowledge spread and increase the visibility of their personal brand. Follow them on Social Media. Take part in their live videos, ask them questions in real time, watch replays when you have nothing else to do, and just make sure to use this new online trend to the fullest. 7. ONLINE COURSES AND UNIVERSITIES What if I told you that you can get a bachelor or a master degree without attending any university lesson and completely for free? Yes, it\u2019s possible. Online. Malmo University has some decent online studies in different that EU citizenships can enroll for free in. There are some requirements of course, but it\u2019s easy to meet them. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to other years of studies (I feel ya, life is short!), you can always check courses on Coursera or Udemy to learn from professors from the best universities in the world at your own pace. Those are just a few ways. Of course, there are many more! ",
