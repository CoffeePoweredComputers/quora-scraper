            "answer_text": "To answer this, you should really look at the UK rankings since they have a much richer dataset than the international rankings. The other five universities that feature in the top ten of all three national rankings are: St AndrewsImperialDurhamLoughboroughLancasterYou won't find all of these near the top of the international rankings, primarily due to the international rankings using reputation surveys (i.e. fame) to make up for their lack of hard facts. If you merge in the international rankings to get a composite list, you would replace Loughborough and Lancaster with LSE and UCL. This would probably have a better fit to most British people's idea of the prestige of the universities. ",
