            "answer_text": "I am the second oldest out of eight\u2026all girls except the second youngest. I had corporal punishment happen up until the age of 15. The only reason it stopped was due to my parents being arrested for that, and a whole slew of other crimes. Both my parents were drunks and drug addicts. They ran with a gang. They also did other crimes that I will not mention here, since this would not be the right place for that discussion. When I say corporal punishment, if the smallest one did something wrong then everyone got punished. The smallest for doing the offense, the oldest ones for not stopping the youngest in the first place. Some examples that I remember as to why I personally got \u201cpunished\u201d: Not sneaking out of the house quietly or quickly enough to go to school in the mornings. Eating anything in the kitchen. Food was a privilege. Not cooking something exactly right. Since I was not allowed to eat, I \u201cobviously\u201d cooked wrong deliberately. Asking to do after school events such as band or sports. This was also a privilege. I had to be home by a certain time every day with no exceptions . No talking back. No proving that a parent was actually wrong about something (this earned extra beatings). Glaring at a parent or showing strong emotions. Bad grades. I should have studied more, even though I had to do all the cooking, care for my siblings until bed, and we all had chores every day. When I mean care for my siblings, let me explain. Again, I am the second oldest out of eight. Once a new baby was between 2-3 weeks old, our \u2018mom' would literally throw the baby at me or my elder sister and say that the kid was now our responsibility and that she did her part. ( during the court case, she was found mentally incapable of rearing children). I could continue with various offenses, but I will move on to punishments. I have been beaten with a walking cane, both a wooden one and a metal one. Same with a wooden hairbrush, a hand, and a leather belt (buckle side hitting me of course). I have done more pushups than I can count. Halfway through pushups, one of the parents would almost always walk over and stomp the middle of my back. I have been punched in the stomach, in the head, and in the eyes. I would be beaten so badly that I could barely walk the next day, but I still was going to go to school, and was ordered to tell no one what was going on. At one point I was also ordered to not make any friends at school, since that would be a distraction from the responsibilities to my family. I couldn't tell you the amount of meals I missed. At five foot six, at the age of 15, I weighed 89 pounds. I was constantly sleep deprived and scared. If I had a babysitting job for a friend I had to give every penny to my parents when I got home. Even if they thought I kept any of the money, i would get beaten. I was being hit so often, that I stopped showing any emotion during a so called punishment. I wouldn't cry, act scared, or show pain. I literally tried to kill all of my emotions. I decided that I didn't want my parents to see that they had any effect on me any more. So to answer the question. Yes. Girls suffer through corporal punishment and sometimes so much worse than that. Trust me, when I was placed in the California foster care system after my parents were arrested, it literally saved my life. Again, that is a separate story for another time. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a huge difference between an adult temper tantrum and a well thought out and very controled spanking please adult temper tantrums are counter productive. My comments are based upon a spanking given in a very control manner without yelling, name calling or belittling. Hugs and cuddles are part of the ritual and the child/ young person has been told in advance that a given action is a spanking offence. The spanking is always proceed ed by a two way discussion about exactly what yhey did or didn't do and why their action warrants a spanking. They are allowed to plead their case and bring uo mitagiting circumstances. In the end both parent and child should agree (unless the child is being stubborn)that they have a spanking coming. Most kids have an inherent sence of fairness so if you have instilled honesty they will readly admit they have a spanking coming. When it is over the young person knows that their transgression has been forgiven and their slate is clean. For many children the releif of guilt is extremely comforting. I personally will often take the child for ice cream to celebrate their acceptance of personal responsibility. Take the time to do it right and you rarely have to spank. Obviously the younger the child the less discussion is required in the end you are the parent guardian and you not them are in charge. Rudeness or lack of respect can not be tolerated but their point of veiw delivered respectfully must be allowed. Respect is a two way street. Each and every child is unique so what might work for one child maynot work for another. There are also general differences in how a gender responses to spanking associated with age. Generally boys between oh say 6 and 11 seem to do reckless things to get them in trouble, spanking seems to work well to sort of tone that down. Spanking for most boys looses its effectiveness by mid teens and otherforms of discipline like loss of vehicle privileges etc are more effective. Girls on the other hand seem to get in trouble in their tween and teenage years and for some into their twenties. Grounding a 16 year old girl makes life incredibly miserable for everyones in the near proximity. When given the option, my daughters both natural and aquired opted for the paddle. Get it over with and everyone moves on. In my family that has been super effective. When is a child too old to spank\u2026\u2026.. that is between you and them. ",

            "answer_text": "QUESTION Are girls subject to corporal punishment from their parents? Short answer: Yes. I looked at a few state laws and about 10 minutes of overall research and there is no language to support any gender specific guidance. Long answer: Yes. Wikipedia - \u201cCorporal punishment of children by parents or other legal guardians is legal in the United States.\u201d Most state laws say something similar to - \u201creasonable methods of parental discipline\u201d In my home - Yes. We gave out some butt pops when the kids were younger. I can\u2019t remember a time where my husband popped my daughter and I don\u2019t think it is right for a grown man to hit a small child without dialing his strength back by 75%. I ran across this website that tells you how to break down a spanking. I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. So I decided to share. ",

I told him fine, but I can\u2019t go bare butt because I was on my period and would probably get blood on him. he backed off and I wasn\u2019t spanked that time, or ever again by him. mum spanked us by swatting our butts with a wooden spoon, so my last spank from her was when I was about 15 or 16.

We received the slipper for minor matters. It was usually carried out at the front of the classroom. I was told to bend over and I put my hands on my knees and quickly felt two or three whacks on my bottom. It was over and done with very quickly. Some teachers would give a choice of detention or the slipper and most girls opted for a smacked bottom instead of wasting an hour in detention. Girls were caned for serious misbehaviour. The cane was given in private in the headmistresses study and it was a more formal procedure. I had my bottom caned when I was 13. ",

            "answer_text": "In those families in which the children are punished with spankings, almost always the girls get spankings. In fact, statistically, girls get more spankings than boys; primarily because girls get spanked to a later age. Short of physical abuse, boys do not respond to spankings after age 11 (give or take a year). Girls generally respond to spankings well into their teens. Personally, I received my last spanking at age 17; my little brother had stopped being spanked more than a year earlier. If we both earned punishment, he would likely be given extra chores while I would be spanked. ",

I don't have a lot of data, but I would guess the ones that do are likely to spank both girls and boys. In our family, our parents sometimes spanked us. Both of us are girls. It was pretty common that kids of both genders got whooped where we grew up in rural Tennessee, and still is. That was a long time ago: the last I got was when I was around 15, which was 18 years ago. I have nephews and nieces there who get spankings now. I know many other parents who never spank their kids at all, which includes their daughters. ",

I spent a couple of my high school years living with her and her 2 kids in Singapore while my parents (from HK) where travelling around a lot on business. I was made aware of the rules of the house when I arrived and knew that a cane was kept for extreme measures. During a school break my 2 cousins (twins, boy+girl one year older than me) and I got into some trouble at a shopping plaza and 2 police ladies visited our home to speak to us. To avoid the situation going to charges my aunt told the police ladies that we would be caned. She caned the 3 of us on our backsides, 3 red hot stings each while the police ladies observed and agreed that the case was closed. ",

If she then felt the need to tell dad then I also got his belt. I've no idea if it's legal, and no interest in finding out, either. For me it was just a fact of life. One thing though, I've never laid hands on my child. I learned that if you know you're gonna be belted anyway, lets make the transgression worth it. ",

They were taken into the living room which was open to the kitchen, they stood next to each other and bent over; they had to pull down their shorts and underwear then bend over the rest of the way and grab their ankles. Their dad then paddled both of them on the bare butt. ",

I don\u2019t think most states have an outright ban on corporal punishment, based on the feeling that parental discipline (up to a point) is an individual choice and not a governmental one. Having said that, many states might have thresholds regarding the age of the child or the levels of injury caused (bruises, bleeding, broken bones) that would trigger a child abuse investigation. Also, I\u2019m not sure why girls were singled out in the question \u2014 most child abuse laws are gender neutral and would not treat boys and girls differently. ",

However, that was the 30\u2032s, I remember as a child seeing my cousin (girl) getting spanked by my aunt, but it was in the heat of the moment, and more like a firm tap than a brutal whooping per se.

And, no, it is not legal nor is it humane. The children are taken away from the abuser parent and placed in foster homes for their safety. It is not legal for anyone to hit anyone, period. If you\u2019re talking about spanking a child or smacking a child for discipline, that\u2019s another story. But if you\u2019re talking about an adult hitting another person (man, woman or child, related or not) that is battery and is illegal. ",
