            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question: When I was younger, I hated learning.  I hated school.  I hated reading.  Anytime someone started to say the words, \"Let me show you...\" I would tune out.  I didn't want to be taught.  I didn't want to listen. Why? Because I associated \"learning\" with the fact that my parents, both of whom are very successful, were trying to tell me \"what to do.\" This led to exactly what you're talking about: the self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.  I did horribly in everything.  As should be obvious, \"learning\" is a pretty key component to doing well in life, and I seemed to be on a quest to ensure that nobody taught me anything, and everything I learned, I learned completely on my own. Not a very conducive long-term growth strategy, to say the least. Fast forward a few years, and I had straight As all through college, graduating with honors and eventually becoming one of the representative students for the creative writing department.  I went to open houses and spoke to parents and incoming freshman about my experiences studying creative writing in college, and how these new students could be successful in their own learnings. How did I change my mindset? I decided that I wanted to learn for me. See, I associated learning with having to be someone other than me.  I associated it with pursuing my father's dream or my mother's dream or society's expectations of me\u2014all of which I didn't want.   As soon as I reframed it and started focusing on learning out of genuine interest, everything changed for me.  I aced math.  I aced chemistry.  I aced history.  All of it suddenly became easy because I was actually curious\u2014instead of \"doing it for the grade\" or \"doing it to make my parents happy.\" This is the key, and all it takes is a new perspective.   Part of it was just simple maturity.  I started to see that smart people were badass.  I started to realize that knowing a lot was impressive.  I found people who could talk about a whole range of subjects to be interesting people\u2014and I wanted to be interesting too.   It goes back to the inner dialogues we have with ourselves.  I had to shift my inner dialogues from, \"This is pointless / I'll never be good at this / What's the point,\" to \"I can figure this out / I wonder if... / This is actually pretty cool!\"  You have to tell yourself you're interested.  You have to start reading with curiosity instead of seeking short-term memorization.  You have to find the part of what you're studying that interests you and then build from there. But can it be done? Absolutely. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is one way you should give some thought to. Have you ever done any reading from Carol Dweck?If not, you\u2019ll probably find her research on using praise very interesting.This will be particularly true if you have children or grandchildren in theextended family.    Why you may ask? It is simply that Stanford ProfessorCarol Dweck has discovered that how we praise our children can benefit ordetriment their self-view.    Being mindful about how you praise your child canhelp your child foster a growth mindset and boost his or hermotivation, resilience and learning. All very important to us all, aren\u2019t they?   Who is Carol Dweck? ProfessorCarol Dweck is a psychologist at Stanford University and the prime forcebehind mindset theory. Dweck\u2019s research has led her to theconclusion that each individual will place themselves on a continuum accordingto their implicit belief of where their own ability originates.   In simple terms this means that thosewho tend towards believing in \u2018nature\u2019 or innate ability as the prime factor indetermining their success are defined in Dweck\u2019s model as having \u2018fixedmindsets\u2019 or fixed theories of intelligence.   At the other end of the continuum arethose that believe their success, and the success of others, comes from hardwork, learning, and persistence. These people are defined as having \u2018growthmindsets\u2019 or incremental theories of intelligence.     What are mindsets? In the fixed mindset, people believethat their talents and abilities are fixed traits. They have a certain amountand that\u2019s that; nothing can be done to change it. Many years of research havenow shown that when people adopt the fixed mindset, it can limit their success.They become over-concerned with proving their talents and abilities, hidingdeficiencies, and reacting defensively to mistakes or setbacks-becausedeficiencies and mistakes imply a (permanent) lack of talent or ability. Peoplein this mindset will actually pass up important opportunities to learn and growif there is a risk of unmasking weaknesses. -Carol Dweck    When you praise intelligence, you foster a fixedmindset, the belief that one\u2019s intellectual ability is inherent. Those with afixed mindset tend to agree with statements such as \u201cYou have a certain amountof intelligence and cannot do much to change it.\u201d They see mistakes as failureand as signs that they aren\u2019t talented enough for the task.    More concerning, they seek experiences thatreinforce their ability and prove their intelligence, leading them to avoidchallenging tasks. The desire to learn becomes secondary.    In the growth mindset, people believethat their talents and abilities can be developed through passion, education,and persistence. For them, it\u2019s not about looking smart or grooming theirimage. It\u2019s about a commitment to learning\u2013taking informed risks and learningfrom the results, surrounding yourself with people who will challenge you togrow, looking frankly at your deficiencies and seeking to remedy them. Mostgreat business leaders have had this mindset, because building and maintainingexcellent organizations in the face of constant change requires it.\u201d -Carol Dweck   When you praise for effort, you encourage a growth mindset, the beliefthat intellectual ability can be developed through education and effort. Thosewith a growth mindset believe that they can get better at almost anything, aslong as they spend the necessary time and energy. Instead of seeking to avoidmistakes, they see mistakes as an essential precursor of knowledge.    The Dweck experiment For the past ten years or so,psychologist Carol Dweck and her team at Columbia (she\u2019s now at Stanford)studied the effect of praise on students in a dozen New York schools. Herwork\u2014a series of experiments on 400 fifth-graders\u2014paints the picture mostclearly.   Dweck sent four female researchassistants into New York fifth-grade classrooms. The researchers would take asingle child out of the classroom for a nonverbal IQ test consisting of aseries of puzzles\u2014puzzles easy enough that all the children would do fairlywell.    Once the child finished the test, theresearchers told each student his score, and then gave him a single line ofpraise. Randomly divided into groups, some were praised for their intelligence. They were told,\u201cYou must be smart at this.\u201d Other students were praised for their effort: \u201cYou must have workedreally hard.\u201d   Why just a single line of praise? \u201cWewanted to see how sensitive children were,\u201d Dweck explained. \u201cWe had a hunchthat one line might be enough to see an effect.\u201d   Then the students were given a choiceof test for the second round. One choice was a test that would be moredifficult than the first, but the researchers told the kids that they\u2019d learn alot from attempting the puzzles.    The other choice, Dweck\u2019s teamexplained, was an easy test, just like the first. Of those praised for theireffort, 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. Of those praised fortheir intelligence, a majority chose the easy test. The \u201csmart\u201d kids took thecop-out.   So why did this happen? \u201cWhen we praisechildren for their intelligence,\u201d Dweck wrote in her study summary, \u201cwe tellthem that this is the name of the game: Look smart, don\u2019t risk makingmistakes.\u201d And that\u2019s what the fifth-graders had done: They\u2019d chosen to looksmart and avoid the risk of being embarrassed.   In a subsequent round, none of thefifth-graders had a choice. The test was difficult, designed for kids two yearsahead of their grade level. Predictably, everyone failed. But again, the twogroups of children, divided at random at the study\u2019s start, respondeddifferently.    Those praised for their effort on thefirst test assumed they simply hadn\u2019t focused hard enough on this test. \u201cTheygot very involved, willing to try every solution to the puzzles,\u201d Dweckrecalled. \u201cMany of them remarked, unprovoked, \u2018This is my favorite test.\u2019\u2009\u201dNot so for those praised for their smarts. They assumed their failure wasevidence that they weren\u2019t really smart at all. \u201cJustwatching them, you could see the strain. They were sweating and miserable.\u201d   Having artificially induced a round offailure, Dweck\u2019s researchers then gave all the fifth-graders a final round oftests that were engineered to be as easy as the first round. Those who had beenpraised for their effort significantly improved on their first score\u2014by about 30percent. Those who\u2019d been told they were smart did worse than they had at thevery beginning\u2014by about 20 percent.   Dweck had suspected that praise couldbackfire, but even she was surprised by the magnitude of the effect.    \u201cEmphasizing effort gives a child avariable that they can control,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey come to see themselves asin control of their success. Emphasizing natural intelligence takes it out ofthe child\u2019s control, and it provides no good recipe for responding to afailure.\u201d   In follow-up interviews, Dweckdiscovered that those who think that innate intelligence is the key to successbegin to discount the importance of effort. Iam smart, the kids\u2019 reasoninggoes; I don\u2019t need to put outeffort. Expending effortbecomes stigmatized\u2014it\u2019s public proof that you can\u2019t cut it on your naturalgifts.   Repeating her experiments, Dweck foundthis effect of praise on performance held true for students of everysocioeconomic class. It hit both boys and girls\u2014the very brightest girlsespecially (they collapsed the most following failure). Even preschoolersweren\u2019t immune to the inverse power of praise.    Learning implications  Praising kids for smarts encourages them to avoidthe most useful kind of learning activities, those in which we learn from ourmistakes. Without experiencing and focusing attention on mistakes, minds willnot revise its models. Mistakes are repeated and challenges avoided.

            "answer_text": "Decouple learning from \"what I will do well in.\" Learn things that interest you and things you need to know. I guarantee that anything you practice, you'll get better at, assuming you practice hard and keep working past failure.  This year, I am learning some new computer programming languages, sewing, electronics, chess, and some Victorian history. Will I \"do well\" at that stuff? I don't know and I don't care. My goal is to learn more about those subjects than I do now. If I put in the effort, there's almost no way I can fail at that.  \"I'm not fond maths.\" Well, there are two main reasons people expend effort: (1) they need to in order to complete some goal; (2) they are fond of the subject. In the former case, focus on the goal. We don't take out the trash because we like doing it. We take out the trash in order to have a clean house. If you neither need to learn maths nor are fond of the subject, why do it? Why not, instead, challenge yourself in a field you already care about. You like arts. Do you know everything about them there is to know? ",
