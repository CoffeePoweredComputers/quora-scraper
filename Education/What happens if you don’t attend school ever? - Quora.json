            "answer_text": "That depends on where you live in the world. However, no matter where you live, never attending school will likely make you a more vulnerable individual. If your family is loving, caring, and their behaviors are not influenced by strong religious or cultural beliefs and practices, you may be ok because they will always be there to advocate for your health and safety. If this is not the case, you need to get to school as soon as you can so that you can be independent and not at the mercy of anyone who will use you to their own advantage. That is the main benefit of an education. It gives you the opportunity to be free from oppressive beliefs, people, and situations. ",
