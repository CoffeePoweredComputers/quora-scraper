            "answer_text": "Mark is right, but to expand on that a little bit.. Early Modern English playing (not acting yet) was not the glamorous profession that we imagine actors have today. Players went to work every day, rehearsed (a little), did the business of running a theatre (the 8 men who owned Shakespeare's theatre, including the playwright himself, were also the principle actors), and put on a show at 2 in the afternoon. Every day. What we might now call an honest day's work. There weren't Oscars, Tonys, or anything like that. Shakespeare's company had the patronage of the Lord Chamberlain, and later the King himself. There are also limited records of court performances of plays in the early years of King James I's reign, and those records show a considerable amount of performances of plays by Shakespeare - Othello, Merchant of Venice, The Winter's Tale, etc.Finally, Shakespeare himself had earned patronage as a poet, although his last long poem was published before the Lord Chamberlain's Men were formed, so that may not have continued.

He (along with a couple other members of his company) was given special cloth by royal proclamation to be fashioned into a fine suit to be worn in the Queen\u2019s procession at a special time one year.
