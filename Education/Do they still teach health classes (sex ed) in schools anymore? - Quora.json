            "answer_text": "Yes, and it\u2019s a good thing. Sure there are plenty of forums, but they\u2019re no good for two reasons. One is that the information in these forums is unreliable and two is that not everybody visits those forums. There is a lot of nonsense online that is being called sex education, but false information is worse than no information at all. You don\u2019t want children to believe the many lies about sex that spread on the internet. Sex ed at school is at least supposed to be objective and most of the time it is indeed. This information can be trusted. And no matter how much knowledge there is available online about sex education, as long as it\u2019s not being read it\u2019s useless. The trick with sex education is that you should teach this to children before they become interested in sex. At that point in their life they\u2019re unlikely to look up that information for themselves. At the point they become interested in sex, it might already be too late. Sex education at school is mandatory, everybody gets it. Everybody learns it. That also includes children that otherwise wouldn\u2019t learn this information on the internet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good thing that all of the information that is given in sed ed classes can also be found online. But it\u2019s an addition, it can never be a replacement. ",
