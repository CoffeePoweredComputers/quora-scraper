            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to enthusiastically recommend Colt Steele\u2019s React Bootcamp, which you can find right here: The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router) That\u2019s a great course, and very project-driven. The projects can be a lot of fun, too. I originally learned React from the official docs and tutorials but I ended up doing Colt\u2019s course later on and it answered a lot of questions that I had. Colt also teaches some useful design patterns that aren\u2019t in the docs. I ended up supplementing his course with another one by Stephen Grider when I wanted to integrate Redux into a project. Colt covers Redux a bit in his course but that workflow is more complex and Grider takes more time to explain it. You can find that course here: Modern React with Redux Training Course You should be able to get both courses for under $20 each. If you see a different price, just Google \u201cUdemy Coupon.\u201d Good luck! ",
