            "answer_text": "well it was a mixture. some were easy, some were hard.there was a question: 1-(1/3)+(1/5)-(1/7)+....=? (options were-2\u03c0, \u03c0,\u03c0/2, \u03c0/4).you can do it simply in your calculator without knowing any physics or math.there was a question about measuring Sz operator of spin-1 particle(which you can not do without knowing how to do it.)there was a question about first order perturbation. you dn't have to know a lot of things about perturbation theory to do it.you can do it if you know what is 1st order perturbation term(average of H').so, it wasn't too hard or too easy in my opinion. But at the end, only way to know 'How was jest2016' is you solve the question paper for yourself. ",
