            "answer_text": "Teaching as a lecturer, teacher in \u201cschooling systems\u201d-private/public- is a paid job to earn a living as in any other skills job. Teaching as an evangelical religious outreach can be called a mission for some involved in this enterprise with the caution that many are persuaded by the power and income received to focus only on these two outcomes and view the religious aspect as an incidental marketing tool to get more income. Teaching for some parents is burdensome and leaves it to the community/government as they do not have the time, knowledge or skills to fulfill this task. The community in which one resides decides what are the skills to be taught to keep their community in existence. ",
