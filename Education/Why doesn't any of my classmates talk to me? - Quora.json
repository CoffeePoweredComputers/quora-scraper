            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s see here: Are you kind? If you\u2019re a bit of an arrogant, inconsiderate redneck, then chances are no one wants to be associated with you. I\u2019ve found simple acts of kindness can go a long way (no, I\u2019m not some mum telling you how valuable kindness is).Are you attractive? This one gets the chicks every time (assuming you\u2019re a boy). Chances are that if you\u2019re smoking hot, you\u2019ll get attention from some girls (again, assuming you\u2019re a boy). Other boys will get jealous of the attention from the opposite gender and probably will want to be associated with you to get some stares too. They probably wanna know your secrets. And girls will talk to you more often.Are you a geek? While having geeky traits can attract well, geeks, most students (especially in high school) don\u2019t want to associate themselves with a couch potato who has a sexual attraction to his computer.Are you smart? People either envy smart people, or they ask them questions (or at least ask them to do their assignments).Have you done something publicly embarrassing in the last 30 days? High schoolers are brutal. While some forget about it, others like to bring up that time you tripped down the stairs and will laugh about it.Most importantly, have you talked to them? Not all people like to break the ice. Tell the people of the Titanic that.",

            "answer_text": "Could be many reasons why really but the most likely is they are to self involved or to busy with their friends and don't care for making new ones so don't worry. And hey even if no one talks to you in class your probably awesome. Just remember you c9uld be like the song everyone skips till they realize it's fire then they listen to it all the time. That's how I am lol if I don't talk to people they don't talk to me then we become friends but it only recently got like that sadly I was a big target for bullies ",
