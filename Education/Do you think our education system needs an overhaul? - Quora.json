            "answer_text": "Progressive (1984) Education in K-12, university and grad school needs all tax monies defunded: local, state and federal. Why? Prog (1984) Ed is based on the tyrant\u2019s creed: \u201cMorals are, heh heh, relative.\u201d It is taught in order to make dystopian society, and especially to make compliant people as mental slaves. When in 1787 the states signed on to the US Constitution, they signed on to a Constitutional Republic\u2026 not a suicide pact. But now, to take tax money from any source (local, state, federal) and use it to create and maintain Progressive (1984) Education is to kill the United States. This is actually the goal, as global governance is the religion of the Deep State, which instituted Prog (1984) Ed in the first place. Grades K-12 need to have expunged from them\u2026 everything Prog (1984) Ed. Same with universities and grad schools. No sane person wants to ever stand before a judge in court, a judge who has been taught \u201cmorals are, heh heh, relative\u201d and is dedicated to Progressive (1984) Ed twisted precepts, memes and manners. The goal of Prog (1984) Ed is injustice, so it ruins courts. Actually, Progressive (1984) Ed is designed to maximize death, destruction of time, wasting of money and ruination of all energy. (See Chicago weekend death count, for example. The most Prog city has the most violent deaths?) Therefore, defund Prog (1984) Ed. ",

            "answer_text": "A2a Hi Oskar . In the uk yes . Schools put too much emphasis on academics and not enough on practical subjects . Many children are like me they have some form of practical skills , there intelligence lies here, not in academics . But since practical subjects get liitle air time these children dont get the chance to show their ability . Hence they get lost in the academics and end up leaving school with little or nothing . Made to feel inadequate and failures . In the construction industry there is a massive shortage of tradesmen just crying out for these type of people, but company's are reluctant to take them on as they have no background skills . Those they could of learned in school . People like me show what they can achieve , can inspire others to follow in our footsteps if only these type of children we're given a chance in school . ",
