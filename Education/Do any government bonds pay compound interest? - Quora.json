            "answer_text": "A Zero-coupon bond effectively pays compound interest. You buy a bond at a discount to face value, and at maturity it pays out the face value. Along the way, you are earning interest that is automatically reinvested in the bond rather than paid out in a coupon. In the United States, dealers buy regular Treasury bonds and separate each individual coupon and the final principal payment into their own securities, and resell them individually. These are called \"strip bonds\", and are referred to by the contrived acronym STRIPS -- \"Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities.\" Many other countries either sell zero-coupon bonds or their own versions of strip bonds.
