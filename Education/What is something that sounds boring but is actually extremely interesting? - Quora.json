            "answer_text": "Learning How To Learn (i.e. Meta-learning) Sadly, the state of affairs might be even more dire than people \"merely\" considering the topic boring. I say this because to consider a topic boring, one would have to actually consider it in the first place. If you approached me back when I was a high school pupil (\u201804 -\u201908), and asked me \"Do you think meta-learning is boring?\" I would likely have asked \"What is meta-learning?\" Upon understanding, I would then eventually have asked myself \"How is it that I'm already learning at high school level and I haven't even been taught how to learn?\" So for me, it\u2019s not so much that people consider it boring, but that it\u2019s outside of their radar. I must also state that I mention high school because I not only think meta-learning is interesting, but I think it\u2019s also essential and foundational. I must admit though, even though I don\u2019t think people consider it boring necessarily, I never call it \u201clearning how to learn\u201d without expecting eye-rolling from the unaware person I\u2019m discussing it with. Going back to the matter of school: I\u2019d like to be fair to my teachers and say there were at least some features of meta-learning within a subject here and there (such as mindmapping in English class for example). In the name of even more fairness, I just asked my niece who just finished high school, whether or not she had a brush with the subject. This is just to make sure I'm not too out of touch and outdated in my thinking. She too did not learn about meta-learning, she says. As far as fun, I think it's fun to entertain the idea that your brain is not just something you can use, but something you can harness. You become more likely to say things like \"I think I should study Mandarin,\" because you learn not to put too much emphasis on the idea that some things are just inherintly difficult, and others inherently easy. Dr. Jawanza Kunjufu speaks on this quite eloquently here (at 23:13 - 25:58):  The other fun thing is when you learn about all the luminaries that have used meta-learning in history, like Salvador Dali, Thomas Edison etc. If their achievements are anything to go by, I'd like to think they probably weren't boring people. If we're talking present-day, David Blaine, as an endurance artist is really interested in sleep deprivation, and through studying it, has become interested in the subject of sleep in general. He speaks about Edison taking naps with a ball bearing in his hand which is an interesting anecdote you can look into here: The Naps of Thomas Edison - [Post: Visualize] I cannot do this post justice without touching on the broader subject of pedagogy (which is basically means \u201cthe approach taken to teach\u201d). For that I will leave you with an Elon Musk clip. Thank you for this. It turns out that another good way to learn, according to some experts, is to teach. Your question is my opportunity. Enjoy.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think ultimately, as long as you enjoy learning for learning\u2019s sake, anything can be interesting. That said, I\u2019d say geometry can be EXTREMELY boring on the surface, but gets incredibly bizarre the further you go down. Let\u2019s start with Buckyballs. Buckyballs (or NeoCubes or ZenMagnets or what have you) are a group of magnetic spheres you can buy in packs of 125 or 216 (or higher quantities). Why are they sold in those numbers? Because they sell them packaged in a cube, usually a 5 by 5 by 5 cube or 6 by 6 by 6. Why are we starting with Buckyballs? Because they easily allow you to explore geometric patterns, circle and sphere packing, magnetism (which itself is an exploration of the rules that govern the universe, which is an entire rabbit hole of interesting information itself), construction, polar alignment, the list goes on. Say we start with just two magnets. They pull towards each other when aligned one way, and push away from each other when aligned another way. Each magnet has a North pole and a South pole. North attracts South and repels North, and South attracts North and repels South. Let\u2019s grab 6 magnets. You can line them all up and they\u2019ll stay in a straight line, with the North end of each magnet all facing the same direction. So all together, they become one big, long magnet. But, the line is flexible, so you can bend the North end down to the South end and you get a ring of 6 balls. But that ring is, at the same time, a hexagon, with each ball being one vertex (or one edge). There\u2019s more to play with here, but we\u2019ll talk about that later. Let\u2019s get another 6. When you try to put this 6 and the last 6 together, a number of things can happen. They could stick together and form two parallel lines of 6, they could form a ring of 12, if you try to stack them they will line up with each other in 2 different ways depending on the direction the magnets are facing relative to each other, and so on. Soon you\u2019ll find you can make a ring of 6 and a ring of 12, and if aligned properly, you can have the 6 nest perfectly inside the 12, forming a larger hexagon, of which you can make 12 if you have 216 magnets to start with. So you can intrinsically learn that 216 divided by 18 is 12, without doing any actual math. But then, you can also construct regular polyhedra (which is just fancy talk for make shapes) out of those hexagons. If you put 4 together, you can make a tetrahedron (tetra=4, hedron=shape), 8 will give you an octahedron, and so on. There\u2019s loads more to these, but I think this is a decent introduction. I just love these because playing with them helps me merge my proclivity to be creative with my desire for precision and symmetry. :) ",
