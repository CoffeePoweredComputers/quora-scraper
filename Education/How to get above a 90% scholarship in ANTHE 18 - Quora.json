            "answer_text": "I got 70% scholarship at ANTHE. I know It\u2019s not thaaaat great but its okayish. You literally just need to do your books really well and you\u2019ll be fine. Get the science part perfect and you\u2019ll definitely get above 80% and for Maths I recommend M.L. Aggarwal and R.D Sharma they really helped me get my percentage up . Oh, and make a time frame for your studying. As in, Take 8 hours of studying on weekday as a normal and work with that and stretch it to 12 hours on a weekend. And you\u2019ll be fine. Believe in yourself. I did and I\u2019m pretty happy with myself now (like on an idealistic level but okay) ",
