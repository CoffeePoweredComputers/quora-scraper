            "answer_text": "As an uninformed kid who thought C++ was an update to C, and jumped to C++ from C, I think I am qualified to answer this question. If you are thinking the same thing, do not rush. What did you learn in C? Although C and C++ are different languages, they are from the same category. So if you have just started, you will not be completely shocked. What do you mean by learning C by the way? If you meant mastering the language it is going to take a lot of time. Learning a language is not the same thing as finishing a book. I remember reading my first C book. I didn\u2019t have a computer and I didn\u2019t even know I needed a computer! I read it like a novel, finishing it in 3\u20134 days understanding literally nothing. I then discovered it was actually a programming language\u2026 After that I did a research (not a good one\u2026 you will see) on programming languages. And when I saw C++, I was devastated thinking I wasted my time on another old language instead of learning the updated(!) version. But I didn\u2019t give up. I started C++, however now the things were different. The language looks really similar to the good old C. My dumbass brain supposed that these were the unupdated parts of the language( Boy was I dumb ) and felt confident enough to not read them. However, the codes started to be incomprehensible really quickly. It felt different. While I was scratching my head I got my own computer and (finally) wrote my first code in the C language (because I already knew it right?) ERROR: unknown type name \u2018using\u2019\u00a0ERROR: \u2018cout\u2019 undeclared (first use in this function)\u00a0WRONG. As you can see I knew nothing. I didn\u2019t know C, I didn\u2019t know C++. I was blindly reading them. This is not the way to learn these languages. I am now teaching C++ to small groups. I know that C++ is not the updated C now. But believe me or not, I still cannot comfortably program in C language. Knowing a language means using it. My native language is Turkish. However I do not know all the words in Turkish. Should I learn Turkish? No, I guess not. Should I leave Turkish to learn German? No, I guess not. If I to speak German for 20 years would I be able to speak Turkish this fluently? No, I guess not. ",

            "answer_text": " C is the default choice for source level programming, like kernel programming, driver development etc..C is somewhat better than C++ in speed and efficiency. It is easier to code and debug in C than C++. so, it is better to learn C Language before C++. C++ is by far more complex than C, it has a lot more stuff in the language itself, it has a bigger standard library, it performs a lot of implicit things that are not seen in the code, but, at the same time, it makes programming easier because all of those extra features. Applications of C Programming: C language is used for creating computer applications.Used in writing Embedded software.Firmware for various electronics, industrial and communications products which use micro-controllers.It is also used in developing verification software, test code, simulators etc. for various applications and hardware products.The best way to learn C Programming is from online courses\u2026 you may learn from them. I can also suggest you the Best C Programming Online Courses: #1 Introduction to Programming in C Specialization From this course you may learn about: Among the 4 course of this specialisation the 1st course is about the Programming Fundamentals and the introduction about the programming C. this course teaches you about the problem solving process in seven steps.Writing, Running, and Fixing Code in C is the 2nd course of this specialisation and in this course you will gain knowledge on how to write the code and how to run, compile your program and how to debug and test it.In the 3rd course i.e Pointers, Arrays, and Recursion you will learn about the recursive functions and about arrays which provides a way to bundle data by guaranteeing sequences of the data and are grouped together.The last course of this specialisation i.e., Interacting with the System and Managing Memory you will gain knowledge on sophisticated uses for pointers, like strings and multidimensional arrays, and also how to write programs that read and write files and take input from the user.By the end of this specialisation you will get to know completely about the C programming and how to read, write and implement the C code.",
