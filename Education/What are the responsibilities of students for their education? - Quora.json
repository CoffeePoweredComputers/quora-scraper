            "answer_text": "Students, in an educational system, have two main roles. The first role is probably the most state-forward one. Students need to learn what the teachers are teaching. The duty of an educational system is to teach students about the various aspects of our world and the student is the one who needs to learn them. Students are also supposed to apply what they have learned in school in their lives. This creates meaning to the materials presented to the students. For example, someone taking art classes should not stop creating art after their art classes finish. They should continue to draw and apply the techniques and strategies of what they had learned in art class in their creations. A student\u2019s role in an educational system is to learn about the subject and find ways to apply that learning for the betterment of themselves or to others. ",
