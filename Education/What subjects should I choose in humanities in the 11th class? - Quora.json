            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want to do after class 12th. But the best combination which I think as a former humanities student is this - English as the language compulsory History and Economics. You can choose between Political Science, Geography and Psychology as per what you like and what you dream of becoming! And I would certainly prefer to take Maths as your optional subject. I feel that Maths in class 11 and 12th keeps your analytical brain active and it helps you with all your entrance exams. If you have the option for sixth subject then choose another one from Pol science, Geo and Psycology. This is just my opinion, you should take subjects which you like and which may help you with your future aspirations. ",
