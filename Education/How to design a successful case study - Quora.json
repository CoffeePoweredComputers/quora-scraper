            "answer_text": "A2A from Halima Ali. Question: How do I design a successful case study? Halima, there are a plethora of examples of case studies for various disciplines available via the web. For example, do a search for \u201cBusiness Case Study format\u201d and you\u2019ll be overwhelmed with various permutations. Be cautious though; there are a lot of folks / businesses offering their templates for a fee. You don\u2019t have to pay for anything\u2026just due some due diligence. I suggest that you follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid). I\u2019m going to assume that you are preparing a case study for a client - there are plenty of other reasons for doing a case study. I always start off with the following basic white paper outline (meant as a decision paper of not more than 2 to 2 1/2 pages): 1) Issue / Problem 2) Background 3) Options 4) Recommendations. I then expand into the following\u2026depending upon the purpose of the case study: 1. Executive Summary - the executive summary summarizes the business case, including your recommendation. This should be stand alone and sufficient to take a decision. 2. Introduction - why / what is the purpose of the study? 3. Statement of the problem - what is the challenge? Doesn\u2019t have to be a problem\u2026can be something such as moving into a new market; change in legal environment; change in competitive landscape, etc. 4. Analysis. 5. Discussion of Possible Options. ... 6. Recommendation. 7. Details of your Chosen Option - this is sort of optional\u2026depending on context of case study. 8. Conclusion. Hope this helps. ",

When they start the study, they try to cover the entirety of the topic, only to realize that what they are digging into would be too much for even a doctoral dissertation. The end result is a case study that is a mile wide and an inch deep. Or metrically, a kilometer wide and a millimeter deep. One must focus on one element, and delve deeply and completely. Be certain that there are no \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that have not been addressed. ",
