            "answer_text": "In my senior year of high school, I was extremely interested in serving in the military. As some other folks have touched on, I visited with recruiters from every branch save for the Coast Guard (there wasn\u2019t a recruiter in the area). I was struck with the different attitude expressed in the Marine Corps recruiting office. The other folks in the other offices were all professional, but the Marine Corp recruiter will typically leave a potential applicant questioning if they have what it takes to pass boot camp and the like. This left me struck with at desire to join \u201cthe best branch of the military\u201d. Since I was 17 at the time, legally I had to have my parents present to sign up for the Delayed Entry Program (DEP). Having my parents present was very helpful since they were able to add wisdom to my final decision. After hashing out all the details I eventually signed an enlisted reserve contract to become a 7242 \u201cAir Control Electronics Operator\u201d. From that point I became a \u201cPoolie\u201d. As a Poolie, I attended functions held by the recruiters intended to prepare me for the challenges ahead which was very helpful later on in boot camp for knowing what to expect. When I graduated, I went to boot camp only a few weeks later. It is definitely as challenging as folks say\u2026 getting physically fit can definitely make things a little easier, but much of the whole experience is very mental. Advise to remember during boot camp is fairly simple\u2026 do what you\u2019re told to the best of your ability. They are trying to mold undisciplined civilians into Marines who can follow orders of the senior Marines assigned to lead them. If you show the Drill Instructors (DIs) you know how to do this\u2026 you will STILL get challenged and messed with\u2026 but to a much lesser extent than any of your peers NOT really attempting to play ball. If you sign the contract to go to boot camp \u2026. DON\u2019T flake out. Put your nose to the grindstone, endure and try to excel at the training and graduate. The fastest way out of the depot is walking across the grinder on graduation day. From graduation day at boot camp is where the career of each Marine forks. While everyone graduates boot camp as a \u201cbasic rifleman\u201d, depending on the contract signed at the recruiting office will decide the next step. I would highly encourage thinking long and hard about what one\u2019s future might look like once their career (reserve or active duty) comes to an end. There are numerous technical professions and trades that someone in the service can get a huge step up towards if they are deliberate about the contract they sign. You can make A LOT of progress towards technical qualifications in the communications field or in many other jobs in the military across the board. What\u2019s really great about this is that it is essentially free training that doesn\u2019t even tap into your GI Bill benefits. With that being said, If you want to be a grunt and that is the reason you want to join and there is nothing else you could see yourself doing\u2026 then I\u2019d recommend talking to as many grunts as possible to gather a balanced review on the field. Don\u2019t make any decisions based on one Marine\u2019s \u201c5 star\u201d review, and don\u2019t rule out a decision based on one Marine\u2019s \u201c1 star\u201d review either. If you remain resolute on becoming a grunt after soul searching and talking to a lot of other folks then I\u2019d recommend you go ahead and do it. In conclusion, I think that joining the service in any branch is something really honorable. It is something both extremely challenging and rewarding that will set you apart from your peers in high school. Do your homework and seek the wise counsel of others because making a commitment to the military will typically at least take up 4\u20138 years of your life after high school. I\u2019d recommend doing everything in your power to make the most of it. ",

            "answer_text": "First, allow me to correct you on our name. It other United States Marine Corps. The \u201cp\u201d in corps is silent. If this teen you speak of is serious about joining, then I recommend that if he hasn\u2019t already begun to get into prime physical shape, that he get going on it well Before he leaves for basic training or \u201cboot camp\u201d as we refer to it. He will face the most grueling physical training than he has ever faced, and along with that the most extreme mental conditioning that will transform that teen from a immature adult to a man who is confident, attentive and able to accomplish, adapt and overcome the toughest obstacles he may face. These young men and women who voluntarily sign up for the military service branch known for its toughness will be asked to undergo extreme pressure to succeed not only for themselves but for their platoon-mates that make up their \u201cteam\u201d if you will, which builds trust in each other, and healthy morale for the sake of the unit and it\u2019s mission. These training techniques will last them a lifetime and they will carry it with them forever. It\u2019s a privilege to succeed in boot camp all the way to graduation and finally earn the right to wear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (EGA). Your teen must be willing to give his all during his training, and the reward is great if the goal is to be respected. For those who are hesitant about the sacrifices they must make in order to \u201cclaim the title,\u201d. Stay home, grow your hair, and hang our with your other ambitious-less friends who gripe if their latte is too cold. But if you are one of the Few who wants to gain the respect of others for attaining what many can\u2019t, then go to boot camp and train hard, fight well, and work for that gorgeous emblem we who have come before still worship years after we received it\u2026The EGA, which places us in the fraternity forever. \u201cOnce A Marine, Always a Marine.\u201d ",
