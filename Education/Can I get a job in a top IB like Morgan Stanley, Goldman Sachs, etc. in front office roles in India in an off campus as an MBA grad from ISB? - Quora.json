            "answer_text": "Yes, follow these steps. It is not sufficient to have an MBA alone from ISB. Having understood that, strengthen your portfolio. The best option to do is to do a CFA. They want you fire in more than one cylinder. Then they want your passion in finance. Not high grades alone. Indulge yourself in all the 'Finance' activities in the campus. Finance clubs and like. You should know in and out of such activities, leading from the front, leadership programs, networking activities outside the campus with all associated with Investment banks. Then reach out to all who matter in investment banks thru social media like LinkedIn. Know in and and about those target banks, positions, front office positions like Buy side/Sell side to quants and like. Finally know what is expected of you? 18 hours of work per day. Research, con calls etc. Can you handle high pressure? Can you leave office only between 10 pm to 2 am everyday after work? Are you prepared to get burnt out fast? There are very good chances of an interview if you condition yourself with all these. I am sure you can convert one which comes your way. ",
