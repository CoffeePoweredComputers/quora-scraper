            "answer_text": "You demand for quantitative citations entirely misses the point.   Look at the first sentence of the Wikipedia article on American exceptionalism:  American exceptionalism is the theory that the United States is qualitatively different from other nations. So your question doesn't make sense.  Remember, there is more to the world than just quantitative measurements.   The difference between a cat and a dog or a comedy and tragedy are most easily understood as a qualitative difference.   Similarly, one does not easily arrive at an understanding of national character by scanning over tables of industrial and agricultural output. ",
