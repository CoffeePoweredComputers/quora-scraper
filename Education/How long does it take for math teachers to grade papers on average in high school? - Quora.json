            "answer_text": "I worked as an assistant to my teacher in high school during my free period. In a heavily populated school, teachers typically have 25\u201330 students per class, which they tend to have 2\u20135 of. In this case, with it being something like Geometry (which requires proof checking, etc.), it could take the teacher anywhere from 5\u201315 minutes to grade one student\u2019s paper. However, math is easier to grade than a subject like English simply because the answers are more definite. The teacher I worked for designed the questions one at a time, ensuring a detailed answer key for each question. Because of this, we practically flew through grading. ",

            "answer_text": "Too long. If you follow the \u201cbest practices\u201d you will have a warm up, in class assignment, exit ticket and homework from each student everyday except test days at the least. Far better an idea is to take class time to go over answers for warm ups, assignments and homework, and use an electronic auto grading system for the exit ticket. This way students get feedback quicker, learn from and fix their mistakes, and you spend less time grading. ",
