            "answer_text": "It\u2019s about as hard as you want it to be. There are people who knock off a DVM and a PhD at the same time, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re at the very limit of your ability or anything. There is an effectively infinite amount to learn but the minimum you need to pass your courses and your boards is relatively easy if you had the marks to get in in the first place. It depends some on how competitive you are and what career track you\u2019re aiming for after graduation. And it depends how seriously you take it. Most people there want to learn what they\u2019re going to need to know in a few short years, and marks are just sort of a learning device, something to measure yourself and push yourself against. But there are always a couple of people who seem to not really find it all that interesting, like maybe it was all a mistake. And they still manage to pass. I found it unbelievably interesting, and sort of exhilirating, in a long, drawn-out kind of a way. Life, biology, animals \u2026 it\u2019s the most interesting thing in the world, and every day you get all this information about it, stuffed into your head. There\u2019s a lot of information, but \u2026 there\u2019s also quite a bit of drinking beer and playing pool. So how hard is something that you\u2019d do again instantly for the sheer joy of it, if it was like Groundhog Day? ",

            "answer_text": "That would depend on your definition of 'hard'. Simple answer would be yes. Its as hard as any othet doctorate to get. Years of school and training to earn your degree. If high school was hard, then definately yes vet school is harder. If two years at community college was hard, then probably four more years of schooling to become a vet would also be hard. However, if animals are your passion, then it may be only slightly more difficult. Your interest in the subject has a lot to do with what you condider 'hard'. ",
