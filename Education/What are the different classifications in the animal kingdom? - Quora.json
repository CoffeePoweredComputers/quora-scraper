            "answer_text": "Too complex to answer, as there is no agreement on the number of phyla. Some say 30, some say 36\u2026 below is further reading for you with extra links by noted scientists on this subject : Encyclopedia of Life Animal Phyla Last updated over 1 year ago The major subgroups of animals are usually classified as phyla (singular: phylum). The higher classification of animals is still in flux, and scientists' opinions on which groups should be given phylum status change as new information about the structure of the animal tree of life becomes available. So you may see that some of the groups listed here as phyla are classified differently elsewhere. For example, the spiny-headed worms, Acanthocephala used to be treated as a phylum, but research has shown that this group is probably nested within the phylum Rotifera, so it will probably disappear from modern lists of animal phyla. Follow the links below to find out more about each animal phylum. Species estimates are from: Chapman, A. D. 2009. Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World. 2nd edition.
