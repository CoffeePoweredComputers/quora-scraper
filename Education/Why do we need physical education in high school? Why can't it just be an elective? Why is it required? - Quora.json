            "answer_text": "Beats the heck out of me. Since it is usually a dumping ground for teachers needing a planning period, many students do not want to go and don\u2019t learn anything, even if something is taught, which it usually isn\u2019t. It is usually a throw out the ball situation and it becomes disciplinary, when kids beg off or won\u2019t dress. If it was an elective, you could certain pare down the huge numbers of students and actually teach something. If you offered individual classes in sports people will do after high school, it would be much more valuable. Most city recreation centers offer basketball, Zumba, volleyball, dance of various kinds, badminton and tennis. Why not offer these so kids who want to learn and who enjoy the activity and learn and have a fun class during the day. I went from PE, to special education because of the numbers and because many of the students got irritated if you tried to teach, bump, set, spike, because they are used doing what they want, because most teachers have given up. I went from teaching PE to teacing EBD, because I would rather have a small number of difficult kids than huge numbers of kids who aren\u2019t interested. I found my place in the world. I am essentially rather disobedient myself, though I do follow rules, but I know how to teach other disobedient kids how to follow rules. ",
