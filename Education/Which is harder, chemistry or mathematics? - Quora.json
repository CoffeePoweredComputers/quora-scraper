            "answer_text": "I'm a mathematician, and my fianc\u00e9 is a geochemist. I find what he does incredibly stressful to hear about\u2013he's often working with samples that represent hundreds of thousands of dollars of field work done by multiple generations of grad students. Analysis can take weeks of carefully choreographed lab work that requires him sleeping at his lab for multiple days, and even small errors sometimes mean that the process must be started over. Additionally, some of his work requires the use of pressurized hot hydroflouric acid, which is incredibly toxic and potentially fatal if mishandled. The data that he generates are also not straightforward to analyze\u2013results could plausibly represent the outcomes of multiple possible processes. I think that it would be impossible for me to do what he does. If I make a mistake it means I have to rethink a proof or derivation, or re-run some code\u2013there is no way I could make a fatal mistake doing what I do. All that being said, he absolutely finds what I do to be completely beyond him. I remember helping him for a differential equations course he took\u2013he would get very frusterated with a lot of the course material. I remember him getting upset at the very idea of Laplace transforms, for example. He uses a fair amount of algebra in his day-to-day work, but starts to get uncomfortable pretty quickly once there aren't numbers involved any more. I don't think that the differences between us are really of intelligence, but rather of disposition. I think it would be equally hard for either of us to walk in the other's shoes. ",

And many people find chemistry too difficult because it is also a cot subject and has to memorize a lot of formulas\u2026 That's why every human has different choices.. Some people find math difficult and some people find chemistry.. Thank you.. ",
