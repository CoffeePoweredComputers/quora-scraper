            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, As I'm a first year MBBS student at AIIMS RAIPUR , so I can answer your question well . At 7 o'clock at morning I wake up with full enthusiasm , brushed my teeth and took a bath , at about 9 o'clock I had my breakfast , at 9:30 we all got into the bus ( as 1st year students are provided accommodation in residential area of AIIMS about 3 Km from AIIMS campus) and headed towards AIIMS. AT about 9:45 we reached the campus and I saw it was written ALL INDIA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES on the top of Medical college building it was like dream coming true to be an ' aiimsonian ' . Then we headed towards lecture theatre 1 where department of anatomy welcomed us and gave their introduction. After that we all were asked to give our introduction and tell something about our hobbies as number of students was more it was getting boring as time passed away. I saw many students were from South India and they faced difficulty in speaking and understanding Hindi. After the introductory session we were taken to various anatomy labs and dissection hall to get acquainted with the department after that we all were told about the dress code and discipline. Then we were told that for one week we will be having introductory sessions with different departments and then we were released to go back to hostel.I\u2019m attaching some photographs of my first day at AIIMS .

After the introductory session we went to the dissection lab which is very huge but the best part was the museum, looking at various specimens inspired me in a way. At lunch time we went to hostel, in the evening, it started raining and increased the beauty even more, there are so many different insects, frogs, birds in the campus and their sounds were rejoicing. Here are some pictures of the beautiful hostel campus as most of you must have seen the pictures of college already.     ",
