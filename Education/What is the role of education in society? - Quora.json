            "answer_text": "Education is the single most important thing there is in the world. The question of course is \u201cwhat is education\u201d. People used to learn from example and from hands on experience. The best professional education came from apprenticeship. People would shadow a master at work and by serving him and following his actions would acquire a sensitivity for the craft. People would develop a sense for metal, wood, leather, and other crafts. This is still true to this day. During the renaissance, the rich would send their kids to the newly formed universities where they were schooled in the seven arts that would prepare them to join aristocrat society. Many of the great scientists of the time didn\u2019t attend those places and have learned from observing nature and from experimenting. For the most part, all the knowledge that existed in the world could be crammed into a small room and only a few people really needed it anyways. Later on, with the onset of the industrial revolution, factory owners needed to quickly train large numbers of employees so modern schools were set up\u2014much like factories\u2014to quickly and efficiently give people basic skills like reading, writing, and math so they could be useful at work. You can learn about it through sir Ken Robinson\u2019s famed RSA video. In truth, not much has changed since. Education is still confused with schooling. The latter being the transfer of information, which for the most part can be achieved today with a smart phone. The true value of education, and the one thing it fails to do, is to teach a person how to be a human. Education should explain our nature, our place in the system of nature, and how to connect to all the other components, most importantly, other humans. It\u2019s funny how we teach toddlers to be nice to each other, to play together, to share but completely neglect these values when they grow up. We are products of our environment and yet we fail to teach people how to shape such environments that will bring out the best in us. We still teach people that what makes us unique is how we exploit others and rise above them when we see in nature that a cell becomes unique specifically through the type of connection it forms with other cells. Even more practically, it was shown that a class that is graded based on the collective average, where students help each other, has a higher average than a class that is graded individually. We teach and value such behavior that in a living body we would call cancerous. People are failing at marriage and relationships, at home economics and finances, and yet we don\u2019t teach them about the causes for these failures and how to avoid them. We don\u2019t give people experience from which they can learn about absolute laws, we give them transient morals. We don\u2019t structure our classes similar to the natural environment of which we are still a part. We don\u2019t use mentoring. We don\u2019t reflect on our reactions. We teach our children to be egoists instead of how to work with those ego-centric desires in them and shape them so they are used positively. And the greatest illusion is we teach our children that they can change what they don\u2019t like about the world when the only thing that needs changing is man himself. If we could truly educate but one generation, our world would be set. **If you like my answer please follow me on Quora** ",
