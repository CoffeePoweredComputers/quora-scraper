            "answer_text": "Well, an online degree provides an education, so I suppose it doesn\u2019t really matter what an employer thinks. Most \u201conline\u201d degrees don\u2019t outright state that they are online. For example, if I get a bachelor\u2019s from ASU, my degree will say: \u201cBachelor of Arts - Arizona State University\u201d - it will have no indication that it was taken online. The reason for that is simple, if it showed any indication that the degree was online, that would mean that the university doesn\u2019t view the degree as equal to their normal degrees. Essentially, if you want to get an online degree, get one; if you choose to follow this route, make sure the university you get it from treats it as an equivalent degree to their on-campus program.

            "answer_text": "Depends, in the UK the government set up the Open University. It\u2019s degrees are accredited to professions such as the Unstitute of Physics and the Institute of Engineering and Technology. Professional bodies such as these work with the OU to shape degrees so they meet the needs of professions. Courses, standards and exams are all moderated by other universities, who in turn are also moderated. Employers will pay OU fees because they get degree educated staff with no loss of work time. Students learn to juggle work, study and family. So again better than a normal university. I studied at the OU plus London, Westminster and Portsmouth universities. The OU is incredible! I even got a lecturer who taught at Oxford University. ",
