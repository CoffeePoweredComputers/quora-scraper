            "answer_text": "If you go to a target school, make sure to go to all the networking events on campus. The recruiting teams spend a significant amount of time looking at who attended these events, and it\u2019s an important mechanism in the filtering process. Make sure to speak with the recruiting team and take every opportunity to get to know them better. If you DON\u2019T go to a target school, hustle hustle hustle. Show up at another school\u2019s event\u2014people love that level of effort and underdog mentality. In either case, by no means will simply applying on the website ever be sufficient.Focus on your story. Interviews are typically made or broken in the first 120 seconds. Work on your story. Figure out the main points. Cut out useless information that doesn\u2019t sell you. Video tape yourself saying your story. Spend hours on this and don\u2019t underestimate how quickly interviewers will make a decision on your candidacy. Your story should include WHY you want to do banking. The interviewer is trying to assess if you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into and you\u2019ve thought through this career decision.Know technicals 100%. There\u2019s only a few technical/quantitative tests a banker can throw at you. (1) DCF, (2) accounting, (3) understanding of comparables. These concepts are simple at a high level, but take some time to understand deeply. When articulating how to do a DCF, the interviewer isn\u2019t looking for a high level answer, they are looking for a line by line understanding of the formula and how each line can impact the ultimate value. Comparables are similarly nuanced. You may understand mechanically how they work, but there is significant nuance in applying them. Why use EV / Revenue vs. EV / Free Cash Flow? How do multiples vary by industry? Fluency is different than knowledge. Try to be fluent.Extracurricular interest in finance (e.g., examining a portfolio) is helpful if you REALLY know what you\u2019re talking about. Otherwise don\u2019t fake it. IB firms are looking for hungry athletes who are intelligent that they can train. Prepare intelligently by focusing on the 3 items above and don\u2019t worry so much about demonstrating that you live and breathe finance. Non-intuitively, it can be a drawback because the interviewer might expect that you\u2019d be disappointed when the job isn\u2019t as glamorous as you expected.",
