            "answer_text": "Most of the time, zero weight. But an interview can sometimes make (or break) an application. If an applicant has terrible manners (such as picking their nose during the interview) or lies, this can kill an application. But an applicant can provide perspective or background for an incident or their life that can make an application come alive. For example - I remember one applicant who had to take a semester off from school to care for her dying mother. She could have written about this in one of her essays, but she chose to write about something else. She told me about it in her interview, which I passed along to the admissions office. Her grades were ordinary since she was spending so much time (even before taking off the semester) helping take care of younger siblings, cooking and shopping, etc. that she would ordinarily not have have gotten in. Without the interview, the admissions office wouldn\u2019t have known about her situation, nor about the maturity that she developed in the process. ",

            "answer_text": "Not all colleges require an interview. I did have one with a counselor but that was in 1960. Nowadays my university tries to offer them to 100% of applicants (they get to 97%) but they are done my local alumni committees. In the committee on which I have served since 2002 applicants who turn down an interview reduce their chances of admission (in fact only one who has turned one down has been admitted). An interview is a great opportunity to show off some attributes which were not in the application,, essay or recommendation letters. It is also a great way to learn about the school from an alumnus.
