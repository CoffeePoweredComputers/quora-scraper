            "answer_text": "If you fail English in the 10th grade will you pass to the 11th grade? At my high school if you fail a required course; English, Science, History/Social Studies or Math, you may have the opportunity to earn the failed credit in summer school. If you do not pick up your failed 10th grade English credit in summer school you will need to take two English classes your next year, both 10th grade English and 11th grade English. English is the only course at my high school that requires 4 years of credit, in order to graduate. However at my high school, you don\u2019t fail a grade. Students are assigned a homeroom with a group of students who are all set to graduate in 4 years time from their 9th grade year. These students will remain in this homeroom for the next 4 years and progress through being freshmen (9th grade), sophomores (10th grade), juniors (11th grade) and seniors (12th grade). However not all will graduate in 4 year\u2019s time. Some will need to come back for an extra semester (1/2 year) or even an extra full year. These students are often called \u201csuper seniors\u201d . Many of the students who fall behind in credits will change from the traditional high school to the alternate high school. The alternate high school is far more focused on the individual student than the traditional high school. Students work with an individualized programs on the computer and progress at their own rate. At the alternate high school, some students will get back enough credits to catch up and will sometimes switch back to the traditional high school. Other alternative high school students may choose to complete high school at the alternative high school. Unfortunately, however some students don\u2019t succeed in either the traditional setting or the alternative setting and end up dropping out of high school altogether. I think this is typical of most US high schools, but as always: Check with your own high school guidance counselors!!",

            "answer_text": "In my high school, we have English 10\u20131 and 10\u20132. 10\u20131 is a higher level English and leads to university or some high-level trade courses. English 10\u20132 leads to a general diploma and is a condition for some courses at the trade school level. If you fail English 10\u20131 but have a grade between 40 and 49 % you can repeat the course or enrol in English 20\u20132, which is a grade 11 English, and continue on with the lower level courses. I have taught both levels and each student must still study a novel, short stories and write essays, however they are graded on a lower difficulty of resources. For example in Grade 10 English, my 10\u20131 students read To Kill A Mockingbird, and in English 10\u20132 we read Deathwatch. Also in English 10\u20131, we studied a Shakespeare play which we did not do in English 10\u20132. Not everyone likes higher level English. A more practical English may be just what you need to graduate and move on. However, if you need the higher level English courses you should repeat the course. Check with your school counsellor to see which English you need for your future plans. ",
