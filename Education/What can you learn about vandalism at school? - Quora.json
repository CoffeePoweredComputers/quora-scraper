Once I wrote \u201chi\u201d on a desk, and the next day, people in the classes before me had already wrote on it. Someone wrote on it in pen. so I responded in sharpie and soon after a week or 2 the desk was a graffitied desk. there was a fully colored anime girl and everything. since this was next to the wall, I also vandalized the wall a bit, and people followed me. So most people aren\u2019t as good as you think! ",
