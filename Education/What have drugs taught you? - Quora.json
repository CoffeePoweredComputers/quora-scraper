            "answer_text": "So much. I\u2019ve learned something from all of my drug experiences, and since I\u2019m a lightweight when it comes to illegal drugs, I\u2019m including everything. Caffeine, prozac, cannabis, everything. Abuse of drugs: I\u2019ve abused several drugs, taking them to the point of an uncomfortable overdosage at least once. Overdosing on caffeine and cannabis are remarkably similar with both feeling like you possess a nauseating amount of energy and are out of control of it. Overdosing on aspirin gives me ringing in my years, sufficient to make me lie down just to listen to it. A hospital level dose of opiates leaves me delusional to an often unpleasant degree. The hallucinations are prone to turning to sinister if I\u2019m alone in a hospital. The only drug that made me physically sick to overdose on was alcohol. And it tastes bad. Warnings: Anti-depressants really do take weeks to build up to a level where they affect you and weeks to wear off. They prevent my spontaneous uncontrollable bursts of emotion from occurring, but do not affect my normal depressed emotional state. Cool things: Cannabis makes me happy. It increases my self-esteem and gives me bursts of positive emotions. It slows down my over active thought process to the point where I can see it happening and interact with it instead of being told what to do by it. It does not, however, control the negative bursts of emotions, just gives me a little more time to react to them. Take Home: Life is rarely lived in an unaltered state of mind. Whether your drug of choice is caffeine, ibuprofen, oxygen or chocolate, the substances you put into it affect how you think and how you behave. Try to moderate your intake of substances so that you don\u2019t take too much of anything and know your limits. Your body, your choice. ",
