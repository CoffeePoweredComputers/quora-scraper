            "answer_text": "Hey. Over my 30+ years as an ESL teacher, I will admit to having some difficulties with certain types of teachers (and I am among that group, but don\u2019t dislike myself!). Here are a couple of \u201ctypes\u201d that at times got my goat: \u201cI speak English natively so I can teach it\u201d I came upon these teachers mainly once I moved to Spain. These were \u201cteachers\u201d who were actually overstaying tourist visas and paying their way by giving the natives so-called \u201cconversation classes\u201d. These \u201cteachers\u201d basically placed an ad in a free ad paper or left a small poster at the local copy shop and then gave classes to their students by sitting with them, either in their homes (the student\u2019s) or sometimes in public places like bars (the student always paying for the teacher\u2019s coffee or beer!). Problem with this type of class was that the \u201cteacher\u201d, who usually lacked even the most basic concepts of pedagogy or ESL itself, so the \u201cclasses\u201d were limited to the \u201cteacher\u201d talking 90% and overcorrecting the student\u2019s broken English the other 10%. These teachers also tended to charge a great deal more than the average ESL teacher, which was damaging to those of us who made a living through private classes. They also soured many students to private classes, through the frustration of feeling that native private teachers where simply chatter boxes with no actual teaching experience. English Only teachers Related to the \u201cI speak English\u201d teachers, these can also be very well educated ESL teachers with both formal training as well as years of experience. And most who fall into this category are mono-lingual. While there are some cases in which using \u201cEnglish Only\u201d in the classroom is beneficial, the true English Only teacher is often very pig-headed about the so-called method and students spend hours listening to someone blab away in a language they do not understand, knowing that important information is being shared, but unable to assimilate that information. I can\u2019t think of any other broad types of ESL teachers that rubbed me the wrong way. There were individuals with horrible attitudes or personalities that just didn\u2019t go along with education, but highlighting those would be nit-picking. I might add the \u201cthere\u2019s only one way to speak English, and that\u2019s the right way\u201d, which I have actually seen some teachers say in forums, doesn\u2019t matter where they are from, their English is the only correct English (and yes, this happens both with American and British teachers, though I\u2019ve noted it more among Brits, that\u2019s not statistically reliable).

The teachers who are the worst (as people) are ones who: disparage the host country/ their students for things beyond their control, who assume everyone else hates teaching too, who put no effort into their lessons, and don\u2019t care about their students.
