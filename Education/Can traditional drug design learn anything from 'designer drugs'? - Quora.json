            "answer_text": "I think the distinction you drew is a false one to begin with; there isn't such a neat divide between what you call designer drugs which is a term I personally find repulsive because it makes you sound like a reporter who hasn't a clue what they're talking about and other drug development.  In fact many popular research chemicals (such as the nBOME series) are used in legitimate research and development, in particular these ones were used to map out serotonin receptor groups since they are full agonists which is pretty rare for a recreational psychedelic drug, though of course some folks find them fun to take casually.   The forces behind the research chemical industry, referring specifically to what you called designer drugs as in new novel compounds that are not \"officially\" for drug usage purposes, but actually totally are in reality, is purely profit driven and not as much about the logic and design of potentially interesting compounds, but rather churning out slight variations on a reactionary basis following any legal action against existing ones.  If it sells, that's all they care about.   Shockingly similar to the motivations of more legitimate drug development particularly ones under patent, and indeed with many of them we later find out that commercial interest obscured the assessment of their actual effectiveness at their claimed purpose after the fact, much as most RC-type drugs are not as recreational or safe in comparison to older alternatives. Though there are some clandestine chemists that are aiming to purposefully design certain molecules, as was the case with MXE (methoxetamine) a dissociative that was intended to help with phantom limb syndromes  ",
