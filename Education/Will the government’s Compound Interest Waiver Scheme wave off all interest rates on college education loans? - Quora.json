            "answer_text": "Under RBI moratorium permitted for six months , the interest waiver is not allowed and the interest on outstanding for the moratorium period on simple interest basis is to be borne by the borrower and the interest on interest effect only has been waived to the customer . The committee appointed by the government to study the impact of waiving interest and the compounding interest has since submitted the report . It is expected to cost , if waiver of the interest for the moratorium period , about Rs . 6 trillion . That's Rs . 600 ,000 crores . If , That much amount is waived , then Banks can't survive and the government also can't compensate . In view of the above facts the government has filed an affidavit in the supreme court stating that the only compounding effect of the interest alone will be compensated for the period of six months ( March to August ) that too on the loans of upto Rs. 2 crore . It is reported to cover MSME loans and personal loans to professionals , home loans , educational loan , consumption loans , consumer durables loans , auto loans , credit card dues . The government stated that the permission for that effect may be sought from the Parliament as this burden will have an impact on several committments , including the cost of fighting pandemic disease . *For example loan amount is Rs . One lakh . Rate of interest 12 % . Under compounding . Interest 1000 . next month interest 1010 . 1020 , 1030 , 1041 , 1051 . Hence the total payable Rs . 6 , 152 . Under simple interest it comes to Rs . 6 , 000 only which is to be borne by the borrower . And the compounding interest effect , The interest on interest , of Rs . 152 will be compensated by the government . * The court may state that the impact should be borne by the bank only . If that is the case , naturally the bank which has been paying interest on quarterly compounding effect , may revert to the simple interest method for deposit also ",
