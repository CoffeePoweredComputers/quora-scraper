            "answer_text": "Conversational skills don\u2019t improve just like that. It takes time, practice and the ability to learn at a rapid rate from your own experiences. On top of this, they have virtually no limit to how far they can be developed. 1. Talk slowly Typically, good talkers don\u2019t rush into a conversation. They take their time when they reflect on something and when they say it out loud. They act as if they have all the time in the world. This makes them come off as centered and collected. Model this way of talking and you will create the same effect. 2. Hold more eye contact Most people keep eye contact about 2/3 of the time or less when they talk. In my experience, it\u2019s a very good idea to hold eye contact just a bit more than that. This will convey confidence and interest in interacting with them. 3. Notice the details People with good conversation skills tend to notice the kind of things that the average person doesn\u2019t notice, and to bring such details into the conversation. They may notice and point out an interesting ring on the other person\u2019s hand, a certain foreign accent, or a certain voice tone they use when saying a name. Thus, such individuals impress people in a very elegant manner. 4. Give unique compliments Anybody can pay a generic compliment to try and get another person\u2019s appreciation. Charismatic people on the other hand are able to really pay attention to others, to look beyond the facade and thus, pay unique compliments. Do the same and besides wooing others, you may even help them find out things about themselves they didn\u2019t know. 5. Express your emotions It\u2019s very rare to meet a person who is comfortable talking about their emotions and how certain things make them feel, especially with strangers. Yet this way of talking is a real virtue. Don\u2019t just present the facts, you\u2019re not a newspaper. Express your feelings about those facts. Keep in mind that it is at the emotional level that people connect best. 6. Offer interesting insights Anybody can talk about the news or express basic opinions. But good talkers can frequently tell you things you didn\u2019t know and that you\u2019ll find fascinating. This is why it\u2019s good to have knowledge into fields such as psychology or sociology, and bring such knowledge out at the right moments in a conversation. 7. Use the best words The ability to talk smoothly has a lot to do with choosing the precise words to convey your precise feelings or thoughts. Constantly develop your vocabulary and practice communicating as accurately as possible. It will help you develop a way with words and allow you to express yourself more easily. ",

            "answer_text": "Chatting and conversational skills are much easier to master than say public speaking. I put few brief tips, for you to see results within a fortnight. Listen well, with good eye contact.Love people, even if they have some perspective which does not appeal to you, never doubt their intention. Ask simple questions to understand their reasons for that perspective. Put up your perspective, if you believe it holds water.Do discuss, but argue never. Discussion is to find a meeting point, arguing to prove one\u2019s point only.Speak minimum about yourself, try to learn about people, with whom you are chatting.Do not cross the privacy limits.Keep contacts alive if you find the person interesting, and respond to others if they contact you how so ever brief, you want to keep it.Keep a good track about what is trending in society.If you are good at an art, singing, music, magic etc. you will be sought after more and more. Any one thing which you like, may not be difficult to master. One of my friends is good at recitation of good poetry and stories.It is enjoyable to chat and it is stress burner. ",
