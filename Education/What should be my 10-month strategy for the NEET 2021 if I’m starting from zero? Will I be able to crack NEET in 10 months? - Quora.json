            "answer_text": "Hey, Yes you\u2019ll be able to crack Neet if you\u2019ll be able to do what it takes to crack Neet and believe me you have what it takes, Just utilize everyday up to it\u2019s fullest. Now let\u2019s make a strategy for you - First step is to Join a coaching if you can, it helps a lot and yes average run time is around 10 months but if you wanna go for self study then you need to buy Modules of a good coaching, don\u2019t go for different books, Modules are best. You can try to get Allen\u2019s or Aakash Modules they\u2019re the best.Now once you have the resources, Make your mind from starting that you need to go through syllabus at least 3 times of course time for subsequent revisions will be less.Now For Biology NCERT will do for 90% of the questions and read modules with it, as you have plenty of time now for rest of the questions.For Physics and Chem - Modules and Notes if you have some(Not talking about school notes).Also NCERT for inorganic chemistry is highly recommended.Now you\u2019ll probably ask for schedule but man no one can make it for you why? simple because no one knows you better than you, no one knows how your day looks like, so make it yourself. I can only advice you to make a detailed plan to incorporate 3 revisions till Neet and give 50% of the time to first reading and then two revisions and keep a month extra before Neet for any test series. Now I\u2019ve mentioned reading at many placing that doesn\u2019t mean read for just the sake of reading, Make sure you absorb everything that\u2019s in NCERT and module, no matter how many reading it takes. You gotta Study Eat and Repeat throughout these 10 months and don\u2019t ask anyone if modules are enough or not, they\u2019re totally enough if done in right way. I wish you get what you dreamed for, don\u2019t forget to work hard and make sacrifices, but for now That\u2019s been it, Bye ",

After completing ur whole syllabus do 100 mcq practice on daily bases of each subject. U have to find ur weakness and ur strength and work on it..give daily mock test and analyse ur mistakes in it.,make a separate notebook and write all imp questions and revise that on daily basis.,do previous year papers and revise that also. Maintain the timetable by full discipline and sincerity\u2026 Don't worry if u R an enthusiastic learner and ready to hardwork for ur dreams and u surely able to fulfill ur dreams..
