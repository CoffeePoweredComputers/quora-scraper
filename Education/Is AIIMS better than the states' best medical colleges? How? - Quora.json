            "answer_text": "AIIMS New Delhi is the best no doubt. Let's look how other AIIMS perform with respect to some top state colleges. Here the answer will be data based. Let's take UCMS, for people love the Delhi college fascination including me. The comparator will be AIIMS Bhubaneswar  Hospital Services UCMS have 21 departments; no superspeciality departments; AIIMS B has 42. So Hospital Services AIIMS will be more diverse, not to forget state of art too. According to NIRF Data 2020, 2018 OPD footfall of GTB(Hospital of UCMS) was 7000/day and will remain almost similar over the years until expanded. AIIMS are new institution accelerating and currently have 4500\u20135000/day load. Will soon cross GTB. Beds: UCMS=1500; AIIMS B=1000 Academics:(NIRF 2020) UCMS: 2018- 92 faculties for 150 Batch students AIIMS B: 2018- 200 (leaving the nursing) for 100 Batch student Faculty Selection: Harder for AIIMS requiring more experience and better educational background. Student Quality: AIIMS>UCMS(No State Reservation) Campus Life : Better or equal sports facilities. Biggest Fest. More International & National Conference owing to more departments & National Status. Research : UCMS  AIIMS B  Sponsored Research was higher even in 2018. Leave aside the intramural funding. As of today AIIMS B has 16 crores of research funding. The comparison shows clearly an edge for AIIMS B & will be similar for other AIIMS too. However: India Today 2020 Rankings : UCMS 10th ; AIIMS B : out of scene. What I feel these ranking agencies never research updated facts; they just interchange 2\u20133 positions among the colleges & release them. I would request aspirants to do proper research on facts and then choose their college rather than going for subjective perspectives of others. Now if people say Delhi is \u2764\ufe0f, then India is too \u2764\ufe0f, explore it in college life. ",
