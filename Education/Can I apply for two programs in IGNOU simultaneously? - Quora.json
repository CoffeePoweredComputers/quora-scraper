            "answer_text": "You can apply for two degrees from IGNOU, to be pursued simultaneously. That won't be invalid. The only combination of dual-degree that is invalid is pursuing two regular courses together. However, please consider the nature of both the degrees before enrolling. Just because it is lawful, doesn't mean it is advisable. In a recently answered question on whether MBA and MCom can be pursued simultaneously via distance course, I have mentioned how combining some degrees with another might lead the employer to doubt your learning. Please check it's context here to understand it better, Can I get an MCom (distance) degree from DU and an MBA (distance) degree from IGNOU at the same time? ",

As a counselor I will say according to UGC guidelines there are no such type of space to do two degree simultaneously .I.e.illegal. So you can only do certificate or diploma (part time not regular) course with one regular degree(Msc or Bsc). UGC says how it is possible that one person can be at two place at same time .So two degree simultaneously not valid. I hope you will satisfy with my answer .If there is any query related to career or life or your goal. Please contact at given above detail on visiting card. Best of luck!! ",

Even if you do by registering one degree in ignou and one in another distant or regular university , it wont be valid as UGC doesnt endorse that. You cant show both certificate at instance. I am attaching UGC\u2019s circular on this. So its always better to complete bcom and then go bor MBA. Bcom along with bba is a hardship as well. Once you complete bcom , you can directly register for MBA with ignou.  ",
