            "answer_text": "math hl is really difficult, as most people will tell you. but as long as you really love the subject or are good at it (or both), then you should be fine. that aside, here are some actual tips to how to study for math hl (or any in math for that matter :)) 1. know what you\u2019re getting yourself intothis doesn't mean that you shouldn't take math. you truly cannot avoid it.don\u2019t dread it, but also don\u2019t expect the easiest ride of your life (of course, depending on your skill level \u2014 you might have gone above or below where you think you lie; and any class of math that you take it enough and worth something)anyway \u2014> read the syllabusthe syllabus will end up being your best friend because it is basically a checklist of what you need to knowi know that for math hl, you may need to know quite a few things or problem-solving methods that aren\u2019t covered by the syllabus (this is where the hardest part of hl math comes into play)but still, the syllabus will pick you off the ground, dust you off, and keep you going when you wanna drop out of math \u2014 trust me, we have all been there (and will most likely be there again pretty soon)by researching the topics exactly and knowing them deep enough so you could explain them to a peer will guarantee at least a 6 in most math classes2. practice and practice. and practice. and practice just a little bit more.the dreaded old adage of ib math; past paperswhile they are amazing!! to use when you truly get a topic, practising them when you just do not understand anything is quite difficultthis is when i get into what i call \u201cmath mode\u201d:1. you make a list of topics that you know and/or think you absolutely suck at (or legit just your worst topics). be incredibly specific. don\u2019t just write algebra. write adding and subtracting complex numbers (if that is what you are going for)2. find your dusty, old textbook. textbooks may be great for some, but the truth is, no one really uses them in the ib and in our generation, cause, y\u2019know, the internet. but actually pick up the giant brick of a book and find the topic you are stuck with.3. read over the part you are stuck with. your textbook is great for this because it keeps everything concise and gives you worked examples in sometimes less than one page. truly understand this part. don\u2019t just memorize it. if you\u2019re still a little bit confused \u2014which everyone is sometimes\u2014 do the next step too.4. use the internet!! the amount of ib resources out there is insane. there are so many ways that you can have one simple concept explained. don\u2019t worry about finding the perfect source. instead, just google what you need (specifically) and click on the first resource. if it doesn\u2019t sit right with you, click on the next one. and the next one. and keep going and searching until you feel like you know it well enough to practice questions because guess what the next part is\u20265. practice questions. yeah, i know, this is the tedious part sometimes. but, bear with it, cause this is the core of mathematics in the ib. use the official question bank if you want to (and have the money). but, there are great sources elsewhere, it doesn\u2019t have to always tailor to the ib diploma program. instead, just google your topic and put \u2018questions\u2019 or \u2018exercises\u2019 at the end of it6. keep practising until you feel confident. this one is pretty self-explanatory. just do some questions. when you feel like you know it, do three more questions. if you feel like you might never do math again in your life, then do one last one and call it a day. congrats, you just learned something that you didn\u2019t know before!! that\u2019s pretty neat7. this might be the most important part of this (long) process. long-term retention. wait a week. or two. maybe even a month if you\u2019re still pretty early in the ib. then do some questions again on the exact same topic. try to find new questions just in case you have a really good memory lol. if you get them okay-right \u2014at least to the score you\u2019re aiming for\u2014 then you\u2019re all set!!3. past papersnow that you know most topics (at least the important ones), you practice the big boy papers. as in, the real past papers of the ibfind some pdfs online or ask your teacherthen\u2026 do the questionsif you get enough right \u2014set a goal for yourself before you start e.g. 80% correct or at least half\u2014 then you\u2019re ready for your future career in math. jk\u2026 unless\u2026no, but honestly, if you solve at least four or five years worth of past papers in the three months before your exams (and you get them correct of course haha) then there is nothing else to doyou will with at least 87.3% certainty get the math grade you want (yes, that is real math)4. final step (we\u2019re almost there) \u2014> have fun!!math is actually an amazing class when you think about ityou get to literally explore the man-made, abstract nature of the universe. i think that\u2019s pretty neatof course, this depends on what level of math you\u2019re on since you won\u2019t be taking math aa hl if you despise the subject ahahbut if you\u2019re going to be doing it for two years, then have fun with it!!see the subject, not for what it is (a bunch of boring equations and difficult questions), and instead for what it could be: an amazing way to discover new things and feel great about yourself when you finally get a question rightand with that, i hope you go on to get the grade you want and deserve in math, whether this is a 4, or a 7, or anything above a pass haha thank you so much for reading this very long post about how to own ib mathematics with love, ib spectrum <3 ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m uniquely qualified to answer this question, because I\u2019m bad at maths. To clarify: we often answer questions about subjects that we feel like experts on, but those are often the subjects we have a natural flair for, and so our answers are only useful to those who have the same flair. Because I suck at maths and I got a 7, however, I can tell you how someone without that flair can do it. You\u2019ll be sick of hearing it by the end of two years. Often you\u2019ll feel deeply frustrated because it feels like you\u2019ve tried your butt off without getting anywhere. You\u2019ve just got to keep adjusting your tactics and marching onward. I often joke about how IB is war. IB HL maths is like a siege: it\u2019s a slow fight of attrition, and whoever gives up loses. Getting a 7 in HL maths is about practice. A few tips about that practice (yes, they\u2019ll sound like the same old from if you only skim the bolded parts, but I promise this is good stuff): Get the Questionbank, if you can. It\u2019s very useful for topic-focused practice.Every time you do practice questions, flag down the ones you get wrong (and also the ones where you feel like you just blundered into the correct answer). Then, the next time you do practice questions, repeat the ones you got wrong last time as well as doing new ones.If you get the right answer the second time, it helps to take a few seconds afterwards to reflect on what you learned, so that it\u2019ll stick.If you get the wrong answer again, meanwhile, flag that question again and repeat it again next time. Repeat that question until either you\u2019ve memorized the solution perfectly (and so can no longer gain anything from repeating it) or until you feel that you\u2019ll never err on a question of that type again.This is much more efficient than endlessly doing new questions.Identify your weaknesses and address them. Don\u2019t just let them sit and hope for the best. For example, by the time the end of two years came round, I still felt hopelessly weak and shuddery about doing integration, so I compiled a bunch of questions on integration from the Questionbank and I worked through them, using the method outlined above, until I felt completely comfortable doing integration. (When you notice that you\u2019re barely ever flagging any incorrect questions for review anymore, then you can stop.)If you can, you should do that for every single topic. Obviously, that takes a lot of time, so you should take advantage of the topic tests offered internally and do this as prep for those topic tests rather than trying to do every topic in the weeks before finals.But I can swear to the effectiveness of the method. It will even cure carelessness. If you really do that for every single topic, I guarantee that you could walk into the finals sick or sleep-deprived and still come out with 90%+. I didn\u2019t have time for that, but that was the effect for the topics that I did do it for.Do not cram. Never cram for maths. Cram for English or biology, if you like, but never maths. (NB: I never actually took biology, I just like to bully the subject. If you need context, I\u2019m a prospective physics major.)An infinitely more graceful and efficient method is to make practicing maths a habit. Half an hour every morning, for a few weeks per topic\u2014that\u2019s all you need. I even started to enjoy the routine of crunching through a few maths problems every morning, because it made me feel like I\u2019d done something and so improved my productivity for the whole day.Finally: sleep well before tests, and especially before finals. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me, but my logical faculties (the ones that I need for physics, maths and ToK) cut a sharp freefall if I don\u2019t sleep. I become a lot more careless too. Plan well and exercise some self-discipline so you\u2019ll be well rested for the test.",

Follow the instructions of your teacher and know what the examiner wants to see. The thing that drove me to do well was this irrational passion. I did well for maths prior to the IB course, but I hung around grade 4/5 throughout my years in the IB. In fact, the only time I got a 7 was in the final exams. So I did not do well for most of my time in the IB, and yet this did not stop me from liking the subject. Perhaps it was the satisfaction of cracking the problem on my own, after going through a few sides of paper. It could be the fact that maths was important to me. Or maybe it is the fact that maths is just a beautiful subject, and I appreciate it. You might do well if you find your passion in maths. Then again, not everyone finds their passion in maths, and not everyone without passion does poorly. ",

An important part of this subject is to 'keep your perception of it as easy and interesting' rather than 'extremely hard and boring'. Most students obviously fail because they don't work hard, but most students of this subject develop a perception of it as something very hard and complex, and hence it demotivated them before they can even begin doing it. Always remember that it is playing with numbers, concepts and logic, and if you respect it by practicing it enough, this can be one of your strengths. No matter what, don't let your own perception and attitude towards it become negative, because when it is as such, you just lose before the game even begins!  ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, speaking, you should be doing two things: Pay attention and read the content that is covered by the syllabusWork hard and practice a lot.I know this sounds extremely condescending, but there\u2019s really nothing much else to it, given the normal circumstances of having a perfectly capable teacher for IB Mathematics HL. IB Mathematics HL is hard because of the extent and depth of maths involved. So, the solution, is to simply keep practicing and to keep track of the homework and practice problems you have. In topics that you\u2019re unsure of, fill the gaps by asking others for help (e.g. teachers or even your classmates). In this light, the only real difficulty is getting on top of the workload and concepts. And, remember, if you slip and lose track of the topics, it\u2019s a long way back to getting on top of things. Therefore, consistency and hard work is key. ",

It is an excellent textbook, and will certainly provide you with extensive knowledge and examples for you to get prepared for the course. Pair this with completion of multiple Math HL past papers, and you will be set! Not kidding. I did this and improved my grade significantly. Past papers can usually be found on reddit threads on the IBO subreddit. Beware, the IBO often shuts down these sites upon discovery, so download the papers quick. ",

First I have some questions for you: Have you already started with your IB, or are you starting it after the summer? Engineering is a vast field. Which field of engineering do you wish to pursue? Are you taking Maths HL only because most colleges ask for it later on when you apply for engineering programs? Do you have genuine interest in Mathematics? Since I am currently studying an engineering program, I can tell you this: Maths HL is the best preparation for the mathematics that you will encounter during your university later on. It might be difficult during the two years you are in the IB, but you won't regret it later. I can give you further deatils once you have answered the questions that I wrote in the beginning. Cheers.
