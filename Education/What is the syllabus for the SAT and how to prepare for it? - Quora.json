            "answer_text": "The SAT is a 1600 marks test testing your reading and math skills. To put forward in layman terms. It is divided into 4 sections: (1) Reading: Consists of 5 passages from varying topics such as US History or World History, Science, US Literature or World Literature, and Social Sciences. You won\u2019t have to study these subjects since answers can be found easily in the passage. However, you will have to brush up on your vocabulary, learn new words and their usage in different contexts. (2) Writing: Consists of Grammar questions. Just practice grammar rules such as tenses, punctuations, subject verb agreement, etc. (3) Math: Consists of two sections(No Calculator and Calculator). The questions cover topics such as Algebra,Trigonometry,Complex Numbers,Statistics,Probability,Linear Equations and Inequations, Quadratic Equations,etc. The questions are really easy. Algebra questions , quadratic equations is of CBSE class 8th and 9th level. Trigonometry is of Class 10th level mostly. However, 1 or 2 are of Class 11th level. Complex numbers are of Class 11th level(Duh, this concept is introduced in Class 11th)!. Practice reading line graphs, bar graphs and pie charts. For learning, I would advise you to first learn the concepts from Khan Academy, and practice their tests(the tests are of the same,if not a little bit higher, than the official SAT and are recommended by CollegeBoard(the organisation which creates SAT question paper) itself.) If you aim for a 1500\u20131600 score, I would advise you to do a few Barron\u2019s tests. Any further questions can be asked in the comments section below. Hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no syllabus for the SAT. There is a standard format consisting of Section 1, Reading. Reading includes 5 passages/paired passages including Literature, Science, Social Science/Global Views and History. You are given 65 minutes to complete. Questions range from Command of Evidence to words in context,organization of the passage and more. Next is section 2, Language and Writing. Comprised of the generally accepted rules of American Grammar, you are given 35 minutes to answer 44 questions. This section is an editing section, in that you are expected to know and understand the rules and apply them to the 4 passages that you are presented with. Math is both section 4 and 5\u2026with and without calculator. Algebra, 4 Trig questions, a bit of calc (tiny), geometry and\u2026. Fairly simple, most of it is math you\u2019ve had but may have forgotten. The last section, which is optional, is the essay. This essay is meant to test your understanding of how to analyze a piece of writing by explaining how the author uses rhetorical devices to support his/her position. Most tutors have a template that helps you shape your essay. As far as a true syllabus for studying, well, that depends on your tutor. I have a basic syllabus, and then I customize it to each student. Take a look at the college Board site to see what the tests look like, how they are scored, the sub score areas (which are rarely if ever used by colleges) to see what the test covers. ",
