            "answer_text": "A related question might be, \"How long will it take you to be the person you will eventually become?\" We start every day from a unique place along our life experience. Every day we have one more day of experience, questions, perceptions, and answers. Because mathematics is a way of exploring life, we learn more about mathematics every day we are alive. Some days are comprised of non-formal mathematics while others are much more organized and rigorous. Mathematics is a language that allows us to impose a little more understanding to the universe and our place in it.Every day we are at some level of mathematical competence and the ability to manipulate mathematical principles at that level. As life itself, mathematics comprehension is not a destination, but a journey. We can choose to limit our formal efforts to learn more about mathematics and our ability to use it as the wonder tool it can be, but the informal expansion of our mathematical education never ends.Anyone who thinks they know all of the answers, has not heard all of the questions.

            "answer_text": "Actually I didn't find General relativity all that difficult or at least the parts i was given to learn it\u2019s more getting your head round it. A bouncing light particle and what happens to it at speed is a good way to visualize it knowing it can only go at a fixed speed what happens when you do x you need to be good at visualization thinking and moving things round in 3d in your head. The others will take a lot longer and i'm definitly not saying getting a maths degree will be easy especially since you will need to go beyond a BSc for research. If you can find something you like i'd advise you to pick an engineering subject though. Theres still plenty of maths and you have a similar workload but more tailored to a specific industry and better for when/if you graduate. If you like maths you will likely also like enginering. ",
