            "answer_text": "Today every new person is starting his/her own coaching because they know it is cheap and can guarantee good ROI. Vedantu is one such company, you should not fall for these non-reputed websites, they would give anything but good material. You should take trial classes of any video lecture available online before making any decision. After all, it is a decision that can completely change your life. You cannot just go ahead with anything blindly. However, about Vedantu, I would like to describe an incident that happened to me at the beginning of class 11th. I attended one of the so-called educational webinars of Vedantu called mastering chemical equations and reaction- their reaction mechanisms. However, their main concern was Organic Chemistry according to them. This was supposed to be for class 11th. For about 45 minutes these teachers kept beating around the bush, finally, he talked about the topic, which students of class 9th have already study. They talked about Types of Chemical Reaction and their Balancing of the chemical equations(hit and trial method not the Ion Electron Method). WTF, such a webinar for class Class 11th students. Claps. What do they think- they can teach an already known board topic to any JEE Aspirant? Finally, he advertised vendatu and asked the people to tell the students how great he was. Never attend these stupid people. I say never. Now coming on their video lectures and tutoring. One of my cousins(now in IIT Guwahati Chemical), who used Vedantu told me that it was not very fruitful. Throughout your preparation, you have to suffer an exhaustive training. Most of the times you would be having many doubts and need a quick answer to it which you will receive at Vedantu. Many times it happened with me that my doubts were not answered for 2 to 3 days. These were his words. Come on man what you think the tutors are, they are just unqualified JEE Teachers who are still in Private Colleges and are in the need of money. At least 50 to 100 or more than that is given for each doubt solving. Even if you solve 10 per day you get a good income per month. Nobody checks man. Even in my college such kind of freelancing is done. It very good for college students- less time to make a huge amount of money. My senior(now at IIT KGP MnC) had taken a subscription of Ahaguru Video Lectures. Though I didn\u2019t use Ahaguru, but my senior has a very positive review of it. In his words: \u201dI have a very good review of it. I am completely satisfied with their services. I loved to attend Balaji\u2019s sir Physics and Maths classes. The way in which he taught made the concepts crystal clear. Also, they had provided me with a mentor who used to weekly call me and solve my doubts. Also, I used to call him whenever I wished and he used to solve my doubts. This is a unique feature of Ahahguru. It is a one-time investment of 22k/annum at Ahaguru for all the three subjects but it is worth investing. You will be definitely happy with their service if you apply your own efforts also.\u201d At last, it is you who has to make the choice. Good Luck for your JEE Journey ahead!! ",

            "answer_text": "I have seen Vedantu YouTube channel when they have very less no. of subscribers and there journey to big company as well. Well I am currently pursuing B.tech at NIT Allahabad and in my preparation days I have not taken any courses form Vedantu + not from any other coaching as well. At that time Vedantu have not got such fame, but after that they got some investments and started there advertisements. So, what are the factors which you look upto when you purchase any online courses from any coaching. You should research about teachers who will teach you in that particular subjects. You should know some background about your teachers.Price of that course should justify the content provided in that course + material given.In courses what all things are included.Whether they give you test series or not.Will they regularly mentor you in distance learning program.Will they take extra classes for doubts.Check these all things when you are taking online coaching from anyone. Well I will suggest you one online coaching which I got to know from my friends or seniors in my college - Its Ahaguru Online Coaching - By Dr. Balaji Sampath ( AIR 4 in IIT JEE ) Our college opener of last year is from Ahaguru ( he is our senior and I got to know about this coaching from him & I was amazed that some one can get this much rank only from online coaching) from that onwards I really recommend everyone who asked me to a lower rate + amazing coaching + regularly mentorship from Toppers.  Other students who are creating wonders after studying from Ahaguru. You will get mentored by top rank holders + they will also teach you so it's obvious that you will create wonders in examination. So, according to me if you are finding a good online coaching + material + test series + regular mentoring all in one best possible price then you should consider Ahaguru ( also search about it's founder on google Dr. Balaji Sampath AIR 4 in IIT JEE ). \u201cCheers\u201d Hope you will find best possible courses at good price there.

            "answer_text": "Vedantu\u2019s cofounders were the teachers for the top AIR\u2019s including AIR 1 in JEE ADVANCED and are teaching at vedantu. Vedantu has integrity ..integrity means to keep up the promise . Prices are reasonable . For entire 11 and 12 syllabus revision + JEE Mains and advanced training with tests which were taken by the top AIRs ,which helped in assessing who will actually be the real topper,they just charged around 9000 rupees wheras in other coaching institutes it will be more than double this rate!Vedantu has the best of teachers from all over the world whom we can choose as per our study requirement and time and we ,sitting in any part of the world can listen to the class . Vedantu provides a free session with the teacher before we decide to learn from them and if we dont like we can always choose another good teacherin vedantu. Vedantu gives free solutions to RD Sharma , HC verma ,NCERT and many other papers Vedantu team is working really hard to help every student to reach beyond their potential. We also get our doubts cleared from teachers and students through whatsapp or during sessions. They make sure we send our feedback and ensure that the quality of teaching and website care team is always good . The cofounders who are teaching us are the most wonderful persons ..they teach us with lot of dedication and affection and integrity. Lastly vedantu is better than byjus(good collection of questions but do not keep promise of 24 hour doubt clearing ..teachers in byjus do not help with doubts at all it is very rare and difficult)and simple lecture (good doubt clearing forum but the study material vedios are only average) and meritnation(good doubt clearing forum and sample papers to solve but live classes are not much beneficial)..but vedantu is the best because we get all doubts cleared and we can choose a teacher personally to clear all our doubts in vedantu..teachers teach and clear doubts ..teachers also provide homework questions and tests . Also as vedantu is an online platform for learning we save travel time and can learn comfortably at home. Thanks a lot to the vedantu team ",

Vedantu has teachers which are called \u201cMaster Teachers\u201d. This institute, settled in Bengaluru, is not well known at the present time. But the teachers are quite friendly and cooperative. They will teach you by maintaining a very good environment, that would also include humour etc. To be honest, I don\u2019t find their teaching methodology nice. In their videos, I have always observed that they teach in a quite elementary way, especially in chemistry and mathematics.In physics, they teach you the concepts well, but most of the illustrations they take, are actually not expected to appear in actual exam, as per the seen paper pattern.I also find the pace of teaching slow, which can definitely make serious aspirants feel irritated.However, they provide good mock tests. I have attempted few of them and found the level of questions considerable.These observations are made by me and I agree that many people would be having different opinions, which I appreciate.",

I believe that vedantu is the best you can get for jee. being an online coaching it has a lot of advantages ; You need not waste any time in travelling.You can access the classes from anywhere ( no matter where you live and how small your town is).Since JEE is now computer based so you get used to the CBT mode ( computer based test ).The teachers are legit the best i mean the best ( literally no joke\u2026)The best part compared to offline institutes it demands for a much lesser fees ( approx. 1/3 rd )So I would highly recommend Vedantu ( And yeah just for clarification I m not being sponsored by vedantu to say this .)

You would be having two options ie one is private tution(quite expensive) and other is the class course(cheap) now talking about the teaching its quite good in iitjee class course as i have taken many sample classes. They also provide you with test series and all other stuff. But it just lacks in one thing ie making pressure on students to do the homework which is much more important than class. Also you may sometimes find yourself playing games on mobile during a boring class(personal experience) There is no one to keep a watch on you and thats the major issue And ya dont join the private tutions as teachers charge high in it and you may need to wait days to get assignments. Rest teaching is good if you can do everything without anyone keeping a watch on you Thank you Nanak Singh Khurana ",

            "answer_text": "Vedantu is the best platform for gaining knowledge. It is the excellent platform i have seen till date. I have enrolled with Toppr, Allen DLP, and with a well reputed institution too but my experience with Vedantu was excellent. It has the best faculty for JEE, NEET, KVPY,etc. and has produced many single digit AIR in JEE Advanced(Sarvesh Mehtani AIR 1, 2017), NEET, AIIMS. I myself think that very soon online platform will become the main medium for studying. As it saves time(approximately 1 hour jouney time from home to tution and vice-versa.) and and keeps you safer as nowadays anything can happen with you especially in case of girls. If you are a JEE, NEET, KYPY, NTSE ,etc. aspirant you should give a try at Vedantu, You will love it. ",

I attended IIT JEE prepaparation coaching at Brother's Academy Ranchi and it was great experience. I had also joined cedantu for some extra knowledge and doubt clearing, but it was not very fruitful. Throughout the 2or 3 years of your preparation, you have to go through an exhaustive training. You need be in regular contact with your teachers, complete your assignments l and many a times require a great amount of motivation which can't be achieved with Vedantu or any other online tutorials. Most of the times you would be having much of doubts and need a quick answer to it which you will not get at Vedantu. Many times it happened with me that my doubts were not answered for 2 to 3 days. So, I don't prefer vedantu ",
