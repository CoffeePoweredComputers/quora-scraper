            "answer_text": "Values, beliefs and attitudes fall under what Bloom referred to as the \u2018affective domain\u2019. Values are central to who we are, therefore trying to change someone\u2019s values, attitudes or beliefs through education is more difficult than teaching a skill, or showing someone how to write an essay or use a formula to work out mathematical problems etc. Your question, \u2018why can values education not be imposed?\u2019 is an interesting one. Values can certainly be taught, but we must believe in them to fully embrace them as part of our lives, so whilst I agree in part, that imposing a set of values through education would be difficult. It is possible to impose a set of values via education through fear of not adopting them! E.g. under totalitarian rule. But humans are incredibly adaptive, so we might SAY we agree with the values that underpin a certain education system, we may THINK something else. ",
