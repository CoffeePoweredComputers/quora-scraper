            "answer_text": "I\u2019m penning down the sources and the exam strategy that I followed. Happy to share it for the benefit of everyone. This might also help beginners by giving a direction to their valuable efforts. Read the exam notification You must start with reading the exam notification in detail. You will be aware of the scheme of the examination, syllabus, qualification criteria etc. This has to be done by the aspirant on his own. You must also choose your optional subject for mains by going through the optionals available and their syllabus. You can take guidance of seniors while choosing optional. Sources It is important to choose the right sources from where you would study the aspects in syllabus. I will mention some good sources here. This is not an exhaustive list. I referred to other sources too apart from the below list but only as secondary sources. But even if you prepare only from these below mentioned sources,you will be able to get a good rank. Remember that your book collection and rank are not proportional. Current affairs: Read newspaper daily. Don\u2019t depend on The Hindu alone. Read Hindustan times, Times of India etc. PT 365 by vision IAS during prelims, Mains 365 during Mains. These are current affair compilations which are arranged subject wise. Current affairs are important for all subjects. So even when I specifically don\u2019t mention current affairs in subjects below, take it as said.Polity: Indian polity by Lakshmikanth , PRS India legislative research website for information on current legislations.Geography: NCERTs, Physical geography by G C Leong.Art and culture: Indian art and culture by Nitin SinghaniaAncient history: visionIAS materialMedieval and modern history: NCERT, 11th and 12th class Tamilnadu state textbooks, A brief history of modern India by spectrum.World history: VisionIAS material. Focus on key aspects and don\u2019t try to memorise everything. Your understanding is more important here than event dates.Economy: Indian economy by Shankar Ganesh, Economic survey, Union budget.International Relations: Focus on current affairs, watch Big picture debates on RSTV. This show covers international relations well.Environment: Shankar IAS academy\u2019s Environment book. Take the latest edition.science and technology: Focus on current affairsEthics: \u2018Lexicon\u2019 book for ethics, integrity and aptitude. You need not read static content regarding thinkers. It\u2019s not being asked. Focus on key terms such as integrity, aptitude, ethics, values, morality, qualities needed for public service, 2nd ARC report recommendations etc. Practise case studies. Your writing ability counts more than your preparation in ethics paper.Security: Read about current security threats and develop understanding of multiple security threats to India including cyber threats. NIA,UAPA amendment acts and such security related legislations.Disaster management: Sendai framework, National Disaster management plan. Focus on recent disasters across India and the world.Optional (Sociology): Essential sociology by Nitin Sangwan is a good source . NCERTs of Sociology help you in basics.Note: Preparation for prelims and mains overlaps. So I mentioned sources subject wise rather than compartmentalising them into prelims/mains or even paper wise in mains. It is important to address the question asked from the knowledge you gained. Do not worry about where you have read it from. Aspects you read in one subject might be very helpful in answering a question in a different paper as well. Your preparation must be holistic. Also, some subjects are part of prelims and are not present in mains. Vice versa.You need not read world history, ethics, society, international relations for prelims but are present in mains. You will have to read ancient,medieval and modern history for prelims but only modern history is present in mains. Exam Strategy: Prelims,Mains and Interview need three different strategies. Each stage is unique in what it demands.Have a look at the prelims, mains question papers of 2019 available on UPSC website. Prelims strategy: Objective in prelims must be to score a comfortable score of at least 110 to 120 in the prelims GS paper. One must not aim to answer questions which he/she has no idea of. There will be at least 10 such questions out of the total 100. They are better left unanswered to avoid negative marks pulling down your hard earned marks in questions that you know for sure. You can take an intelligent guess in few questions that you are aware of. Being thorough in current affairs will fetch you good marks in prelims. Also questions from current affairs are the ones that you can mark at one go without wasting time on second thoughts. Be careful while marking with pen as a bubble once marked cannot be changed. You will also have to bubble your roll number on the OMR sheet with caution. Prelims is dynamic with weightage to each subject changing every year. But good preparation will surely make you qualify the exam. Coming to strategy to prepare, it\u2019s good to write sectional tests in prelims before taking any grand tests. Finishing a section of syllabus, say, ancient history and then writing test in it is what I would suggest. This way, you will be able to finish the entire syllabus with greater single minded focus. By the time you finish all the sectionals, you will realise that your scores in grand tests improves drastically. Paper 2: The second paper in prelims consisting of logical reasoning, Quant, English must be easy for most aspirants. The qualification criteria here being just 33 percent marks out of 200. But i suggest you take this paper too seriously and write few mocks, to ensure your preparedness in it is same as you think. You can work on areas in this paper where you can improve. Mains strategy: Answer writing is crucial for marks in mains. Mock tests help you in improving ability to address the question well. Write answers with a free mind. Do not try to just reproduce what you have read. Your answer must be coherent, well reasoned and a meaningful presentation. Essay: Common mistake which most aspirants do is that they neglect essay paper. They think that their knowledge in general studies will help them write a good essay in the exam hall. This is a flawed approach. Preparing notes for essay is crucial. Common essay topics such as education, health can be prepared beforehand. Making note of relevant examples, facts, current issues, government initiatives, quotes, figures, international experiences and comparisons will improve the quality of the essay. Choosing the right essay to write in the exam is also important. Choose an essay that you are most comfortable with. Make use of the choice that the essay paper is offering you. General studies papers: It is important to give enough time to all the 20 questions in GS1,2,3 and 19 questions in ethics. With right preparation and approach, it\u2019s an easy task. I feel very happy that in mains I was able to present everything that I wished to, within the stipulated time of 3 hours. GS paper 1: Focus on understanding the big picture rather than detail. Especially true in world history. Will explain with an answer I wrote in the 2019 mains exam. It\u2019s on how American and French revolutions changed the world. Rather than mentioning any specific events and dates, I explained how ideas such as All men are born free, no taxation without representation, concept of written constitution etc of American revolution and rule by people, equality-liberty-fraternity and rights of man of French Revolution changed the world forever. It is important to be thorough in basic concepts of geography such as climate, landforms. In modern history, tamilnadu textbooks of 11th and 12th give a concise and easy way to cover syllabus. Newspaper reading helps in answering questions on society. Be well aware of various art and culture aspects by listing down at least one example that you can quote relevantly. GS paper 2: International relations must be focused apart from Polity. Big picture debates on RSTV with former ambassadors and High commissioners sharing their expertise is the perfect learning source, as the questions are dynamic. I did not miss a single debate. Mains 365 of IR must be read as if it\u2019s a textbook. In Polity, concentrate on current legislations and issues rather than static. PRS legislative research website is a wonderful source for current legislations tabled or passed by the Indian Parliament. I even made notes out of it. GS paper 3: By going through the GS paper 3 question paper this year, you will realise how important it is to have answer writing ability. It helps in answering well, questions that you don\u2019t usually expect. Economic survey part 1 must be read well. You can start with reading the summaries of all chapters given at the end of each chapter. Part 2 mostly has figures, statistics in most chapters. Summary of budget is presented in PRS website. Current issues in Environment, security, S&T, Disaster management must be focussed. Ethics,Integrity and aptitude: This tests your answer writing ability to the best as there is low scope to reproduce what you memorised. You must keep track of time too in this paper as one might spend time in thinking about the answer to present. Practise will make it easier. Practical, feasible and legal solutions must be given in your answers to Case studies. For questions in part 1, making notes of quotes, current issues and examples will help. Optional (Sociology): Optional and essay are crucial for scoring well. In sociology, I primarily followed Essential sociology book by Nitin Sangwan. I also did M.A in sociology through distance mode while I was working in IT. It is important to take feedback on your answers from faculty by writing test series. Rajitha madam of Shankar IAS helped me a lot in my answer writing. I wrote sociology mock test series in Rajitha madam\u2019s guidance and it greatly improved my answer writing ability. Madam would give me personal feedback through Skype video call after evaluating my script as I was in Hyderabad. Personality Test: Prepare on your DAF 1 and 2. While one cannot predict the questions that they might ask, being well prepared for the interview helps us in presenting ourselves better. Give honest, well reasoned, polite answers. Mock interviews help. Do one to one mocks with peers. My interview which was supposed to be on March 31, 2020 happened on July 30,2020 due to COVID. I kept preparing on current affairs and DAF. Having good sleep before the day of interview is important. I had a relaxed, proper sleep. Eat well before you go to UPSC building. If you are hungry, it would reflect in your voice, expressions, energy etc. In interview, remember that how well you reason the answer is more important than the answer itself. Finally, this is just my strategy and I would advice you to evolve your own,based on what suites you best. Right strategy and preparation will surely give you success. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for a smart question! Coming directly to the point, this is what I think smart work means: Study concise material. Read 12\u201315 books in all for prelims rather than 30\u201340.If you read concise material then you have fair chance to revise same 4\u20135\u20136 times. Revision is very important.Just attempting test is not smart. Make notes for tough questions and revise them. Questions do repeat from tests in prelims.Reading N number of material for current is the biggest mistake one can do. Hindu+vision+insights is all you need.Keep India year book as paper weight and yojana / kurukshetra / frontline etc as manual fan :DFor mains, smart work means: Guessing possible questions while you read a news.Read concise material and revise multiple times.I never read ARC/IPCC. All I read was the index of such big reports and used the index in answers. Once you know that ARC has talked on terrorism, just quote \u201cas per ARC\u201d and write any damn thing!Similarly, if you have read all economic news then you don\u2019t need to read economic survey to actually use it. Just write \u201cas per economic survey\u201d.Focus on innovation in answer writing as much as you focus on answer practice. Example: use questions/keywords asked in previous years in GS-4 in your answers.In Essay I used to quote other essay topics given in the question paper! Also, look around in exam room. There might be a quote somewhere on a chart drawn by school kids :pIngrain in yourself that you will draw diagrams in GS.The basic smart way to force the examiner to give you 6/12.5 is to write 12 points in 12.5 marker question. Nothing else matters much.Focus equally on your optional. I know it goes without saying but many just don\u2019t get this basic right. Select optional smartly. Do not go by herd mentality.Smartest way to handle essay and ethics is to prepare them in the 1st week after prelims. These easy topics help in building study flow.Lastly, focus on personality development throughout the year. At my wordpress blog and youtube channel, I have uploaded my notes and such strategies. Work smart!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Starting with the most important thing which once an already selected senior told me - in CSE preparation, it is more important to be able to decide what not to read than what to read. Thus quality content becomes important for studying and it's repeated revision helps one to succeed. Where there is shortage of such content for example in optionals then note making becomes very crucial and important. Prelims \u2013 Prelims( Got 154/200) is a tough competition where first elimination for CSE takes place and one should devote proper time for its preparation. Strategy which I followed was - Dedicated three months preparation which would cover my static portion of mains syllabus as well as current affairs till prelims exam for GS.Last five year question papers as guide to understand which type of questions UPSC is asking. For example reports by world organisations , space programs, missiles, national parks, biosphere reserves etc are frequently asked now.Reading selected standard books and their frequent revision.Followed InsightonIndia daily quizzes, Daily current affairs, Vision monthly, PT 365 and Insight revision tests.Revising the above as many times as possible.Booklist \u2013 Polity \u2013 LaxmikanthCulture \u2013 Nitin Singhania NotesHistory \u2013 Spectrum Modern IndiaEconomics \u2013 Mrunal lectures and Economic surveyGeography \u2013 Rajtanil Madam lectures available on http://Mrunal.orgMaps \u2013 Prem Patel (India Through Maps )Environment \u2013 ShankarIASCurrent Affairs \u2013 InsightonIndia, Vision Monthly and PT 365.NCERTs of History and GeographyOne must take as many tests as possible before the prelims and study the answer keys in a very detailed manner because one never knows which information would be helpful during the real examination. The art of eliminating the options is very important which one could learn through practicing tests and solving last year Question papers as UPSC many a times would be asking questions which are not straightforward. Frequent revision of studied material is very important as that increases the accuracy in prelims as well as reduces the negative marking which overall helps in getting through. Essay \u2013 I got 158 this time and had taken inputs from the strategy of Chandra Mohan Garg sir who posted his essay strategy on InsightonIndia website. One must practice two essays per week and get them evaluated from friends. This way one is able to prepare relevant material (which includes facts, reports, indices, judgements etc) on different topics which one could revise before the examination. One can also prepare quotations for broader areas like environment, women, science and technology etc. and successfully use them to supplement dimensions and sub dimensions in the essay. Strategy during the exam \u2013 Choosing the right topic i.e. about which one has the relevant content \u2013 examples, facts, quotations etc. I wrote on \u201cIf development is not engendered, it is endangered.\u201d I had previously prepared on women issues which helped me choose this topic.Preparing the blue print ( for 15-20 minutes)Revising the Blue print and structuring it.Writing the essay for an hour.Moving to second essay and selecting the topic keeping in mind that the content from first essay is not repeated in the second. I wrote on \u201cCyberspace and Internet : Blessing or Curse to the human civilization in the long run\u201d. I had previously prepared on Internet of things, Digital world and Net neutrality, which helped me choose this topic.Preparing the blue print and writing the essay.Revising both the essays to avoid silly mistakes and thus saving marks.I have the habit of starting my essay with simple definition of the topic and giving a glimpse of what I would be dealing ahead. I used quotations in the body and conclusion. I used simple language and small paragraphs as well as tried to cover multiple dimensions and sub dimensions in the essay. The criticism should be constructive and solutions should be given to overcome the shortcomings if any. Dimensions like Rural areas, Tribal population, Agriculture are very important to be covered apart from social, economic, political, historical and cultural dimensions. Quoting examples to substantiate is must. The conclusion should be futuristic and positive. The government schemes along with NGOs and media efforts should be mentioned. There must be some personal suggestions as well. GS Papers \u2013 Followed Insight secure and practiced writing few of those questions daily especially the ethics question. I used to discuss it with my friends which helped me in knowing the points that I missed as well as it helped in preparing the topics for mains.I wrote all the answers in points unlike my previous attempt in which I used paragraphs. I observed that with points one is able to write more relevant content along with various dimensions avoiding repetition.Followed vision mains 365 and test series.Last year papers are guiding light for aligning oneself with the UPSC.I tried to link the answers with current events, drew diagrams where I could and tried to give examples wherever possible.Practising comprehensive tests so that paper could be completed on time without diluting the quality.Peer evaluation and group study is important to know different perspectives.The word limit needs to be kept in mind while preparing notes on any topic or reading any material as one is expected to write quality 200 words only for any answer, neither more nor less. Revising again and again helps one to write more relevant answers in exam as compared to reading more and remembering less. In the end I would like to say that everyone is unique and has one\u2019s own learning curve, one must listen to everyone but must form one\u2019s own strategy for this examination as per one\u2019s own strengths and weaknesses. Failures must be thoroughly analysed and lessons must be drawn for future. Constant introspection is necessary to keep oneself aligned with UPSC. The other important point I would like to stress upon is of keeping oneself healthy and fit during preparation and to be able to undergo the regress days of examination during mains. Hope this helps Feel free to ask any further doubts All the Best!! Thank you ",

Every subject has its own demand (i.e. thinking pattern, writing style, presentation techniques etc). Your personality should suit to it.Following are some basic criteria for selecting optionals: Interest and understanding in the subject (about which you will come to know when you study for GS Mains)Analysis of the syllabus and previous years\u2019 question papers of the shortlisted subjectsWriting style and presentation techniques suitable for that particular optional (about which you will know once you start writing for GS and essay)Thinking Pattern expected for a particular optional (you will come to know about yours after you prepare for GS.)Availability of study materialAvailability of guidanceWeightage of optional in GSGraduation backgroundApart from this, some give importance to the length of the syllabus\u2026.

            "answer_text": " Hello friends, I am share with you the story and strategy Santhosha H. He secured AIR 753 in UPSC Civil servicesexamination in his second attempt. He has shared his strategy in an interview and let's read it. I was born and brought up in a village which is devoid of all basic infrastructure. To catch any transport means, or to commute we had to walk to minimum of 5 kms distance. That isolated is my village. My parents are agricultural labourers who work for daily wages. I completed my primary education in government primary school in the same village. Budding of becoming officer After completion of primary education I headed to another village for secondary education. Due to aforementioned commuting issues, I had to live in a backward class and minority hostel \u2013 where there was no proper food and drinking water facilities. Though government gave generous grants, the hostel did not care to provide decent food, drinking water and hygienic conditions. Aware of corruption, I spoke to my primary school teacher about this and he advised me to complain to Lokayuktha (then Lokayuktha Justice Venkatachalam). I come across Lokayukta address which was written on government offices/hospital walls. I complained but didn\u2019t receive no response for months. However at the end of academic year district administration officials visited my hostel and I again complained. Fortunately by then time Lokayuktha officials also visited and problems were solved to some extent. This activism and experience where I could see powers of government machinery to address public issues attracted me to become a government servant. Another incident was drinking water problem in the village where I was staying in the hostel. In that village potable water was available in certain area only. Local political representatives and MLA staged a hunger protest for sanctioning of land to build water tank. The then District collector Mr Harsha Gupta came and sanctioned the same instantaneously \u2013 this again enabled me to understand power of district collector. With these incidents my dream of becoming an IAS officer emerged and took concrete shape. I lost my hearing ability at the age of 10. Due to this impairment my interactions with people got reduced. I started reading more, especially newspapers and novels at Public libraries. I must thank Pavithra Printing Press (Thanks to courtesy of its proprietor, who provided me daily 2 newspapers and a tabloid free of cost with adequate place to read) This enabled me to understand the society and build my own personality. With these incidents and ambition I wanted to peruse humanities after my class 10 but due to societal norms my parents refused and I had to join Diploma in Mechanical engineering. I completed it for the sake of completing. After completing diploma, I worked with my brother in law in Civil Engineering field to earn livelihood. While working here, I prepared for banking exams and got selected for clerical post at State bank of Mysore. This helped me to become financially independent. Then I started pursuing my graduation in humanities through distance education and I also started supporting my family. Due to financial constraints, I again switched my job to DRDO and came to Bengaluru. With all these experiences and struggles I kind of became architect of my own life. Prelims Followed prelims test series rigorously in 2017 and 2018 which and followed daily initiatives such as current affairs, quiz, editorial and solved vision IAS test series 2 months before prelims. Multiple revisions helped here and I also read exclusive modules which made revision easy. Test series and its multiple revision helped me clear 2018 Prelims which was tough. Mains After prelims I was searching for good strategy for mains. I came across Shri Mudit Jain\u2019s,IRS(IT) strategy who cleared 4 mains consistently. According to him 4 to 5 revisions and answer writing practice are must to write effective answers. When I was searching for test series Insights test series had 3 rounds revisions and 15 days gap before actual Mains. This helped me to do one more revision. I wrote all Mains tests at my coaching institute. Their on time evaluation helped me know my mistakes and their support in terms of feedback was very helpful. Interview My IAS coaching institute started group discussion in the month of November with probable topics list for discussion. This helped me to get diverse opinion. I frequently interacted with Vinay sir, he instructed to give the answers from personnel experience, which will help me connect with the panel. I gave one on one mocks with Vinay Sir which helped me immensely in gaining confidence. I also attended some more mock interviews at other institutes. Looking back, I believe we should be architects of our own destiny. With belief and perseverance, anyone can achieve their dreams. When our intentions and actions are good, help will easily come to us in many forms. I thank everyone who helped me reach till here.

I have in the past 3 months gone through loads of material both online and offline to find answer to such questions, i would share my exp. and hope that it would be of some help to all those who are sincere in their intent for CSE. I am following an integrated approach and till now it has turned out to be productive Alhamdulillah. Start with NCERTs, but don\u2019t finish all subject\u2019s NCERT at once, rather, finish a single subject\u2019s NCERT first then proceed to the relevant book of the same subject, take assistance from online initiatives like unacademy, studyIQ etc for the same subjects whenever felt necessary.Very important: Cover daily Current Affairs from InsightsofIndia(INSIGHTS Daily Current Affairs for UPSC IAS Preparation) and Solve their daily quiz on current affairs.Gradually one can proceed to newspaper reading selectively along with step 1 and step 2Write weekly(mostly on sundays) on any current topic of your choice, probably related to the same static subject that you would be studying at that point of time. If possible get them analyzed by some pro, senior or subject matter expert. ImproviseDon\u2019t try to memorize facts rather re read the same books, topics over and over again periodically to have deeper insight and retention of facts.If 1 to 5 implemented successfully then after 2 months, download all the current schemes run by the govt. and try to add them to your schedule of study, but do it Ministry/Department Wise, or else you might mix things up.It took me 3 months to decide on my optional, please for the sake of Almighty, be very clear and decided about your optional, its the game changer!Brief Booklist: All NCERTs 6th to 12th, except science which can be read selectively according to the syllabus.Indian Polity: Roman Saini Sir\u2019s Videos + M.

Allow me to post my humble attempt to guide youngsters in a detailed manner for Prelims preparation- the first step of UPSC. Read further before watching the video presentation \u2026  I have seen many aspirants start enthusiastically, exhaust a number of attempts, blame the exam and leave the preparation with broken dreams. Where do they go wrong? Dont they have access to guidance and booklists ? \u201cMore than What to read, you should rather focus on How to read it.\u201d Remember the famous quote, \u201cWinners dont do different things. They do the same things differently\u201d What makes your preparation style different? What makes your answers unique? Before starting your preparation, answer the Question - Why UPSC? Why invest so much time and energy? What service, what cadre appeals to you? Is it the perks that motivate you or the will to achieve something great, an opportunity to serve our country? Are you willing to work hard for this opportunity despite all odds and continue serving despite the cons of each service? Arey you motivated enough? These questions will haunt you when you are stressed to breaking point and you might be forced to ask yourself\u2026.Have I taken the right decision to prepare for UPSC?! So, think over these questions and once you have the answers, start preparing for this battle\u2026 THE VITAL STEPS : Step 1 - Why UPSC? Why not something else? Are you motivated enough? Do you have the right guidance/mentor? Step 2 - Do you have a back up plan ready ? If not, think over it. It will help you fight fearlessly. Step 3 - Study the Pattern from previous year papers and also the Syllabus. Your Syllabus is your Bible. Step 4 - Set a timeline, a deadline, the date of your first Prelims - Just one final attempt to achieve your goal. Leave sufficient time before the D-Day to prepare. Step 5 - Observe the successful and unsuccessful candidates carefully. Learn from other's mistakes. Step 6 - Classes - yes or no? If you already have the right guidance - No. Dont follow the herd blindly. Join if you are completely lost/ dont have anyone to guide/ dont trust online guidance/ have lot of extra time and money. Do join a class for Mains and Interview Mock exams. Step 7 - Study the booklist and buy 1 or at the most 2 exam oriented books per section of the syllabus Step 8 - Know HOW to study the same books to score more marks - your Key to success! Step 9 - Use technology and all resources available to you efficiently. Stop cribbing about your circumstances. Stay away from negativity. Step 10 - Prepare for Interview, Mains and Prelims from Day 1. Your main focus should be on Mains prep. Leave atleast 2-3 months for dedicated Prelims preparation Step 11 - Be creative, innovative in your approach. Study different strategies and develop your own. There are people preparing for years together, if your one attempt is to match up to their standards and beat them, you need to be very Smart! Understand what constitutes \u201cSmart Work\u201d Step 12 - Revise regularly. Everyone Forgets, but not everyone finds a solution to this problem in time. Step 13 - Preparation is just 40% of the task. Remaining 60% is the actual battle. Practice answer writing and attend mock interviews - dont overdo, just understand your drawbacks and worl on them before the final battle. Remember, a War may last just a day but a Warrier is not made in a day! You need to fight the battle in your brain a thousand times each day before the actual battle. Exam starts from Day 1 of your preparation. The way you handle stress, depression, frustration, negativity is also a part of this exam. You'll find individual strategies for Prelims, Mains and Personality Test on the internet. If you have just started your Prelims preparation and want a slightly different approach, a detailed approach of how I handled the first hurdle, I invite you to watch my first guidance video\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly I would like to congratulate you on opting for Civil Services, not many get the opportunity to serve the country and you have chosen to be one among them. Inform your family : Let your family members know that you have taken the decision to write Civil Services examination. In my case this was the most important step because I had to tell my family that CSE is a very competitive exam and that I will not be participating in family activities like before because this exam demands commitment and perseverance.Long term commitment : CSE is not a short term 3 month project or 4 month project. You need to have a clear cut picture in your mind that this exam is competitive and unpredictable. You must not lose heart just because you did not clear prelims by 1\u20132 marks or did not clear mains by a few marks, but you must put in enough effort to make sure that you are well above the cut off under any circumstances.Know the syllabus : I would suggest that you start your preparation by going through the preliminary exam syllabus and the mains examination syllabus thoroughly first. Understanding the syllabus will help you in relating to the relevant topic whatever be the source you are studying from. Over a period of time you will become thorough this way.Read the newspaper : Start reading the newspaper on a regular basis, make it a habit and if possible prepare notes or type the content on your PC so that you always go back to your notes to revise. Aspirants often find it difficult to start preparing notes from the newspaper and leave this habit over a period of time. However, it is crucial that you regularly go through the daily newspaper. I would also suggest smart abhyas app as an alternative because they cover sources like Hindu, PIB, ET etc and moreover they present current affairs in simple manner so that even newcomers are comfortable.Start with polity or history : Why I suggest polity or history is because of the simple fact that you can easily relate to these subjects no matter from what educational background you are from. Everybody can relate to India\u2019s history or the way how the political system in India works.Previous year question papers : Thoroughly going through previous years question papers will give you an idea of what the exam demands of you and at what level you need to prepare. CSE preparation in general demands a sea change in the way you prepare because you are no longer preparing for a college exam but you are preparing for the one of the most competitive and prestigious exams in the country.Choose your optional subject : This is a very crucial decision and you need to think about a number of factors before deciding. Choose a subject that you can relate to and manipulate easily. It would be wonderful if you could choose a subject that you have studied about in your graduation course.Secondary sources : Once you have established a daily routine, you can further supplement your preparation by going through other sources. Rajya Sabha TV and Lok Sabha TV are two television channels that provide very useful programmes that aid in preparation. Yojana and Kurukshetra magazines are very useful resources that help in keeping your knowledge with regards to government programmes and initiatives up to date.Lastly, keep a tab on your health. Do not try to suddenly adopt the habit of studying for 12\u201315 hours just because you saw somebody say that in a television interview. Understand your strengths and proceed likewise. Do not deprive yourself of sleep unnecessarily, a healthy sleep cycle is most important for staying motivated and energised.Stay sincere and stick to the daily routine that you make for yourself and you will find success no matter what the circumstances. Consistency and hardwork are the key to success in this exam. Hope this answer helps you in beginning a wonderful journey of becoming a Civil Servant. All the best. ",

Eg attitude. what is attitude, attributes of attitude, how to change attitude etc. Make simple points on all these and relate it to real life examples.( how to change a bureaucrat attitude, society attitude etc). This year a question was based on it only- changing attitude of villagers towards female education. How will you do it. UPSC expects application of ethical knowledge in real life and this is how we need to do it.Refer Insights secure for answer writing and reading others answer. Key is read less, think more ( collect examples, reason and analyse etc) and then practice how to write. Refer some test series if you want. GS score case studies solutions were really good earlier.

            "answer_text": "Have a knowledge base 5X than the maximum marks of the entire CSE: I knew I should have a tool box which would help me go forth five times the length required to crack CSE. It means if you have prepared for 10000 marks; order your favorite dish, you surely are going to crack UPSC.Focused formidably on books by Ramachandra Guha and Amartya Sen and I can vouch for the fact that the examiner might not have read NCERTs but this brilliant fellow already knows the content of these books inside out. Merely reading extra books is not enough, you should commit the important paragraphs from therein to your memory and thereafter apply them in appropriate places.Codification is the core strategy to pass the CSE relatively EASILY. When you join my reasonably-priced batches thousands of easy-to-remember codes will be given to you. I applied these codes to ace the exam and reach the interview at age 22 in my first attempt!Put this into your consciousness: Prelims just requires about 10 books plus some current affairs booklets to crack it. To crack CSM, only about 18 books maximum are required. Reading 30 NCERT books means you reduce your chances to ace the exam dramatically. I avoided NCERTs except a single Good NCERT that of Geography- Standard 11 India: Physical Environment.I wanted to break all the CSE myths generated by many earlier toppers and general public that if one does not study 12 hours one will not become Civil Servant leave alone a normal govt servant. That's why I averaged about 36 hours a week throughout and the highest ever I studied was a week just before CSM 2013 where I clocked 56 hours which means 8 hrs per day in that final week.This has been my strategy not necessary you do the same: I do not believe in back-ups. I never filled any forms of other examinations. I always have burnt all the bridges so that I could fully achieve whatever I have cherished. Similarly, when I realized my inner calling is to coach civil servant aspirants full time, I ejected from the govt sector to start my own initiative Peak Performers UPSC Tutorials. Pan-India online batches have started. Please see my panel profile and once you study through my methodologies and inputs you will realize there is nothing as exciting as studying and cracking CSE.",

So it's very important to formulate your own strategy as it pays to be yourself. However, for the general guidance to tackle this examination, we are giving some tips which may be help to the aspirant to achieve success. Tips for Civil Service Exam Go through the syllabus and the previous question papers: It is the most important part of your strategy to invest your time to go through the Mains syllabus thoroughly and also the previous years question papers. A thorough insight of the past question papers will solve two purposes. One it will appraise you about the portions of the syllabus from where the questions are regularly being asked and second you may also understand the nature of the question being asked. This two factors will constantly guide you throughout your preparation of the Mains exam. So go through the question papers and identify the pattern and select the topics which are asked very frequently. Identify those topics which are particularly being asked for conventional essay type questions that require analatical abitlites and those questions which requires facts and figures. Once you have clearly demarcated the topics, the rest of the preparation will be an easy task.Reading Material: It is advised not to go through a lot of books, instead rely on one standard book on each topic which deals with the basic concepts. Standard books not only save your time but also enrich you with right knowledge. So always rely on one quality book and not on many books. Also it is advisable to collect various books on different topics in advance to save time and the last minute blues.Make your own notes: It is always advisable to make notes of the related topics as you go through the books and other study material. A well drafted note solves two purposes. One it takes you through the entire syllabus and second your own notes will be of immense help for the revision of the syllabus. Prepare short notes of important topics with relevant points and always rely on your self-prepared notes. Go through your short notes rigorously.Rely on your prior preparation that alone will help you.Mind your Handwriting: Since Mains examination is all abbout handwriting, so try to practice writing as much as you can. you must practice how to write answers in the limited space given in the answer sheet, which will be provided to you during the Mains exams. This is something you must develop as a habit from now onwards and always stick to the word count that would be given to you to write answers. You must see to it that your answer should not exceed the word count or spill over the box given as you may be penalized for any such lapses. While practicing this activity, you must be careful about other facets of handwriting as well. You try to develop writing legibly that can be read by the examiner without any difficulty. In the same vein, you must pay attention to the spelling and grammar too. You see to it that your answers are free from such mistakes and your handwriting appeals to the examiner.",

Are you willing to give 110% ? If yes , then First and foremost understand that you will need to really fire on all cylinders to complete the syllabus and be competent enough to clear the exam. This should be rough time table and guidelines ,please tweak it to suit your needs. Break the available time into months , weeks , days. Before starting anything , do previous year question papers thoroughly . This will be very very helpful , don't discard it as useless activity. It should take around 10 days. Try and finish all relevant NCERTS in max 20 days. Give INSIGHTS and VISION\u2019s test based on NCERTS. Move on to reference books . I'll give you a rough time taken to complete the books. Laxmikant for polity - 15 days .Spectrum for modern history - 10 daysShankarias for environment- 10 daysClass 11th NCERTS for geography - 8 daysEconomy videos or class 12th Macroeconomic with Sriram notes - 10 days.Ancient and medieval you should do from MRUNAL videos and make notes out of it (you don't have time to read books and this topic has low cost benefit ratio) - 5 daysAs you can see you will take approximately 2 months to complete standard reference books . Meanwhile keep reading the Hindu and please don't make notes out of it (it's too time consuming ) . Instead follow INSIGHTS dialy Current affairs , coupled with ONLY IAS analysis. 3 months would have gone in a jiffy !!!!! Start giving full length mock tests for prelims from VISION and INSIGHTS (both complement each other pretty well). Analyse each mock thoroughly and revise it umpteen number of times . Neglect the revision part at your own cost because in the exam hall when you are required to analyse and recall minute details , it is the revision which would come at your rescue. Slowly steadily start reading daily mains answer writing at one of the online website preferably INSIGHT . When you have a decent knowledge base you can start answer writing (don't spend too much time on it though!!) After this for next 2\u20133 months you should keep revising the NCERTS , standard books , mock papers. Looking at this year's prelims it's clear as daylight that prelims would require full fledged preparation . Also prepare your optional in this time , you should have completed at least one reading before PRELIMS !! Last 2\u20133 months focus should be completely on prelims. Solve mocks , revise them . Various coaching institutes would give last minute revision modules. Do them , even if they don't come in exam directly but they surely help in developing our intelligent guessing !!! Ant further doubts ,please DM me or comment below or go through my other answers for booklist and other queries. All the best !!! Thank you . ",

            "answer_text": "How To Prepare For UPSC ( CSE ) The Civil Services Examination ( CSE ) is considered to be the Mother of all written examinations. It is a curriculum heavy examination especially at the Main exam stage. A candidate, therefore, has to begin preparation for the Main Exam and then for the Prelim. This is so because, if one starts his preparation for the Main exam after the having written the Prelim exam, he will have just four months (June to October) to prepare the Optional subject, Essay and General Studies, which is almost impossible to achieve. The optional subject is of post graduation level and usually it will be totally a new subject. Let us take X as the year in which a candidate wants to sit for the CSE and X-1 as the year previous to the one in which a candidate wants to take the CSE. One can divide his preparation into two parts or two sessions Viz., June and July sessions. #1. Students who begin Preparation in June (X-1) Start your preparation in June of the previous year if you wishe to appear for the Prelim exam the next year. Begin your preparation of the optional subject, from the second week of June to October( 4 months) of the year X-1 and General Studies for both Prelim and Main exam from June of X-1 to March of the year X and take the Prelim exam in May or June of the year X. ). Prepare for the CSAT in either October (X-1) or in January (X). After taking the Prelim exam, from June to October of the year X, you can revise your optional subject and GS and prepare the Essay paper before taking the Main exam in October. The period from January to April and June to October of the year X, can be used to take a test series for the optional subject for the Main exam. Kindly follow the steps shown below: (X-1 is Previous year) ( X is Exam year) Step 1: (Start at least one year before you intend to take the Prelim exam). From the second week of June (Previous year) to October ( Previous year),viz. 4 months, prepare the optional subject and CSAT. Step 2: From the first week of June (Previous year) to April (Exam year), prepare GS, both for the Prelim and Main exam. If time permits, you may revise your optional subject. Step 3: From Febuary (Exam year) to May (Exam year), revise G.S and CSAT for the Prelim exam. Step 4: From the last week of June to October, revise the optional subject, GS and prepare for Essay for the Main exam. The compulsory English and Indian language papers generally do not need any formal preparation. Join a test series for GS and optional subject. #2. Students who begin Preparation in July (X-2) Start your preparation in July of the previous year in which you wish to face the Prelim and prepare the General Studies from the last week of July (X-1) to April (X) and the optional subject from the mid October (X-1) to March (X). Prepare for the CSAT in either in October (X-1) or in January (X). Step 1: (Start at least eight months before you intend to take the Prelim exam).From the last week of July (Previous year) to April (Exam year), prepare General Studies both for the Prelim and Main exam. From mid October (Previous year) to March (Exam year), you can prepare the optional subject. Those students who are capable of managing their time and schedule, may join CSAT also in October ( Previous year). Step 2: For the other students who cannot take all the three courses together, should join CSAT in January (Exam year). Step 3: From February (Exam Year) to April (Exam Year), revise GS and CSAT for the Prelim exam. Give the Prelim in May or June (Exam year) Step 4: From the lmonth of June to October, revise the optional subject, GS and prepare for Essay for the Main exam. The compulsory English and Indian language papers generally do not need any formal preparation. Join a test series for GS and optional subject. You have now much time.. First think Carefully before entering into Civil Services! All The Best\u2026! ",

You can prepare for GS papers of Mains along with the Pre preparation. If you are starting from scratch Reading and understanding the detailed Syllabus for UPSC Exam should be the first step Go through the previous year question papers to understand the nature, quality and difficulty level of questions Gauge the current level of your own understanding/level Prepare a comprehensive set of resources and a booklist to cover all the parts of the syllabus. I am presenting here a summary of all the books as recommended by toppers of the past 5 years. We have carefully analyzed their blogs, interviews and answers on multiple forums and the first thing that becomes apparent is that there is a great overlap and consistency in the books they have recommended over the years. Also all toppers have suggested sticking with your booklist and not refer to multiple resources for the same topic. Please note that this is a consolidated list and subject to our interpretation: NCERTS \u00b7 NCERTs (6-10th Standard) Geography, History, Social Science/Polity \u00b7 NCERTs (11-12th Standard) Art and Culture, Geography (Focus on mineral distribution, agriculture etc.) History (Selective reading) \u00b7 NCERT Class 12 Biology last 4 chapters on environment History \u00b7 Spectrum\u2019s A Brief History of Modern India- Rajiv Ahir Spectrum \u00b7 India\u2019s Struggle for Independence- Bipan Chandra (Selective reading) \u00b7 TN Board History (Class 11) Polity \u00b7 Indian Polity - Laxmikanth Geography \u00b7 Certificate Physical and Human Geography-G.C.

It is especially crucial for working professionals or candidates who do have limited time. We present below a list that most toppers believe can be put on hold or be used as reference books. However we advise that you use your own discretion in choosing a booklist for yourself. \u00b7 India\u2019s Ancient Past - R.S. Sharma \u00b7 A history of Medieval India \u2013 Satish Chandra \u00b7 India Since Independence \u2013 Bipan Chandra \u00b7 A brief history of modern India \u2013 Bipan Chandra \u00b7 Introduction to Constitution of India - DD Basu \u00b7 Indian Economy- Dutt and Sundaram \u00b7 Geography of India - Majid Hussain \u00b7 Environment Studies - Bharucha \u00b7 Manorama Yearbook Stick to these resources and revise them regularly. Do not keep switching books For the current affairs cultivate the habit of reading newspapers. If that is not possible you can use the summary of current affairs published monthly by various institutes Practice previous year question papers and other practice papers Keep doing mains answer writing practice after you have a decent grasp over subjects Most importantly keep a positive mindset and prepare with a marathon like attitude Hope that helps.

            "answer_text": "Preparing for UPSC Civil Services (IAS) Exam can be really daunting in myriad ways. There is so much to study, so little time and absolutely no idea of a beginning or end. One can easily get lost in the sea of information or get bogged down by different ideas, strategies and topper tricks/hacks. Though the UPSC CSE preparation strategies given by toppers are useful, most of the time they are in the favour of old students who already know the ropes of IAS preparation very well, leaving the newbies in the lurch. So, in this article I am trying to lay down a broad strategy for UPSC Civil Services Exam 2017 for the Beginners who are not yet sure of how to approach this exam. Commandments for Success in UPSC Civil Services Exam 2017: Newspapers & Magazines: The first thing a newcomer should do is to start reading newspapers. Why reading newspapers is so important? Because reading newspapers is vital for gaining an understanding into the complex issue of the day and for gaining awareness about Current Affairs. Standard Reference Books: Instead of reading many books once try to read a single book multiple times. You need to read standard reference books for different subjects. Some of them are: 1. M Laxmikanth for Polity 2. India\u2019s Struggle for Independence: Bipan Chandra for Modern History 3. India After Gandhi: Ramchandra Guha for Post-Independence History 4. Ramesh Singh for Economy etc. Note: I will soon post a detailed Book List for Aspirants. NCERTS: Reading NCERTs for UPSC Civil Services Exam is very important for building concepts. NCERTs become important not because of their content, but because UPSC asks questions from them. UPSC will lift a line from NCERT and may convert it into a question. And that\u2019s why NCERTs are important. Websites & Internet: One needs to utilise the internet effectively for UPSC Exam preparation online. And that means not wasting time on countless useless WhatsApp/Facebook groups in which no worthwhile information is shared, and only time wasting discussions on cut off take place. Use internet effectively to search for information not easily available in exam preparation books or to understand a particular concept you find difficult. Internet can also be utilised for general reading about different topics of UPSC syllabus to build a good balanced outlook towards current affairs. Some of the useful websites are: 1. Editorial pages of Indian and Global Newspapers like The Hindu, Indian Express, Economic Times, Mint, Business Line, NY Times, Guardian etc. 2. Websites dealing with specific topics of the Syllabus like Down To Earth (For Environment), IDSA (For Defence & Internal Security), CFR (For International Relations; their backgrounders are unmatched in describing the background details behind issues), The Diplomat (For understanding Asia-Pacific Affairs), The Economist (For a global perspective about issues) 3. YouTube for videos related to the syllabus (For Example: Michael Sandel Videos for Ethics) General Reading: General reading is very important to build a holistic perspective about the issues happening around oneself. And it\u2019s very important to have a well-rounded and balanced personality not from the point of view of Interviews but in general too. So, one should read a lot from varied sources like Novels, Magazines, Books etc. How To Study: The focus should be on building fundamentals and conceptual clarity and not on mugging up information. UPSC tests knowledge and understanding and not factual information. So, focus more on building concepts and less on information. Integrated Preparation: One of the very common mistakes people who have just started their preparation make is to think of Civil Services Exam as three different and discrete steps. This whole exam is one integrated exam having different levels testing different skills. So, exam preparation strategy for beginners should be holistic and integrated too. Yes, when a step approaches focus should be on that step, but that should not mean the preparation becomes discrete. Current Affairs: Another mistake students make is of neglecting CA and trying to cover them through compilations as a last-ditch effort. This can be disastrous. UPSC asks CA questions which are rooted in concepts and require deep analysis. And these questions cannot be covered at the last minute, least of all through compilations. So, the best way to do CA is through regular reading of newspapers and from the sources mentioned before. Skill Building: The three different levels of this exam test different skills. So, to ace this exam, one needs to develop those skills. For example, Mains demands excellent writing skills as well an ability to analyse issues. So, to develop these skills, it is imperative that one do adequate writing practice to be able to express one\u2019s views effectively. Timeline: Although everyone learns and reads at a different pace and hence the times lines vary per individual preferences and tastes, a general timeline can be prescribed which one can modify according to one\u2019s requirements. Month Preparation Strategy Dec Start Preparation: Cover Basic NCERTs Jan-March Finish Optional Papers along with Static Portion of GS Apr-May Focus Exclusively on Prelims: Take Mock Tests and Revise CA June Prelims Exams July- Oct Prepare for Mains: Do writing Practice, Revise GS and Optional Oct Mains Exam Nov Relax and do General Reading Dec Onwards Start Preparing for Interview Gud luck!!!

            "answer_text": "What Gets Measured Gets Done Since UPSC is a long journey, therefore, it's essential to have monthly, weekly and daily plan for your studies else you would find that even after 6 months of preparation you won't be able to recall what you have studied or attempt question papers. Before setting daily target you must first set your monthly and then weekly target. Don't be too ambitious in setting these targets. It's OK if you are able to manage only 7\u20138 hours per day. You daily study should have following components: Newspaper Reading Ideally you should start your day by doing through the newspaper. It's best to read newspaper in the morning. Your mind is fresh and ready to absorb new information. Intensive Revision Revise what you studied 1 month, 15 days and 1 week back. Revision, if done well, takes less time but gives rich dividends. Static Subjects Go through HIPEG (History, Polity, Economy, Geography) standard textbooks as these subjects are highest marks fetching. Make sure that you have crystal clear clarity on these subjects. Optional Irrespective of what optional you have, you should daily devote some time to it. Even if you feel that you have an easy optional don't ignore it. Optional marks plays a crucial role in deciding your rank. MINIMISE INTERNET USAGE Internet surfing, reading random newspaper articles does not qualify as preparation. Period. Your time on internet should be with a definite purpose. Ideally you should devote weekends for searching new information. Writing Practice You should daily allocate some time to writing 1\u20132 answers (GS, Optional) or attempting MCQs. This will prove very effective in the long run. If you are able to maintain the above daily routine then you won't face difficulty in your exams.

            "answer_text": "One of the biggest challenges among the exams in India is UPSC Civil Services Exams and you have to prepare for it accordingly if you want to succeed among the lakhs who appear for it. Like for any difficult conquest, plan your preparation. For that you need to first know and understand your syllabus from cover to cover. Each topic and how much time it will take you to cover them. Once you have a basic understanding of that, you can begin planning for your preparation. So create a study plan and take someone\u2019s help at this stage if required. Then create a timetable for yourself, allotting a healthy time for sleep, eating and breaks. Don\u2019t try to pack 16 hours of study in a day. Start with 5 to 6 hours of study and build up to 10 to 12 hours as you progress in your preparation. Remember to allot time for revision and tests. Now that you are more or less prepared with the syllabus, you need to focus on the exam and that means the previous years\u2019 question papers. This will make sure you are always attuned to the exam rather than the syllabus. You need to find patterns and topics from the questions and sort the questions into the correct topics. Study topic wise and make sure you know the type of questions that appeared in the questions in earlier years. Take time and guidance to choose your optional subject. Don\u2019t blindly follow the herd and choose a \u201chigh scoring\u201d subject. Choose a subject that you are truly interested in and won\u2019t find difficult to study for a prolonged time. But don\u2019t choose a subject just because it is a subject you studied in college. Choose a subject that interests you, has a manageable syllabus and has an overlap with the GS papers. Take mock tests regularly and check your progress. Also take tests in groups by joining test series to see how you are performing against others. You should at least do 20 tests by the time you are appearing for the mains. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "To prepare for UPSC, you need to start with two tgings- newspapers and NCERTs. Reading newspaper is must for clearing UPSC. Completing newspaper in 2 hours generally is a challenge for many people. So I will recommend you to start reading a good newspaper right from today. If u are new to newspaper reading, you can start with The Tribune or The Indian Express. These are good papers but are not sufficient. When you are comfortable reading them, shift to the Hindu. Never Ever leave any editorial Editorials are must. Keep on reading them even if you are unable to understand them. Read them twice, thrice , four times till u understand them. If you are new to the context of the news headline, use internet- Google, YouTube, blogs- to learn more about the topic. Second important thing is to read NCERTs. You can get the list if the NCERTSs which are to be read from internet. Once you are done with them, read old ones- ancient , medieval and modern history and Indians and world geography. You need to broaden your thinking and understanding of the issues and topics happening in India and in world. Listen to discussions on rajyaSabhaTV. Find like minded people and have healthy discussions and debates with them. Once done with this, start reading standard texts books- goh cheng leong for Geography, Ramesh Singh for Economy, Laxmikant and DDBasu for Polity, Bipin Chandra or Spectrum for Indian History, Arjun Dev for world history. Almost all other topics are dynamic and u will be able to cover them through newspapers, pib, and so on. Another important thing is to follow a good website religiously. Insightsonindia, civilsprep both are good. Also develop a good hobby. A lot of questions are asked about it in your interview. ",

            "answer_text": "Thnx for A2A ....You are asking a very tough question that what should u do . look I m telling to u a basic fact , it is not the hard and fast rule. You have to listen to everyone but act according to your own mind , because you can't follow everyone's strategy. Just stuck to one strategy and don't change strategy quite often , if you choose any strategy then don't influenced by other's strategy . Here I m giving some point which cover all your doubt. First of all ask to yourself that why u want to be a civil servent, if the ans is for perks and money then right away change your goal, because if you are studying hard for only these perks which you can earn in any field with less effort . and if your ans is for the sake of humanity and u want to change the thousands life with your profession then your most welcome.Second thing whether u want to join any coaching or just want to self study ( coaching is not the Panacea for civil services). You can also do self study, if you are economicaly strong then think about it otherwise in my opinion don't need to join coachingJust visit some websites for making your strategy. Here is some websites from there u get an idea that how to make ur strategy. Mrunal.org , from here u will know about everything regarding Civil Services Examination (CSE).News paper reading should be in ur hobby. Especially \"The Hindu\" , in beginning u will face some problem in reading editorial but when it is in ur practice , u will be familiar with itAnd read Ncert from 7-12 . and don't read it class wise , read it topic wise ( ex. For the topic 'universe' u should read topic from all classes regarding universe). For topic wise study go through mrunal.org , here u will find all topic wise material and just download it.And first stuck with one book don't read same topic from different books. When one book is finish and if u want to enhance ur knowledge then u can follow another book.And the YouTube channel \" Unacdemy by Roman saini  \" from here u will get everything about the Ias. And after seeing this u have no doubt.I think if u follow these things then u no need to question anyone that \"what u should do\" , because after that u have too much information regarding this exam and u alone can make ur strategy in better way.If any boubt then inbox(msg) me.Hope this ans will help u.Thnq u and All the Best !!

Control your thoughts..while studying..I used to read for long hours, sitting for 4 to 5 hours in a stretch was not a big thing for me..but the problem was, my mind wanders a lot during reading\u2026from Cainozoic to present I started to travel while studying..means I was taking 4 hours for topic need to covered in 1 hr..I was in habit of writing every important thing I read..I never trained my mind to remember facts..not only this I was making notes of same topic many times instead of editing and revising my previous notes, with more colourful and decorating stuff..especially girls. Stop doing that.I always hesitate to take help\u2026I tried doing things all by my own\u2026it drained lot of my energy and time\u2026but taking too much help can also be dangerous better take right decisions. Alert to introverts.I was more into listening than speaking. Sometimes it's bad.Revision is the key\u2026do it regularly and avoid revising whole subject in one go\u2026revise your work weekly.I was very bad at remembering facts\u2026Reading with Concentration and connecting the dots..is the solution. Now I am trying this and improving.Listen to your gut feeling about your preparation\u2026it knows it right.few months of 16\u201317hours of preparation without proper direction and guidance\u2026luck need to be on your side as well in this case.These points may not help you to pass but definitely reduce your chances to fail.

Padosh ki aunty: Woh toh sab kar rhe, uske alawa aur kya kar rha? Rahul\u2019s Mom: Nae nae, paper clear kar chuka. Bs interview baaki hai. Padosh ki aunty: Acha mae chalti hu, khana bnana hai. Rahul\u2019s Mom: Smirked :) So, let's find out how Rahul cracked UPSC: Mock Test Papers or IAS Question Papers: First Mantra to success is undergoing through mock-test daily. This will help in understanding your strength areas and also the areas where you are lacking. There is always a crunch of time in the IAS Exam, one has to be very fast in writing questions. Mock test papers help in increasing the speed of mind to make calculations.Right Choice of IAS Preparation Books: The only friend who will be with you till the end of your journey is the books. So, make sure you choose a legitimate and informative friend. NCERT and books from KopyKitab are always highly suggested and are considered as a must-read by experts as well as successful candidates as they clear doubts fundamentally.GS Paper 1 is the Treasure: Covering every subject of the IAS Main Exam is the best approach to clear the Prelims test. Don't give priority to any particular book or area. You must not miss the easy questions from traditional subjects like Polity, History, Geography, History, and Economics. Current affairs are also important, other than that the latest schemes and bills launched by the government are also valuable.IAS Prelims cum IAS Main approach: The questions asked in UPSC Prelims and Main are different, but there are also many similar areas. For GS Paper I, an ideal strategy suggests covering GS Main and Prelims syllabus in detail first as it will give you the concept clarity about all major topics.Time Management: Categorize available time according to the sections you have to cover. One must note that you do not need books or notes on bulk to completely go through but only a limited no. of good books and a deep study of that study material.Peace of mind and a healthy body: Your mind needs to break and rest to work on full force. All your efforts and hard work go in vain if you lose your cool on the doom day. Be calm, confident, and believe in yourself :) I wish you all the best in your career.

            "answer_text": "UPSC CSE s are the toughest exams to crack in India and especially so because of the huge syllabus that you need to cover to crack it. Thus the preparation time is usually spanning across a year or so for preparation of the UPSC exams. Thus the first thing I will suggest is read the syllabus till you have practically memorized it. Know the syllabus so well that you see a topic in a question or a newspaper and you will know which part of the syllabus it belongs to. The second thing is to create a study plan and a timetable. Plan the entire preparation along with time for revision and test taking. Ensure that you are not cramming too much into a day and leave time for your daily activities like eating sleeping etc. Also make time for newspaper reading, about an hour a day, Choose the optional subject wisely; understand your interest and also the overlap of the subjects with the GS papers. Choosing your optional subject based on only one of the criteria is a big mistake. Follow the previous years\u2019 question papers. Understand the pattern of questions and rigorously write answers, at least 2 per day to improve your answer writing skills. You need to make your answers related to current news, well presented, well structured and well thought out. Remember that even if you have all the facts, they will not present themselves in an orderly fashion during the exams if you don\u2019t make a habit of practicing writing answers regularly. Take mock tests regularly and chart your progress. You need to continuously see an improvement test wise, subject wise and topic wise. Only then will you be able to crack the UPSC exams. Finally I would say get a mentor to help you stay focused during this long preparation. Wish you all the best in your preparation! ",

            "answer_text": "As a beginners, you can start with the daily analysis of The Hindu newspaper on study IQ.(With this you may be aware of many important things and is an excellent habit that will help go a long way in making you a well -informed , socially aware and sensitive human being) You may keep UPSC mains syllabus in front of you while reading the newspaper. This would help you concentrate on areas of importance (Eg: NGOs, Self-Help Groups etc. as they are mentioned in UPSC CSE syllabus) Then start with an analysis of the UPSC syllabus properly and then try to know the question pattern of UPSC by following the last five or six year\u2019s questions.  Do the same thing when you choose optional for your mains exams. Just download some 3 to 4 years back question papers for your optional.   \u2022 Now coming to the major dilemma which every fresher faces whether to join a coaching. As you would be very much aware of the fact that offline classes cost you around 2.5 lacks to 3, on the other hand at study IQ the whole online course will be available to you at 22500 which very less as compared to any offline classes. \u2022 Everyone can not afford a minimum of 2.5 lakhs + fees demanded by offline coaching classes. And also offline coaching classes are being conducted only in few cities. I would say if you don't want to go to Delhi then this is the best way to do coaching for UPSC. \u2022 In offline classes, once a subject is completed you will barely get a chance to interact with concerned faculty for doubt clearance.  \u2022 On the other hand in Study Iq\u2019s pen drive course, you can watch videos as many time as you need to clear your concepts.  \u2022 In offline classes, you will have a strict timetable every day. You will feel bad if you can not attend the class for any strong reason. On the other hand in online classes you can overcome this problem.  \u2022 You don\u2019t need to commute for long distance and waste time in traffic.  \u2022 High flexibility in nature of scheduling your study eg: from studying early in the morning or late night, even during gap periods of college or office. -> Download \tthe videos and watch them , when you have no internet access .   More \tinside into the study IQ\u2019s pen drive course :  \t \u2022 They teach concepts from the scratch assuming that students \tknow nothing about the topic and convert the students to the masters \tof those topics.  \u2022 All I need to say is Study IQ's \tpen drive course for UPSC is worth the money, and their teaching \tstyle is awesome. Even after one year, I could remember the concepts \tjust by revising my notes.  \u2022 You can visit Study \tIQ's youtube channel and see for yourself.   SOMETHING \tABOUT THE AUTHORS : \u2022 Every subject has been subdivided in such a way that it will easy to know the areas that are being covered by every subject and it will be easy to revise sequentially also.  \u2022 The materials that have been prepared to teach through videos is remarkable, you not to refer different books for a subject. All things are covered in videos collectively with a better understanding for students.   \u2022 I suggest you do your own research before you start preparing for UPSC and then choose what\u2019s best for you.   \u2022 For your doubt clearance, you can put your doubts in official mail-id. It will be cleared within 24 hours(sometimes it might take more time, but your doubts will be cleared definitely).   \u2022 You can ask for demo videos. \u2022 You can inquire about the course and nature of the interaction between student as well as educators.  \u2022 After you to buy the pen drive course, you get the updated material on the site of Study IQ. \u2022 Study IQ never compromises with the quality and regularly updates the new material on the site.

            "answer_text": "Upsc civil services exams is considered to be one of the toughest competitive examination in India. So before one start preparing one should must have idea regarding pattern and shyllbus of the exam. This exam is followed by prelims then mains and finally interview. PRELIMS : 1.general stuies 2.csat MAINS 1.QUALIFYING PAPERS *one of the Indian language from the 8th schedule of constitution *English 2.PAPERS TO BE COUNTED FOR MERIT *EASSY *GS PAPER 1 (indian culture and heritage, history and geography of world and society ) *GS PAPER 2 (governance, constitution, polity, social justice and international relations ) *GS PAPER 3 (technology, economic, development, biodiversity, environment, security, disaster management ) *GS PAPER 4 (ethics, integrity and aptitude ) *OPTIONAL PAPER 1&2 Now one has clear vision of pattern and shyllbus. If we see the past year papers we can analyse that in prelims for gs paper 70%of questions fall under current affairs, so here it's important to have a strong grip on current affairs. And for csat it's is wisely to know some basic mathematics, passage understanding and reasoning questions .But if one want to be in merit list one should start preparing well for the mains. So one need to follow very strict disciplined routine. 1.Follow the right path. See before starting preparation it's important to watch some videos of the toppers and also talk to those who failed to crack this exam.by listening to them one gets a very clear vision of how to do and what to do.And analysing one calibre design own timetable. 2.Newspaper Reading newspaper is very important .when one is reading newspaper sincerely it's helps not only in gs paper but also in eassy and pass -ge solving. See suppose when you have completed reading one article then try to form certain questions regarding that articles and write answers to those questions in your words , this will improve your writing skills and also you will get one rough idea of time management. 3.Time management Time management is key to the success for this examination. One can manage time according to their interest and knowledge . 4.NCERT It's very important for the beginners to first go through ncert books rather than touching high level books.ncert books are like pillars easy to understand. So one should have read ncert books thoroughly. 5.Be wise at choosing optional subjects While all the general studies papers are top of mind but optional subjects have the potential to give one uplift and a decent score can turn things in one's favour. See if you have done your higher studies with arts paper and graduated with arts subjects and choose them because what you have studied earlier only that you have to study in advance manner. 6.Eassy writing The contribution of eassy paper sometimes called the game changer .eassy prepartion is based on your overall preparation but only thing is that what matters is your writing style and presentation. So make fix in your mind that twice in a week practice some topics .And try to write positive stuffs if possible. 7.understand Try to understand the text instead of mugging everything. This is a crux strategy. 8.making notes It's very important because one can go through these at last moments. And be wise at making notes and don't dare to copy the whole text from wherever you are studying. Suppose you studied about harappa civilization then try to recollect some points and if you missed something in one book and found it your reference books then write those stuffs.try to write in your own words which is easy to understand . 9.previous year papers Practice, practice, practice ",

            "answer_text": "Preparing for the UPSC exams is a long journey and I would say you won\u2019t reach anywhere without planning it. So first of all, draw up a study plan and decide how you are going to cover the huge syllabus, revise, take tests and mocks, and still have time for reading newspapers. Stick to a few sources to study but study the 3 to 4 times to be confident about each topic. Take notes as you study and make them very concise. You should be able to fit a chapter\u2019s worth of information in a page or less. Remember these notes are for you to save time when revising, so there\u2019s no point having elaborate notes and wasting time during revision. Revise, revise and revise. This is what is going to make you remember things, not multiple sources or a huge booklist. As you revise make your notes more and more concise. Finally, take tests and mocks. Take tests topic wise and subject wise as you finish topics and subject portions. More importantly track your progress as you take tests and progress through the preparation. Don\u2019t forget to check where you are making mistakes and correct them. Do not repeat the mistakes you make in your tests and for that, study in between the tests, don\u2019t just take test after test with no improvement. Minimize internet time. Don\u2019t get caught up in the internet. Allot a particular time for searching for content on the internet. You can do it as an activity during your break, but it should even then be strictly timed and limited. If you are going on the internet to look for or study something specific, make sure you get back to your studies once you are done. Don\u2019t count browsing the internet in your study hours. They don\u2019t count. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The UPSC Civil Services (Prelims) 2017 is all set to begin in about 60 days i.e. on June 18. As we all know the fact that revision is significantly important before jumping to the next topics, revision must be given utmost importance in the process of preparation. It's time for students to get a good hold on the topics they have studied. Here are few revision tips that can indeed help students notch up success in the examination: 1. Revise at least twice before exam: Map out your studies in a way so that adequate time is left for revision. It is equally important that no topic should be skipped while revising. Revise everything. 2. Basics have to be strong: Having a strong command over the basics is better than just knowing the entire subject. Numerous questions are asked from subjects like current affairs, Indian history, Geography, Indian Polity, Ecology, Biodiversity and Environment, hence they should be prepared in detail. Candidates tend to ignore prelims because the questions are objective in nature, but the questions are tricky and each question aims to check the knowledge of students in depth, and therefore, equal importance has to be given to the preliminary examination. 3. Solve mock test papers: Solving previous years' question papers zeroes out chances of errors in the examination and increases accuracy and speed. It provides the opportunity to get the hang of time management and have a clear idea of the paper. Accordingly, you can decide which section has to be attempted first. 4. Prepare notes: Notes help to revise concepts quickly when a candidate wrestles with time; so, it is advisable to prepare notes especially on topics which are tough for you. Making notes help you remember things in a better way. 5. Get familiarise with syllabus: Getting well attuned to the syllabus is the first step to set about systematic preparation. It provides the right direction to your preparation and helps you stave off covering irrelevant topics. 6. Selection of books: Most of the candidates get perplexed referring to countless books available in the market. Make your basics strong with NCERT books and count on standard book to farther go through relevant topics. 7. Strategise: General studies paper covers everything. It can be categorised as: Geography: Focus on physical geography and maps. Atlas is the best guide to help you with these topicsGeneral awareness: This embraces government schemes etc. Reading newspapers and guidebooks will help you a great dealHistory: Emphasise on Modern history, Freedom movement, Ancient India etc. A standard history guide covers all these topicsCurrent Affairs: Going through at least two standard newspapers (one English and the other, a vernacular) will keep you abreast of the current eventsCSAT: It covers a vast portion. Comprehension, logical reasoning, basic numeracy are to be prepared from standard book8. New topic: Don't read any new topic prior to the examination. 9. Proper sleep: All the students should note that sleep deprivation will take you nowhere; so, sleep well on the eve of the examination and don't go through any book. 10. Confidence: Note that confidence is the key to success in any examination so be high on confidence and do not panic during examination. ",

            "answer_text": "My Preparation began with a lot of thinking and understanding the requirement of the exam. That was the first thing. If one understands this then other things like resources and hours of studies will just be trivial matters. I have written a piece describing what I learned in last 3 years of my preparation. Hope it helps you to get a proper insight into the requirement of UPSC Prerequisites of Civil Services Preparation - What UPSC demands? There has been a lot of hung ho over preparation for UPSC Civil Services Exam in recent times, specially after coming up of so many coaching institutes. The institutes that sell you a package of essentials, needed to fulfil your dream of becoming an IAS or IPS (not Civil servant as such). But, this new approach of getting into the Civil Services needs a bit of inspection and there is no better way to start from the term itself - \u201cCivil Servant\u201d The term reveals a lot about the kind of job one can expect starting a career in Civil Services. Somewhere, this term has also been forgotten in the conundrum of some more appealing and glamorous terms like Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Police Services(IPS) etc. But, the term itself and specially the meaning attached to it has not lost it\u2019s relevance yet, specially if one wants to have a flourishing and rewarding career in Civil Services. Civil Services or Civil Servants need certain special attributes in order to sail through the career which can be rewarding at times, but punishing more than often. Some of those attributes can be - patience, humility, dedication to work, consistency, discipline, ability to plan and execute, to fall back on Plan B if Plan A does not succeed, managerial capabilities to manage work pressure and family (Work life balance), to mention some of them. If one undertakes a thorough analysis of the selection process of UPSC Civil Servants, the preparation phase itself will reveal a requirement of a number of these attributes. Discipline and consistency and dedication, which ultimately gives way to hard work are of utmost importance. One needs to plan through the preparation phase as what to study, when to study, what resources to opt for - all this to be broken into goals, objectives and short term targets. Gaining knowledge about the subject matter is not the actual requirement, as is the popular perception, but one of the components. If UPSC had to check the knowledge of a person, it would not have 20 questions of 12.5 marks in each of the papers, but like essay (which is indeed a test of knowledge), there would have been 2-3 questions with answers demanding detailed analysis of topics asked. The current pattern of UPSC reveals it\u2019s expectations as having good and sufficient view point on topics as well as performing to your level best within a time constraint - a pressure situation. UPSC through the selection process, actually wants candidates to develop the above mentioned traits. For this exact reason, the selection process has been spanned for 2 years approx and 4-6 chances have been given to each candidate. Some candidates may have most of the desired attributes naturally and thus can pick up the missing ones in a period of 1 year and get qualified in 1st attempt. Some may not have most of the attributes and may take a period of 4-5 years to develop those and get through the exam. This also puts much focus on self-introspection. Until and unless one knows herself, one knows what is lacking in her, she cannot improve on that and build herself to the level of civil servant. Taking the above arguments into perspective, the role of coaching institutions in today\u2019s scenario seems doubtful. They make you followers and not leaders. They give you a plan, they give you resources, they give you timelines and ultimately one just follows what they say. What about the self-initiative capacity of a civil servant? What about the leadership quality of a civil servant? Everything goes in vane. Its not at all an argument that candidates will not be selected by following such approach (this is actually a fallacy in UPSC selection process which UPSC is trying to revive by constantly changing the patterns and question types and decreasing the role of coaching over time), but even one gets selected, he/she may not have all the essential attributes of being a civil servant and that may cost dearly when one starts the career. The bureaucracy is not seeing any substantial change in recent times mainly because of this reason, may be. To sum up, if one wants to join civil services, and one\u2019s aim is not just to pass an exam, but to serve the masses and have a fulfilling career in civil services, it is of utmost importance that one\u2019s focus should be towards developing a personality that matches the requirement of civil services job. Coaching can work as a guidance, but not enabler or planner. They should be used to the minimum and onus should lie on the candidate him/her self. Thanks for reading. ",

Gabbar\u2019s enlightening words may have had a lasting impact on hard-core moviegoers but it continues to have some pretty far-reaching influence well outside the Bollywood domain. One such unlikely sphere includes the young women and men who decide to appear, in the hopes of qualifying, one of the hardest exams in the country \u2013 the UPSC Civil Services Examination (CSE). Why? \u2018Coz they are aware of the handful number who actually end up clearing the CSE and the even smaller pinch sized number that make the merit list to be selected into the top CSE contenders \u2013 the IAS, IPS and IFS services \u2013 from the lakhs who appear for the yearlong examination. And yet, there is no place for any fear and intimidation. The only possible way, they know, to have a successful shot at clearing the CSE is giving it a wholehearted preparation attempt. In this article, we will discuss some of the essential recipes that have worked in favor of previous successful candidates and the best preparation material and books they used. Every candidate, as you might obviously have guessed, has a unique preparatory style. What may be good for one may fail miserably for another? However, knowing that one has to at least begin with a formulaic baseline, here are some tips to help you get started to develop your own fashion of studying for the exam. Best Books and Preparation Material for UPSC Civil Services exam : Visit for best UPSC Books How to prepare for the UPSC CSE Exam Here are some tips to crack the UPSC Civil Services Exam and become an IAS, IPS, or IFS officer. Watch your Routine One of the biggest roadblocks for CSE is time management. The exam is conducted over three stages \u2013 the Preliminary, Main, and the Interview. Each has a pretty large syllabus and the exam extends over a year. Most aspirants are full-time students or office-goers who have to schedule their preparation within the time they can manage outside of their regular routine. Being serious about the exam requires a steady focus, and thus a separate time-table to ensure a consistent approach towards assimilating the vast amount of information for the exam. This time management is only possible if the candidates are able to set up a schedule and fix deadlines for when they intend to cover the various portions of the syllabus. For instance, studying and making notes for at least a few hours every day for 10 days to cover the basic concepts of Geography. The process and the individual timelines may vary but working out the strategy for time management is essential to everyone. Last-minute cramming has hardly, or rather rarely, worked for most CSE candidates. It is also important to realize that a lot of the time to study will actually involve revisiting concepts you have already studied. So, set aside time for regular revisions and workout your brain regularly. Understand the Exam Pattern The UPSC website clearly states the intention of their test. It is to find individuals who need not have a specialized in-depth understanding of the topics but rather a comprehensive awareness of the history, culture, geography, and other functional aspects of India and a bit of the world. Questions may get specialized in the Optional Subject papers, but only as much as somewhat more than an undergraduate level, ie at an Honor\u2019s level. In the case of Engineering, Medicine, and Law, an undergraduate understanding is sufficient. Familiarize yourself with the extent of the syllabus, so you can start structuring your study plan accordingly. The syllabus, for each section, is detailed on the UPSC Website.

In the case of Engineering, Medicine, and Law, an undergraduate understanding is sufficient. Familiarize yourself with the extent of the syllabus, so you can start structuring your study plan accordingly. The syllabus, for each section, is detailed on the upsc website. Plan a Structured Study The volume of information, towards an exhaustive preparation, may seem intimidating. Therefore, it is easier to structure the study plan concentrating on building on the basic concepts, usually from the recommended NCERT books. It is a good idea to find multiple source materials, while not overwhelming your schedule with too many books. Candidates often even refer to online material for information. The secret, as many veterans have mentioned before, is to comfortably understand the basic concepts without taking the aid of rote learning schemes. \u2018Coz memorizing may land you in trouble by virtue of the vastness of the syllabus. Practice Testing It is essential to keep up a regular habit of writing, reading, analysing, and examining, a content. Many successful candidates have stressed on the importance of having regular discussions and debates with their friends and colleagues, on topics associated with the syllabus and current affairs. It provides an excellent practice for logically presenting your views while also helping you to understand the depth of your insights. There are many free mock tests available online to examine your preparation in a timed fashion. These can help in getting all your gears in action as required on the day of the exam. Although the exam coordinators are known to almost never repeat questions from previous years, the previous question papers do provide a glimpse of the type of questions preferred by them. You can judge the difficulty level, relevance to the prescribed syllabus, depth of required understanding, analytical and logical complexity, and scoring, by revising your performance on questions that have been asked before. Revision is a Priority The length and breadth of the CSE exam requires regular revisits to the study material. Your preparation schedule should cover the time needed to revise the read topics multiple times. It is often useful to highlight important passages, or make notes, for a quick look close to the exam date. Make sure you have such a provision for the sake of efficiency. Updated Current Affairs A lot of questions are associated with the candidate\u2019s general awareness of topical affairs in the world, with emphasis on the happenings in India. Get in the habit of reading a multitude of daily newspapers to stay abreast of current topics. Various sources recommend The Hindu, Economist, The Indian Express, All India Radio News, Parliamentary discussions, regional language newspapers, and magazines like Yojana, India and Manorama Year Books. Stay Healthy and Engaged Finally, set aside time to look up from your books and interact with other people. The CSE exams are taxing on not just the candidate but also the people around them. It is important to not ignore your communication skills and your general emotional well-being. Eat and sleep well, engage yourself in other activities, and don\u2019t let the weight of the exam stress you out. The UPSC CSE exam is designed so that a candidate\u2019s efforts, dedication, strategizing, planning, logic, analytical powers, and overall quick thinking, are rewarded. In that sense, every candidate\u2019s life experiences also play a role in their preparation. How else would you explain a syllabus that essentially tests the ability to absorb the political, cultural, historical, and geographical, environment that one lives in? The actual CSE preparation then simply boils down to polishing on the knowledge that you would have anyway imbibed as a student and a citizen of the country. So, don\u2019t dwell on the vastness of the syllabus but rather concentrate on how to get to know your world a little better. ",

India's leading civil service is believed, IAS is one of the three arms of All India Services with Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFS).

IAS is part of the permanent bureaucracy of the country and is an integral part of the Indian government's executive.

On confirmation of service, an IAS officer serves a probationary period as a sub-divisional magistrate. After completing this probation, an executive administrative role in the district is in the form of a district magistrate and collector, which runs in some states for 16 years for many years. After this tenure, an officer can be promoted as a departmental commissioner for the entire state division. On receiving the top scale, the IAS officers can lead government departments or ministries. In these roles, the IAS officers represent the country in international bilateral and multilateral negotiations.

In fact, their education is adequate, but when I approached the students who bought the common administration course, they felt so hopeless and terrible about the other workforce significantly after paying around 70,000. In the remote possibility that its employees are so magnificent, at that moment why the condemnation doubts and tells garbage stories and draws attention to different fundamentals. 2. All 5-star surveys given on Facebook are for adherents to free substances. Try not to believe that this is the person who bought the course. It is a great invention of him to get notoriety. 3. He says he will always be in touch at any time, even At the time when one of my colleagues sent him an email for little specialized help and uncertainty. It seems that no one has reacted so far. 4. He never offers criticism of the composite responses, yet he gloats through the web-based network media that remedies and guides at every point and level. 5. Wrap all suction rules and guidelines. Truly, right after paying the cash, he begins to discover every crazy principle, which never says to buy a course, for example, arriving to our online classes only from a PC or device and web, if not, it seems that you have some product that will end our entry accordingly. In any case, when one of my colleagues sent him an email regarding the ordinary explanation. He did not react to it. In a significant number of the recordings clarifying about the course, he only points out that we can get entry from anywhere, and so on. Truly, in case you have put this limitation to stay away from miscellaneous usage, it is completely fine. But what is the problem with offering a reaction to the substitute? (What the heck is this ???, in the event that I go to my office or other station. How could I stream my PC? At that time, what is the need for this online course called \"faulty\"? For what method can you use the design to be available from anywhere? 6. At first you will conduct some live classes and then transfer some recorded videos. That's it. Making us all fools. 8. Exceptionally expensive course cost, however the substance is poor. In fact, even in the physical study room, the load is damn less. Just watch Plutus Academy you will feel that luxurious in the content. 9. Towards the end of the course, you will discover a wave of tests. 10. Only he fakes the guys in the limited-time video with his engaging words. Note-No, where I am identified with some type of contenders of this page or some other. I am a conventional applicant planning serious tests. I'm simply giving this audit to spare in any case, almost victimless and saving your huge bucks. In order that others can take advantage of it.

You have to be patient, hard working ,be aware of the thing around yourself and increase your curiosity. UPSC is all about enhancing your knowledge, skills and your overall personality. In very simple steps first you have to acquire knowledge then analyse it multidimensionally, you must have your own opinion about a issue or topic and finally you have to present it in your own words in writing and in oral. And believe me you will be in the merit list one day. This is all the UPSC need in all its tiers :: Prelims : your knowledge base Mains : your opinion in writing Interview : reflection of your opinion,stand and knowledge in your overall personality. Knowing or unknowingly if you are working hard and are consistent you will acquire the skill that are needed in bureaucracy. Listing some of them, general awareness and opinion on different issues and general knowledge about history and geography, management of different opinion or tasks simultaneously, empathy, morale upliftment and be a proud Indian. It may not be original sometimes but you have /will acquire it subsequently to fit in Indian Bureaucracy and that is what the selection process of UPSC does to the aspirants. I have been preparing for the services and I have read various answers in quora to the same question. They discuss various strategy and book list and to my belief they are cent percent right. Therefore I will not be repeating those again in my answer but I ll discuss some basic tenants that I feel are necessary. For static portion read NCERT and basic standard books. Read one book many times, don\u2019t go for every book mentioned in the list. Choose your weapon and sharp it again and again and again :) .For dynamic portion read one newspaper, analyse it , see some editorial discussion videos on youtube after reading it beforehand. Refer some magazines or RSTV Debates on topics/ issues you feel important.Practice previous year papers and the syllabus should be very clear to you.Write answers everyday. Actual preparation starts from the day you start writing an essay or answer or short notes on issue or topics on routine basis. Before it , it is all time-pass or in proper words just a warm up.Make short notes to revise. AS short and simple as you can so that the whole topic/ issue is revised in the least time possible.At last be very consistent, patient it takes time and sweat. And most importantly believe and appreciate whatever you study, it will retain. Hope I have answered the query satisfactorily. Sorry for any grammatical mistakes, I did\u2019nt had time to check it. Thank for reading!! ",

There are various methods used by aspirants to manage their consistency level. These may be; A strong reason:- Every aspirant possesses a personal reason that why he wants to crack this exam which motivates him/her to clear the same. The reason can vary. For some it may be power, perks,fame or money and for other it may be their parent\u2019s wish and service to the nation. This makes them consistent and patient.There comes a point in the life of every aspirant when panic and fear of failure haunts them but then there is a much stronger reason to supress all these negative vibes and gives them the required energy to get back to their work. I have met some of the aspirants and when I asked them the Same question, they replied that they sometimes listen motivational songs which acts like a recharge fuel and gives them the required power to continue. Since the examination almost takes a year for completion, it becomes obvious to become consistent and patient and this is what UPSC is all about. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I presume you have enough time. No general strategy is applicable to all. There are three essential requirements; good in academics, good in general awareness and good in language , that is , communication. The last two are long term investments. So one can start building them from undergraduate level. Cultivate good habits. Determination and perseverance are critical, keep your motivation high. Keep good company and avoid time wasting activity . Do take time out for relaxation but limit this. I presume that you are still studying. So, focus on your studies but earmark some time for language and general awareness. Follow time management skills. One of basics for this to devide the time into quantas, which I call periods, consisting of 30 minutes each. Assess the optimum time available to you for them. You should be able to manage at least 10\u201315 periods a week in addition to your studies. Now make a plan. Keep separate note books for each and take notes. For language, read good prose, anything that interests you. My favourites in entertainment, were Agatha Christie and Wodehouse and Graham Greene , Aldous Huxley, and Bertrand Russell for serious reading. Focus on vocabulary and usage. Write regularly, anything that you fancy, letters, diary or articles. For general studies , during this period and later, read at least one good newspaper and one news magazine . Read the op-ed page regularly. Keep track of current trends in science and technology and economic developments. Full time preparation should start about a year in advance. About 3000\u20133500 hours of time is required. You will get a lot of guidance in this from professionals and amateurs. Most people join coaching classes. Choose wisely, if you do. In general, time management is important. Take care of your health. ",

If any coaching centre suggests a strategy and claims it will help you to succeed, believe me, they are making huge money by conning you. Coaching centers, at best, help in flagging some relevant issues in a given subject and may provide some relevant material on these issues. Upto that point, there won't be much problem. If you are offered a preparation strategy by these coaches or coaching centers, they are making you a sissy. Don't allow it. UPSC thinking and reach is on a different plane. No coaching centre in India will ever be able to break into to \u201cthinking\u201d of UPSC. UPSC is far far ahead of all the coaching centers put together. CSE is a highly individual centric examination. Acquire basic knowledge in relevant subjects. Read and understand upsc previous questions. Write your own answers to questions. Reduce reading. Practice writing and writing and writing. Workout your own winning formula. Enforce rigorous self discipline. Your name will figure in the final select list. ",

We all are well-aware of the adage \"The early bird catches the worm\".

Adopting a long term approach has proven to be effective and also saves previous youth-years of many candidates. As an early bird, you will be better equipped and oriented when you actually wet your feet in the UPSC waters.  But that doesn't mean that those who start late can't clear the IAS exam! This does not imply that those who start late are at fault and cannot clear the exam. All it requires is perseverance and a fervent desire to get through the Civil Services Examination.

I mean, at least I feel that if you don\u2019t have an answer to the WHY here, you will never be able to apply the answers of HOW to your life! Before asking this question, ask WHY DO I WANT TO PREPARE FOR UPSC? And find the most convincing answer, not for anybody else, but for yourself! And mind you, it shouldn\u2019t be because \u201cpapa ne bola, mummy ne bola, or sharma ji ka beta bhi IAS hai\u201d! Because, to be honest, none of that is going to help you in sustaining the pressure that comes with the preparation of an exam as demanding as UPSC CSE! It should come from within, you should want that life for yourself, you should feel that you belong there and this exam is the path to reach there, then and only then, you will be able to put the answers of HOW to reality! So, once you\u2019ve figured out the WHY part, so many wonderful people have answered the how-part for you! Just take inspiration from any one of them and come up with your own strategy! Remember, it is never the borrowed dream that you can carry and never the borrowed strategy that can work wonders for you! So, take inspiration from all the answers and come up with your own strategy, that will work the best for you! All the best ",

The Civil Services exam is the doorway to exciting careers in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), Indian Revenue Service (IRS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and more. With lakhs of people attempting the elite services examination and only a few hundred seats typically available, the competition is fierce. To beat the competition, it\u2019s important to prepare thoroughly and give yourself the maximum chance of success. The Civil Services exam takes place in 3 stages preliminary exam (Prelims) consisting of objective-type multiple choice questions, the mains exam which is an essay-type written exam, and a personal interview. The 3 stages are separated by a gap of 1-2 months. Given below are some major UPSC Preparation Tips which a candidate can follow to score high in the exam: Mock Test Papers or UPSC Question Papers:Mock Papers are an essential part of regular preparations for successful candidates.Writing mock tests not only helps you to revise your IAS Syllabus but also helps to increase your speed to solve the exam in time.

Putting less effort as compared to GS Paper I, aspirants used to score high and clear prelims. On the basic level, covering every subject of the UPSC main exam is the best approach to clear the Prelims test. It's not recommended to give priority to any particular book or area thinking that questions will come from that source. Likewise, one must not miss the easy questions from traditional subjects like Polity, History, Geography, History, and Economics. Current affairs are also important to prepare as they are definitely asked, other than that latest schemes and bills launched by the government are also valuable. 4.IAS Prelims cum IAS Main Approach: Even though the type of questions asked in UPSC Prelims and Main are different, but there are also many areas where one can find some kind of similarity in the questions. For GS Paper I, an ideal strategy suggests covering GS Main and Prelims syllabus in detail first that gives the concept clarity about all major topics. 5.Time Management: All you need to do is to manage your time in a way that you can easily cover your decided syllabus and gets proper rest and sleep at the same time. One must note that you do not need books or notes on bulk to completely go through but only a limited no. of good books and a deep study of that study material. It is very must important for a student to get proper rest and sleep. 6.Mental Peace is the key: All your efforts and hard work go in vain if you lose your cool on the peace of mind, otherwise you get confused and selects the wrong answer and even takes more time in solving a question then what is actually needed.

            "answer_text": "Before starting to prepare for UPSC, keep in mind the reason (a genuine one) for which you want to clear this exam. Because the syllabus is so vast that you'll need a strong reason which will force you to prepare well for the exam. If you don't have any strong reason then stop reading further. If you got the perfect reason then you must start reading NCERT books from 6th to 12th std. They are the base of your preparation. Make sure to complete these books as early as possible. So that you'll have enough time to read and revise standard books. Don't look for shortcuts. UPSC doesn't expect you to complete 100% syllabus but expects 100% accuracy in what you know. Give at least a year for the preparation. Also keep yourself updated with current affairs and new policies. Even after all this if you fail, then don't worry and give it another try for sake of your \u201cSTRONG REASON\" which I mentioned above (got my point of having strong reason?). I hope this will help you boost your confidence. Keep Learning n sharing! All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "The Civil Services exam is the doorway to exciting careers in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), Indian Revenue Service (IRS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and more. With lakhs of people attempting the elite services examination and only a few hundred seats typically available, the competition is fierce. To beat the competition, it\u2019s important to prepare thoroughly and give yourself the maximum chance of success. The Civil Services exam takes place in 3 stages; preliminary exam (Prelims) consisting of objective-type multiple choice questions, the main examwhich is an essay-type written exam, and a personal interview. The 3 stages are separated by a gap of 1-2 months. When Is The Right Time To Start Preparing For Civil Services? Some aspirants begin preparing for the Civil Services directly from high school and others start studying only 7 months before the exams. The ideal time to start preparing is in the last few years of your graduation degree as you can attempt the exam only once you graduate. How To Begin Your UPSC Preparation You have the conviction, you have the passion and a career in Civil Service is your goal. Now, comes the path to your goal. To begin your preparation for the Civil Services Exam, start reading NCERT books for Political Science, History, Economics and Geography from Class 6-10 levels, based on the Civil Services official syllabus. Additionally, you may utilise reference books. A few good ones for Prelims are: History India\u2019s Ancient Past by R. S. SharmaHistory of Medieval India by Satish ChandraHistory of Modern India by Bipan ChandraIndia\u2019s Struggle For Independence by Bipan ChandraGeography Geography of India by Majid HusainOxford School AtlasEconomics Indian Economy by Ramesh SinghPolitical Science Indian Polity by M. LakshmikanthGet in the habit of thoroughly reading newspapers on a daily basis, for at least 2-3 hours, and compare the current events with theoretical knowledge studied in Political Science, History, Geography and Economics. Prepare personalized notes, focusing on your weak points and how you remember things best. Take help of all the resources in your power, whether it\u2019s aid from former teachers, online videos, guidebooks, and coaching centres. Be sure to use your time wisely, study with full concentration and test yourself at each step of the way. Make revision your best friend and be confident in your abilities. I\u2019ll talk about the specific preparation for each of the 3 UPSC stages in the coming sections. Let\u2019s talk about two other pressing concerns first. ",

            "answer_text": "UPSC being the toughest exam in the country, requires more than just preparation. It requires both strategy and preparation. UPSC exam consists of 3 stages: preliminary exam (objective)main exam (subjective)InterviewNow the most important question as to how to prepare for UPSC: First, go through the syllabus as it will help you in understanding what to read and what not to. The questions asked in the exam are always within the syllabus and hence keeping a close eye on syllabus is fundamental. Second, choose your study material wisely and the best source to get clarity and a good hold on various subjects are the NCERT books (from class VI to class XII). Third, Time management is important so don\u2019t waste your time too much if you are not understanding a topic instead go to YouTube and watch the videos of that particular topic. For math watch the videos of EXADEMY[1] they explain each and every topic in detail and are quick to clear your doubts if you have any or you can watch their live classes with affordable fees ( my friend got herself enrolled in EXADEMY and where ever she goes she always gives good reviews and recommends people to watch their videos). Fourth, stay updated with what is going around in the world. Watch news channels( like NDTV and not news like times now, Republic tv), many people would say to read newspapers but I would recommend you to read magazines instead or watch STUD talks of EXADEMY( it is basically a talk session on various issues and happenings in the country) so you can give importance to other subjects as well, many toppers of UPSC don\u2019t read newspapers as it consumes a lot of time. Fifth, keeping giving mock tests and analyze where you are going wrong. Give 2- 3 mock papers in a week the more you test yourself the more you will gain confidence, and get familiar with the pattern. Last, but not the least, is proper care your health. One must exercise or take a walk, to remain healthy, as well as maintain higher concentration during study hours. All the very best for your UPSC exam. Footnotes[1] https://www.exademy.in/",

            "answer_text": "Here are the correct strategy for preparing for UPSC, the most toughest exam in india. Now let start the strategy points: As we all know the fact that revision is significantly important before jumping to the next topics, revision must be given utmost importance in the process of preparation. It's time for students to get a good hold on the topics they have studied. Here are few revision tips that can indeed help students notch up success in the examination: 1. Revise at least twice before exam: Map out your studies in a way so that adequate time is left for revision. It is equally important that no topic should be skipped while revising. Revise everything. 2. Basics have to be strong: Having a strong command over the basics is better than just knowing the entire subject. Numerous questions are asked from subjects like current affairs, Indian history, Geography, Indian Polity, Ecology, Biodiversity and Environment, hence they should be prepared in detail. Candidates tend to ignore prelims because the questions are objective in nature, but the questions are tricky and each question aims to check the knowledge of students in depth, and therefore, equal importance has to be given to the preliminary examination. 3. Solve mock test papers: Solving previous years' question papers zeroes out chances of errors in the examination and increases accuracy and speed. It provides the opportunity to get the hang of time management and have a clear idea of the paper. Accordingly, you can decide which section has to be attempted first. 4. Prepare notes: Notes help to revise concepts quickly when a candidate wrestles with time; so, it is advisable to prepare notes especially on topics which are tough for you. Making notes help you remember things in a better way. 5. Get familiarise with syllabus: Getting well attuned to the syllabus is the first step to set about systematic preparation. It provides the right direction to your preparation and helps you stave off covering irrelevant topics. 6. Selection of books: Most of the candidates get perplexed referring to countless books available in the market. Make your basics strong with NCERT books and count on standard book to farther go through relevant topics. 7. Strategise: General studies paper covers everything. It can be categorised as: Geography: Focus on physical geography and maps. Atlas is the best guide to help you with these topicsGeneral awareness: This embraces government schemes etc. Reading newspapers and guidebooks will help you a great dealHistory: Emphasise on Modern history, Freedom movement, Ancient India etc. A standard history guide covers all these topicsCurrent Affairs: Going through at least two standard newspapers (one English and the other, a vernacular) will keep you abreast of the current eventsCSAT: It covers a vast portion. Comprehension, logical reasoning, basic numeracy are to be prepared from standard book8. New topic: Don't read any new topic prior to the examination. 9. Proper sleep: All the students should note that sleep deprivation will take you nowhere; so, sleep well on the eve of the examination and don't go through any book. 10. Confidence: Note that confidence is the key to success in any examination so be high on confidence and do not panic during examination. Remember one thing ,you can do it. THANKS FOR READING. HAVE A GREAT FUTURE :) By Noman Ahmed. ",

There is no definite answer to the most commonly asked questions, such as how many hours an CSE person need to put in every day? It will differ from person to person so let us look at it from a general perspective.TIME REQUIRED : Many Experts believe that aggressive preparation for 10 to 12 months is must. Ideally you should target two subjects every day. as most of the questions are asked mostly from Class 6 to 12 standard books. So preparing notes and devoting 10 to 12 hours before a year of exam is believed to be sufficient.",

Preparation strategy. 1-Take out the UPSC syllabus,read it and try to understand it. 2-Take previous years'question papers and see how the questions were asked(both for Prelims as well as Mains). 3-Read the basic NCERT'S of Geography, History, Environment,Polity, Economics, Science.(Std 6 to 12\u2032th are considered as basic NCERT'S). These books will give complete idea of that subjects in a easy way. 4-Keep referring syllabus and previous years\u2019 question papers while reading NCERT. 5-When you will complete reading either subject's NCERT. Let us assume that you have completed reading Indian Polity's NCERT then go for it's standard reference book like Indian Polity by M.Laxmikanth. 6-Read atleast one news paper like The Hindu,The Indian Express.. 7-You can also join coaching classes if you need. Coaching classes will not ensure your selection but coaching will make things somewhat easier and will also help in solving your doubts. There are many students which were selected without joining any coaching classes so it is not mandatory. 8-Try to read only reference books rather referring any local class notes or local books. Keep it to only one reference book for one subject.(In some case you may have to go for another reference book.) This is for initial stage of preparation.All the Best..!! ",

I am sharing my preparation strategy. I started preparing one year before attempting Prelims. I made a time \u2013table which I strictly followed no matter what. I am sharing time \u2013table https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-daily-routine-or-how-do-did-you-manage-your-daily-time-for-UPSC-preparation/answer/Bornali-Das-15 I made monthly, weekly and daily target for studies. PRELIMS STRATEGY Preparation Guide Smart study + Daily revision+ Solving Mcqs regularly = Key to success in CSE Studying too many books is nothing but waste of time which leads to failure\u201d I studied very selectively. I did not read books cover to cover, instead made crisp notes for revision. I took three months to cover prelims syllabus. Revise, revise and revise. This is the philosophy I followed. I am sharing my Prelims Booklist Booklist \u2013 1. Polity \u2013 Laxmikanth 2. Culture \u2013 Nitin Singhania Notes 3. History \u2013 Spectrum Modern India 4. Economics \u2013 NCERTS( Macro Economics & Economic Development),Indian Economy by Ramesh Singh ,Economic survey,Govt Schemes,Etc 5. Geography \u2013 NCERTS Class 11 & 12 6. Environment \u2013 Shankar IAS 7. Current Affairs \u2013Hindu and monthly magazines 8. Vishals Publications Prelims Solved Papers 1995 to 2018. I practiced atleast 40\u201345 tests for Prelims .One can opt for any good test series The more one practices MCQs,the more is his chances of clearing the exam. MAINS STRATEGY Read-Make Notes-Revise-Write Answers- Revise Optional: I took coaching from Upendra Gaur Sir for Sociology . Optional is the most scorable in Mains CSE I compiled books and coaching class materials and made one precise notes which was very easy to revise. Once done, I revised those notes thoroughly and started writing answers. First I attempted previous year\u2019s paper and then regular mock tests. I revised Optional 5 times. ESSAY Paper: Next most scoring paper is Essay. I Practise essay writing in an organised manner within a stipulated time. I refered can refer Shubhra Ranjan Mam\u2019s Essay Book. Adding Quotes also helped me in getting a good score. ETHICS: I refered LEXICON and practice many case studies everyday atleast one. GS-1, 2 & 3 I made notes for each topics mentioned in the syllabus. CURRENT AFFAIRS I made notes and revised them properly. Last but not the least to clear Mains it is mandatory to practise answer writing and get it evaluated by any faculty or Mentor. ",

            "answer_text": "As around 130 days are let for Prelims, the best way to go about preparing should be based on proper strategy, target based study and timely completion of the targets. And all this must be coupled with daily question solving. thing we must have in mind is the time crunch. So based upon above features there can be many best ways to suit an individual. But still according to me the best strategy for UPSC preparation at this time must be as follows: one should divide the complete syllabus of prelims subject wise and then based on level of preperation each subject must be divided into topics to be covered in specific number of days.now for every day select atleast 2 subjects and set a target for covering the designated topics.at the end of the day solve some question based on the topics you have read.then at the end of week revise all the topics you covered during the week of both the subject and without fail solve more question.if you do this you will have covered your whole syllabius more than once before prelims(which is a must).This the best strategy at this point of time as when there is time crunch one is overwhelmed with what to do and what not to do and in this confusion one ends up doing nothing. So i would suggest do this target based study to be in a position to clear the prelims this year itself. But there may be a chance you would not be able to analyse the syllabus properly and properly divide syllabus into topics, in that case take help of some senior or may be coaching. I think online sites like insights offer this type of program. But i personally i would suggest you to approach some offline coaching centre which can keep a personal check on you if you dont fulfill targets on daily basis. Vajiram offers test series where target is given for every test that may be also helpful. There is also a coaching Jigyasa IAS which offers personal mentorship and target based study, that might be particularly helpful for you at this point of time to prepare. I think they run online program for it also. But whaterver you do dont waste your time running here and there as time will just fly away. So organise yourself and get down to study. All the Best.. ",

Study And Revision Should Be Part Of Your Syllabus: The vast syllabus of civil service examination can leave anybody in confusion. Hence, you need to plan your studies for a day and for a week. You should plan your study method in such a way that you should be able to read and revise the prescribed subjects as many times as possible or till you feel confident about your preparation. Focus On Basic Concepts: Since those who aspire to help in nation building through civil services need to know what exactly it takes to pass these exams, they should be well aware of the country and significant developments. Thorough knowledge about your country's culture, society and language is an inevitable requirement to be well prepared for the exams. So the preparation does not mean you should be a book-worm but an aspirant with the practical knowledge of his surroundings.  Make notes: As you go through the syllabus, make quick notes. This will help you in revision and better understanding of concerned topics. Are coaching classes necessary? One very simple fact that every civil services aspirant should know is that if one is not mentally prepared and determined enough to understand a subject to the core, one cannot succeed even by attending coaching classes. Those who believe that only coaching classes can help them with useful tips for preparation can join. However, it is always better to study each and every subject in detail with proper understanding instead of preparing for name's sake. Keep Yourself Updated With Current Affairs: Civil services exams are there to test an aspirant's in-depth knowledge about the society he/she is lives in. It is a common myth among the candidates that they should be well aware of what is happening at the international level. Knowledge about international events is also required, but knowing one's own village, district, state and country should be considered as the foundation for one's preparation. This does help in serving one's country very well. Reading Newspapers: The moment one fills up the form for civil services exams, one is advised to read newspapers regularly. Reading English newspapers is advised with a lot of emphasis. However, it is quite important for the civil services exams aspirants to read English as well as other regional language newspapers. The idea here is to be well informed rather than acquiring limited knowledge. One newspaper may provide a news with limited information whereas the same news may be given with a lot of details in another. So be hungry for more than one newspaper to be well informed. Practice Previous Years Question Papers: Solving previous years question papers is important. It is advised to study at least 5 years solved question papers. This kind of activity gives you an idea about the structure of the questions papers and what kind of questions can be asked in the coming exams. Solving question papers of previous years or at least glancing at them may appear a tedious task, but it is a pain worth undergoing. It does boost your confidence and give you a clear picture of what exactly you are going to see in the question papers of upcoming exams. Many civil services related sites have useful question banks at your disposal. So go ahead and utilize them to the fullest and you will experience the leap your personality takes from being blank to being focused and confident. Focus On Your Personality And Communication Skills: Interview is one of the most important parts of the examination. It is vital for you to convey your thoughts clearly to the interviewers. Hence, concentrate on polishing your communication skills and body language. Some candidates are blessed with such skills. And some need to practice to become excellent communicators of their ideas. Candidates with no communication skills can approach those, who have already appeared for the civil services exams, to take useful tips from them. Be Honest To Yourself: The interview part of the civil services exams is not designed to judge one's expertise on a subject. However, a candidate has to speak from the heart or answer all the questions with honesty. There is a common misunderstanding among the candidates that if they speak lies about their hobbies just to get through the interview, it will never help them. The interviewers are there not just to ask questions but also to evaluate a candidate's personality and ability to have a clear understanding that a 'no' is a 'no' it cannot be replaced with a 'yes' and vice versa. So you have to be yourself, and must face the exam and interview honestly. ",

            "answer_text": "Before getting into it, There are some questions, you must answer them viz., First, Why do you want to be a civil servant? Because it is like a jungle, either you have to hunt or to be hunted. Without reason of LIVING, you\u2019ll not be able to fight. Second, Do you have second thought in your mind? If you have any other plan in your mind then it\u2019ll divert you from your goal at some time. So be with your internal motivation instead of external and once you decided, do not let anyone change your decision. Then What is UPSC? First read syllabus 2\u20133 time and also check previous year question papers. Select your optional subject wisely. If possible, choose your graduation subject or any other which you like to read more. Always keep your syllabus with you while studying and do not read the content which is not relevant for your exam. Read selected books and notes but revise again and again. Start with NCERT books and newspaper. Dont waste your time thinking about old or new ncert or shall I study subjectwise or classwise. Pickup any & Follow whichever is okay for you. \u2018Your excuse will eat your time\u2019 After completing ncert\u2019s Study static portion because if you couldn\u2019t choose your optional subject then it\u2019ll help you to understand your interest. If you don\u2019t know books, google currently selected officers interviews and follow whichever you want to follow. Essay, current affairs and optional are the important factors. As your time will pass you\u2019ll understand the material ( which) and time (how much) need to complete your task. Join test series because it will help you to record your progress and it will also help you to focus on your weaknesses. Good Luck. ",

Another important feature that adds toughness of the exam is the syllabus, as it covers a diverse range of subject, unlike many other Exams.   How to prepare for IAS while working? With less time in your hands, time management is crucial to your preparations. Some to-do list Set a schedule as per your liking and stick to it Find people who are in your situation or in your organization and socialize with them to utilize that time for discussions. You will thus have time to chill with friends who are serious about the IAS exam. It will also fulfill your social needs and keep you stress-free. Look for notes and study material that are short and effective. But some topics you will have to do in-depth studies. Listen to the short news and do not waste time listening to unnecessary discussion-based news unless the topic demands it. Use memory techniques that speed up your learning. Frequently practice giving tests and writing answers. That will work as revision and practice.

Start studying NCERT from class 6 to 12 .NCERT books are written in simple way so that everyone can understand it . Start from class 6th NCERT and read history, geography, polity etc. If you have problems in reading NCERT then you can also watch YouTube video to clear your concept. There's one YouTube channel name EXAMRACE where you can get summary of all chapters of NCERT so it will help you to understanding basics. Start reading newspaper or watch videos on YouTube for current affairs so that you can get idea of what to read or what not to read in newspaper. Atleast give 1 month to fully understand newspaper and don't try to remember or memorise things just read once get essence of every topic that would be sufficient initially. After doing all this , go for higher level book like Bipin chandra for History, laxmikant for Polity, Ramesh singh for economics and so on. Start writing answers also. Whenever you read any topic , create your own question and write that topic in answer format so that you're answer writing also get improve. These all things you can't do in 1 day or 1 week it requires a lot of time and you still have lot of time for preparation. So , start from now and don't try to study 8 hours a day directly initially study only few hours and gradually gradually increase your study hour . You can study as per your wish but be regular and consistent. Gap in studies should be avoided. So best of luck for your UPSC journey. \u201cStart by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible\u201d ",

Revise every subject - On the basic level, covering every subject of civil services preliminary exam is the best approach to clear prelims now. It's not recommended to give priority to any particular book or area thinking that questions will come from that source. Likewise, it's equally important not to miss easy questions from traditional subjects like Economics, Geography, History and Polity. At least, brushing up NCERT books and previous years' question papers would be a good idea if you are time-crunched. 2. Take, Clear mock exams - Writing mock tests arm you with confidence which is the key to success in any examination. 3. Invest on the right books - Picking up recommended books and right study material is of utmost importance. The NCERT books are thought to be must-read by experts as well as successful candidates. 4. Follow Prelims cum Mains Approach - An integrated prelims-cum-mains approach is catching on among civil services aspirants which rely on clearing prelims and mains in a single attempt.

            "answer_text": "First of all make your LONG TERM PLAN. It must be with you to compare it with your daily plan and match your speed accordingly. Then divide it(long term plan)in shorter pieces. Suppose if you want to complete Union government in one week then divide it like reading each chapter and making notes each day. On sunday you can revise the whole unit. Your plan should be comprised of Long term plans+ short term strategy. Like that you can cover big syllabus with manageable burden each day. You wont feel overburdened and keep your motivation to study at high level. This really works:), almost for everyone. The most important thing is to keep your resources minimum. Your daily target should not be studied from too many books, articles. And keep saying yourself that whatever you have chosen to read that is enough and and you won\u2019t be attracted by unnecessary lucrative materials in the market. Do not go speedily. everyone has their own speed of learning. Make plan according to your capacity. Do not over do it. It will keep your energy saved. Finally I would say make plan keeping in view all your strengths and weaknesses. Start with what you are weak in and keep your strong subject for later. All the best ",

These books are written in a very lucid language with rich content and helps us getting involved with the books.After finishing relevant NCERTs, refer to the highly recommended reference books or class notes [if you have joined coaching]. Don\u2019t just read books from cover to cover, be selective.Your approach should not like first I have to study for prelims and then mains exam. You should have integrated approach.Join good test series for prelims as well as for mains. Get your preparation evaluated.

            "answer_text": "Before you start preparing for UPSC exam from or outside your home, you should know some important information related to the civil services examination including: What is the IAS exam, the eligibility for ias exam, and syllabus. Once you have good knowledge of the basics of the IAS exam, you will realise that IAS preparation requires an integrated approach to Prelims and Mains exams. Only the preparation method varies.Read the recommended books for IAS at least twice. You should read atleast one good newspaper daily and one good current affairs magazine.If you\u2019re preparing full time I will suggest you devote 7 hours to Paper 1 daily and 2-3 hours to Paper 2. In Paper 1, you should devote 30-60 minutes to reading newspapers and current affairs.Unless you attempt mock tests on IAS pattern you will not know whether your preparation is on the right track or not.I Suggest don't waste time in preparing ur own notes take from crackias.com notes they prepared personal notes of IAS toppers with multiple mind working on it,enriching the real time notes of reliable, relevant & recommended Text Books for UPSC.

Don\u2019t try to start by self studies otherwise you will not understand what to read and what to leave, if you will read all the things you will become professor but not IAS. you must know syllabus , pattern ,role of subjects. A teacher will guide you in smarter way in brief and how to link that knowledge with News papers NEWS because you have to write the answers in 200/250 words that is an art . I would suggest take admission in any coaching but you must visit few coaching like \u201cUNIQUE SHIKSHA\u201d they are in karol bagh and the strategy which they are following is really superb..like 1- fixed class for every subjects (no. of hours decided to cover whole GS subjects and proper time when it to be covered) 2-Small classes with recorded lectures facilities where you can avail your missed lectures or to understand again the topics 3-They are giving an extra mentors they say it personal tutor other than your subject teachers to each students for their doubt clearing, these tutors are successful candidates like IRS IFS etc. i found this very unique. 4- They conduct tests weekly , topic end test ,prelims & mains test series all in their courses and best thing is they emphasis on writing , copies will be checked and suggestions of how to write answers in better way is really worthwhile . I found them the Best !! ",

For each day have two to three reading and summarising schedules. If you are not parallely attending University, increase the sessions to five. But chose different subjects for each session. From the third month on , practise answering the Regular exam papers within the allotted time.Neer exceed the time adissible. Go on increasing your answering speed till you can complete the p[aper in 80 to85 % of the allotted time, and have free time to review the answers. Choose for Optional Paper a subject you have genuine interest in , \u2014one through which you think you can make a difference to the Country [eg; International relations, Foreign Trade and Commerce,GATT and its newer versions, Genetic Modification of Crops to solve India\u2019s food deficit, and so on].If you already don\u2019t know one such subject, take as optioonal one subject you were very good at college an Pursue it to P.G and Doctoral level study,informally, til you can answer the quesions in the exercise I suggested : one word, ,one sentence etc.. Join Debating Socities , read scholarly aricles on General Knowledge and Current Affairs [Read GST/VAT etc]. Write and contribute serious articles to journals and News Papers.

            "answer_text": "Hey. First of all, I hope you are asking this question because you want to serve the nation, the people of the nation and not because your parents want it. Because until it's your own dream, it's not worth it. Yes, that's what I said, a job is only worth it when you want it. This job comes with a lot of love and respect but you will still spend 70% of your life doing this. Better make a right choice, not a forced one. And secondly, there is no right answer for this. Listen to everyone's suggestions and alter all those for yourself. It's important to have your own personal routine that suits your style. People can sit at home with no social interactions but if it doesn't suit you, don't try it. Decide what suits you and your preparation. Important: I am going to tell you what to avoid in the preparation, and what mistakes are most common. Donot blindly follow anyone's advice. Bring logic in every discussion. I had a teacher who told us to study only 4 pages of newspaper, wrong.Plan. Make a plan, starting from prelims, mains, interview. How much do you want to cover. How much hours you need to study to complete that much in that time. And then follow the plan.Check: keep a check on your plan. Ask a friend nor family to check it on you.NEWSPAPER: I can't stress enough on this part. Now again, don't read blindly. Newspaper help in prelims and in mains. You understand which part of the static syllabus ( i.e. that doesn't change with time like polity, history, etc) is important for the year you are preparing . It also helps in giving facts, numbers, data, viewpoint to write in mains answers. What to avoid in newspaper: Politics news, vague statement related articles- the ones that doesn't provide any new viewpoint or any data. You can also ignore sports, hardly 1\u20132 questions can be asked. Many time no questions are asked on sports. Ignore Delhi times, Bollywood, etc. Newspaper you will be recommended will be the Hindu or India times. Whichever newspaper you read, read it consistency. Note: here, many people will start reading 3\u20134 newspapers. But it will last only for a few days. It's better to avoid that. Read just one, buy daily. Small consistent steps are valued.Consistency: make a routine that suits you, don't make it hard on yourself. Bring about a few days to relax, meet your people, laugh. But try to keep the pace constant, try to give designated number of hours to studies daily.Revise: syllabus is vast, questions are uncertain. How to make sure right information gets into your mind at the right time ? Revise what all you study. Respected Tina dabi mam says syllabus should be revised thrice before prelims.Syllabus: there are cliche books for basic subjects to start with ; modern history(spectrum) polity (laxmikat, )e environment (shankarIAS) , geography ( GCleong) etc. You can also ask a senior or a teacher.Coaching: it's not a must. Even after coaching, you have to do a lot of self study. It just gives you a starting base . If you are confident, you can proceed by yourself.Understand your weakness and strengths.Here.. UPSC preparation isn't rocket science. The importance is given because of the prestige that comes with it. And it's well deserved, you will be serving people, serving nation. But it's important that before dedicating your precious time, you evaluate that you really want this. That you can dedicate a lot of your time to this. And that you are strong enough to reach the other end. And if you decide to not pursue UPSC, it's okay. Everyone gauges success at different scales ,but all of them uses happiness and satisfaction. It's important you find that in whatever job you choose. I wish you luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Well. Being an aspirant I do perceive what the beginners think about the exam and how much they are worried about their preparation. Having no knowledge is no shame. Not everyone is starting from zero knowledge on the subjects they are required to study during the leviathan journey. It depends on how much they can remember the matters they learnt in their school and college. But truth is, that does not matter. UPSC's demand of conceptual clarity more than memorized facts compels every candidates to study their old NCERT books religiously irrespective of their marks obtained in school level exams. So having no knowledge is no shame.Coming to the question, I must say if you are a beginner,do not hesitate to chew the syllabus of UPSC which comes with a notification every year. Read the syllabus, which is always considered as the most useful guidelines for candidates, as many times as you can until memorized. As beginners you must go through the basic NCERT books from class 6 to 12(not of all subjects). You can recapitulate every important chapters which you think necessary. Many argues that reading NCERTs and making notes are waste of time. But there are many including me who have realized how helpful it is to revise all the things before prelims. Sometimes UPSC asks very basic questions directly from NCERT books. After you have done well with NCERTs you should start reading the standard books or coaching materials which you have. I will give you a list of most advanced and highly recommended resources later in the article. Let me not forget to highlight the significance of reading newspapers which constitutes around 60 per cent of current affairs in prelims . The contriubution of newspaper in UPSC CSE is so enormous that all three stages are incomplete with out current affairs questions. In mains papers if you see, the maximum question are asked from current affairs. However, you need to link current affairs with whatever you have read from books. Your analytical ability is primarily tested in the mains stage. So you can not let a single day pass without reading The Hindu or Indian express.Books required for Prelims:1. Indian History: Ancient India by RS Sharma, Medieval India by satish Chandra and Modern India by Rajib Ahir (These books are available in NCERT format also)2. Indian Art and Culture NCERT (Introduction to Indian Art part 1 and2)+ Indian Art and Culture by Nitin Singhania(you can also refer to CCRT website)3. India and World Geography NCERTs (class6 to 12)+ selective study from Certificate Physical and Human Geography by G. C Leong4. Indian EconomyClass 11 and Macro economics of class 12+ books by Sanjiv Verma or Ramesh Singh + the Economic Survey of that year5. Enviroment Shankar IAS updated book 6. India Polity- M. LAxmikant7. National and International importance has to be covered from Newspaper. (Be a regular watcher of Unacademy DNA) Apart from that you should also mug up the monthly Yojana, which comes at the end of months with some decent articles written by some honorable ministers, professors or secretaries of central ministries,on the policies introduced by Central Government. Reading Yojana helps you gain data as well as proficiency in answer writing.Books for Mains1. Indian History- (Ancient india- revise the books you read for prelims analyse the events)(Medieval India by Satish Chandra)(Modern India-A Brief History of Modern India by Rajiv Ahir and India's struggle for independence)(Post Modern india- India since Independence or India after Gandhi)2. World History - Mastering the Modern World History or Coaching materials.3. Indin society- no good book avilable. Get help from coaching material.4 Geography- rely on current affirs more than basic sources.5.

Practise case study rigorously.Interview is a stage where your personality is tested more than your knowledge. Thus, it is known as personality test. Rather than reading new things, you should focus on and revise what you have read through out the year and current developments. Make a thorough study on the areas and topics you dealt with while filling your DAF. Being aware of yourself boosts your personality considerably.From the above, one must find the huge importance of current affairs in the exam. Arguably,With the progress of time and increasing availability of materials online, UPSC is setting question papers with questions which are more dynamic in nature. But Don't freak out. We have enough sources and free educators who are working hard day and night to provide useful current affairs resources and standard online coaching, free of cost to all. Unacademy, Vision IAS, Insight on India, IAS BaBa are some online websites which provide standard resources and visual presentation. Remember your endless study will not help you to clear the exam until you solve the previous year question papers sincerely and enroll for mock tests. They will shape your mind according to the requirement of the exam and will boost your confidence remarkably.Best of Luck. ",

In this era of \u201cInternet\u201d the main problem is not how to get the best content, just google UPSC and you will get two to three times content of the same topic. There are videos, there are pdfs there are the so called \u201ccapsules\u201d, \u201cmagazines\u201d and the list goes on\u2026 Ask any aspirant do you have study material? and he/she will tell you all the books or video lectures or those \u201cpremium\u201d content they bought thinking that buying the study materials will magically be consumed in the brain. It seems the problem is not finding the content but how to actually handle these overloaded content. Let\u2019s look at the basic thing any aspirant do at the end from all those content. They make study notes and then after they actually starts to learn the things And what is the main purpose of Making Study Notes? TO MAKE THE EFFECTIVE REVISION. Now it is becoming clear that the main problem is not to decide which study materials or so called \u201cpremium courses\u201d to choose. But the main problem is To go from \u201cstudy materials\u201d to your own personalised \u201cstudy notes\u201d and then to make \u201crevision\u201d. Let\u2019s look at the methods people are making study notes to make revision then it seems they are just doing it in traditional ways of making hard copies of it which rise another problem of \u201cOrganising\u201d. (Let\u2019s not talk about those ToDo or Notes apps, let\u2019s be honest those are not suitable for making study notes) Feels like Stone Age while making the study notes in traditional ways Right? Enough of the problems now what is the Solution? What if the study notes can be organised well like in tree structure and the reading is from cards of short summary and the best thing is Revision is Automatic.  Make the best study notes and get the automatic revision COMING SOON ",

Buy or Download NCERTs from 6th to 12th of Subjects (History, Geography, Economics, Polity, Science). There are around 40 books, Which make your basics for CSE. Learn each & everything from NCERTs, Read, Revise & After you are done with three or more times reading, Write notes in very compressed & crisp format. My suggestion is to make only 1 or 2 A4 paper sizs notes for each book. Use indicators , highlighters, diagrams and mnemonics as much as possible. You can learn NCERTs in 3 or 4 months.With NCERTs start reading The Hindu, Well known precise newspaper for CSE preparation & Other is The Indian Express, But my suggestion is to go with The Hindu. In begining allot 2 hours for Newspaper reading daily, after reading for 2 or more month this time gets reduced to 1 hour, depens on person to person, Make very short notes of it in separate notebooks of each subjects like History and Culture, Geography and Environment, Science and Technology, Polity and International Relations And Policy Formation, Economy, Social-Women-Child related issues.Once you are done with NCERTs buy Standard Textbooks of History, Polity, Economy, Geography, Science, Environment, International Relation & Ethics & CSAT.Essential IAS Books For UPSC prelims-History Of Modern India \u2013 Bipan Chandra.

            "answer_text": "I am writing this answer without any idea of your academic credentials & your past track records. The very realization that you know nothing is a good sign, I would say. I too feel to this date that I know nothing, trust me. It is much better to feel this way than have a misplaced self-confidence that you know everything. And this drives me to look for every possible source of knowledge and improve my information and understanding. I would advise you the following: First develop the habit of reading. Once you do that you will start loving the process & that will take care of half of your problems Read any reputed newspaper daily & dont miss out on the editorial. That will update your current affairs knowledge. Buy NCERT books on history, geography, economy, polity etc to build the base for General Knowledge Next step would be to choose your optional subject. Choose the subject you love rather than the one others advise on account of subject being high scoring. Go through CSE syllabus to ascertain & assess the length & breadth of the topic covered. Get the right set of books\u2014 not too many , just the relevant ones & optimum number. Set a plan and prepare your routine. Then confine yourself in a room with books around you. Keep faith in yourself. Must avoid cramming. Try to understand and analyse everything you read. Soak things in. Lastly, don't worry about not having guidance. Everything is available online thesedays. There are plethora of advisors & sometimes too many advisors will mess things up. So, it is best to self-assess the progress periodically. Try doing these. I'm sure things will start falling in place. Edit 1 : The change in question now requires answer to be modified accordingly. Suitable amendments will be done in due course. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello friends, this is a question that a lot of aspirants might have so, let us try to answer this as briefly as possible. But before we begin, let us break a myth regarding this exam. Myth: You have to be exceptionally brilliant and should possess academic excellence above par in order to clear this exam. Reality: Hardwork - Sincerity - Zeal - these are the three things that you need. You do not need to be academically excellent, you do not need to be exceptionally brilliant. Let us elaborate.Hardwork: hardwork never killed anyone but if you only do \u2018hardwork\u2019 your dream of becoming an IAS officer may get stamped out! What we recommend is \u2018smart hardwork\u2019 - a type of preparation that is dynamic and quick to adapt to changes, gets work done and most importantly does not create unnecessary stress while you are at it. Example: Do not waste time reading a lot of books. Reason being that reading too many books is going to confuse you in the end, remember that you are preparing for a competitive exam and not for a PhD. Reading the same book 2\u20133 times will help you here more than reading 2\u20133 books one time each.Sincerity: this is actually the master-key to success in this exam. If you are not sincere and give up to personal and societal whims on the slightest pretext - like partying, movie dates - you may suffer in the exam. You will instead need to build routines, stick to your study plans and reshape your lifestyle around this exam. Zeal: having a zeal keeps you eager, keeps you ready. You have to be eager to learn new things all of the time and you have to be ready for any question on any topic before the exam, especially the Main Exam and the Personality Test. For this to happen, you may need to motivate yourself every day of your preparation. Lastly, this cannot be overemphasized enough: stay ahead of the competition; stay focussed; stay healthy; most importantly don\u2019t shy away from taking help if you think you need it! With Best Wishes Team Drishti ",

            "answer_text": "First, familiarise yourself with the syllabus, then Read NCERTs before opting for standard books. Once you form a stronger base, then shift your focus to standard books. Market and Internet are flooded with so many material, books, coaching notes that its so easy and natural to be lost in this sea. Make sure you study only relevant ones. So, make your booklist and follow it sacredly. Also, Stay tuned with current affairs. The Hindu, Indian Express, Rajya Sabha TV, Lok Sabha TV, AIR News, editorials, current affairs compilation, budget, and economic survey, are some of the important sources. Then, choose optional subject in which either u had done your graduation or as per your interest. Your job is half done if you choose the right optional according to your aptitude and liking. Whatever you study, just keep revising because the syllabus is vast. Moreover, try to develop answer writing skills, it is important that you practise writing well-framed answers, covering all dimensions within the stipulated time. Also, try to solve previous years\u2019 papers. It will not only help you with answer writing practice, but will also give you a fair idea of the exam pattern and help analyse the trend of question papers. Then, you must also join test series of any reputed institutes like KSG India etc. to assess your preparation level. At last I would only like to say that, don\u2019t believe in Luck or Destiny. Consider yourself worthy of UPSC. Confidence is biggest quality needed. Give your heart and soul to this exam for one year. Be totally honest with yourself and assess yourself continuously. Manage your time judiciously. You will definitely clear this exam with sincere hard work. Best of luck and keep total trust in your abilities. You will make it surely. ",

I wish you all the best, and I congratulate all those who wish to prepare for UPSC, because atleast you guys are sure what you want to prepare. Now I come to HOW\u2026. I am not here to write a long list to do or any magical paragraph, neither i am not going to give philosophy of UPSC or just to repeat all those methods which everyone will tell you. Even we all know how. I am sharing what i did to reach 99.5 in prelims 2019, without a single class, from 80 in my previous attempts. I never attend any coaching neither any paid test series. Now what I did, what We all should do, Again, it will sound simple as i said these are basic structure. You must stick to it. Learn the syllabus first and read them atleast thrice. And you will get 20% idea (ab kya krna hai.) Start with Mains Preparation, Study syllabus of Mains G.S paper, and try to make notes on each and every topic, either from any book, coaching material or internet. Any source you follow, you have to follow the same and try to gain self believe. E.g, GS 1, History is common in both Prelims and mains, except world history. But once you will read Mains syallabus you analytical approach would develope, this is what prelims expect we should be aware of facts and concept both. This tactics, you should follow for the remaining subject as well. Either in Polity Geo or EVS. Previous paper ko aapne apni aankh bnani hai, jitni bar dekhoge utni baar nye nye thoughts and ideas ayenge, kya krna hain, kahan se padhna hain. Now most Basic Question, Why NCERT, As we all need Alphabets for word formation and then comes sentence, similar way NCERT is Alphabet. We have to read it. News paper reading and Mock paper all this we all know, but we did not follow rigoursly. Our casual approach stop us to follow our routine which we all write but after a week. Sb khtm, arey yar ke lenge. Koi na ek baar notification aajaye, uske baad se jee jaan lga denge. Rest , Book list you can get from any where. List is same. News paper ka content bhi same, but how you approach these tools matters. News paper is mirror the way we all look it ,vice versa it reflect. For Current Affair, yes, Newspaper. Remaining things as early you will start you will be in automatic mode. Last thing, please sit with yourself atleast one hour a day. No friends no mobile. Only you, syllabus and previous year paper. Your every doubt would be clear. And after that one hour what ever question comes to your mind will be your achievement and then try to find out them. Nothing else. Atleast we expect rest we all know. \u201cHow\u201d ",

The time spent on each subject or topic depends on individual to individual. Students should make a strategy keeping in mind the below points. Start with NCERTs. Make notes for revision purposeRead standard books.Take mocksRevise the topics multiple times.Start practicing answer writing, get the answers corrected by your mentors regularly.Keep the resources limited.Read newspapers judiciously and make notes for the same. Compilations should be used for revision purposes. They shouldn't be the primary source for Current Affairs.Students should keep in mind that the preparation for prelims and mains should be done simultaneously. The last 3 months before the prelims can be kept entirely for prelims revision. CSAT should not be considered lightly and should be practiced during this period. Optional Subjects should be completed once or twice over before the prelims and should be thoroughly revised before the mains. Consistent Hardwork, Systematic Approach, and Revision are the keys to clearing this examination. All the Best! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great thread. Here are my two cents. To start off, I'm a vicarious learner (ethics terminology - meaning: Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others; something such as this thread itself) Firstly, the most cost-benefit I found was through Mrunal's video series - \u2018How to prepare for UPSC' (How to start UPSC Prelim cum Mains Preparation for General Studies - YouTube) Most important emphasis one can find on this and through all others is that NCERTs are a MUST. The video series will help you to organise your study of them. Secondly, you shall plan your time - both spatially i.e. till the exam comes up and daily. There can be multiple ways. My approach has been to divide the Spatial time, let's says when I have a year, to complete NCERTs, my optional and status portions of GS (Paper 1, Paper 4 and parts of 2 & 3) within first 7\u20138 months. Then with 3\u20134 months remaining, plunge into exclusive Prelims prep, with following two test series. Additionally, take help of video sources if you are comfortable with them. With changing times, they have a high throughput. P.S. I don't think religious reading of newspapers is a must. Summary videos online will work just as well. And writing practice depends upon your existing calibre. If you feel that you need to improve, you shall practice a paper a week. This shall get you started. All the best:) ",

Because there is lot of difference between our academic education syllabus and UPSC syllabus.Choose the books wisely. Because some websites say a particular book is good and some websites recommend not to use that book. So understand your way of reading and choose books.For choosing books, you don't need to read them. There are many youtube youtube videos which explain how points are mentioned in books and what are pros and cons of bookAfter arranging all books start reading.First and most important thing is reading NCERT and reading newspaper. Surely these both cover most important topics of UPSC syllabus.Remember that understanding is more important than reading in upsc exam. (But never negelet reading. I just wanted to say understand whatever you need)Never get worried about vast UPSC syllabus. It is built in such way that to test your ability to work as an civil servant.Practice writing 5000 words within 3 hours that too including some time to think.Understand importance of history and geography and polity. This is main aspect of UPSC examination.Finally the most mentioned point by all coaching institutes and tutors. \u201cyou are not writing to compete against 1000000 people. You are competing against only about 5000 people who studied well for UPSC exam\" but the main concept is in preparing yourself from a normal student are normal person to those 5000 toppers with whom you are struggling to get one of about 300 IAS posts in spite of caste and physical disability reservations.

As far as, self preparation is concerned, first of all, we should be highly determined and disciplined and follow the continuity till the goal is reached. We should start with question papers and the syllabus in our hands. Then we should take some guidance from the successful candidates or a teacher or anyone ,who is expert in the field. But if we need some help in the form of coaching, we have many options like Visionias, Vajiram, KSG etc, which have proved their worth as most of the successful candidates are found to be assosiated with one or the other.

            "answer_text": "I may not be able to draw up any daily time table suitable to all aspirants, but here are some tips for target-setting - Target atleast 3 to 4 subjects/topics in 1 day, apart from newspaper. It is better not to get bored with 4 hours of same subject in a day.Always set \u2018slightly ambitious\u2019 targets. You will not be able to get 100% success, but that is very normal.Your targets should ideally have 2 layers. Daily and weekly/biweekly. Like doing 4 chapters of Spectrum in a day, and completing 12 in a week.At regular intervals, preferably weekly, check your how well you have fared in reaching the targets. Buckle up if you are missing them by too much margin.Do not get frustrated by the fact that you are losing the will to study after every two weeks. During such phases, watch a movie or spend a day travelling around your place, to refresh the mind.Space your revisions cleverly in the time table. You cannot expect to retain something if you read it today, and then come back to it after a month. So, make sure that a particular topic/subject is not out of your routine for more than 3 to 4 days.Edit : Interested UPSC aspirants may join Scribble for various free initiatives on Civil Service preparation.

So, don't waste your time to learn to have flowery and ornamental writing skills. It is NOT required.Prelims is the MAIN HURDLE. Mains is crackable with above average writing skills (if one is well-read).Cracking UPSC CSE is possible (& not impossible). 8-10 hours/day of study is sufficient if you keep your sources limited.Newspaper is your best friend once you have finished reading your limited books multiple times.Coaching is a waste of time/money.

Before setting daily target you must first set your monthly and then weekly target. Don't be too ambitious in setting these targets. It's OK if you are able to manage only 7\u20138 hours per day. You daily study should have following components: Newspaper Reading Ideally you should start your day by doing through the newspaper. It's best to read newspaper in the morning. Your mind is fresh and ready to absorb new information. Intensive Revision Revise what you studied 1 month, 15 days and 1 week back. Revision, if done well, takes less time but gives rich dividends. Static Subjects Go through HIPEG (History, Polity, Economy, Geography) standard textbooks as these subjects are highest marks fetching. Make sure that you have crystal clear clarity on these subjects. Optional Irrespective of what optional you have, you should daily devote some time to it. Even if you feel that you have an easy optional don't ignore it. Optional marks plays a crucial role in deciding your rank. MINIMISE INTERNET USAGE Internet surfing, reading random newspaper articles does not qualify as preparation. Period. Your time on internet should be with a definite purpose. Ideally you should devote weekends for searching new information. Writing Practice You should daily allocate some time to writing 1\u20132 answers (GS, Optional) or attempting MCQs. This will prove very effective in the long run. If you are able to maintain the above daily routine then you won't face difficulty in your exams. ",

Reading NCERT books of class 6 to 12 and they should revised it properly . : Writing skill for mains exam aspirants should start their writing skill till staring day of their journey towards upsc because mains exam is totally subjective and snatch 1750 marks out of 2250 ..so writing skill should be most important from staring days ..get some topics and write not worried about mistakes. ; If aspirants joine coaching that's good but if they doing self study then they should join test series of those coachings which they can understand .. If aspirants should get online information it's also good .. : Upsc demands smart study not only study and hardworking .UPSC IS A PACIFIC OCEAN and we aspirants are a BOAT nor a BIG SHIPS . : But insha'Allah we can cross this ocean one day if we work hard smartly and with full of dedication . consistency ,internal motivation .and serving good deeds for our NATION . so it's a little bit suggestions for upsc aspirants .. ALLAH HAFIZ . ",

But after going through toppers interview and their strategies I found several things - Firstly before starting preparing for UPSC firstly you need to go through its syllabi .Secondly make habit of reading a newspaper daily (The Hindu or anyone)Thirdly do extensive research about good and authentic books ..You can also see what other toppers had prescribed.Make habit of writing.. As You know UPSC is all about writing .. Write about any topic daily.Then cover your GS portion (static)Daily or weekly revise current affairsMake short and crips notes about the CA which you are readingKeep revising it.. Daily or weeklyAfter all this.. You must join a good TEST SERIES. Lots of test series are available in market.. You can pick any one (vision and insight are good)Don't worry about low score in test.. Yeah but give proper testSo finally if you will follow all these things then UPSC is not that tough exam \u263a Best of luck guys, For 2019 ",

Apart from the basic syllabus which comprises mainly of the NCERT books from std. 10 to 12, general awareness is another big chunk of the curriculum for the exam. First, analyze the previous year question papers, there are many good question paper analysis (like wizard strategist for prelims). Second, make your own study plan. That must be flexible. Time must be allowed according to syllabus requirements. Third, make a stringent revision plan. Remember that without proper revisions you cannot consolidate your studies. Fourth only reading books won\u2019t help. You must have to analyze your studies. To analyze your studies proper test series will help you. I said proper test series. Not any random. ( like Vision IAS, Vaziram, Pioneer Academy, etc.) Institutes like Pioneer Academy do provide some Individual guidance programs for the student who are preparing by self-study. Finally, keep in mind to cut yourself some slack. Only you can stop you from achieving your goal. Every exam comes with its ups and downs and it\u2019s best if one doesn\u2019t pressurize themselves over it. Prepare slow and steady( this is a marathon, not 100 mt race), and use every means of expanding your knowledge base. ",

Download the syllabus, go through it as many as times till you are able to relate it with responsibilities of the particular post. For preparation of civil services examination, start with NCERT books of 9th, 10th 11th and 12th and reading daily newspaper. For other exams, you google about the persons topped the exam and read their interviews for clear views.  Often keep reading or hearing the motivating speeches or life stories of honest officers which will keep you focused. If the question is more specific about the exam in long list of exams, i can give an elaborate answer if i know about that exam. ",

Then choosing the optional based on your previous education background as that would make it easy to understand the depth of the subject and enables you score better. Even if you want to choose a completely new optional, that is no big problem unless you make sure there is the proper availability of the material for the subject you choose. Give yourself ample time to prepare for the exam before attempting it. (I would say 1-2 years)Start each subject with NCERTS of 6-12th or 9-12th based on the subject requirement.Read THE HINDU newspaper every day.Follow a good current affairs magazine.This is all. You can definitely prepare on your own by doing smart, hard and dedicated study.If you want any more specific details check for sites like Mrunal - Competitive exams Preparation Page on jagranjosh.com UPSC etc.ALL THE BEST!!

Each has a pretty large syllabus and the exam extends over a year. Most aspirants are full-time students or office-goers who have to schedule their preparation within the time they can manage outside of their regular routine. Being serious about the exam requires a steady focus, and thus a separate time-table to ensure a consistent approach towards assimilating the vast amount of information for the exam. This time management is only possible if the candidates are able to set up a schedule and fix deadlines for when they intend to cover the various portions of the syllabus. To make this possible, candidate requires roper guidance throughout his/her profession which is provided by UPSC PATHSHALA, which is the best online UPSC preparation platform nationwide. There is a personal mentor assigned to the students for making a proper plan for them according to their convenience for efficient and productive studies. He analysis student\u2019s work, clears doubts, gives test series according to student\u2019s level and is connected all the time to help out in the best way he can.

Start with knowing the syllabus Knowing the syllabus is of paramount importance as it helps to plan which subjects to be picked up and how each one should be given time for preparation in a day. Knowing the subjects beforehand helps to assess the competence of oneself. Create a time table A balanced time table, if followed religiously, can hep reap fruits easily. The time table must have time allocated to general studies, newspaper, optional subjects, watching news and interacting with fellow aspirants in a study group. Improve writing skills Writing skills can be a make or break in UPSC exam. I would practice writing an essay everyday and getting it reviewed by mentors or fellow aspirants on a regular basis. Be away from distractions This does not mean locking myself up in a room for years. It just means staying away from unnecessary activities and elements. Social media is not a necessary evil; it can even be helpful. There are communities on Facebook, like this UPSC 2018 aspirants, which can help in preparations. But don\u2019t get addicted to social media. Have a mentor Joining a coaching center or having an online tutor will help in keeping oneself on track. There are many inexpensive coaching websites for UPSC. I find SuperProf to be fairly good. I am not sure if I will ever go the UPSC route, but if I do, this is how I will proceed. ",

Initially I took the help of NCERT books which is one of first and primary source from where we can take help for our preparation but then I was not confident about my preparation as I have to crack the .

            "answer_text": "The civil service exams are considered the toughest in India. Even students who are on the whole good at studies, may fall behind due to the complexity of the exam as well as lack of strategic preparation to ace the exam. You have to go the extra mile to excel in this exam. Here are some pro tips on how you can enhance your performance. 1. Preparation for the preliminary exam- To build up on your subject fundamentals, your school books may come in handy again. The most widely recommended and used books for this purpose are the NCERT text books. Be confident of your facts with NCERT class 8 to class 12 books. 2. Work on your General Knowledge- In addition to having your subject basics clear, work on your GK as well. Read, read, read is the key to having a strong hold over General Knowledge. Read the newspaper everyday and note down important facts from the daily. Newspapers are a storehouse of knowledge, you can even purchase Competition Success Review, Yojana and Pratiyogita Darpan etc magazines for the same purpose (they are written keeping in mind the needs of UPSC aspirants). 3. Analysing Past years question papers- Previous years question papers can provide you with an insight of the pattern of questions. You will know the weightage of different questions, the sources used etc. 4. For the Main exam (Written)- Practice writing by picking up a topic everyday. This is the second stage of the exam where you will be tested on your writing skills. You will be expected to give descriptive answers. The best way to practice for this is to write on topics for which you had made notes earlier for current affairs and general knowledge. Choose a new topic everyday from the same and get set for writing. The total time period will be three hours and total marks will be 1750. After giving the prelims exam you will relieved but you do not have time to waste. Within a week, you should get back to work. All you\u2019re extra reading will help now. You need to write more and read less. Again newspapers like the Hindu and NCERT books will help in this stage. 5. Interview Preparation- Do not take the interview lightly. A lot of brain teasers and logical questions are asked. Give yourself a pat on the back if you have reached this stage. There will be five members on the panel who will judge you for your logical aptitude. The panel will assess your personality and see whether you will be a good fit as a public servant or no. Be candid and polite. They are not concerned with the length of the answer, rather they are more bothered about how you answer, your body language, choice of words etc. Simetimes they intentionally ask questions for which they know that there is no correct response, but want to see your reaction to being asked an awkward question. Do not feel overwhelmed, this is basically an assessment of your personality and not your intelligence.

If you are willing to give that time to the exam instead of other mundane things, you are good to go. I\u2019ve seen people collecting/buying all the books, pilling it up and and not looking at it again. Regretting later for the time gone. This exam should be your first and foremost priority (along with your life, your parents and your health), if you are starting for it. Be clear with the above points, and go for it. About what to study- start with NCERTs and a newspaper (The Hindu or Indian express). Know the syllabus well. Refer to sights like UPSC IAS EXAM PREPARATION - INSIGHTS ON INDIA HOMEPAGE - INSIGHTS , Mrunal \u00bb Competitive exams Preparation. These are really helpful while preparation. Read toppers interviews, their strategy, timetable and etc. Lastly, enjoy the process. All the best. ",

To put it in plain words, he cut himself off for a few months, no going out, no meeting with friends, no partying.. :/ He used to study after coming back from his office, but whatever time he dedicated to his studies, he did it with full efficiency. Sadly, he could not clear the exams with the marks he was hoping for, but he now is confident that with more effort, he can crack it next year.

A lot depends on whether you are having full time job or not. If it is the former now will be the good time to start for 2019 exams. It is not too late for 2018 either. If you are working presently and focusing just on the exams , then 8 months before the commencement of prelims will give you sufficient time to crack it. Draw out a basic timetable and material list first and that\u2019s the first direction in clearing the exams. I have also given the link below on materials I intend to use for the exams how to integrate mains and prelims preparation. C. Materials and preparation strategy It all boils down to this. I researched a lot on this by exploring quora, unacademy and mrunal. Based on it I prepared my own strategy. You can look at this video below where I have detailed my strategy and material list  Cheers and good luck, Krishna. ",

            "answer_text": "the word \u201crequired things\u201d could mean a number of things. intellectual traits: mental alertness and attention to comprehend what you read.if you are not active while studying you might miss out on a key aspect. how to sharpen intellectual traits: exercise/nutrition/sleep are the 3 foremost factors that affect brain function.avoid junk food and those with sugar like cold drinks.add more fats and protein in your diet.eat 20 almonds a day, have boiled eggs also.run every morning.running involves both deep breathing as well as coordinated movement of hands and legs.running is a proven way of optimising brain function2. mindset: how you think or the lens through which you see yourself is important.your belief should be that if I follow the right approach you will get the right results.conversely if follow a wrong approach I won't get the right results.never ever repose so much faith in yourself that you forget the importance of right approach.read some toppers\u2019 interviews and take note of important points.you will see a lot of commonalities in the advice given by different toppers.those common points are absolutely non-negotiable.just take note of key points from their interviews.however you should read toppers\u2019 interviews after a certain point. 3. book list: avoid reference books wherever possible.ideally reference book should be read only where school textbooks don\u2019t cover the syllabus well. freedom struggle and polity are the only 2 subjects where you should read a reference book.for subjects like economics, geography and culture school textbooks should suffice.this is because these subjects are well covered in school textbooks 4. learning skills: how to learn is far more important than what to learn.everybody knows the book list.everybody reads the Hindu yet not everybody gets the same result.the difference is created by how you read those books.most people take short notes to reduce the information burden.but this strategy backfires as it limits the perspectives you get from a given topic.ideally you should take notes in question-answer formation to cover all possible questions that might be asked. 5. ability to ignore popular opinions: most people will read vision monthly not because it helps but because others are reading it.candidates fear that if they don\u2019t do what other are doing they may be left behind.in other words candidates sacrifice their selection prospects for short term psychological security. 6. brain optimisation strategies: i.a.s. is no body-building competition. it is a test of your brain function.your brain works very much like combustion engine of a vehicle.it needs oxygen to burn the fuel that you get from food the absence of sufficient oxygen means the fuel is not \u201cburnt\u201d and energy locked in it not released.in the absence of energy you won't be able to sustain your concentration.when you have trouble concentrating you will stop studying altogether.this is why running every morning is important.it increases intake of oxygen.other brain optimisation strategies include yoga and journalling.both are equally important as running.as Abraham Lincoln said, if you give me 6 hours to chop down a tree I'll spend the first 2 sharpening the axe.you must spend some time sharpening your brain.trust me merely reading books doesn't sharpen your brain.running and yoga do. lastly, you must take note of important pieces of advice that you get from different sources and then act on them. no point asking these question if you have no intention to apply these principles.as French author Andre guide said,\u201deverything worth saying has been said already but because nobody listens it must be said again\u201d.

Meet them, they will guide you for proper preparation. If some close relative will be ready to supervise your preparation and guide you time to time and did not allow you to make mistakes which nearly all aspirants commit during preparation, then you will be selected in the very first attempt and even secure top rank like kanishka kataria and akshat jain\u2026.

In simple words, it is the hard work complemented by smart work that gives results in an exam as strenuous as UPSC CSE. Most of the time in preparing for civils services exam go to collecting and preparing quality source material (I would say more than 60%). That is why once you get the source material right, it takes quite less efforts to prepare for the exam. This is where you may find UPSCMENTOR very helpful, where I am myself doing the job of data collection and information building. There is a subtle difference between data and information. On internet and books, you get the data, which also contains a lot much unwanted content from examination point of view. Once you filter the relevant content, it becomes information. This information when absorbed becomes your knowledge, which is tested in the exam. So, at our platform, you get information which is precise, structured yet comprehensive, so that you gain the maximum knowledge needed for the exam. There are many free resources also available, but they mostly serve the data. You have to spend your time and effort in reading that data, and then filtering the important information from that data. So, its upto you, whether you want to save time or whether you want to save money. Irrespective of this choice, the end result would depend upon how much you convert into your knowledge. So to prepare well for upsc cse exam, read high quality content, revise, and practice. Work hard but work smart. I hope it helps you get the picture. ",

See, It is quite important to start with the Basic books like NCERTs. Please don\u2019t jump to any conclusions just by a read of it. After first reading when you develop some familiarity with the topics go through the syllabus thoroughly. Now, you are able to differentiate between what to read and what not to read. When you have developed a familiarity with the syllabus, again read the NCERT and try to make crisp notes of it. When you are done with NCERT, you can now either go for books exclusively for UPSC (this never makes NCERT less important) or join any coaching institute. I have provided you the list of books in an another answer i have written. About coaching institute there are many players in the market, you can opt for the best among them, may be Vajiram or KSG India. Also, must remember to regularly study The Hindu along with PIB (relevant only) to get a better grasp of contemporary issues. Hope this helps!! ",

You should first go through the syallabus of ias and after understanding the syallabus completely you should start your prepriation. You can start with ncert books , yojana magzine and The Hindu newspaper. You should watch the video lectures of @Roman Saini sir on @Unacademy website, He explains how a college student as an absolute beginner should start his/her prepriation and which books should he/she consult. There are people who prepared during the college days and emerged as toppers , among them are Roman Saini, Tina Dabi, Shah Faesal, Athar Aamir, Ansar Sheikh and many others. Hope you got the answer.

Because you must have a prior knowledge about the Syllabus, exam date, total number of candidates etc. If it is affordable then join a coaching centre and try to give mock tests as much as possible.

It will only leave you frustrated after 1\u20132 attempts because then you will realise you have wasted 1\u20132 years of your life and still in the same spot the day you begun .

If you choose optional in which you dont have any interest and you just took it because others are taking it or others are scoring better in it then i think thats wrong. one should choose optional after proper research because it carries 500 marks which are extremely important. Also you should keep in mind that you are not choosing optional which is not scoring at all and also requires lot of handwork. but in my opinion Optional like Geography, History, sociology and Anthropology are good because they are scoring as well as they help in your GS PAPERS. GEOGRAPHY optional have lot of scope for improving your presentation by adding diagrams and WHILE in Other you can add mindmap and flow charts which will help in increasing your presentation as well as your marks in mains. For geography optional no one is better than Tirthankar roy chowdhary sir from EDEN IAS . he is a gem the way he teaches is absolutely amazing. I was the person who after reading found it intersting but was unable to understand some tricky areas but after attending class by tirthankar roy chowdhary sir my views for geography is completely changed . one should definitely give it a try.

For UPSC, I strictly and compulsorily recommend you ICSE board because it deals with subjects like English and Arts more well than CBSE or any other State Board, or I can say it is the best board for this kinda streams which doesnot desl with MCQs but rather it deals with more of Knowledge and Knowledge and Knowledge\u2026. Which is the foremost requirement for UPSC Examinations. So, as per my opinion, you should without any doubt, go to an ICSE board. By the way, All the very best  for your future. ",
