As such I regret that I am ignorant of what an \u201cimperative sentence\u201d may be; I am further desolated that, due to this ignorance, I am unaware of any types of imperative sentence, let alone ten of them. Some may exist, but their distinguishing characteristics are blessedly unknown to me. Could someone please communicate to teachers of English in foreign lands that this sort of nitpicking does nobody any good? ",
