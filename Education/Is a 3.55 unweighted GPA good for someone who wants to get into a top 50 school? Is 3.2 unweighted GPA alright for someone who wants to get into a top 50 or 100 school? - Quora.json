            "answer_text": "It all depends on the REST of your package. First of all, your ACT or SAT score and if you have extracurricular activities outside of your academics. Humanitarian involvements, such as feeding the poor and caring for the homeless, volunteering in the hospitals or translating for the illegal aliens in the detention center, etc. etc. Last but not least, the recommendation letters that go with your application counts a lot. Some schools weighs those rather heavily. Your unique quality and talents far outweighs YOUR 3.55 GPA. AND if you have many AP or IB Classes. My son, for example, had mostly AP/IB classes throughout his transcript and the 4.83 GPA naturally looks impressive. Good luck! ",
