            "answer_text": "Okay, I feel I'm more than eligible to answer this question as I'm pursuing English literature from Amity University Noida. Here's the thing, you need to really think as to why you want to pursue this course? Is it because you think English is easy? Is it because you want to pursue something light, which doesn't involve much effort? Is it because you are really interested in the course, and clearly know about the job opportunities after that? So, once you have an answer to this. Let's proceed further. Amity's English literature or English Hons. Program is nothing like you could ever imagine. It's rigorous, vast, tedious, difficult and lengthy. Mind you, it's not a course where you'd simply be reading novels and having a gala time. There are theories involved. There is history of English literature involved. There's psychology at play. And these will be actual subjects. You would be asked to write atleast one research paper with no plagiarism ( they are really strict about it) every semester. From 3rd semester onwards, there will be two research papers. Then you'd get to study the political scenario of the entire world, especially Europe from 12th century to 21st century. You should know all the major historical, socio-political, and economical events by heart like Great depression, Civil war, cold war, Vietnam war, World wars, etc. You would be learning all the rulers of Europe from Anglo-Saxon age to post-colonial times including the writers who wrote through each time. Then you'd relate the texts prescribed with these scenarios and other literary theories. Now the good part - the course is so rigid that it shall prepare you for civil services examinations and to some extent, for the writing world too. The classes are fun. But the professors are too strict and moody. Well, they're highly qualified too so sums that up. You'll get to see movies often in the class itself. The huge campus and all the things you could do is an added bonus. Overall, it shall be a nice experience that is, if you really want to study. Else it's a breathing hell here. The faculty of our department will make that sure! There you go. That's about it. So I advise you to take the decision cautiously. And if you still decide on it, then welcome aboard. Oh, and one more thing. You will have to attend classes from 9\u201315 to 4:30 sometimes without any break. And you really can't miss or bunk because it's recorded online on their Amity portal called Amizone. Hence, you can't do anything regarding it. Plus, once you fail to meet 75% attendance per subject, you'll have to reappear for your exam next year, and you'll have to pay extra for it. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude03 ",
