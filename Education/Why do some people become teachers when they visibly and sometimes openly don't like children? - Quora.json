            "answer_text": "For a career? Let\u2019s rewind: teaching is a job. A lucrative one? HAHAHAHA no. But it\u2019s 2017 - having a job that you could spend decades at, even with relatively meager wages, a hellacious workload, and okay benefits is considered a really good career. Also, remember: when you do something every day, you grow to resent the shitty things about it. I didn\u2019t like doing dishes before I spent a brief time as a dishwasher, but now I can tell you all the little, detailed reasons why dish washing is objectively horrible. Teachers are no different - and if they hated kids before they started teaching, this palpable hatred could have easily been turned into a diamond over the years. There are excellent, brilliant teachers\u2026 and there are horrible, bad teachers. The vast majority are struggling somewhere in the middle This is true of every profession. ",

            "answer_text": "This is (unfortunately) yet to be a world where everyone gets the opportunity to choose the work they love to spend the rest of their lives doing. You may have noticed, for instance, that there have been waitresses, strippers, and office workers that haven\u2019t always seemed thrilled with where they are in life. The world always needs teachers, so it\u2019s a \u201csafe\u201d career path to walk down, albeit being a bit taxing (and by some considered grossly underpaid), and so some may choose it simply for the relatively high probability of landing them a job, regardless of their thoughts of children.
