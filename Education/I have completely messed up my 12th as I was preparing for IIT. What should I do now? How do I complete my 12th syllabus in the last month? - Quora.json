            "answer_text": "Just relax . You will definitely secure a good % in 12 if you would follow me .12th and jee mains are same thing but different in aspects to give their paper . One involves subjective answers while other involves objective having conceptual based question.12th board is more easy than jee because it goes with lenient checking.If any student has tried to write his answer but his answer is incomplete or wrong ,he will get some marks on trying on that question. NOTES - take notes of 12th class from anyone one of your senior/friend who had completed his 12th classroom classes (unlike Kota students) . As their experienced teacher know which topic comes every year . Just go through every important chapters twice .WRITING - It is true that in boards your hand writing matters as the examiner doesn't know who is the topper of your school . If someone's writing is good ,he would get good marks (it doesn't mean you don't have to prepare well if you hand writing is good ). Try to focus on your hand writing as it matters not more but a little but that little makes differenceTIME - try to solve atleast 3 previous year paper of board after you have studied it well just to check whether your timing whether you are slow in subjective if so just improve your writing skills . Many students fail to write their answer in time although they know the answers just because there are slow in subjective writing . try to focus on increasing your fast writing skill.IMPRESSION- write your first 3\u20134 pages with a good hand writing without a cut in any word (read it again) . As it sends an impact to examiner whether student is good or not . If you have made in starting please don't cut it , if do so you are highlighting your mistake .JEE MAIN- meanwhile your 12th preparation give some time to your Jee main just revise whatever you have studied earlier don't learn new for jee main as doing so you would end up messing with your 12th. Revise inorganic , organic chemistry .Revise formula of all mathematics as there are many so give them time.Whenever you feel pressure ( ab Kya hoga ?? Abhi to wo Wala chapter pdha bhi nhi h . ) Just say \u201c all is well \" to yourself. Think that your mom's blessings (aashirwad) are always with you Everything takes time .If You have studied really hard then surely you will get good percentage and percentile in your 12th and jee main respectively",

I compensated in 12th board by making sure of I did not touch ANY IIT study material for 21 days before the boardsScheduling: made a plan to study every subject in 12th board and stuck to the plan12th Guidebooks, NCERT books: Only used them for study and practice. I mostly memorised the guides (especially English and economics) . I observed in Physics, Chem, Math that answers were easy but needed to written in more steps, learnt thoseLastly - Practice and hard work: I used to take 1.5 hours break daily (lunch+dinner+my favorite video). I slept 8\u20139 hours. Rest 13\u201314 hours i spent studying. It was boring, it was stupid and painful - but it had to be done.After boards, I spent two days taking an complete break from ALL studies. Then resumed any competitive exams\u2019 study ",
