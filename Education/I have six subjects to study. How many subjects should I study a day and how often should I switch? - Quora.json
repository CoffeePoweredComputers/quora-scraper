            "answer_text": "You are best off making a work and life timetable. This is to ensure balance in your life and a calm approach. Schedule time for your 7-9 hours sleep without phone disturbance, time for your dinner and time for some physical relaxation and fitness. Then look at what you need to achieve.  In a separate diary Enter all the dates of the assignments and  reminders to have parts completed. Each day, set goals and list them . CROSS OFF  the goals if they are achieved. REWRITE THE GOALS that have not been achieved by listing them on another day. NEVER go back to previous days in the diary to look up what you should have done, always work forward and you can staple or fold over the old pages: they are history.  If you find yourself rewriting ( transferring) goals you wanted to have done today a lot and future days have too many goals , this will soon become obvious . You will realise that you are needing to have more discipline, more help or have spent too much time on one subject and neglected another. The requirement to write out again what you didn't achieve today eg maths exercises advdfvbggjjjcdgngf ( long) list , might make you decide to push yourself harder or realise you need help.   Make your study timetable visible to your family (not your diary but the weekly schedule) . This will allow them to cooperate with you: you will be nagged less and they will realise that if you go for a jog or watch tv with them etc , that this is your  scheduled event.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A :) First of All : Do take a resolution that you will prepare little by little side by side of your daily classes.  Now about the preparation : Don't think that you will do it all in a set amount of days... even if you did .. it will be of no use if you couldn't remember what you did. So try to do that subject in which you think that you are very less prepared.. and devote your self more to that. Don't mug up. Do it for 2 hrs. or 1 hrs. at least revise and try to remember what you read. After doing one subject for 2 hrs. take few minutes break. move around or talk to friend or family. Then come again to study... Be focused to your tasks and revisions. do every subject little by little on each day.. divide your day time according to the chapters in a Subject and try to be focused.. Don't worry. Just do your part and try to refresh everything or main important topic on morning of a day. Don't worry on results just do preparation and be relaxed.. just give it a good start and you will not even feel any tension. :) best of luck for all :) ",
