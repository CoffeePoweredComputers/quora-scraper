            "answer_text": "I would like to say beforehand that I will try my best to stay unbiased. (I've been to both AIIMS Patna and AIIMS Jodhpur). According to my own experience and the factors you've mentioned. The Rank in my view is AIIMS DelhiAIIMS JodhpurAIIMS BhubaneshwarAIIMS PatnaAIIMS RishikeshAIIMS RaipurAIIMS BhopalThe teaching quality here is pretty awesome I must say. As a first year student, I've been taught by teachers who are passionate for teaching.No personal grudge but the food here is quite better than what I've had in other AIIMS. (I've been to AIIMS BBSR and AIIMS Patna too).Of all The PG courses started at the new AIIMS, AIIMS Jodhpur has the maximum seats.The college location isn't that bad, it's hardly 2\u20133 km from the heart of the city.The sports families at AIIMS Jodhpur are hands down better than at any of the new AIIMS and Most Government collegesThe hostels are quite well maintained and there are separate rooms for each student.The labs are a state of art ,they are quite new and use new and developed technological devices for teaching UG student. The anatomy dept. here perhaps has the most no. of cadavers than any of the other new AIIMS.The recent recruitment of over 89 new faculties has improved the quality of services of the hospital.I couldn't think of any negatives of this institution of much.. Feel free to ask specifics if you wanna askResearch opportunities are awesome here.Hence my final conclusion on the basis of my opinion would be that AIIMS Jodhpur is the best AIIMS after AIIMS Delhi. And Yeah using Closing and Opening Rank is not a good criteria in this answer because most of the students are consfused about the college details and go mainly in BhedChal( I\u2019ve seen this :P) or after hearing some bizzare info from some unreliable sources. Srijan Sinha has also given a decent reason for AIIMS Jodhpur being better than other. EDIT : After some recent reviews I got about AIIMS Bhopal, it seems AIIMS Bhopal isn't so good as I thought. Hence I've changed the rankings. Check out the comment section with an article about this Thanks Message me for more queries or leave behind a comment ",

            "answer_text": " That's a hard one to answer. I'm from AIIMS Bhopal, so I can give you opinions about this college.It's a nascent college, which means that all the lab equipment is new. You get to practice from the latest equipment. You get to handle micropipettes in biochemistry (I asked a friend of mine in MAMC, and she told that micropipettes are strictly handled by residents). We have projectors connected to microscopes so that each histology and pathology slide can be demonstrated on the screen by professors before you examine it yourself. Academics is top notch here, the professors are distinguished and well learned. For example, our current head of Pathology and Lab medicine is a member of the Indian Advisory Board of the revered Pathologic basis of diseases by Robbins and Cotran. Researches are encouraged and many students take part in ICMR STS each year and get selected. Even if you don't get selected, you'll find the faculty inclined to guide you and do a research project with you anyway!Of late, the temporary library had come to be well equipped with books and journals. The various clubs for extra curricular activities have started functioning and are taking baby steps.There is free wifi in hostels and college as well as LAN facilities. The rooms are spacious. Since it's a new college, there are no fixed rules about the use of electronic appliances like coolers, water dispensers, fridge etc. however AC is not allowed. Split ACs are installed in the girls' hostel common rooms though. We recently organised a hugely successful sports and cultural fest, Retina. There was country wide participation with delegates coming from faraway places like Kharagpur, Andhra Pradesh etc. None of the newer AIIMS even come close to the feat we accomplished in that area. I'm attaching the official poster here. We have a strong SU and student body in general. We have organised strikes, protests and the SU is more than capable of defending the rights of the students and does just that actively. You have to remember about the delays in infrastructure though. The hospital is way past its schedule and so is the library building. The hospital has ICU services, but no trauma and delivery services. However, the instruments present are top notch and the doctors are talented.Bhopal is also well connected as far as travelling is concerned. Trust me, that matters when you have to go home or even plan a weekend out to a nearby place. ",
