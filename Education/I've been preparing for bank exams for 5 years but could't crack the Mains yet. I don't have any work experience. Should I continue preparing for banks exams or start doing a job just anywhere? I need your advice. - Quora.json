            "answer_text": "Hi, I want to share something exactly similar that I noticed a few months back. I had joined a public library in South Mumbai and this was a library where you would find a bunch of different students from different streams preparing for exams you didn't even knew existed. There was this group of about 10\u201312 boys who came from villages and were trying extremely hard to clear SBI PO exams, even after 6\u20137 attempts not a single of them could move forward. So eventually they started preparing for different exams like Railway loco pilot, food inspector, police etc. Basically their expectation was to get a government job. And even after dropping bank exam in favour of other, they couldn't get into other sectors as well. What I'm trying to say, don't keep repeating same mistake over and over again. If it isn't happening in the first 2 or 3 attempts it might not happen in the 4th or 5th. A young person in India has an important resource and that is time. If you are 28\u201330 year old taking same exams over and over again plus you're without work experience, frankly it's very difficult to get a job looking at the current state of our economy. My advice to my friends who have been putting so much of their time in courses like CA and other has always been to drop it and look at something else. We have so many courses available nowadays, if you aren't clearing one there is always something out there. Don't get stuck on one thing only and most importantly please don't waste your time. Your work experience is more important than a degree. And work experience along with it brings in money. Do consider that! I'm sorry if this answer is discouraging, I'm speaking from what I have observed and experienced. ",

Keeping your struggle for 5 years in note, i would suggest you to attempt for every chance you get and also start working somewhere to get practical knowledge that will help you to get better perspective and understanding to prepare for mains and interview as well. Many of the bank employees are working in some private banks and on the other hand aiming to clear govt. exams. ",
