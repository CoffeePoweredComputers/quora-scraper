            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. One thing I learnt so far is that in biology mugging up without understanding wont help to score best. Also we mustn't take our textbook for granted. Usually it might seem like our textbook is stating very obvious thing but mind you each and every line ,example paves way for a deep concept oriented question. So what I feel must be done is Study the textbook patiently and thoroughly ( atleast 3\u20134 hrs per lesson ).Never EVER start a lesson anew one day before the exam.Diagrams: In some lessons (like evolution) we have diagrams which are sure questions. Make sure you know that.usually we tend to keep diagrams till the end. Try to avoid that. Finishing it then and there with the concept makes it easier to remember. Try to answer the book back questions yourself. This gives you almost half exposure to the type of questionsPractice previous years papers and note the recurring questions.In case of exam idea it might be tempting to staright away read its notes,which seem short and convenient. But by experience I suggest you to use them for revision rather than 1st initial study. The questions are good so go through them too. Hope it helped. Cheers. ",
