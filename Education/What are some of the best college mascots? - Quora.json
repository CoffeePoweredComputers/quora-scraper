            "answer_text": "I see people have already mentioned the UC-Santa Cruz Banana Slugs, the Evergreen State College Geoducks, and the unofficial Delta State University Fighting Okra. I may be able to top those, however: The St. Louis College of Pharmacy is unusual in that it accepts undergraduate students directly out of high school. It offers bachelors\u2019 degrees in health science fields, as well as a four-year course of postgraduate study leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. The College fields sports teams in Division 1 of the NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, which oversees varsity sports at many smaller schools). And their mascot? The Eutectics. The logo looks like this:  And they do, in fact, have a costumed mascot at sporting events. His name, it seems, is Mortarmer McPestle, also known as \u201cMorty\u201d:  What is a \u201ceutectic\u201d? A eutectic system is a mixture of two substances whose melting point is lower than either of the substances by itself. (A simple example would be salt water; pure water melts at 0\u00b0C, and sodium chloride melts at 800\u00b0C, but a solution of sodium chloride in water, about 23% by weight, melts at -21\u00b0C.) According to the college\u2019s website: \u201c\u2019Eutectic\u2019 describes the scientific process of two solids being combined to form a liquid. A common term in pharmacy, it is the perfect metaphor for STLCOP's intercollegiate athletic program\u2014combining athletics and a demanding academic program.\u201d (St. Louis College of Pharmacy Athletics)  I might also point to an example within my adopted home state of Arkansas. The University of Arkansas at Monticello competes in NCAA Division II. Their mascot for the male sports teams is. . . the Boll Weevils. Yes, the teams are named for Anthonomus grandis, an agricultural pest insect that devastated the American South\u2019s cotton crop, peaking in the 1920s (and now mostly eradicated from the South). I\u2019ve been unable to find out why a university noted for its agriculture and forestry programs would name itself after one of the most destructive pests in US history. This is a boll weevil:  This is a UA-Monticello Boll Weevil.  This is the costumed Boll Weevil mascot. His name, it appears, is Weezy the Weevil. (@UAMCHEER IN SEARCH OF THE NEXT WEEZY THE WEEVIL)  The strange thing is that the Boll Weevil is only the men\u2019s teams\u2019 mascot. UAM is one of a few colleges to have completely different mascots for men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports teams. The women\u2019s sports teams at UAM are known, not as the Lady Weevils, but as the Cotton Blossoms. They don\u2019t seem to have an emblem or a costumed mascot of their own. This makes absolutely no sense at all\u2014I can\u2019t figure out why one school would use both names, given that boll weevils are pests of cotton blossoms. I mean, boll weevils eat cotton blossoms. I can\u2019t figure this one out. ",

            "answer_text": " Delta State University - Fighting Okra A tiny college in the Mississippi delta, this school's unofficial mascot is a vegetable. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_State_University  However, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of okra (a vegetable) wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression.[11] The \"Fighting Okra\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \"Statesman\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \"The Fighting Okra\" as an unofficial mascot. The \"Fighting Okra\" was featured in the \"Okraphobia\" episode of the Food Network show Good Eats.[12]The popularity of \"The Fighting Okra\" grew so much that there were many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant on the first base of the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was born from a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \"Court of Governors\" dormitory. A basketball player (Houston Williamson) was lamenting the fact that a \"Fighting Statesmen\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternate mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, a baseball pitcher (Bob Black) suggested that okra was green, fuzzy and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\" at DSU basketball games. ",
