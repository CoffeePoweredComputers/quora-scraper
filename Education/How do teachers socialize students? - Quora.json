            "answer_text": "I teach them. That is what I do; that is what I am trained to do, and it is what I am skilled in doing.An example.Tonight at your first junior high school orientation you will have to introduce your parents and your teacher to each other. Do not read an etiquette book. That will try to teach you how to introduce a king to an archbishop. It will also teach you how to introduce your teacher to your parents OR your parents to your teacher. Then it will give you an entire page of rules on which is which. I will teach you these if you really want, but for tonight I am going to show you one simple way which is ALWAYS correct. This way always works due to the rule which says that if words are missing, the hearer supplies the correct words.So instead of worrying about if you should be saying, \"Mr. Morrall, may I present my parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jameson\" or \"Mom and Dad, may I present Mr. Morrall\" just say this, \"Mr. Morrall, Mr. and Mrs. Jameson.\" or \"Mom and Dad, Mr. Morrall.\" This is always correct because when you skip the words, \"may I present\" each person puts them in correctly in his own mind. Why? That's the rule. Hey, I don't make the rules; I just learned them. Now you know the easiest and always correct way to handle this tonight. If you really need to introduce a king to an archbishop, it works the same way, and for tonight, you are all set.Another example.\"Cool, but be careful. You can say that to me because we are both males and you can say that to your male friends, but it is better not to say that to female teachers or the girls.\"Another.The class and I are getting annoyed because you interrupt too often. Watch me. If I touch my glasses on the right, it means to cool it for a while and just listen.Another.Yes, I am in line. No, just because I am a teacher I do not cut into the line. A gentleman doesn't do that.The last for this answer:\"One cannot hear what one is not supposed to hear. One cannot see what one is not to see. One cannot smell what one is not supposed to smell.\"One teaches socialization the same way one teaches anything -- by example and by instruction. ",
