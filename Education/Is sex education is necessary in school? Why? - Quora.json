            "answer_text": "Yes not only it is necessary but it should be made by experts in the fields! I\u2019ve never had proper sexual education from school, other than the usual reproductive system and STDs lessons. It was not only boring but also the least useful you can get. At least we got free condoms\u2026 However, it\u2019s important for parents to educate their children in an informative way. It\u2019s important that parents KNOW and UNDERSTAND that their children, as young as they may be, will eventually end up having sex with someone. Every child should know when they reach 14, that they are supposed to use a condom if they\u2019re going to engage in sex. That there is a risk of diseases associated with those practices. That a missed period is not something that should be ignored. There are other organism that usually provide sex education. If you want my personal opinion, the two main obstacles for a successful sex education are: parents want to believe their children will never have sexreligion wants to shadow sexual educationHere is what kids should know about before they engage into sex: PregnancySTDsHIV/AIDS and its dangersbirth control methods (ALL OF THEM)where and how to get free birth control methods until you reach majority (mostly condoms and birth control pills)who to turn to in case you have an accident and have a risk of pregnancyAnd parents should be a part of those classes if they want to, so they could discuss these lessons with their children.

            "answer_text": "There was a girl in my younger sister\u2019s class whose nudes got spread across the school when she was in eighth grade. In my seventh grade year there was a video of a girl in my grade masturbating that went public, and forced her to be homeschooled. Most of my friends got their periods when they were 12 or younger, and many had no idea how to react or what to do. When I was 16 I knew three girls that had been raped on school campus, and three boys than had been seen bragging about it. No one ever did anything. In fifth grade a boy told my best friend he wanted to have sex with her, then two weeks later revealed he had no idea what it was and was trying to show off. My friend spent those two weeks terrified because she thought sex and blow jobs were the same thing. A girl in my class spread rumors about herself having sex in sixth grade because she didn\u2019t know what it was. In our senior year people were still talking about it. I put in tampons wrong my first year of having my period and walked around in agony because I didn\u2019t know the difference. I went anemic soon after getting my period because I wouldn\u2019t stop bleeding. My mom said it would become regular soon enough. I was 14 and fainted twice before going on birth control. My mom was told she couldn\u2019t have children, went off the pill, and was pregnant within a month. She was newly married and 24. She had to take 15 years off her career and travel plans. My sister wore a bra 3 sizes too small for two years because no one told her puberty could start at age 11. We need sex education. We need health education. We need to start young and reinforce the values of communication. And there\u2019s no place better for this than school. ",
