            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t. Like most mathematicians (if not most researchers), I work off in an obscure corner of the intellectual universe. I do strange things with abstract stuff like binary trees and matrices and recursion and topology that most laymen have no exposure to and don\u2019t care about. Most people don\u2019t even know that university professors do research. Most people would correctly interpret even a cursory description of \u201cmy research\u201d as a flood of meaningless buzzwords, which I\u2019m just throwing at them to make myself sound smart. That\u2019s just rude. I generally talk about more relatable stuff, like teaching, or office politics, or my kids, or travel. Everyone\u2019s had teachers, everyone\u2019s office has politics, everyone has a family, and we\u2019re probably on a plane. Sometimes, especially if the person I\u2019m talking to solves problems for a living (for example: doctor, teacher, electrician, auto mechanic, blacksmith, video editor, portrait artist), we can talk about the problem-solving process. But few people outside the Ivory Tower have dealt with Referee #2 or fought the Notation Demons, and even fewer have ever tried to (or wanted to) understand the role of homology in computing strictly convex drawings of essentially 3-connected graphs on the torus. (See what I mean?) On the extremely rare occasion that someone I\u2019ve just met actually asks about my research (beyond the level of \u201cI design algorithms\u201d), I usually start with something vague like \u201cIt\u2019s pretty abstract. I draw a lot of donuts.\u201d or \u201cDid you ever play Asteroids? Imagine some of the rocks are connected by rubber bands.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to explain your research to a layperson you\u2019re meeting for the first time, talk to your mother about it! I think this is a great question. Before we start, let\u2019s define the parameters of our conversational setting. If it\u2019s a random layperson, it would be extremely arrogant of me to start talking about my research. I\u2019d rather talk about something that\u2019s interesting for both of us. That said, it\u2019s inevitable that you would run into situations where people do not have a lot of idea about your field of study, but you\u2019re still expected to explain your research to them. This is particularly relevant in a corporate research lab where you\u2019d be collaborating with people from engineering, management, marketing and much more. Back when my advisor was a graduate student, he had to deal with company CEOs directly and present his work, to secure funding for his doctoral research at his university. Even if you\u2019re presenting your paper in a conference, it is always a good idea to motivate the problem in layperson words. This makes the presentation more powerful as most attendees would have something to gain from it. So, knowing how to talk about your work at a high level so that it\u2019s interesting to laypeople, is always a good skill to have in your armory. For me, one thing that really helped develop this skill was talking to my mother about my research. My mother\u2019s always been inquisitive about what I do. Unfortunately, she has an Economics background and she doesn\u2019t get any details whatsoever. Talking to her has really helped me develop a perspective on what a layperson can relate to and what the best way of explaining my work would be. A good way of motivating your work to a layperson would be to keep things on a high/abstract level. A good strategy at first would be to talk about an application or a natural event that they\u2019re bound to experience. For example, in my case I say, \u201cWhen you go to a party, you don\u2019t have a problem talking and listening to your friend even when there are several people talking around you.\u201d Now that they have an idea about the application, you can explain the research problem on a high level again. So I say something along the lines of, \u201cHumans are very good at it, but a computer would get utterly confused. So, my goal is to teach a computer to do that.\u201d If the other person finds the problem interesting, I\u2019ve noticed they often get back with questions that are on a high level again. Now, answering these questions is a lot easier since they set the technicality of the conversation at their comfort level and you just respond to questions. Original question: How do you explain your research to a layman when meeting for the first time? ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, have you heard about those airplanes that crashed maybe because of software issues? Yeah, my research field is about preventing that from happening. If they want more detail, I\u2019ll talk to them about toilets, because I think that\u2019s a great way to visualize what I was working on a while back. The story goes like this. Imagine you and a coworker share a toilet booth, but the lock is broken \u2014 you can\u2019t lock the thing, so the only way of knowing if it\u2019s occupied is by opening the door. So you come up with a scheme: whenever you want to go to the toilet, you hang a blanket on the door knob. That way if you see the blanket, you know it\u2019s occupied. As it turns out, software does similar stuff. But now imagine that you wanted to \u201coptimize\u201d your daily life by using a time management system. Like all \u201cgood\u201d time management systems, you begin by using to-do lists. Whenever you have to do something, you put it on the to-do list; that way you can still do it later when it\u2019s convenient, and you can\u2019t forget about doing it. For example, if we have to do the laundry but the shared laundry machine is occupied for the next four hours, it would be inconvenient to wait in front of the machine; it\u2019s better to do other stuff now, and then come back to the laundry machine in four hours. Great, right? Except of course when you enter the toilet, and instead of putting up the blanket immediately, you just put it on the to-do list, because you can still do it later when it\u2019s convenient and you can\u2019t forget about it\u2026 As it turns out, processors do exactly that\u2026 \u201cBut wait!\u201d, you say, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just figure out when you have to do something immediately, and then not put it on the to-do list?\u201d Ah, yes, and that was exactly what my research was about \u2014 how can we tell easily when we can use the to-do list (which helps us save a lot of time as we can do things when they\u2019re convenient), and when do we have to do things immediately? This is also the level at which I explain it to fellow computer scientists, as any more detailed explanation requires a lot more time. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on a lot of factors, how well do you understand your work? do you like talking about it? how much time to you have to impress or depress this layman? is the location suitable? I assume these have already been considered and you have come to the conclusion to share your work. Personally, I love talking about my research, it's flashy and it can pique interest to hear that I use a 5m2 indoor space to grow 5kg of peppermint and raise 3.5kg of fish in 7wks without soil. But sometimes it can become hectic especially to \u2018laymen\u2019 who speaks/majors in a different language. This is why it is very important that you must have a firm grasp on your work, in this way you can explain it using the simplest terms and still retain the uniqueness/specialization. I have once used the flushing system of a toilet (not the most palatable, but it was the best I could come up with at the time) to explain how an aquaponic system works to a tourist. So if I may, a few tips from my experience; Figure out if this layman is really interested in knowing about your work or its just an ice breaker/ conversation bridge. Knowing the difference between the two can help you gauge how much time you have, for instance if you meet at a fair where stuff is displayed and people generally want to have an idea it is not the time to go too deep/technical. In this case, the fun aspect of your work will suffice (this will either invite Ms. layman for more discussion or cultivate a positive mindset about the work hopefully for the future). How \u2018lay\u2019 is the layman? If you\u2019re working on \u2018blackholes and light theories\u2019 or \u2018the difficulty in pronunciation of certain consonants by the Tiv tribe in central Nigeria\u2019 your layman range could be pretty wide. While it is not always possible to ascertain the level of \u2018layness\u2019 until you begin talking it would help a great deal to pick up cues as you progress and adjust accordingly. It would help greatly to have some aids like pictures or everyday analogies to aid you. I always use nature or google up some pictures. Thankfully that works for me, and I understand it may not be plausible in all cases but whenever possible use an aid. Ask follow-up questions so you know if you\u2019re still carrying your layman along. Sometimes we get so engrossed in our research that we bequeath the same level of knowledge to everyone else. Your work must be exciting enough for you in order to sustain the interest of another. Excitement is contagious, I have easily transmitted interest in aquaponics to staff waiting on me in a hotel just by how I spoke about it to a colleague at a conference. I have also been infected with interest in various fields in this same way. I hope this helps, will add more as i remember. Happy talking! ",

            "answer_text": "I think about it ahead of time. By layman, I assume that you mean an non-scientist, so I have to leave out technical terms (which takes some thought). And I must keep it simple and short because few people want to hear a lecture. In business, this might be called an \u201celevator pitch\u201d, i.e., a short, 30\u201360 second summary. You need to get across the main idea, so you start with the conclusion and then perhaps tell how you know it. I try to think of visual examples because people respond to things that they can imagine. So try to think of a simple way to explain what you do and to describe it in every day things that can be easily visualized. As I said at the top. This takes some thought, so it\u2019s a good idea to think about your elevator pitch, so it is ready when the opportunity presents itself. ",
