            "answer_text": "Course certificates are always good as long as the applicant is as efficient and effective. It should go together, skill plus proof. If someone with an academic award lands a very good job he has to prove his worth. Company this days are more on performance especially when you work remotely or online. The best thing is to choose a legit online platform that will allow you to increase your knowledge and skills in order to be globally competitive. One site I would recommend would be AI Training | Experfy @ Harvard Innovation Lab. They also have 30% off on all courses in line with Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday deals so there, hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "I look at it this way: If an applicant shows that they are investing their own time and intellect into improving themselves, that\u2019s a good thing. If they are doing it without spending a fortune, that means they have some wisdom. If they are taking a subject that has nothing in common in a direct sense to what they want to do for/with me, thatmeans they are intellectually curious, and might be someone I can learn something from. So it\u2019s not a get out of jail free card, but I can\u2019t think of any negatives. Just don\u2019t violate my company\u2019s Acceptable Use Policies. ",
