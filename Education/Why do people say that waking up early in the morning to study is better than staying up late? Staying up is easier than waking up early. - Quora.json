            "answer_text": "When you wake up early in the morning your body will be relaxed both physically and mentally this way you can focus more easily on the task as hand which is studying. Also usually early in the morning the environment will be very quite i.e., no external noise due to traffic, no disturbances from ppl (everyone's asleep  except u :P). Yes, staying up at night is more easier than waking up however, when u stay up all night u are adding more stress to your already tired body from the activities which u have done whole day....So, best thing to do is have a good 6hrs sleep whole night n then waking up early in the morning n start studying with a hot cup of coffee/tea.

            "answer_text": "Let's cut out all other factors like the location, light, pollution, ventilation and etc etc. Simply put, your brain's ability to focus at night is lesser than what it can achieve in the morning. You can compare it to driving at night vs driving in the morning. The tendency of the brain by default is more towards rest at the night time. So you are opposing this tendency and forcing your brain to do the opposite. (Of course don't compare studying with partying at night ;)).  You can of course still do extremely well and score 100% but you would have definitely harmed your system in the process ",
