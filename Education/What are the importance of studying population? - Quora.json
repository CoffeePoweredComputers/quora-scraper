            "answer_text": "The history of population on planet Earth, the recordation of timelines, trends, cycles and patters all serve as clues to an underlying theme being played out in perfect order. One must demonstrate the willingness and courage, however, to go both under below and extend at times uncomfortably beyond their conditioned bandwidth to fully understand the breadth and depth of how and why the ebb and flow of populations of all creatures inhabiting our world have played out. Serving that modus operandi, I would strongly urge you to free yourself of the constrictive, limiting constraints of standardized and formal educational platforms to truly discover how and why populations of all living species on our planet are managed, controlled and manipulated. The study of populations serve as a litmus to the effectiveness of internal and external forces acting upon a given subject group. True numbers don\u2019t lie. It is what we are fed by a global agenda controlled directive that effects both what we are served up in classrooms of our schools and universities and dripped intravenously by way of our mainstream media well deserved of heavy scrutiny and doubt. Prepare to think way outside the box and amass a strong willingness to consider many alternative sources of information and learning. This is the key that unlocks a true portal to a full understanding and nature of populations inhabiting our world. The universe is a most fascinating sandbox of which we are a very small cosmic grain of existence. Dig deep, stay thirsty, open and enthusiastic. I promise it will blow your mind! ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you mean human populations. We study populations to eliminate the bias due to random events and to place individuals in context. For example: -1. If an individual is treated with a drug and gets better this may be due to random chance. This is why we undertake random controlled trials on population groups to establish efficacy.2. If study the genetics of an individual this is interesting but to place the individual in the context of human populations is important. It is in this way that the concept of race has been shown to be without genetic basis; though genetic lineages can be can be demonstrated these do not relate to racial categories.3. Study of historic populations enables us to test historical theories and assumptions that have been generated by other means.These are just 3 random examples as illustration. It is fair to say that without the study of populations we would have little understanding of medicine, history society and indeed many of the attributes that make us human. ",
