            "answer_text": "There are exceptions like the ones mentioned by other quorans. In my experience, the ones that constantly obtained bad grades were either Working in retail or a small company Pregnant after college and married Involved in a pyramid scheme Involved in a get rich quick scheme Posting motivational qoutes on Facebook, preaching that the A students will work for the C students. I do agree that grades do not mean much. Schools and colleges rarely prepare us well for the real world. We don't get taught social skills or basic communication skills. All of which are fundamental just to pass an interview of an internship. What I found in successful C grade students that distinguished them from the mediocre ones is the ability to do hard work. This generation is brainwashed into the entrepreneurship lifestyle. The whole \u201cBe your own boss\u201d jargon. A lot of people claim that they are going to be the next Steve Jobs but they don't realize the amount of hard work and bravery it takes to acheive that level of success. Everyone wants to be rich and successful, but not many want to go through the grind. To take that risk, you will have to face a thousand rejections, face several failed projects, criticism from closed ones and on some days, you can't even afford food. The C students want to be fearless, but fail to take action The A students have the dedication but their bravery is smaller than an ant. As Robert Kiyosaki said \u201cEveryone wants to go to heaven, but don't want to die\u201d. ",
