            "answer_text": "In general I would say no, but it does depend on age. I have once in a while found some older students attractive, certainly, but I would never ever act or show such a thing, much in the same way that I would survive daily life finding random people attractive and moving on with my day. Even when I teach adults (some of whom are even older than myself) I have never once shown or acted upon any attraction I have for them because they are my students and my role as teacher pushes aside everything else.
