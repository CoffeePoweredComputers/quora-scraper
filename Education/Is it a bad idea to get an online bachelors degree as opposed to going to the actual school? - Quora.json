            "answer_text": " As long as you do your homework (pun intended) your online degree is going to be as valuable as a traditional degree. If you choose a major college or university like Arizona State University, nobody is even going to know that you got your degree online. But let\u2019s say your degree is from Western Governors University. Then it is obvious you went to an online school. However WGU has a good reputation\u2014not a problem. What if your diploma is from the for-profit University of Phoenix? Now your degree may or may not be an online degree. Due to the lack of selectivity at this school, if I were interviewing you for a job, I would proceed with caution. There are 4000 colleges and universities in the US. Many of them offer perfectly legitimate online degrees. Whether an online degree is right for you is a different issue. It is going to take some careful planning to get it right. (What I mean by \"right\" is that you invest a reasonable amount of time and money and come away with a good job.) Consider the following issues: Learning Style: Online classes don't fit everyone's learning style. Some people lack the discipline to work in what is a less structured/unstructured environment. Marketable Major: You need to identify a marketable major and find an ACCREDITED online school that provides that program. Cost: The costs vary widely. In-state tuition is a big factor. My advice is to never entry into a degree program without a financial plan that covers the entire, planned term of your education. Institution: Everybody and his brother offers online degrees including major universities, community colleges, for-profits, etc. Personally I would opt for a major, recognizable school like Arizona State University (Starbucks offers free online education to their employees at ASU) vs West Podunk U*. I also have a strong prejudice against the for-profits. (They are not cheap. And look at the list of the ten top schools for student loan defaults. Eight of them are for-profits.) Job Placement: Check to see if you're going to get help finding employment. The lack of job placement services is a red flag. Financial Aid: Does the institution qualify for Federal Direct loans? What other sources of financial aid are available? Competency-based: Some programs take into account your life experiences in constructing your curriculum. This shortens the time to get a degree and reduces the cost. Examples are the University of Wisconsin--Flexible Option and Western Governors University. Note: There is some confusion on this subject. It comes from confusing the lack of selectivity of some schools, e.g. for-profits, with the delivery mechanism. Purdue University just bought Kaplan University. (The Purdue faculty wasn\u2019t thrilled by this.) My guess is that Purdue wanted Kaplan University\u2019s infrastructure to be able to deliver distance learning. ",

            "answer_text": "No, a degree is a degree and what matters most is what school you got it from and whether or not it is a certified school rather than a for profit non-certified. A degree is the same all around as long as it is from a real university, it will not state in any form how you achieved to get it and only show that you finished the credit necessary to obtain the degree so if online is the best way for you to finish your education then go for it. It is better than nothing. ",
