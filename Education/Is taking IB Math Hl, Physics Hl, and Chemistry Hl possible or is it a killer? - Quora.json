            "answer_text": "You know what, this is the short answer: No, it is not a killer. I have done the diploma programme May this year, and our college\u2019s valedictorian scores 45/45 IB point despite of taking Maths, Physics and Chemistry HL. He always got 100 in tests. He got unconditional offer for engineering course in semester 3 though (IB has 4 semesters), I am not sure from which university in Canada but I believe it is McGill. Those who chose those subject combination in their IB gains my respect. Personally, I think it is very though. But if you have a good discipline, mark this word: DISCIPLINE, you will and can do it. The main thing you have to know is that, you must believe in yourself that you can do it. If somebody could do it, so can you! In fact, you can do much better! :) I believe you can do it as long as you have the strong will. The strong will will surpass your doubt on yourself. Go for it! ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of students who take these courses and are successful. They are also industrious and utilize their time well. There are also students who find this type of load extremely challenging and beyond the scope of their real abilities. I have one rule about the DP program when I advise students. Choose classes that you will enjoy taking. Do not try to get your undergraduate degree in your 2 final years of high school. You will be miserable. If you have the inclination for these type of classes and have taken prep classes preferably in all of them, then I might advise this as a possibility. There are many, many factors to consider before deciding. Too many to give you an honest answer really. I can tell you from my experience. This is a very tough set of HL\u2019s to sign up to take. ",
