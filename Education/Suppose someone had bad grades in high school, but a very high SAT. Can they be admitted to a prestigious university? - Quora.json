            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not impossible, but generally speaking, the odds are stacked well against you unless you have other stuff on your application that makes up for that. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t apply. But don\u2019t start looking for an apartment in Palo Alto. You should\u2019ve buckled down and gotten better grades. Usually, ideal applicants have both (1) very high SATs, (2) very high GPAs. And a whole bunch of other stuff. People need to stop asking whether there are exceptions to the general proposition that most elite college students have (1) good to excellent GPAs, (2) good to excellent test scores, (3) have other stuff in their files that also show they\u2019re individuals with potential. Are exceptions made? Yes, of course there are. Are the odds high that\u2019s going to be you? No, and if you have to ask, you\u2019re not likely that person. If your goals aren\u2019t nearly so lofty as Stanford or Harvard though, are you likely to get into a university somewhere? Yes, absolutely. ",

From what I could gather they didn\u2019t seem to care about high school or much about school in general; they just happened to be intelligent and do well on those type of exams, almost always the math part. For those that did go on to college they went to a junior college first as they had no shot at getting jnto a regular four year with horrible high school grades. Ultimately, yes, one could be admitted if he/she attended either junior college or a regular four year and had good enough grades and good enough graduate exam scores to be at admitted into an Ivy League or PAC-10 grad school.
