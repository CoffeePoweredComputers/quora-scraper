            "answer_text": "For me, the benefit was figuring out what I didn\u2019t know. And it turns out that was a lot. Aside from the actual knowledge you will learn, you\u2019re forced to sit in an environment with other intellectually acute people and learn from them. When else in your life are you given such an opportunity to stop and reflect on your life and your goals, through the lenses of various business subjects and peers? Then, of course, there\u2019s the network, and when you\u2019re walking around campus there\u2019s no mistaking that you\u2019re in the Ivy League. Its one thing to get educated; it\u2019s another to be supported by the pride and camaraderie everyone feels by having \u201cmade it\u201d to one of the most acclaimed institutions in modern society. That makes for a very helpful group of alums who are ready and willing to give you a hand up. Many here on Quora talk about the \u201cbenefits\u201d of an MBA and of an Ivy League MBA specifically, and many go on about this or that feature. But, many miss what I consider to be the most prescient point: Are you an Ivy League MBA? In other words, is it in your identity? If it is, no amount of tuition or ROI calculations will deter you from applying and going for it. And, if you think you could get all that knowledge and networking from somewhere else, that\u2019s probably a sign that earning an Ivy League MBA isn\u2019t all that important to your identity. Because if it\u2019s not important to your identity, there are a lot of other ways to spend a small mortgage and hundreds of hours of your life. ",

            "answer_text": "The same as the benefit of getting a Pac 10 PhD, or an SEC certificate in underwater basket weaving. Namely, none at all. Why? Because none of these things exist. The Ivy League is a Division I NCAA athletic conference. It does not confer degrees. And an MBA is a graduate degree. Graduate students do not in general compete in NCAA sports. The best business schools in the world are, in any case, not all ( or even mostly ) affiliated with colleges whose undergraduates compete in the Ivy League. But to answer the question I'm sure you meant to ask, a business degree from a top school should prepare you for a management role in a major corporation or other institution. ",
