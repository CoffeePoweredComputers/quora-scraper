In general it\u2019s going to take about a 3.5 GPA to make the cut on the academic side of things. Academics are a big piece of the application process, but not everything. Assuming you are in high school, ask your guidance counselor for the contact info for your school\u2019s ALO. Get in touch with this person and ask for their assistance. In addition to academics (and qualifying medically to be an Air Force Officer) I suggest you focus on \u2018leadership\u2019 situations in high school. All the Service academies value things like Scouts, sports, club activities, elected office in school, volunteer work, etc. Pick a few things that interest you and focus on them. Your ALO will tell you that you also need a Nomination (Nom) from a U.S. Senator or a Congressperson. So, get in touch with your school\u2019s ALO as soon as possible. Be early, not late! Best wishes. ",
