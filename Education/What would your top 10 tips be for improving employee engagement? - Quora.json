            "answer_text": "15 Employee Engagement activities 1. Involve employees in your business planning process Every 6 months, or even quarterly, present the most important issues in your company and the actions made to address those issues. Involve your team in planning ahead, assessing opportunities and coming up with improvement ideas for your business strategy. By promoting transparency and offering them a strategic insight into how the company is being managed, you\u2019ll foster loyalty and you\u2019ll also have a prepared leadership pipeline. 2. Create a knowledge sharing system One of the biggest costs of a high employee turnover rate is the loss of essential information. A knowledge sharing system helps you avoid that cost, to some extent, and it\u2019s also a great engagement driver for newcomers. You can have a mentorship program, pairing experienced employees with newly hired ones or use communication software. Create a learning program template that they should follow, giving them enough space to test their own learning methods. Give them a timeframe, a set of objectives and let the relationship unfold on its own. 3. Encourage knowledge sharing in a creative way Teams are oftentimes isolated within their own project and their own workspace, that they have no idea what the rest of the company is doing. Create an open sharing space, once every 2 months or so, where every team can present updates on their project and key learning points. Teams will evolve much more rapidly, using the knowledge shared and the different experiences on every project. To minimize the risk of this turning into a boring, mandatory 2h meeting, make it fun and creative. You can have a theme per each sharing session. For example, this month\u2019s theme is \u201cMafia movies\u201d and the Sales team decides to present its updates in a Godfather-like manner. Remember, creativity is a key happiness driver. You should also try the Happiness at Work Card Game for teams! Designed as a tool for team performance and employee engagement, the game consists of over 50 common workplace scenarios and over 100 science-based solutions. Each scenario identifies and provides context for a common workplace situation, followed by a succinct scientific justification for why it is a problem at work. Each solution falls within one of four categories: Practice Positivity, Subdue Stress, Flow to Goals, and Revitalize Relationships. The cards provide many unique practice opportunities that meet the needs and working styles of diverse teams. 4. Show them the money Nothing builds trust like showing someone your financial statement. And that\u2019s exactly what you should do in your company. Josh Carlile, who\u2019s the CEO at leading paper writing service WritingsGuru explains: Nothing builds trust like showing someone your financial statement. And that\u2019s exactly what you should do in your company. Give your team a quick presentation of the financial state of your company, every quarter or at the end of the year. Show them how everyone\u2019s efforts are linked together, set bold objectives for the next months and get everyone involved in meeting those objectives. You\u2019ll notice that this activity links back to the 1st one. Encourage employees to take responsibility for the success of the company if you want them to put in their discretionary effort. 5. Encourage and provide learning opportunities Create your own Academy, where employees can access the knowledge and development opportunities that they need. This is one of the top 3 reasons why employees quit companies: lack of learning prospects. Assess their needs and their preferences, create a curriculum and set-up 1-2 classes per week. Get them involved in deciding how you should schedule these learning initiatives (during or after working hours). Make it engaging and rewarding with a Graduation ceremony, caps and flowers and even a fun night out. 6. Mens sana in corpore sano Have your own Office Olympics where everyone can get involved and have fun. Promote wellbeing and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle in a fun, competitive way. Get to know each other in a different environment and connect people with the same interests. It\u2019s a great chance to get some of those chair-numbed-muscles going and bond in a friendly competition. Prizes and embarrassing photos are a must. 7. Have a hack night Break monotony with an ambitious working night. Set a clear objective, create your own set of rules (breaks, music, snacks, etc.) and try to be as productive as possible in just one night. Get everyone together and test your creative and operational limits. I promise it\u2019s going to be really fun! Here\u2019s how the team at HubSpot got together to create 200 hours\u2019 worth of marketing content in one hack night. 8. Create excitement about upcoming opportunities Make sure you communicate upcoming opportunities on a regular basis. Get employees excited and striving for what\u2019s next. Do it in your internal newsletter, face-to-face or during a general update meeting. If they\u2019re excited about what\u2019s next, they\u2019ll do their best and reply with a \u201cNo, thank you\u201d to those irritating poaching emails from your competition. Keep in mind that a career processes should be driven by individual potential as well as current opportunities. 9. Let them create their own onboarding experience Create a self-guided onboarding experience. People are much more likely to remember and assimilate information that they get on their own. Set the ground rules, give them basic instructions, a list of objectives and a timeframe. For example a 60 days plan, with some basic milestones. Let them swim on their own. Oftentimes, onboarding processes fail to provide actual value and initiate a dialogue. Let new employees create their own onboarding experience and figure out their work preferences. 10. Make onboarding fun Have a scavenger hunt onboarding. Turn information that is usually considered boring or useless into company trivia and learning how to use tools and systems, such as the internal communication system. Include other people in the game. For example, have some of the older employees provide answers and get to know the new hires. 11. Create your own internal magazine Create your internal employee-focused magazine with fun columns, news, featured stories and opportunities. Who wouldn\u2019t like to be featured on the cover as Employee of the Month? It can be an online magazine or a printed one. Or, it can be both, a monthly online issue and a quarterly printed one. 12. TEDx [InsertCompanyNameHere]. Sounds good right? Have your own company TEDx-like Talks where you get to share ideas, boost creativity and encourage innovation. Make your workplace less about work and more about the people there. Their ideas, experiences and aspirations. Give them a chance to be the source of their own inspiration, boosting morale and creativity for everyone in the company. You can make it an event of its own or include it in another event that you\u2019re already planning. 13. The League of Extraordinary Managers Managers are a key business component and an equally important engagement driver. Create a coaching program for managers and teach them to really care. Coach them towards maximum contribution and satisfaction, align them with the organization\u2019s strategy, mission and values and show them how to recognize attitude, effort and results. 14. \u201cI am my own hero\u201d Encourage individuals to design and own their career paths, instead of relying on the company or on their manager. Employees need to take initiative and set a career goal for themselves. Have people write their goal on a piece of paper. Put it in an envelope and close it. Then, after 6 months or a year, give them the sealed envelopes back to see if they\u2019ve realized that goal. For this activity, managers have a guiding role. They can understand and help align employees\u2019 aspirations with the organization\u2019s career development point of view. 15. Give back Get involved in social and charity initiatives. Giving back creates a positive mentality. It also fosters pride and loyalty. Get the team together, have everyone pitch a cause and pick the one you want to support. It\u2019s important that you make it personal, that you make it count. You can donate either time and involvement, or money, or both. Usually, giving time is more rewarding than giving money, especially for gen Y employees, who are highly oriented towards social involvement.[1] Footnotes[1] 15 Employee Engagement activities that you can start doing now",

            "answer_text": "At Steer we\u2019ve wrote extensively about Employee Engagement, and how to improve it in order to build and maintain a team without issues. In one of our blog post, we explain the 10 Employee Engagement Best Practices: 1. Build trust and default to open It\u2019s not surprising that employees put greater trust in their bosses when they know them on a personal level. Showing your human side becomes the biggest untapped source of employee engagement! \u201cDefault to open\u201d is another way to build trust and be human. This means equal access to information from the start, then choose what, if anything, needs to be confidential. 2. Employee engagement starts at the top An important best practice when trying to improve your employee engagement is that management is the model for change you\u2019re hoping to see. You could preach engagement to your employees on a daily basis, but it\u2019s going to be hypocritical if you can\u2019t prove that you are engaged. Giving every project 110%, being a consistent and lead by example is the best way to embody the level of engagement you\u2019re looking to see. 3. Promote health and well-being According to Deborah Schroeder-Saulnier argues that both retention and employee engagement can be increased if leaders focus on initiatives that drive feelings of health and well-being among employees. Actions such as encouraging an appropriate work-life balance, supporting the local community and investing in employees\u2019 learning and development are key drivers of well-being. 4. Reduce stress According to The Human Performance Institute, \u201cPersonal energy is the most critical resource we have as human beings, and when reserves are chronically depleted, an inevitable outcome is disengagement.\u201d By promoting stress reduction techniques among the workforce, employers can help ensure energy levels and productivity are high and engagement remains a top priority. 5. Share goals and responsibilities If employees don\u2019t know what to do, it\u2019s no wonder employee engagement is suffering. Being engaged means being on top of the situation. This is next to impossible when there are doubts about actual goals and responsibilities. Articulating goals and responsibilities in a clear manner is essential to improve employee engagement. This requires more than just verbal articulation, too. 6. Coach those who aren\u2019t performing well You can\u2019t expect every member of your staff to perform at an exceptional level at all times. More often than not, there are going to be a few individuals that need a helping hand\u2026 especially if they\u2019re new to the organization or are stumped on a particular project. Giving special attention to these employees will not only fix the problem, but it shows that you care enough to help. 7. Create frequent feedback mechanisms Employee feedback is the core of personal and professional growth. 4 out of 10 workers are actively disengaged when they get little or no feedback. Give frequent feedback can help an employee get better at what they do, and surprisingly employees crave feedback. And it\u2019s also beneficial for the company, since it also helps with the reduce employee turnover: 14.9% lower turnover rates in companies that implement regular employee feedback. 8. Track and communicate progress Employees are no different than leadership\u200a\u2014\u200athey both want to work for a \u2018winning\u2019 organization. Leaders need to reinforce \u201cline of sight\u201d by telling their employees where they\u2019re going, how they\u2019re performing, and where they fit in. 9. Focus on communication, the cornerstone of employee engagement Communication is the core of the culture. Employees understand the \u201cwhy\u201d behind their jobs\u200a\u2014\u200awhat they\u2019re expected to achieve and why it\u2019s important to the greater good of the organization. Collaboration is valued and teams communicate globally to get projects accomplished. Leaders listen to employee feedback and encourage it, and recognize the power of a robust communication plan, one built on clarity, consistency, and transparency. 10. Make it a daily focus It\u2019s common for management to discuss employee engagement and obsess over making major changes to improve it. While their hearts are usually in the right place, this \u201call or nothing\u201d approach results in a form of burnout. To improve employee engagement levels in your organization, you have to make it a daily focus. Being consistent with your approach and taking small steps will be more effective than trying to overhaul your business in a matter of days. ",
