            "answer_text": "Let us assume that the maximum marks that can be awarded is 'm'. The boy scored 35% of the maximum marks. This means, (35/100) * m = Marks obtained. But he falls short by 10 marks to pass the exam. Therefore marks required for passing = Marks obtained + 10 Passing marks = (35/100) * m + 10. Now if he had scored 46% of the maximum marks i.e. (46/100) * m He would have cleared his passing marks by 12. This means that the 46% is more than passing marks by 12. Passing marks = (46 /100) * m - 12. Equating both the values of passing marks (35/100) * m + 10 = (46/100) * m - 12. Taking like terms on the same sides. 10 + 12 = ( 46/100) * m - (35/100) * m 22 = (11/100) * m (22/11) * 100 = m m = 200 = Maximum Marks. Now putting this value of 'm' in any of the 2 passing marks equations formed earlier. Passing marks = (35/100) * m + 10. = (35/100) * 200 + 10. = 80. ",
