            "answer_text": "We all know how important sleep is. According to scientists, a good night\u2019s sleep could be the key to living longer, slimming down and even snagging a pay rise. But if you lie awake worrying about not getting enough, or wake up feeling groggy despite getting an early night, you\u2019re not alone. Find out what time you should really be going to bed and what you can do to make your time in the land of nod count\u2026 How much sleep do I need? The amount of sleep we need is genetically determined and varies with age. Up to 5% of the population is \u2018pre-programmed\u2019 to get by on as few as 3 hours sleep a night whilst others need up to 9 hours. However, most of us seem to require about 7 hours in order to function at our best. If you find yourself craving sweets, caffeine, and carbohydrates when you wake up and often catch yourself thinking about sleep during the day, you\u2019re probably not getting enough. However, if you wake up without an alarm clock at the same time each day, you\u2019re probably on track. What time should I go to bed? But it\u2019s not all about quantity. Quality counts too. Sleep experts suggest that a 10pm-6am sleep schedule tallies best with our natural circadian rhythms. \u201cWhen it comes to bedtime, there\u2019s a window of several hours \u2013 roughly between 8 pm and 12 am \u2013 during which your brain and body have the opportunity to get all the non-REM and REM shuteye they need to function optimally\u201d. However, if you wake up midway through a sleep cycle, you may still feel tired and groggy, regardless of the number of hours you\u2019ve spent in dreamland. Why? A good night\u2019s sleep consists of 5-6 complete 90-minute sleep cycles for the average adult. Since it takes most people about 15 minutes to fall asleep after going to bed, this means that, if you want to wake up feeling refreshed at 7 am, you should go to bed at 9.45pm or 11.15pm. If you\u2019re more of a night owl, you might feel more refreshed in the morning if you wait until 12.45am to hop under the covers rather than bedding in at 11.45pm. ",

            "answer_text": " As a Certified Sleep Science Coach I can tell you that: If you\u2019re a typical healthy adult you need to get a minimum of 7\u20138 hours of sleep most nights, for optimal health and well-being. The negative psychological effects of sleep deprivation can start after a single night of poor quality sleep or getting less than 7 hours. And a recent study found that one of those negative effects is not even realizing you\u2019re experiencing a cognitive deficit. And strong sleep science suggest that getting 6 hours of sleep each night be worse for you than getting no sleep. Not only that but: Brain scans of sleep deprived people by scientists at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) have shown for the first time that fatigue disrupts the speed the brain cells communicate and prevents memories being encoded properly. It also causes temporary lapses in memory and vision \u201cInadequate sleep exerts a similar influence on our brain as drinking too much. Yet no legal or medical standards exist for identifying over-tired drivers on the road the same way we target drunk drivers.\" Source: Sleep deprivation stops brain cells firing properly, changing how we see the world Ideally, you want go to bed at the same time each night and wake up at around the same time to.
