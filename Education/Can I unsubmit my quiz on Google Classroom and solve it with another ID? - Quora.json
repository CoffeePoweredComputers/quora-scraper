            "answer_text": "If your teacher assigned the quiz through Google Classroom, then no, you cannot take it again with another ID. The quiz was assigned to your student account. Only people with those accounts are able to fill in that Google form. Additionally, your teacher sees the grade in his or her Google Classroom, so even if you took it again with a different ID, the grade wouldn't go to into the correct location. As for unsubmitting the quiz, that should not be an option. Assignments can be unsubmitted, but if the teacher set it up as a Google quiz, that form cannot be unsubmitted. Even when you unsubmit assignments in Google Classroom, your teacher still gets a notification and can see that the assignment has changed. Your teacher can choose to allow a retake of the quiz, but outside of that, the grade is whatever you got on the first take. ",
