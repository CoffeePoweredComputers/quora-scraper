Learn Networking Concepts Another important and essential step to becoming a hacker is to be good at networking concepts and understanding how the networks are created. You want to know the variations between different kinds of networks and must have an explicit knowledge of TCP/IP and UDP protocols to exploit vulnerabilities (loopholes) in the system. Understanding what\u2019s LAN, WAN, VPN, Firewall is also necessary. You must have a clear knowledge and use of network tools such as NMAP for packet analyzing, Wireshark, network scanning, etc. Step 4.

            "answer_text": "You should learn everything there is to know about whatever it is you want to hack. Computer hacks are discovered by understanding how computers work, how computers communicate, and how protocols work. For example, when you go to a website your computer sends out packets, the server receives those packets and sends back packets as a response. You need to learn what\u2019s in those packets, you need to understand \u201chow does another computer know if what is in this packet is legitimate?\u201d And then you need to ask \u201cIs there some way I can forge the information in this packet to cause the server to give me access to something it shouldn\u2019t?\u201d One of the common ways servers are compromised are SQL hacks on incorrectly configured servers. These are carried out by adding queries into the url that an incorrectly configured server will respond to. In order to be a \u2018real\u2019 hacker you have to deeply understand what you\u2019re dealing with, and figure out where someone has made a mistake. You also have to try things that aren\u2019t supposed to work. A simple example of this is when I worked for a small company where we were still on a dial up connection that was shared with two computers. I needed to download some files that would have taken at least a day to download on our connection so I drove over to a motel across the street that had an unsecured wireless network. However, when I connected I was greeted with a login page that wanted my room number, last name, and a password. I put in something like 123 for my room number, asdfasf as my last name and then asdfasdfasdf as my password just to see what would happen and was connected to the network, got online, and downloaded my files. Keep in mind that a human is always the weakest link in security. Before computer/network security started to become mainstream, gaining access to a company\u2019s information could be had just by calling someone up and pretending to be company IT and asking someone for their password. The same thing goes for locks. Just because you\u2019re told you can\u2019t unlock a lock unless you have a certain key, does that really mean that\u2019s true? Ask the guys that invented lock picking kits, or more recently \u201cbump keys\u201d. If you really understand how something works, you can figure out ways to make it do things it\u2019s not supposed to do. Knowledge is power. ",
