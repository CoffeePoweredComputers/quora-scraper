            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really not practical to expect to learn Arabic in 6 months. I did one of the fastest Arabic programs known, the Defense Language Institute Arabic Course. It met all day, every day with native speakers as teachers for 63 weeks. After completing the course, I knew a lot but was still far from fluent. That was about 15 months worth of Arabic and it equated to something like 10 semesters of Arabic in college, contact-hour-wise. There is simply no way a non-native speaker of Arabic is going to learn the language in six months under normal circumstances. That being said, you can probably learn a lot in six months, but you are going to have to do about the same thing I did. You will have to do Arabic all day, every day under almost-ideal circumstances. If you could live in an Arabic-speaking country or in some total-immersion situation and take formal classes along with using Arabic outside of class, you could probably become fairly fluent at a moderate level. If you were to spend almost no time on learning the alphabet or grammar, you could probably learn quite a bit quickly. Arabic grammar isn\u2019t really all that hard anyway if you just treat it like any language. The toughest part is getting used to seeing words and sentences in the Arabic alphabet. You have probably spent your whole life getting used to seeing words in English like this. Using a completely different set of symbols means having to learn visual recognition and it\u2019s harder than anyone thinks. It\u2019s possible to learn the alphabet itself in a couple of weeks, but to go from having to sound everything out to being able to recognize whole words takes a LONG time. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! , the fastest way to learn a language in general is to speak with native speakers everyday that way you learn common words and phrases so you can communicate with a native speaker about everyday things and basic stuff but you can't really understand more than that unless you have more time to learn how to write and read Arabic and learn grammar and other things ,so the literary Arabic or standard Arabic isn't used between native speakers instead there are different dialects it depends on which Arab country you are in so learning an Arabic dialect is a fast way to be able to communicate with native speakers , I think it is unlikely that anyone can be fluent in a language in only 6 months especially if it is a hard language like Arabic ,but I suggest you pick a dialect that is easy and start from basic stuff like learning the alphabet ,learning common words and sentences ,hearing the right way to pronounce letters is extremely important as well as vocabulary and speaking with a native speaker also learning what you can from standard Arabic is helpful before you start learning a dialect , I think the Egyptian Arabic dialect is understood in a lot of Arab countries but the Levantine dialect is closer to the standard Arabic .
