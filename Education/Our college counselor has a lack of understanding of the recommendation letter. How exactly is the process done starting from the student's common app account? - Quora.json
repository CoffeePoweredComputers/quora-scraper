            "answer_text": "When a student creates their Common App account they have the ability to send out requests for letters of recommendation to their teachers/employers/principal etc. They will need the person\u2019s email address to do this. The recommender then must create their own Common App account where they can access the profile(s) of those who have requested a recommendation. The recommender completes a short series of questions and then uploads a copy of the recommendation which will be converted to PDF format if it is already not in that format. (I always had our guidance department put my LOR\u2019s on school letterhead and then send me that in PDF to upload). The whole process is pretty clear cut and becomes second nature after having done it once or twice and the help desk at the Common App is useful if needed. BONUS CONTENT: Make sure to ask your teachers before sending the email asking for a LOR. It is kind of rude to do it that way, especially if that teacher is going to decline writing you a recommendation.Leave your teachers at least a month\u2019s time before you need this done as many of us do actually put a fair amount of time into writing a good recommendation.Select your recommenders thoughtfully. Who can tell a compelling story about who you are? Who writes good LOR\u2019s? (your guidance counselor will know).The Common App is a great thing in that it will allow recommenders to file their LOR\u2019s electronically and securely. Make sure that you check the box waiving your rights to read your recommendations. If you don\u2019t trust what someone is going to write about you, then why are you asking them in the first place?The Common App provides a means for you to upload your own vital info ONCE rather than retyping it 6\u201312 times. Each college you apply to may have its own essay prompts in addition to the traditional 5 or 6 on the Common App. Make sure you have thoroughly completed any additional essays (very common for highly competitive schools).When you are ready to submit applications, proofread everything twice! AND ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT\u2026MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SUBMITTED BOTH YOUR DATA AND YOUR ADDITIONAL ESSAYS!!! (Depending on your screen magnification you may or may not notice that you have a couple submit buttons to click so please be careful\u2026don\u2019t ask how I know this :-(",

            "answer_text": "Let me show you from the teachers side: whoever you put in for the application will receive this letter.  they will then be prompted to complete similar questions to this, so even if someone doesn't know how to write a letter it's no biggie!  By the way - I've only ever done it from the teachers side, but unless it's required, I would switch your recommendations to teachers or employees of the school who know you very well. ",
