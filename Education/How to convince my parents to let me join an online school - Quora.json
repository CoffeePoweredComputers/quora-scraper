            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t guarantee that you will be able convince your mom to allow you to do an online school, but here are some things to prepare to discuss with her. Part One: Explain the benefits of online school In the question details, you say that you will be happier if you do online school. That\u2019s nice, but why would you be happier? You\u2019ll need to support that claim with some specific details. What other benefits are there? Happiness is nice, but what else does online school have to offer? Those benefits aren\u2019t necessarily the same for everyone, depending on what their other options are and what kind of student they are. Some possibilities could be: flexible scheduling, working at your own pace, being away from bullies at your local school, not being around people who are sick (if you have health problems), no traffic/commute to school, better education (if your local schools are not very good). It\u2019s really on you to come up with a few ways in which online school would be better than a local school. I think you should have at least 3 of them. Part Two: Address Mom\u2019s concerns about online school In the question details, you mention that she doesn\u2019t want you to be home alone all day. [EDIT: Chelle Gordon states in her answer that K12, the specific school you mentioned, requires that an adult be home with the student and serve as a learning coach. So you might need to find a different online school or totally drop the discussion now.] This is a big concern, and you need to take it seriously. How independent and responsible are you? How much time do you spend home alone right now? How much of a self-starter are you when it comes to getting your chores done around the house? Can your mom really trust you to attend your online classes and complete your assignments on your own, when she\u2019s at work? You\u2019ll need to demonstrate to her that you are capable of managing yourself and your education. I used to provide speech therapy online to cyber school students. I worked for a speech therapy company that contracted with a lot of different schools. For some schools, it was a requirement that there was an adult at home with the student during our speech therapy sessions. They didn\u2019t have to participate in the session, but they had to be home. And I can tell you that my students from that school had much better attendance and participation than the students from another school that didn\u2019t have that requirement. I remember one student in particular who never showed up \u2014 not once \u2014 the entire time she was on my caseload. Her mom was at work and couldn\u2019t get her to attend her sessions. When my husband and I decided that online school would be a good choice for our son, I quit my job. Even though I had been working online from home, we didn\u2019t trust him to work independently during the time that I was with my students. Supervising his online education is my job now. Most of the families I know who have students in online school, whether I knew them from my job or through parent groups, have a parent at home pretty much full-time. She might also be concerned that being home alone all day will not be good for you socially and emotionally. That is also a legitimate concern, especially since she won\u2019t be taking you on field trips or meetups with other online or home-schooling families. Tell her your plans for addressing your social needs. Do you have some activities outside of school that you\u2019ll be participating in? Some examples could be a team sport, a church youth group, scouts, martial arts, etc. You will need to have some kind of regular contact with people outside of your house. This is easier for some people than others. ",

            "answer_text": "Although this question was asked over a year ago, maybe someone will read the answers now and get some good help from what\u2019s written. My daughter is starting her sophomore year in a few days. Last week I told her we really need to go get your school clothes. Usually she is thrilled about clothes shopping opportunities. Right then she told me she had been thinking about doing online school this year. Our school district has a great, easily accessed online school program. She told me her reasons she would feel better doing online school full time. (She had taken one online class last semester) .She had so much anxiety last year about school she would worry about stuff and make herself sick in all different ways and either not go to school, or need to come home from school. Each day of school she missed made it so much harder to keep up with her tough classes that require some instruction, like physics and algebra. If she missed two days of a unit she would fail the unit test. The teachers don\u2019t make time to help kids that need extra attention. If she needs an extra hour of help a week that\u2019s not gonna happen. Teachers here have too many students for each kid to get the extra help if they need it. Although she is popular, and has no problems making friends, there is still unhealthy drama, harassment and abuse committed on her by male and female students. There are frequent violent physical fights at school, it\u2019s been a problem since 7th grade, especially between female students that make her , and me, fear for her safety. She was once pushed forward by another girl and told to \u201cgo beat her down\u201d. She backed out quickly: before she was touched by another student. But how scary! She feels pressure to spend at least an hour each morning straightening her hair and applying makeup just right, so she isn\u2019t made fun of for looking\u201dratchet\u201d. I feel bad for her. I have known all this, but I thought she was willing to stay for the social part of school. She has good friends, fun, was on homecoming court, goes to all sport activities. She isn\u2019t willing to hurt every day any more. She can see her friends every day, just later. She can still go to games. She will still be enrolled in the district and be able to attend all sport events and dances. She still has a student body card. Still gets class pictures. Still has a teacher for each class. She can go to the physical online academy school building and get help or study or get materials she may need, any or every day. There are core teachers there full time. A principal. A wellness counselor and a traditional school counselor that helps with school planning and college prep stuff. We met with the principal of the online academy yesterday. It was amazing. MY daughter is excited for school to start. Instead of new school clothes she got a new school laptop that is hers, not the families, not a tablet or chrome. There are way better electives available through the online academy than at the traditional high school. And if at any time she wants to take a class at the physical school for some reason she can. Like if it\u2019s hard to do her Spanish 2 class without a class of people to work with, face to face, she can just take that class at the high school. But there Are language instructors at the online school too. She can go to the building and work with them too, or online. Her school starts the same as the physical HS. September 5th. She will go there that day, get her pictures done and student body card. Meet all the teachers and all the other online students, who she will interact with online sometimes. She can ask questions of more experienced online students. And after that day she will only go there if she wants for help or for testing. Otherwise she will make her schedule at home. We made an agreement that she would have a work plan for each week so she doesn\u2019t struggle or procrastinate. She won\u2019t be able to go out with friends unless she\u2019s up to date with work in each class. But that\u2019s the only restriction. She can get a job now if she wants, without restrictions on day hours like other HS students. She can hang with me on days and go do cool stuff. We can go to all kinds of tours, shows, plays, galleries, museums. There is so much to learn and see OUTSIDE the school building. I feel very optimistic about the opportunities this experience opens for my daughter. I hope my family\u2019s experience with choosing the online school option can help people and give people ideas about how to approach the situation. Oh, there were challenges with this decision. Her father and step father both think this online school plan is a bad idea. They think it means she is dropping out of school. All I can suggest is inviting them to the meeting with principal and orientation so they can get a better idea about what\u2019s happening. Also fully disclose to them the reasons why traditional isn\u2019t working for you. Maybe they don\u2019t know your struggles. I think ,deep in their hearts ,they just want you to succeed and be happy. The men in our problem seemed to believe that since they had to \u201csuck it up and suffer through high school\u201d ( these were the exact words) they think our kids should be forced to do the same. I defended the choice. I told reminded them that 25/ 30 years ago there were not these amazing options for students. We didn\u2019t have the same kinds of problems in schools as our kids face daily. We did have gigantic classes where teachers didn\u2019t have time for us. Things have changed and our children can have a better education and education experience than we did. I did tell my ex husband that just because he suffered doesn\u2019t mean our daughter needs to suffer. Sounds like a him problem, not a her problem. Good luck! Online school is an awesome option for some students ",

A decision about your schooling should not be made by a child. That\u2019s why college is for 18 year olds and not younger. Any younger than that and your frontal lobe isn\u2019t capable of really processing the long term implications of your decision. In other words, it\u2019s not your job to decide how you go to school. If you say they\u2019re avoiding the discussion, my guess is they\u2019ve already answered you and you just want to open a discussion they don\u2019t want to have. Let it go and move forward with your life. As for online school, it\u2019s a bad plan unless it\u2019s the only option left. In a world where the fastest growing addiction is internet addiction, we\u2019re now throwing our children into the thick of that addiction for hours every day in the name of education.

This would be a last resort but very convincing so that they can trust you with it.Extra curricular: Same as the last bullet for college.You can increase your chances of getting into a good college if you have gotten some classes or credits done online.It's a more useful use of time then playing games or out partying.Similar reasons for both but I mean they could all qualify for each other.

My eldest has gone back to brick and mortar for social reasons and my youngest will return because he needs the discipline of having peers and a one on one teacher. Tell your mother that you'd like to try it for a semester and see how you do. You must have very strong self-starting abilities and be able to complete hard assignments by yourself. If you can do this, you'll flourish in homeschooling/online schooling. If you know you need to be constantly pushed, one semester won't mess you up too bad but give you working knowledge about the options. ",

There are a lot of things that they completely don\u2019t explain. They leave it to the learning coach to explain how something works. This is pretty lousy, as there is no requirement that the learning coach be well-educated. Fortunately, I knew everything they left out of his 4th grade program. But if you don\u2019t have a learning coach, who is going to help you with the stuff they leave out? This might not be relevant, but anyone reading should also know this: K12 doesn\u2019t deal well with disabilities. I could go on and on about how poorly they handled that situation. Finally, while the advertisements say that they provide (a few) social opportunities, they never actually provided any. Apparently, that only applies if you live in a large, metro area. Even then, a few events a year will not replace daily/weekly socialization with peers. If you are having difficulty socializing with your peers, try talking to someone about that. Try a school counselor, your parents, or a trusted teacher. ",
