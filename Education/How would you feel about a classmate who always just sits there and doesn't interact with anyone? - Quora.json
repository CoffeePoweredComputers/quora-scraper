            "answer_text": "Hey, that\u2019s me! People generally don\u2019t think, or well, feel about me much because my presence is barely felt. In fact, a lot of my classmates forget my name, or even my existence after a year. It\u2019s pretty funny. Some people may get curious and ask me why I\u2019m always alone, or why I don\u2019t talk a lot, etc. but they generally leave me alone, like how I leave them all alone. On my side, I just prefer to observe people rather than interact with them. It\u2019s my way of having fun. I can socialize if I want to, but I just like seeing other people do it. I have an affectionate term for people like us - the loner club. (It\u2019s like an oxymoron, get it? Because you\u2019re a loner\u2026 in a club) Sometimes there\u2019s more than one loner in a class. I find comfort in them, for they\u2019re comfortable with silence as I am. I usually end up being friends with them after many class parties wherein we end up at the back of the class being loners next to each other. I think they\u2019re generally really chill people. Some actually want to socialize but are insecure to do so, which is where the power of the loner club comes in. If I make friends with a \u2018loner\u2019, then we will interact with each other. This breaks the fear of talking to others as they find it easier to talk to someone who\u2019s of similar temperament to them. Eventually I start inviting more people to \u2018the loner club\u2019, through lunch invitations, projects, etc. and the end result is a group of loners! The best thing about these people is that we\u2019re pretty independent from \u2018just sitting there and not interacting\u2019, so it\u2019s quite a nice relationship to share. No pressure to always be with each other due to needing company, no need for small talk, no hard feelings for suddenly needing to be alone or quiet, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "As a person who always sits there and doesn\u2019t interact with anyone, I can say that I\u2019m just simply shy lol. This may differ from others, they are very likely to think very differently than I do. Despite that when I look at others are having fun with each other, laughing and enjoying their time, and I feel jealous and envious of them, I don\u2019t have the motivation to join them. Probably a sign of anti-social. But I guess you can say that those who sit by themselves are also humans and have human thoughts and emotions, except that they have a harder time to communicate their thoughts? Sometimes I simulate a situation where I interact with people and often end up building up a mere shallow relationship due to personality differences. Therefore before even initiating a conversation, I would just tell myself to not do it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do very much enjoy being surrounded by friends, but just wouldn\u2019t ask for it.
