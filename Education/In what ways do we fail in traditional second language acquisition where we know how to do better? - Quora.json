            "answer_text": "Where do I start?!   In K12 specifically, language teachers are undertrained.  Drastically, sadly, unjustly, criminally undertrained in the case of ESL.   The disconnect between learning research and practice is vast.  Think Grand Canyon vast.  Yes, that's our fault.  I think America is asking that we do something a whole lot more scientific than we're doing, and no one in the districts is listening.  That however is a different discussion.   From where I sit, these education professors write their papers mostly for each other and the textbook publishers.  I don't think it should be so, but it is.  If you don't have a university library account through a spouse or someone you know, you can't read the journals and the books that relate to your practice anyway, unless you pay full cost for them yourself.  The language journals I took for years cost me hundreds and when the paycheck went (baby time) I couldn't afford them anymore. The access problem needs to be fixed and the gap needs to be closed.  But I won't hold my breath on that. In language teaching in general, my objections are: We lean too much on the materials we use, which don't weight the content according to every classes' needs.We have too little gap curriculum for comprehension checking and filling in gaps and holes in the student's knowledge.We don't provide enough detailed and timely negative feedback to students, and without that errors go uncorrected or are unintentionally reinforced.We don't teach the core functional* vocabulary effectively.The digital tools are underused.We fail to teach the learner skills for studying the language.  We're supposed to be an authority on this.In the case of English in particular, we think any native speaker or traditional English teacher can teach the courses.  ---* Functional vocabulary is academic vocabulary, often verbs, that describes actions or states cause and effect or other sorts of logical relationship relevant to the subject area.  In a biology course, the teacher will teach special terms like mammal but ignore a word like compete.  The word compete has a different meaning in biology than in another context, and a language learner needs to know this, but will probably never be directly taught a word like this in a grammar-based ESL program.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion the greatest mistake we make is not starting to use the language. It is common for people to \"wait\" with trying the language skills until you are \"good enough\" - this is a great mistake. You should start talking to natives or other people learning the language as soon as you can say a few words. There are also so many fun ways to learn a language. With modern technology such as websites where you can talk to native speaker through video conference there are many new techniques available for learning languages. I can very easily imagine sessions among primary schools or high schools between two countries where the children can chat with other children, or something like that. I came up with this idea just as I was writing this answer, so if teachers would sit down and brainstorm I'm sure they could come up with exciting stuff. The methods in schools are still building on pre-internet teaching techniques. Also, there should be immediate usefulness for kids to see when you want to teach them. Parents can show them cartoons in the target language, buy them simple books or games. Probably easier said than done, but I think it does help if you see the usefulness of another language. ",
