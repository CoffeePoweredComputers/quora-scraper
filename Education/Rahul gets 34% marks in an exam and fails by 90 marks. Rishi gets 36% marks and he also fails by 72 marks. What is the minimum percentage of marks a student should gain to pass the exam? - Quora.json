            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A The answer is - 44% Explanation - The 2% difference accounts for 18 marks difference. Thus, 1% will be equal to 9 marks By above logic, if we take Rahul\u2019s case, he will need 90 marks to pass which will be equal to 10%. So add those 10% to his current 34% which will give you 44%. Hence the answer. Alternatively, you may even calculate minimum pass % by taking Rishu\u2019s case. He needs 72 marks or 8% (72\u00f79) more to pass. So 36% +8% = 44%. Hope the explanation helps. :) ",
