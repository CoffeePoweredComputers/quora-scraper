            "answer_text": "Hey thats a nice question , If i am not wrong i guess the answer is you can , its called dual enrollment ,Co-enrollment receives considerably less attention than the traditional model of students transferring between community colleges and state universities . UO if you know have an active dual program you can try over there before you jump in to it here a word of advice for you . Understand the rules : consult with your main school's admissions or registrar's office or your academic adviser , let them know about your plans Which course works for you : Your primary four-year university will probably require you to take certain classes, including upper-division classes and courses directly related to your major, at their campus only. As such, you will probably want to take only lower-division classes and electives at other colleges. Always double check credit transfers : The most important check in the credit transfers, Just knowing that credits from the second college transfer to your home school isn't enough. You also need to know how classes satisfy degree requirements at your home school. A bit of proper planning will do alot of wonders for you , taking classes at two colleges at the same time can end up being a cost-effective and creative way to earn your college degree Best of Luck ",
