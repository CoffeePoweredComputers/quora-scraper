            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t get to be the best by having delusions of grandeur. The UK has some of the world\u2019s best universities, and some of the best schools for people who can afford to pay lots of money. There are also lots of things that need to be fixed, especially for people on lower incomes, and even our best institutions should be trying to learn from other nations. What I learned from my British education was not to be complacent, and not to under-estimate other people and other cultures. I\u2019m happy to think these qualities make British education great, but boastfulness about being the best is very unBritish. ",
