            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Speaking to archaeology, it would be pretty much impossible without a Master\u2019s Degree. Archaeologists are first and foremost professors, and without an MA, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance in the incredibly competitive job market for college/university professorship. Most archaeologists work in the field during the summers of their undergraduate and graduate programs. You may be able to find programs that you can volunteer for or pay to go to, but you\u2019ll mostly be working with college students earning credits towards their degrees. Digs are usually the hard-fought-for projects of senior archaeologists that struggled to find funding for their pet projects throughout the school year. No one is getting paid because everyone is just there for the experience: the professors are there to conduct research and continue validating their professorships, and the students are there so that they can become professors.
