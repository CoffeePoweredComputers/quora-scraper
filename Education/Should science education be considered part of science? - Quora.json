            "answer_text": "Great question! Science education should be a part of science. It is also part educational theory, part psychology, part childhood development. We gave no one to blame but ourselves if we are graduating kids who are not scientifically literate. Science education is not just about the \"raw science\". It's also about what science is, how and why it works, an d particularly why it's important. What about science makes it different from just believing based on or own personal experiences. Many people of a scientific bent are out there but not scientists. If scientists wash there hands of educating those who won't become PhD.'s, how long will it be before the society no longer thinks they should bear the cost for all he \"non-productive\" scientists out there. Science has been in ascendency in many ways, but scientist have to learn the same lesson Philosophers have had to - they get to do that job because other people make the food and do all the other things needed to keep scientists (and philosophers, and artists, etc.) employed.  I am alive because of science and I find it incredibly interesting despite not being able to BE a scientist. But I can't tell you how many people I have had to explicitly walk through, step by step, why - for example - space exploration is vitally important to science and technology and human society as a whole. Science education should not, in my opinion, be left solely to scientists or educators - it's an integral part of our modern very complex society: I don't believe there will be many important questions today with simple answers.

            "answer_text": "\"An IQ=200 took 10 years to create a theory that took another IQ=200 10 years to understand. That can't be science\".  - Yes. It isn't considered scientific knowledge/theory if it still lacking substantial evidence. What is science is based on how a theory is substantiated by evidence, not on who or how many people understand it.  \"PhDs discourse in ways that only they understand. Some students read up the papers and just don't get it. That can't be science.\" - Depending on who reads what. PhDs discourse in what exactly? PhDs in arts discource can't be science. If you are talking about something like Bohr-Einstein debate, then the content of their debate isn't exactly  \"wholly-accepted science\". Here is the consensus of their debate: \"Although the majority of experts in the field agree that Einstein was wrong, the current understanding is still not complete (see Interpretation of quantum mechanics). There is no scientific consensus that determinism would have been refuted.\" Bohr\u2013Einstein debates  Science Education is within the scope of social science. So, no.... Science education is part of social science, not natural science. ",
