            "answer_text": "I met Barack Obama and got to know him while he was a student at Occidental College. My memories of young Obama have appeared in a number of historical books including David Garrow\u2019s Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama. This is a 1,460 page pre-presidential biography published by HarperCollins in May 2017. At the time I met the young Obama, I was a graduate student at Cornell University, doing my first work as a teaching assistant in political science. My sense of him at the time is that he was of average intelligence. I don\u2019t remember him making any particularly insightful comments when we spoke. I think it is safe to say that he was most likely a solid B student. To be fair, the Barack Obama I met in 1980\u20131981 was more interested in parties, cocaine and radical politics than his academic record. I think it is only common sense to assert that the only reason his Occidental College GPA has not been released is that it would have been bad news for him. I\u2019m writing this to counter-act some of the extreme Barack Obama sycophantic comments suggesting he is some sort of genius. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is no record of him being particularly talented at math, statistics, or any of the hard sciences. He served as the editor of the law review at Harvard, but didn\u2019t bother to produce any articles of his own for it. ",

            "answer_text": "For everyone who's speculated, that's exactly what it is speculation, about Obama's GPA and why it was sealed or not released, you're all wet! FERPA is the Federal Education Records and Privacy Act[1] that prohibits the release of everyone's education records without their prior written consent. Now to address the elephant in the room. Why are these types of questions asked anonymously? Why do people answer obvious troll questions posted anonymously? Questions of this nature can easily answered with a simple Google search. Of course, some of the results will be as useful as tits on a boar but if you stick to reputable sites and verify by checking a few more sites and confirming the information is accurate. I'm sure the anonymous OP knows this so the obvious conclusion is that he just wants to stir the preverbial pot. As to why I personally answer questions of this type is quite simple. Disinformation can be dangerous! When I see questions like this the first thing I do is check the log to ascertain whether it was asked anonymously. If it was, that usually means that the OP isn't looking for accurate information. If the OP isn't anonymous, I'll check his feed to decide whether he is in the habit of asking insincere questions. If he is then I usually downvote and/or report and move on. There are occasions, such as this, that I'll answer because as I said, Disinformation is dangerous! When I do decide to answer, I provide at least on link to a reputable site and I avoid stating my inherently biased opinion (everyone's opinion is inherently biased). As a parent, grandparent and former teacher, I believe that it's everyone's civic duty to dispel disinformation. The way I see it is that even if the OP wasn't sincerely looking for accurate information, someone else may actually want to understand the whys and wherefores of a particular question.
