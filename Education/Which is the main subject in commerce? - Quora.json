            "answer_text": "Commerce is wide stream where finding one subject as a main subject is like debating over which language is the best of all. You need you learn everything and appreciate every aspects of commerce. The thing is every subject is interdependent. Accountancy, Business analytics, fundamentals of economics, Taxation and corporate laws. Some might argue that Accountancy is the main subject in commerce but without knowing the basics of Business studies and Corporate laws it will be a nightmare when it comes to application of Accountancy. Business studies, as the name suggest this could deceive you to believe it's the main subject, but in the early chapters in higher secondary schooling years you'll understand that business is just a small part of what commerce is. However, it is essential for understanding the same on a wider sense. Although economics is a considered a separate stream, it is a vast subject on it's own, we do need the basic understanding of some Micro and Marco concepts of economics to study commerce. Taxation and Corporate laws: Laws and regulations of a country are supposed to be studied and respected while practicing business or trade inland. It may not seems to have a competition in being the main subject in commerce, but it is the most important in practical terms while conducting commerce anywhere in the world. As technology is racing time itself, more streams within commerce will pop up in the coming years, and surely make it into the syllabus in no time. These newbies will be also equally important and \u201cmain\u201d commerce subject as ever. As commerce grows so will the subjects and syllabus. Make sure you've turned every page of every book. ",

            "answer_text": "English, Accountancy, Economics, Business studies, Mathematics, Entrepreneurship, physical education. But I will not say students to take Entrepreneurship and physical education because these subjects contain nothing to learn.These are time wasting subjects. I will say students to take Mathematics because this is a interesting subject to study. You will learn many things in this subject . You can take the help of educational websites such as meritation.com. Take only five subjects in class 11.Donot take 6 subjects. It will become burden for you in passing class 11th examinations. Choose a good school where provide correct information about the commerce field. I have also studied in D.A.V Public School, Koyla nagar, Dhanbad and Delhi public school, karmik nagar, Dhanbad. But these schools are only known for their name and contain nothing. I will suggest students to join NIOS also if students donot want to attend classes. But in this board you have to work hard because scoring marks in NIOS is difficult one. I will suggest students to join kendriya vidyalaya also if there is no good private schools in your locality. Because I have seen situation also in private schools also where school forces student to take 6 subjects in class 11th also. If the student not able to pass class 11th examination, the school used to expel the students from the school. This case has happened with me also in class 11th in Delhi public school, karmik nagar, Dhanbad. The school forces to take 6 subjects in class 11th. Due to forcing nature of school I have chosen 6 subjects like English, Accountancy, Economics, Business Studies, physical education and in additional subject I have chosen mathematics. But our mathematics teacher Akash sinha sir has not completed the syllabus of Mathematics. I have done tuition from Akash sinha sir also and he charges rs. 1000 per month for their tuition classes but neither he has completed the syllabus in school nor in tuition. Due to non completion of syllabus I was not able to pass the examination of class 11th.After class 10th no teacher is going to teach students in class 11th. They will not complete syllabus on time. Because due to non completion of syllabus students of school donot show interest in classes because private schools also forces students to do private coaching and tuitions to qualify your examinations. Teachers of private schools also tell some questions of question paper which is set in school or by board by giving money to teachers of private schools because in private schools everything can be happened. As per my opinion I will suggest students to do class yet class 11th and if you are not able to pass class 11th join any college or NIOS. ",
