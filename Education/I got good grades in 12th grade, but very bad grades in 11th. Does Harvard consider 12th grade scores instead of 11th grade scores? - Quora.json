            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak to Harvard specifically, having never participated in their admission process. But I suspect that it is similar to ours. The evaluation of applications tends toward \u2018holistic\u2019. They look at everything, including grades from your entire high school career. So, yes, poor grades in any grade can weigh against you. They may, however, take into consideration if there is some reason that your grades were bad in one grade and improved in another. If you have a good explanation for that, then make sure to tell them in your essay. It won\u2019t necessarily turn the tide for you, but not doing it just leaves the bad grades hanging there, which is worse. Having said that - the top Universities look at much more than grades and test scores when making their decisions. We are unable to accept all the students with straight A\u2019s and perfect SAT scores. At the same time, students are admitted who don\u2019t have perfect grades and scores. That is because the process tries to look at the \u201cwhole\u201d applicant. And for the top universities, it goes beyond having a lot of extra-curricular activities. They are looking for evidence of leadership, humanity, accomplishment that goes beyond the standard \u201cgood student\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll give you a interesting statistic: In 2014 70% of Stanford students who got rejected had a perfect 2400 on their SAT's.  Nowadays, you can think of universities as a company: they want to see a student's story. Which major are you applying for and what have you done to leverage your application to be accepted? Imagine if you were applying to Stanford Business School (or any top university) and you have a 2.3 GPA. However, you learned coding when you were young and have a iOS application that 2.3 million people are using with a revenue of over $200,000 per year. Using that as your \"extra-curricular activity\" doesn't your actual GPA seem insignificant now? I would like to ask you back; what major are you applying into and what have you done to build up your story so far? ",
