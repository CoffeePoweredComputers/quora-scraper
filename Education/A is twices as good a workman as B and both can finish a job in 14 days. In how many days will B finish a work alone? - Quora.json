Method 2: As A is twice as efficient as B, so while working together A does 2323rd of the work and B does 1313rd of the work. B completes 1313rd of the Total Work in 14 DaysSo, to do the TOTAL WORK, time taken would be thrice of 14 days.So, B takes14\u00d73=14\u00d73= 42 Days42 Days to complete the task alone ",

A and B together do (1/x)+(1/2x) = (3/2x)th of the work in a day. So they take 2x/3 = 14 days, or x = 21. So B will do the work in 42 days, working alone. Check: (1/21)+(1/42) = (2/42)+(1/42) = (3/42) = 1/14. Or A and B do it in 14 days. Correct. ",
