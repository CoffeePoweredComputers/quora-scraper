            "answer_text": "Biology mostly is a straight subject- you won\u2019t get twisted questions here and answers to most of the questions depends upon how perfect your memory is. For class 11, I will suggest NCERT textbook as the best. If you are thoroughly prepared NCERT, most of your annual exam preparation is done. Go through all the exercise questions and NCERT exemplar questions and most of your problems are solved. You can also refer to sample papers, like All in One( from Arihant Publications), or Xam idea for extra questions for practice. For reference, there are books like Elementary Biology ( by KN Bhatia and MP Tyagi; Trueman Publications) is a good book. It will prepare you for annual exams and medical entrance tests. It has some additional concepts and you may require the help of your teacher for better understanding. Still, you need to be clear on NCERT concepts for performing best in biology. So go through your textbook first before moving on to the others. ",
