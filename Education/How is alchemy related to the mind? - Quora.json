            "answer_text": "Alchemy is the process of Understanding & Mastering the Mind. To gain Mastery of the Mind, it is crucial to gain familiarity with the Laws & Principles guiding Creation throughout the Cosmos. One of the Laws is the Law of Polarity or the Law of Opposites. The Law of Polarity underlies all manifestation; everything manifest has poles, opposites, extremes, etc. Ex: Moon/Sun, Hot/Cold, Light/Darkness On the Mental Plane this principle is also in full effect: Fear/Courage, Hate/Love, Sadness/Joy One opposite can not exist without the other. They are same in kind, different in degree. Gender (Man/Woman) is another extension of this Law. Gender is manifest in everyone & everything. The Masculine & Feminine Principles are always present in whichever living creation. ",
