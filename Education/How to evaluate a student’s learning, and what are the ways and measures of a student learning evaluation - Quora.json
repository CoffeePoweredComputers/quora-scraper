            "answer_text": "The first step in evaluating a student\u2019s learning is to know yourself, exactly what you expect the student to learn. Included with this is an understanding on your part that you will use what you learn through the assessment to adjust your instruction for students who need more help as well as for those who are capable of much more. The second step is to ensure that they know what they are to learn. As a former school principal, I used to spend a lot of time in classrooms observing teaching. I frequently asked students, \u201cWhat are you supposed to be learning right now?\u201d If they couldn\u2019t answer, they didn\u2019t know, and likely the teacher wasn\u2019t sure either. On the other hand, if they could, it was an indication that the expectations had not only been communicated clearly, but that the student was engaged in the lesson. In the end, those were more successful classrooms. Communicate the expectation clearly and frequently. You might start with a statement as simple as, \u201cWhen we are done with this lesson, you will be able to\u2026\u201d The third step is to create an evaluation instrument that measures what you want them to be able to do. So if you have students working to summarize a passage that they have read, the evaluation should require them to effectively summarize a similar passage. If you want them to be able to use an equation to solve a problem, have them solve a similar problem using the equation. If you want them to differentiate between two characters in a novel, teach them how to do that, and then assess whether they can differentiate between two characters in a different passage. Teaching effectively is hard, because your objective is not to present information and walk away. It has to be to ensure that when the students leave for the day, they\u2019ve mastered skills and understandings that they didn\u2019t have before. Evaluate precisely what you have taught, and use that evaluation to fill in the gaps the next day. ",
