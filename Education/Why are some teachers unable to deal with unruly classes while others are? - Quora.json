            "answer_text": "My mother is a substitute teacher, who as you might know are the ones unruly students always sniff from one kilometer away. She changes schools every year, and every year she\u2019s \u201cfresh meat\u201d. She\u2019s also regularly put in the worst schools of the region, because it\u2019s always where teachers have nervous breakdowns and they have empty spots. She teaches high school and middle school students, and has had a fair number of drug dealers, thieves, and violent kids in her classes. Not to count the \u201cclassic\u201d rebellious ones, the abused ones, the foreign ones, or the ones with disabilities. So, her job is hard. Like, really hard. And yet she always manages to keep a firm upper hand on all of her classes. I\u2019ve seen her exhausted and frustrated, but never overwhelmed. How does she do it? First of all it\u2019s important to note she has some innate advantages: she\u2019s 6 feet tall (about 1m80), has a beautiful but impressive face (square jawline, high cheekbones, piercing blue eyes), a low-pitched voice for a woman, and boy, can she talk loud. I always have to put my phone volume to low when I\u2019m calling her.She doesn\u2019t try to be somebody else. She has a very bourgeois upbringing, and it shows. Her students usually come from poor families. She doesn\u2019t try to pretend that she\u2019s like them, and I think to some level they appreciate the honesty. It also puts some distance between them.She can not be embarrassed, and she knows exactly how to embarrass them. She\u2019s told me countless anecdotes of singling out a student by making them sit at her desk (in front of the whole class), or standing up next to the board, or her sitting next to their desk, and reading out loud all their notes. Kids hate that kind of stuff. It always throws them off. One particularly hilarious example was one time where two kids where about to have a fight in her classroom. They were pretty much yelling obscenities at each other. She stood behind one of them and started massaging his shoulders, telling him (very loudly) \u201cWhat\u2019s going on kiddo? Re-laaaax. Take deep breaths. Everything\u2019s okay. Calm down.\u201d De-escalation guaranteed.She\u2019s honest and fair, and she knows mercy. That matters a lot to the kids. Sometimes she makes mistake, and she never fails to apologize for them. In front of the whole class. If a kid has special issues (for example a poor grasp on our language because the family just arrived to France), she will be much, much nicer in her grading and she won\u2019t pick on them. I think that kind of things earns her a lot of respect from the kids.She loves them. My mom is everybody\u2019s mom. When she sees any kid, it\u2019s a little bit hers. The students feel that, and they always know to some level that her intent is good. She never means to destroy them or put them down. She wants their good, and that helps a lot to build a healthy student-teacher relationship. Sometimes she freaks out and tells a whole class how bad they are (because MAN, THEY ARE). It actually does something to the students because they know she cares. They know she\u2019s not being mean but concerned for them.She has boundaries. This kinda relates to the fact that her students can not embarrass her. She knows exactly where the classroom ends and where it starts. So her students never have the power to upset her too much. Their failure are not hers. Neither are their success. She\u2019s built a shield that prevents her from being too deeply touched, because otherwise I think she would have lost her sanity. I\u2019m talking about students victim of sexual or physical abuse, students with profound learning disabilities, students whose families are homeless\u2026 She can\u2019t save them. It\u2019s not her job.I think the first two points (in bold) in this list are enough to make the difference between teachers that can handle a difficult class, and teachers who can\u2019t. It\u2019s my impression that with truly difficult students, direct confrontation can not succeed because they\u2019ll always fight back. Humiliation is a much more powerful tool. And when a teacher pretends to be someone else, it always shows, and the student can\u2019t respect them as much. ",

            "answer_text": "Self-belief is vital. If you think about it, you may dwell on the fact that you have x number of youngsters in front of you, and should they all refuse to do as you say you couldn't do a single thing about it - and that thought is fatal for good discipline. If you are confident, and show that confidence, then it transmits to the youngsters and they too believe in your discipline. I think lack of confidence results in erratic standards of discipline, vacillating between being too soft and too harsh so the class do not know where they are - and that insecurity will make them play up. My eldest son told me his maths teacher was just like that. This was a private school class of thirteen year old boys in the charge of a newly qualified graduate. I'm not sure if he had teacher training, and have no idea why he colleagues weren't advising him, but when I saw him at open day, I did step over the boundary to advise him - I thought he was going to burst into tears, but he obviously took note as my son reported that classroom discipline had improved. Another factor is not shouting, because that implies lack of control - and if you show that they know they've got you. As a young teacher with only a few years experience, I found myself teaching the same year as a teacher with over 30 years in the profession. I had the half with lower ability, and more social problems - she had the half with more ability who had in their previous year been taught by an excellent teacher with superb discipline, yet by the end of the school year hers was the class teetering on the edge of being out of control. She was known for her constant shouting at them and I, though I didn't know it until ex-pupils came back and decided to give me feed back, apparently smiled a lot and was very relaxed and 'nice' to them. I was also know for never shouting. When I was displeased with them, my voice became cold and correct and I didn't smile at them - and they hated it and wanted to get me back to normal by being very good. Once I'd been given my report, I was more aware of what I was doing - and it worked with my own kids too. These were 9 to 12 year olds so maybe it wouldn't work with older children, or those who didn't the same teacher most of every day. ",
