            "answer_text": "I taught online courses at universities. Doing so helped with department, school, and university numbers. My overall impression after 10 years is rather technical: It sucks. Students hated the lack of contact (although my actual cyber contact was nearly 4 times greater than in-class contact with the same courses). I hated not being able to assess in-person how well students were able to grasp or connect concepts. In all, I would never again agree to teach an online course. On the other hand, a few of my colleagues were more sanguine about their experiences. ",
