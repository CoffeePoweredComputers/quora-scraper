            "answer_text": "Simple answer:- Our brain knows how everything works out. And certain things are classified by us. For example :- Video games is a really good way to beat time and it gets our mind active. Studying does not give the satisfaction that video games do. It is a really deep topic to think about. Now a practical example :- Consider two bowl of food given before you. Talking about the food. First bowl be a bowl of cooked rice.  The second be a junk food or a dessert.  As you see the second picture itself, At least some of you who are reading this right now might get a Yummy! feeling (Me too). Most people will choose the second bowl over the first because that\u2019s what the brain\u2019s telling them to do still knowing not nutritious and the presence of many artificial chemicals in it. Same way, we can consider study as the first bowl and playing video games as the second one. So if you take the second bowl regularly then you\u2019ll have to suffer the consequences- Being fat and unhealthy. Now make up a great timetable to focus on study and try to decrease the time for playing video games. Image source :- Google Images. Here\u2019s a similar question i found on quora with similar examples :- Why can I play video games for hours, but when I try to study, I lose concentration in seconds? P.S:- Good luck in time management. ",
