In the recent days it has been found that the children\u2019s are very much engaged in their cell phones . They\u2019re spending too much of their time either in playing , watching or learning various things . So , the best way to encourage kids is to make them start learning computer especially in there happy times . Example : When the kids are playing , then play games like online quizzes related to computer science.If suppose they\u2019re watching something , help them and influence them in watching animated videos that teaches about computer .If suppose they are learning the something then just don't let them read as it will make the learning process pale and flat . Just teach them in terms of stories , poem or even in songs .Help them in operating the computer . Don't leave the kids alone in front of computers or any electronic gadgets. Always motivate them in adapting the changes all around the world .  Help the kids in understanding what the word coding means i.e. programming language . It includes finding solution to real world problem . Let them understand first and give their own space . Take everything slowly and steadily . If things are taken in a rush then the kids might get confused and bored .Help the kids in finding out new terms like Java , Python , C++ etc.Always introduce a new term only when the child is clear with the first term . Always make the child solve a real world problem .This will increase the confidence level and skills of a child . Encourage your child to learn from the mistakes .I\u2019m definitely sure the child will gain the interest and will approach elders to join him in the course.
