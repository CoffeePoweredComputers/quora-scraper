            "answer_text": "What makes a language easier to learn is the grammar. When the grammar is easy to understand and implement, life is easier. English language for example has comparatively easy grammar. The difficulty in English comes when in learning the use of tenses, which might not be the same as in other countries. so imagine you know it all, but you use the wrong tense....funny right?  German language has a difficult grammar and it is a difficult language to learn. I know many people who live for 10-15 years there, work and study there, yet many of them cannot manage to take the PNDS exam.  Pronunciation could be a problem for many.  English pronunciation for French and Spanish and Italians is quite a challenge, while the grammar can be mastered much quicker. Once you learn French, you could learn easier Italian and Spanish. Many of the words have the same or similar roots. It is important to have a quick mind and think what could they be trying to say. Find the similarity with the other two languages, and most of the time you will discover the meaning. In German, if you can't remember the word, you have to start thinking of a new sentence to avoid the word you don't remember. German has Verbs that can split and the two parts are used one in the beginning, one at the end of the phrase, so you have to guess fast what could they be talking about, before you hear the second part of the verb.  Every language has its specifics. The other thing to take into account is, how well do you intend to learn a language. You might learn spoken Italian fast, but only until a degree. For a good Italian, you will need a lot of effort. Italians themselves do not use this kind of higher Italian very often. It is also hindered by the fact that each region has its specific dialects... German in my opinion is the most difficult from the European languages.   ",

            "answer_text": "Will and passion to learn that language makes it easier to learn. Not only language it is true for every new stuff you learn.  I had a tough time in learning Japanese when I started it. I could not remember its letters and Kanjis. It was my passion which drove me to explore for ways of remembering it and my will which kept me learning it without giving it up. I used to practice by writing them in paper 5 or 6 times and then I used to recall them. Practise it at least an hour per day. Language could be learned easily by trying to relating with things which you are familiar. You can relate it with the language you know. Or you could relate with photos or videos.  Watching videos is very effective. It helps you to learn words, their usage and pronunciation.  Learn language under guidance of a good teacher. The better your teacher is, the better you get at it. Get surrounded by people who have same desire as you do. You could help them by telling how you do stuffs and in return they can share their learning tricks and tips with you. You learn a lot by teaching others. Try to have a small conversations with native speakers of the language which you want to learn. This is very important. It helps you to remember it for a long time. It is very effective and worth spending time. All the best. :)   After editing question:- In technical aspects, I feel remembering words and grammar is difficult. The more you practice, the better you become. ",
