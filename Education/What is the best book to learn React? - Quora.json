            "answer_text": "Figuring out that a flexible, high-paying career as a web developer is the dream is the easy part. Where it gets harder is figuring out exactly what skills you need to land a job. If you\u2019re planning on building websites for a living, you probably know you\u2019ll need to learn coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but you\u2019ll also notice developer job listings that call for less familiar skills. One buzzy skill you\u2019ll see pop up is React.  It is currently most in demand and every other company is looking for it. What are your chances. Very very bright. Reason is simple. Most of us are running after either Data Science or Python because of the hype around it. So very few people are opting for it . So huge demand but no supply. Other good things: Only Front End.No need to learn SQL, any other skill.One language only-JavaScript.Very much doable.Focus on only one thing.Salary as good as full stack developer.So a React developer earns as good or even more than JAVA or .NET guys who work on back-end. Even they know so many things.  What Is React Developer ? React developer will be creating the interactive part of web, by creating components which can send and recieve data from a backend server. He will be responsible for the rendering of components which is having customised requirements. for example he may need to create a button which can show a spinner inside it on sending a http request and will turn to back to a normal button on success/error of the request, it is very simple part of the task that a dev may get. Best Book to Learn React - Videos can get overwhelming. Books let you learn at your own pace and are generally very focused. There are dozens of books online but many of them jump around to different subjects. How does someone get started from the very beginning learning React from the ground-up? I tried to learn React when I worked at my last company \u2013 but due to time constraints hired a contractor to help me complete a big project.This year \u2013 I (finally) understand React and this book- Mastering React native really helped me stay away from the reason why I had a hard time learning it last year \u2013 information overload.  this book clearly explains how and why it fits like a glove, and how to separate how, when, where and why Javascript, HTML, CSS and JSX are used. He also just covers the topics that are essential to React \u2013 which is clearly an object oriented front end technology \u2013 and he introduces \u201cjust enough\u201d of Router and Redux \u2013 two libraries that too many other authors get opinionated fast on their use.
