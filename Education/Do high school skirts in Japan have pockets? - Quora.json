            "answer_text": "Most of the school uniforms in my city have a pocket in the skirt, because they're all the same design. The pocket is on the right hand side. Where there should be a pocket on the left, there is the skirt\u2019s zipper. In these pockets, you can carry fairly large objects. I've personally gotten my wallet, my iPhone, a towel, and a small notepad to fit with little difficulty. There was also a few pencils or erasers. But, when you overfill the pocket, it looks really weird and bumpy, so lots of girls prefer to keep it light, or use the top. In the winter, most girls keep a handkerchief in one of their blazer\u2019s pockets. Some keep a notebook in one. In the summer, we have a pocket in our vests, on the right side. It's tiny and a lot of girls don't even know it exists. You can fit almost nothing in there, so it's basically useless. Overall, I would say that most skirts have a pocket. Some may not be useful considering how many girls roll or belt their skirts up, but the pocket is probably there. I find that half or girls carry tissue packets and the others don't. The ones who don't usually have a small bag they leave in the classroom with tissue packets inside, and will carry around a large tissue box if they're actually sick. Other than that, girls don't seem to carry around much here. Some girls will tuck a pen inside their vest in the summer, and will pocket it in the winter. Combs and handkerchiefs/towels are kept in personal pouches or pencil cases. ",

            "answer_text": "I think many of the skirts do have pockets, but according to high school girls who have answered this very question (in Japanese) on the internet, they use their blazer pockets in winter or their blouse pockets in hotter weather more often. Why not use the skirt pocket? A lot of girls fold the waist of their skirt to shorten the length, and the pockets get folded too. But these girls carry enormous, extremely heavy bags that contain tons of books and miscellaneous other real or perceived necessities. Think a bag about the size of what would normally contain gym clothes and sports equipment for an athletically inclined adult. Tissues? Probably. A giant mirror? Sure. I even knew a girl who always had sweet potatoes. They love hanging little stuffed animals or other charms off their bags, too, like this, but often to greater excess:  It\u2019s a way to express style and individuality. ",
