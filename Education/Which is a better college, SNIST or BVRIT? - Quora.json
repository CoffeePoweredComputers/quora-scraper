            "answer_text": "Both colleges are equally good in extra curricular activities and teaching faculty is not that good [This is applicable to most of the colleges in the city] but being a SNISTIAN I can say that u will see a learning environment here in the college as there are many clubs and the facilities provided by the college. You will get enormous help front the seniors and you can build good rapo with them. I suggest you to also consider the college based on the distance too as most of your time will be gone in the journey as the colleges are too far from the city. I know very little about BVRIT and you can refer to other answers by the fellow quorians to know more about BVRIT college and take the decision wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "Both BVRIT and SNIST are autonomous colleges and compete in the top 10 EAMCET colleges . While BVRIT is placed in a suburban region(Narsapur) and SNIST is near to the city. But according to the academics both the colleges give their students the best education . While BVRIT has a slight edge in the sports and recreation division. The placements of both colleges are well and good. BVRIT has a very good hostel facility than SNIST(FOR HOSTELERS). It is the matter of perspective at which the student looks at the college. Finally it depends on the distance from the college which makes the student comfortable(FOR DAYSCOLARS). ",
