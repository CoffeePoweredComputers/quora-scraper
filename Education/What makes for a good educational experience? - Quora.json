            "answer_text": "Let's try this: you learn a lot without much effort. That's pretty much what happens in summer camp. Or when you go to the movies. Or an amusement park. Or you watch a program you really like on TV. Or when you go to certain museums. Or when you are in a very well-thought-out course. Sadly, most schools teach little, but require a lot of effort. More thought needs to go into making school more user-friendly. My word for this is ergonomic. I wrote an article about this perspective 15 years ago that I thought would be important. Hardly at all. The word\" ergonomic\" was not used anywhere. Now it's all over the Internet but it almost always means chairs, lighting, sound systems, whiteboards, arrangements of things. This is very telling. Our Education Establishment does not seem interested in pleasant but efficient education. These people don't even try to pretend. They're so busy coming up with one new gimmick after another, things that will just dilute attention and keep everybody dizzy. Or even worse, things that don't work at all by design. I think the whole field of ergonomic teaching and education is the most neglected of all. Let's say you have 300 facts you want to teach to a big class, you have a month to do this job, and you intend to measure how much was learned a year later. And you invite various experts and teachers to create a course to do this job. I predict you would find a vast spread from totally ineffective to wonderfully effective. So then you would hire the best people to develop more courses. And so on, until you have brought wisdom to the schools. This whole scenario is unintentionally comic. Here's why. Our Education Establishment would say, \"300 facts??? What do we care about that??? Are the kids learning to be better people, that's what matters.\" And thus Progressive schools become dumber and dumber each year. Ergonomics: 26: How to Teach History, Etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Tim, in my opinion the best educational experience that you can actually achieve would be for every student in your class room to receive an A on a certain test. Although this is not likely to happen using traditional measurements, it is certainly attainable by teaching and testing to levels of learning designed with specific measurable outcomes. The traditional method of grading students by the A, B, C, D, F method sets some of the students up for failure from the beginning. This traditional method of student measurement assumes that certain students will not measure up to the highest level of expectancy of an A or 100 percent mastery. In reality, if a student is allowed to pass with a C or 80 percent then they have failed 20 percent of the subject matter they therefore go into the next class level with a 20% cumulative deficit. Depending on the course, that means that they are also allowed to pass to the next grade level with 20 percent deficit. This 20 percent deficit starting into new or higher level class should be totally unacceptable to the teacher and definitely to the educational system. Now with that said, the question becomes, how do I ensure 100% achievement from all my students? The answer becomes, how do I prepare a curriculum where all of my students will achieve an A on the subject matter test? The answer lies in preparing lesson plans in behavioral terms with built in stated outcomes that have measurements inherent to the stated outcomes. In most educational endeavors, there are only three levels of learning taught in the typical educational system They are: knowledge (lowest level) understand (second level) and apply (the doing level). Therefore when you write your lesson, make sure that you select the level of learning that you want the student to achieve. This level of learning should be included in the main points that you are teaching from in your lesson plan. The stated behavioral outcome written in the main point should have these three essential parts. First it should be student centered, secondly it should contain a level of learning and lastly should have a stated purpose. Here is a way that main points in your lesson plan would look: Each student (student centered) will know (lowest level of student learning) why it is necessary to know what is being taught. An example of each would be: Each student (student centered) will know (knowledge level of learning) their multiplication tables through the 12\u2019s) so that he/she may solve math problems in the future (purpose). The next level of learning which is understand should be written as follows. Each student (student centered) will understand (2nd level of learning) how to use the multiplication tables in problem solving, so that he/she can find totals of various problems (purpose), The third level of learning which is application can be written as follows: Each student (student centered) will be able to apply (3rd level of learning) mathematical equations (purpose) in order to find the square feet in a room. Tim, note that writing lesson plans in behavioral terms does not allow for failure. Therefore, before you move on to the next lesson in your lesson plan, student mastery of the current lesson must be achieved. Since the lesson plans are written with desired outcomes, student failure should be an impossibility. You simply can not go to the next learning outcome in your lesson plan without fulfilling the desired results from the just completed outcomes. It is easy to see now why every student is required to achieve at the desired level of learning prior to moving to the next level. If you prepare every lesson with levels of learning and stated outcomes, your course objectives will be complete with all students getting an A. This might cause a problem for the old traditional school administrators that are accustomed to the old A, B, C, D, F concept. However, you can bet that your students will have the highest level of achievement on end of the school year test. Standardized tests writers are incorporating behavioral objective methodology, especially with required student outcomes in test writing and discarding incidental learning outcomes found in the text book chapter reviews. Remember Tim, teaching strictly from a text book may or may not cover the material that will be tested on at the end of the school year. ",
