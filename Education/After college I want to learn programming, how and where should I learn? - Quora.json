            "answer_text": "Actually answered for which programming language is best to learn for ? If you are completely new to programming then better start with C and C++ !! First concentrate more on algorithm based problems like palindrome,reversing a string and later move on to Pascal's triangleTry to solve them yourself using basic condition loops ,(if,while,else if etc.,)If u can't solve it yourself then move on to look for the code (don't seek any explanations ,try to understand them yourself)Try to solve as many programming problems in HackerRank ,first start from the algorithm section ,then move on to data structures ,then dynamic programmingTry to start with C,C++ languages ,afterwards after completing them you can easily learn other languages (be it java or Python )Bye:)) ",
