            "answer_text": "This is probably the most common question I get asked here on Quora and I have been spending some time thinking about a way to provide some resources to people who are interested in getting into artificial intelligence and machine learning that is presented in an easy to understand format. Today I came up with a course of action. I\u2019ve decided to start a series on The Educational Blog on artificial intelligence and machine learning: Understanding Artificial Intelligence Series. This is the first post that goes through the motivation and content of the series.  Motivation behind this series Artificial intelligence (AI) is a really hot topic today. You hear a lot of dark and ominous proclamations from the media today about AI. Just last week, an overblown article claimed that Facebook \u201cshut down\u201d it\u2019s AI because it was getting too intelligent. There\u2019s a lot of worry from some high profile people such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking that if left unchecked, AI has the ability to be a world ending threat. A decent amount of today\u2019s population is also worried about AI\u2019s potential to displace jobs and the subsequent consequences on a socioeconomic level. You only need to look at the most suggested completions on Google for the search phrase \u201cWill AI \u2026 \u201c to see this fear is very real among a good number of people.  But how much of this fear is really justified? I believe that a lot of fear in the abilities of AI comes down to a collective lack of understand of how AI really works. How do computers exhibit intelligence? What does intelligence really mean in this context? What are the limits of this intelligence? How do we create intelligent systems? Basically it boils down to a fundamental question. How does AI really work? As someone who works in the field of artificial intelligence and helps teach the artificial intelligence course at UC Berkeley, I am going to take a crack at demystifying this field. I am going to try to do it in a simple. fun, and intuitive way, especially since a lot of things that are happening in modern AI seem to require a lot of technical jargon. We\u2019re going to take things from square one. I will try my very best to make very few assumptions about prior knowledge. For anything that does require prior knowledge from a mathematical or computer science perspective, I will try explain in detail before we continue. For those of you who want to go deeper into the topics, I will also bring up more advanced ideas and link to resources that you might find useful. Hopefully, people at all levels will find this series to be interesting and enlightening. Above all, I hope you all start viewing artificial intelligence as a field full of excitement rather than a field hidden with darkness, uncertainty, and fear.  This series will appear on The Educational Blog. Here\u2019s a list of topics that I will go over in this series, and please feel free to let me know in the comments if you want me to go through any other topics that I may have forgotten. The order and content of this may change around if I see something better so keep an eye on it updates. A lot of my posts are going to be story and example driven, which is why some of these titles may seem a little peculiar. I have included the formal topics in parentheses for your reference.

            "answer_text": "I taught myself from scratch with no programming experience and am now a Kaggle Master and have an amazing job doing ML full time at a hedge fund. It took an incredible amount of work and study. Here\u2019s how I did it: take every single online course you can involving data science. That includes basic ML, linear algebra (probably the most important), statistics, visualization, deep learning etc.read constantly. read blogs, classic texts, journal articles. I kept books by my bed and would read every night until I passed out.not only read this stuff, but master it. I\u2019d get a new paper or book chapter I liked and I\u2019d go to a coffee shop and rewrite the entire thing by hand w pencil and paper. I\u2019d go through every derivation and memorize it. Any time a foreign concept was referenced, I\u2019d research it and do the same thing with that concept - rewrite everything I read by hand, including my own thoughts, master it, then go back to the original paperkeep learning and relearning everything until it was second nature. I probably learned and relearned something as simple as linear regression dozens of times, each time understanding it from a new perspective.do the same thing with programming. I\u2019d consider myself a nearly complete expert in Python. You need to be a quick and effective programmer to be of any use. I know at least one very talented and knowledgable data scientist whose mediocre programming skills make him almost useless.Read about new tools and packages for your language of choice every day. Make a conscious effort to integrate them into my toolbox if it would help me reduce an expression of a procedure by even one line of code. It all adds up, your power multiplies.Do as many kaggle competitions as possible. Work on as many datasets as you can, and understand how all the classic ML algorothms would interact with the structure of that data. Each dataset had its own idiosyncracies; get familiar with a wide variety of data.Get a job somewhere that works with ML. At first, they might not let you touch the ML. Make ML stuff that would aid the business in your spare time to show them that you know your stuff and can implement it. They\u2019ll probably let you start working on ML.Do all of this to the point that you almost can\u2019t take it anymore, every day for at least a few hours a day. Do it for years. Eventually, you\u2019ll get there. That\u2019s how I did it. ",
