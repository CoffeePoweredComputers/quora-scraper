Most likely this is because this is the beginning of the school year. At the beginning of the school year it is possible for your grade average to swing violently. Imagine a baseball player at the beginning of the baseball season. Say our baseball player gets a hit at his first at bat. He is now batting 1,000. But if our baseball player gets out his next two at bats his average drops to 333. That is a very steep drop for two consecutive outs. At the end of the season there is no way two consecutive outs will swing a baseball player\u2019s batting average by more than a few points, certainly not over 600 points. So the same is probably true for you. Say your first two assignments were each 5 points, and you aced them both and scored 5 on each. So you were sitting on 100%, 10/10. Say your next assignment is worth 17 points, but you didn\u2019t turn it in. You now sit at 10/27 points 37.0737\u2026 or rounded to two decimal places 37.04%. So this is not that terrible, you should have plenty of opportunities to just naturally raise your grade. Say in the next 100 points you aren\u2019t perfect, but you amass 96 of the next 100 points. Now your running total would be 106/127 this would now be 83.46%. Say you can repeat that level of performance for the next 10 points. Now you have 202/227 which equals 88.99%. Now run one more 96 out of 100 and your sitting on 298/327 which is 91.13% So you are in for a bit of a journey to get back up to 90+%, but it is that overwhelming. If you can manage even better than 96 out of 100 you can get up to 90+% even faster. Just keep working hard. But this leads to a very logical question\u2026 If you knew that your school has a no late policy why did you turn nothing in? Even if it was not your best work, any grade is better than a zero grade.",

            "answer_text": "You should be grateful that your teacher has done his or her job and taught you a serious lesson that will, if you learn it, stand you in good stead throughout the rest of your academic career and life in general. You behaved irresponsibly and have suffered the consequences in such a way that you are, hopefully, motivated not to repeat the error. Be aware that it is important to make sure you understand the course requirements and due dates for all the work in any class you take and not goof off and make that sort of mistake again. Now, go over the requirements for this class and all of your other classes and make sure that you are up-to-date and not leaving anything until the last minute. Plan out when you need to work on your lessons in such a way that you are doing all that needs to be done from now on, and pass or not, thank your teacher for a lesson more valuable for you life than any other you will learn in that class.
