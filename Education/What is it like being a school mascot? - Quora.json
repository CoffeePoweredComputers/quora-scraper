            "answer_text": "Being a school mascot is iconic. :) Of course, puns aside, it\u2019s a great and important task and responsibility for any team, group or event the mascot serves, that requires immense physical effort and good cheer. You have to be: physically fit,working out and practicing many hours every week,able to perform for hours at a time at peak levels,fun,funny,friendly,exhibiting good sportsmanship,able to ignor jeering, rude remarks, insults and possibly even light physical force from unruly fans. Sometimes certain unruly fans may or may not have had a bit too much to drink or whatever, and they attempt to take off the headgear or other parts of the mascot\u2019s costume.avoiding fights,able to bring the crowd to their feet at the right moments,able to tamp it down properly when necessary,full of energy to run around the field or court or whatever the sporting venue happens to be, andable to do it all while wearing what is usually a funny, ridiculous, heavy costume, complete with a giant head that you have to balance, thus making your sweat even more, and should make you more aware of your surroundings, despite the usually somewhat limited vision that the headgear often causes.",

            "answer_text": "It feels great. I was our school mascot for 2 years. You should be physically fit, you should be working out & you should practice for long hours every week, you should have fun, you should be friendly, there will be people who will make fun of you/criticize you from the fans or from your own classmates you should ignore all those remakes & most importantly avoid getting into fights. Mind you it will be very hot inside your mascot you should always remember to wear light clothing/sweatbands before you get into your school mascot. ",
