            "answer_text": "Yes they have quite a few similarities. Sparta had a strict social hierarchy with the Spartiates at the top, followed by the Periokoi (inferior to Spartiates) and then the Helots (slaves). The Third Reich had the Nuremberg Laws which created a strict racial hierarchy, with Aryan Germans at the top and people like Jews, Romani and Slavs at the bottom. The Nuremberg laws are more complex but I\u2019m not going to go in full details. Jews (and others) where purged from Nazi society and sent to concentration/death camps, and in Sparta there was a annual tradition where the Spartiates would hunt the Helots for sport to reduce their population. And in both societies these groups where used for slave labour.The social expectation for women is similar in both society\u2019s. Women in Sparta where expected to do daily exercise and stay strong and fit, this so they will produce strong healthy children to become soldiers. In Nazi Germany women where expected to have strong healthy attractive frame and work at home to provide for the family, and produce strong \u2018Aryan\u2019 children for their \u2018master race.\u2019Both Spartan and Nazi society where based heavily around war. Boys in Sparta would be sent to the Agoge at the age of 7 where they would live in barracks and undergo military training till they where older enough to become a soldier. Nazi Germany education focused on the war effort, subjects such as Physics, Chemistry and Math where focused around war. Both Nazi boys and girls would be expected to have a high standard of fitness. Every German boy had to join the Hitler Youth, many activities closely resembled military training, with weapons training, assault course circuits and basic tactics. Both Sparta and Nazi Germany produced arguably the best military s of their respected eras, and both sates where heavily militarized.Secret police played a role in both states, the Spartans had the Krypteia which was used to terrorize the Helot population. The Nazis had the SS and Gestapo who carried out many of the war crimes against minorities.Disable children and people in Sparta where killed off as they had no purpose to to their society. Nazis had the \u2018untermensch\u2019 (sub human people) such as people with physical and mental disabilities. The Nazis would euthanize these people, many of them being children.Both societies believed that interest of the state was more important to the interest of the individual.However their are plenty of differences, and I would say that Nazi Germany was far more extreme than Sparta and it would be wrong to refer to Sparta as the \u2018Nazi Greek State\u2019.

            "answer_text": "In absolutely no way??? What are you talking about? If you were to compare the Spartans with a modern group of people then the closest would be North Korea. A closed borders militaristic nation with bad relationships with other countries and rival nations. Ready to fight at any point and no matter how outnumbered they are. They didn't think they were a superior race that should destroy and kill everyone esle. ",
