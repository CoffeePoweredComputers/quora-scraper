            "answer_text": "One major advantage according to me is that 50% of government jobs are automatically reserved for hindus. Though many converted christians are still shamelessly using reservations in IIT and PSUs while going to church. The point is Islam considers it's victory in prevailing over other religions, but reservation ensures that very little percent is left for muslims to get access to jobs, wealth and power. Even though indian muslims have the same ancestry as hindus, their thoughts have been deviated. I know the right way is to compete on merit. Nevertheless reservation is giving this advantage. I would like to tell all general category students to be a little patient till sc/St get in a better position to beat Muslims on merit in an open competition. ",
