            "answer_text": "if you feel a true calling, I would try to pursue it. Vet school tuition is bad now at all the state funded Veterinary schools. My last semester in 1982 cost me a bit over 1000 dollars Now it has skyrocketed. In my case, looking back, I cannot imagine what else I would have done with my life. I would do a DVM/Ph.D and wish to God I had It would open more employment opportunities for you after school. Our profession does not pay anywhere near what our value is. Lawyers, who are mostly just headaches, do nothing that I can see that is equivalent to our society. The human animal bond is huge now but unheard of when I went through school. Believe me, animals are essential and have been essential to my emotional health and self-worth for 38 years We should demand to be paid better!! Avoid those schools in the Caribbean! They just keep pumping unqualified veterinarians They have to complete an extra year here, and their debt load exceeds 300,000 just for veterinary schools. The only thing I would do differently would have been a DVM/Ph.D. Another option would be a Master\u2019s degree in Public Health Some schools, including my own(Kansas State University) have a decent MPH degree Sorry to run on so long The most important thing I would say is Do you have a strong calling inside to do this? I did but much else has been disappointing. Timothy Lyon, DVM ",

            "answer_text": "Good Afternoon, I am a public health academic but not a vet. I can say that graduate school is very expensive and time consuming depending on the training. I would say that if the degree/certificate is going to enhance your skill set and provide a better outlook for stable employment then it would be worth it. If the course is going to be a possible resume puller than no because it is a gamble. Good luck to you. ",
