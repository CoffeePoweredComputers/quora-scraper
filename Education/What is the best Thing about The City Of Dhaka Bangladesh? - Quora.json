If you are in any kind of need, no matter how small, simple, silly it is, they will give their hand to help you or at least they will tell you the way by which you can sort it out. Food, money, cloth, shelter, direction, suggestions almost anything you can name of. And if you are a foreigner, much is said. The hospitality, generosity you will get which you can never find anywhere. Curiosity, another thing. They are very curious to a certain higher level degree that the rest of the world will get curious to know, how can this be possible! :P They are curious about anything. Like about you, yes, your personal affairs and life. If they ever get any chance to ask you anything, they will do so. Let me, tell you a scenario. Assume, you are just standing by the road and faking to look at something, searching for something. Give or take 30 minutes, more than 50 people will come to assist you, without anything in return. And don't assume it, it\u2019s true. Let me tell you another case. Sometimes, govt. digs up,excavates the road for purposes. You will find so many spectators there just simply observing the work going on for hours after hours. It's not that they have no work at hand, it\u2019s their curiosity wins! Even, sometimes I also watch the humangous constructions. It amazes me. The mechanical advancement, the procedure, the amount of effort it takes to build something this big! It never fails to amaze me. How cute nation it is! Isn\u2019t it?! ",

            "answer_text": "Most exciting beauty of Dhaka\u2026\u2026\u2026. Puran Dhaka (Old Dhaka) The highlight of any visit to Dhaka is to take in a serving of the pulsing vibrancy and extraordinary atmosphere of Puran Dhaka (Old Dhaka). With its winding alleyways and frenetic buzzing energy, there is something to see around every corner and a walk here proves to be quite the photographer\u2019s delight. Travel by a horse drove cart or rickshaw along busy Dhaka streets is a rewarding experience.  Sadarghat: Dhaka\u2019s heaving boat terminal. The terminal itself and all of its launches are absolutely stacked with people. Taking a small boat out on the river in the early morning is the best way to witness this. To float away from Dhaka\u2019s intensity in a launch or rocket paddlewheel is by far the best way to leave the city behind. Shakhari Bazaar:  A Hindu predominant area and one of the oldest mohallas (a traditional neighborhood) of Puran Dhaka, located near the intersection of Islampur Road and Nawabpur Road; the two main arteries of the old city and only a block away from the Buriganga River. Shakhari Bazaar stretches along a narrow lane, lined with thin slices of richly decorated brick buildings, built during the late Mughal or Colonial period. It seems like the buildings, temples, and alleys haven\u2019t changed since the 16th century when Old Dhaka was the heart of the er capital of Bengal. Boro and Choto Katra (Mitford Road): These illustrative names- boro means big and choto means small- indicate the relative sizes of these historical residences built during the Mughal Dhaka period. The smaller of the two was built Subahdar Shaista Khan, one of the earliest Mughal generals of Dhaka, while the origins of the larger building are not known. Today these two buildings are some of the oldest in Dhaka, which probably accounts for why they\u2019re falling to pieces now. Dhakeshwari Temple:  City\u2019s most prominent Hindu temple. The temple throngs with trinket stalls, pilgrims and a prominent Durga idol. The site\u2019s current buildings- one main temple and four small mandirs- are simple in design. Haji Biriyani  (Bangshal Road): This biriyani restaurant is a real Old Dhaka institution. At mealtime,there is a massive queue that stretches out the door. Biriyanis are served in a shal pata- quite similar to a banana leaf. Star Hotel  (Thatari Bazaar): Something of a late-night institution in Old Dhaka. Meals include a range of biriyanis and kababs, and at night the street is furor of kebab-making activity. Dhaka University:  Dhaka University is widely recognized as Dhaka\u2019s best educational facility and a significant source of dissenting voices in the country, a place where the tenets of the wider society could be challenged and debated. There are some worthy architectural and cultural sites scattered around the campus, including the picturesque Curzon Hall, which is a unique blend of European-Mughal architecture. The Central Shaheed Minar commemorates the language movement of 1952, which represents the country\u2019s earliest longings for independence. The Raju Chattar sculpture is dedicated to a student who was killed during political violence, a notorious event at university campuses across the country. Suhrawardy Park is a pleasant place to walk around and to find quiet places in the park to have tea and adda (traditional small talks). Situated in the picturesque surroundings of Shahbagh the Institute of Fine Arts has a representative collection of folk art and paintings by artists of Bangladesh. National Museum  (Shahbagh, near Aziz Super Market): Bangladesh\u2019s state museum offers an extensive overview of the country\u2019s culture, heritage, craftsmanship, and ethnicities. There are some gems among the dusty collections, including Zainul Abedin\u2019s stark series of charcoal drawings depicting the 1943 famine of Bengal and a massive 40ft boat that was constructed inside the museum. National Assembly Building  (Manik Mia Av): Bangladesh\u2019s signature parliament building is the most unique structure that the country has, and stands as a testament to the youthful spirit of the country and its people. Known as the largest legislative complex in the entire world, the building was originally designed by American architect Louis Kahn. The architect\u2019s monolithic style is unmistakably in the design: its towering walls are recessed by geometric shapes such as triangles and squares, all of which allow large amounts of natural light into the building complex.
