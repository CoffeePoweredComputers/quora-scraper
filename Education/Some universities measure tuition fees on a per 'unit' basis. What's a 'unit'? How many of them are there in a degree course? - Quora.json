            "answer_text": "You are expected to do a certain number of units in each degree, distributed in some way. While a college degree can take from 2\u20134 years full-time, a graduate degree such as a masters can be done in 1\u20132 years, or a doctor of philosophy can be done in 5\u20137+ years. Each course has a number of units, and each unit has an expected number of hours to do in class and outside of class. For example, an undergraduate semester course can be 4 units and take 3 hours/week per unit. So taking 16 units amounts to 48 hours/week. And one semester is 15 weeks, with 2 semesters each year. It is easier to budget for tuition yearly, such as University of California at $14,253/year subsidized for California residents, most likely assuming full-time status. The tuition will still be charged per unit based upon how many courses you enroll in each term and over the whole enrollment at the university, meaning how many terms you do as well. This means you end up paying each term for the courses you enrolled in, so that you work toward satisfying your degree requirements, and by the end of the enrollment at the university you have a total cost. Working in this way recognizes the responsibility for designing and teaching each course, worth a certain number of units and a grade, for the professors who do that, and then all their courses taken together under degree requirements. You can think about it as paying for the whole degree once you graduate, though to look at it in fact, it has been organized at the course and unit level, with all that shown in your transcript over all your terms during attendance.

            "answer_text": "In the United States most schools measure class credits as \u201chours.\u201d Successful completion of a three-hour or four hour class contributes that many hours or units towards the degree. A \u201ccredit hour\u201d is determined by the number of hours in class and the number of days the class meets. At a certain university, 120 credit hours (or units) might be required to complete a baccalaureate degree. Of those 120, a specific number of credit notes (or units) must be in the major field of study (major) and a certain number of credit hours (or units) must be electives, among other requirements. Colleges and universities are very specific and clear about what is expected and required. A unit is another way of measuring those requirements. Each class at a school using \u201cunits\u201d as the measure of credit will assign a specific number of credit units to each class and then detail the requirements of the number of units for each degree.
