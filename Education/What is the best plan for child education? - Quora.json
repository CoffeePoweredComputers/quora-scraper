            "answer_text": "The fact that you are asking the question is already a good sign! Many parents are now coming to the conclusion that some form of homeschooling is the best way to insure their kids are well educated. If that option is a possibility I would strongly encourage you to investigate it for yourself. If homeschooling is not an option there are still a number of things you can do to help your kids get the best education. Stay involved: Don\u2019t assume that the school is going to handle your kids education. You still need to be involved, asking questions, talking to them about their interests, and monitoring their level of success in school. In particular, in the early grades how much homework they are being given. More and more studies are showing that there is very little if any benefit to homework in the early grades. If your child is withering under the strain of too much homework (and is in the early grades) there may be things you can do about this. Many schools are beginning to implement reduced or no homework policies to deal with this problem. even in schools that don\u2019t you may be able to ask for accommodations from your child\u2019s teachers. Preserve curiosity: Above all you need to make sure your child remains curious. Sometimes, school can crush this disposition out of kids due to the overemphasis on tests. If school is not providing an opportunity for your child to explore their interests, you need to provide this for them outside of school. Keep reading to them: Many parents stop reading to their kids once they are able to read on their own but a lot of studies have shown that this may be misguided. Many kids enjoy being read to even after they know how to read on their own. And, there are many other benefits to this beyond education. Don\u2019t be a helicopter parent: As your kids get older make sure you give them enough space to solve their own problems and figure things out for themselves. Once they reach the stage where they are in middle school or high school they are able to handle the responsibilities of homework, projects, remembering permission slips, etc. Doing these things for them or \u201chelping\u201d them too much will not foster the independence they need to thrive and succeed in both school and life. Be a good role model: Finally, don\u2019t just talk about the importance of learning; show it. Your child will not be persuaded that learning and curiosity are important if you say they are but then do nothing but turn on the television and watch sporting events. You need to take an interest in learning and continue it for yourself. Read good books, talk about them, show an interest in current events as well as the bigger issues and ideas in history, science, psychology, and so on. ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t \u201cget\u201d them the best education.  But you can \u201cgive\u201d them the best education.  It starts with what you do at home.  In fact, regardless of where you send your kid to school, how much they learn, absorb, and retain is directly proportionate to how much effort you make at home.  You could send your kid to the most elite, expensive, private school in your area, but if you show no interest in their education, they might as well just go a low performing public school because they won\u2019t care enough to benefit from the better teachers/programs. Read to them.  Read with them.  Require them to read at home.Help them with their homework.  That doesn\u2019t mean \u201cdo it for them.\u201d  Figure out what they struggle with and help them find a solution.  If it\u2019s material that beyond your knowledge, the internet is full of tutorials and help.  It\u2019s the making the effort to help that will benefit them because they know you care about them.Support their teachers.  This should have been #1 on the list because of how big an impact it has on kids\u2019 psychology.  Unless you think your teacher is mentally or physically abusing your child, making your kid strive to live up to a teachers demands will only help them, no matter how ridiculous or difficult those demands may seem.  Learning to conquer difficulty is a more important thing to learn in life than any knowledge a school can teach them.  Parents who demand teachers cater to their children instead of demanding the children strive to meet the teacher\u2019s requirements are the MOST harmful thing to a child\u2019s education.  More harmful than ineffective teachers, bad curriculum, disruptive classmates, or anything else I can think of.  You want to make your child weak\u2026 take their side against their teachers.  You want to make them great\u2026 teach them to respect their teachers and to live up to their expectations.Show an interest in their education.  Talk to them about what is happening at their school and attend as many of their things as you can:  Back to School Night, Parent/Teacher Conferences, school performances, sports games, etc.  The more you care, the more likely they will care.",
