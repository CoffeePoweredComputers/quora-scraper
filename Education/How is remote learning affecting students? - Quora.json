            "answer_text": "While educators are working to address students\u2019 learning needs, they are also realizing the effects of remote learning on students\u2019 mental health. Generally, students who were thriving before are doing well now, while some struggling students are falling further behind. But just as the pandemic has thrown some families into new categories of financial need, it has taken a mental toll on some students who do well in the traditional school setting. Many educators report an increase in anxiety among students. Each age group has specific needs that can be difficult to meet, too. For the youngest kids, the transition from teacher-centered instruction to student-directed, parent-supported lessons has been jarring for some, said Katie Scarpati, principal of Mill Brook School, a K-2 school in Concord. That\u2019s especially true for students whose home lives are unstable, said Kris Gallo, principal of Christa McAuliffe School, a K-5 school in Concord. One kindergarten teacher shared with her that she tried meeting with her whole class via live video as a way to maintain social connections among them. It didn\u2019t go as she\u2019d hoped. \u201cThere\u2019s so much stress in some of these families\u2019 lives \u2026 she felt like she shouldn\u2019t have seen that,\u201d Gallo said. For middle school kids, who are beginning to exercise some independence from their parents and forge their own identities, the loss of peer interaction can be tough, said Kim Carpentino, principal of Gilbert H. Hood Middle School in Derry. She\u2019s also concerned about cyberbullying and other misuse of technology among students in this age bracket. The school has had only a handful of such incidents this year, but Carpentino is taking a proactive approach by reminding students to be kind to each other in the morning message she posts for students each day. \u201cThey can be rough with each other online,\u201d she said. While high school kids aren\u2019t immune to such adolescent woes, some have also been thrust into adult roles since the pandemic arrived. \u201cA lot of these kids right now are working a lot,\u201d Dover High School Principal Peter Driscoll said. \u201cThey might be the family paycheck.\u201d Others are babysitting siblings and helping administer their classwork while their parents work. As a result of the added responsibilities, some students who aced their classes in the past are suddenly struggling, Driscoll said. Districts are addressing the varied and changing needs of students in numerous ways. \u201cI have teachers who meet with kids at seven at night,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to ask of the kid and a lot to ask of the teacher.\u201d In Derry, guidance counselors have been issued cell phones by the district so they can stay in close touch with students without compromising their own privacy, Carpentino said. Many districts have devised spreadsheets and other tools for keeping track of and responding to individual needs as they arise. \u201cLuckily for all the schools, we know the kids. We\u2019ve had two trimesters with these kids,\u201d Carpentino said. \u201cWe know who the struggling kids are right now, and we\u2019re trying to pick up those who are struggling in this new model.\u201d Empathy may be the most important tool educators can wield in dealing with the range of student needs, SAU 24 (Henniker, Weare, and Stoddard) Superintendent Jacqueline Coe said. \u201cThere are families who are under stress \u2026 who just can\u2019t do this right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe expectations can\u2019t be the same. This is about supporting our community.\u201d This is part of an ongoing series about remote learning in New Hampshire.

            "answer_text": "After years of working in the IT support for schools industry, I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s been changes that have been due to arrive for a very long time, one of them was the implementation of remote/online learning platforms and although it came to be through a tragic situation, it has been a vital thing recently. There are pros and cons with the use of remote learning and there are multiple factors that can affect the productivity of the learners. For example, some students that feel \u2018left out\u2019 or just really dislike school in general, may begin to thrive and show true brilliance whereas on the other hand, another student who generally likes school and feels more comfortable in the environment, may become more of a procreastinator in a home learning setting. I\u2019m sure as time goes on and more data is recorded and analysed, we will find out for certain whether there is benefits to adopting remote learning as a full-time thing or not. ",
