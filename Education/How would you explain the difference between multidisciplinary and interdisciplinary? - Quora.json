            "answer_text": "I can give you definitions with analogies and then give you some practical examples. The scientific enterprise led by large national institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health, is conducted in silos or disciplines. That is, individual disciplines (eg., psychology, sociology, chemistry, physics, genetics, etc.) have established their independent questions and methods of inquiry so that respective discipline are insular and independent. A multidisciplinary approach is the employment of different or multiple disciplines to solve a specific problem. Each discipline may employ their discipline-specific approach in solving the problem. The end result provides multiple answers from different disciplines in addressing or resolving the same problem or question. Using the silo analogy \u2014 different silos would individually approach the problem and provide solutions from each individual silos. An interdisciplinary approach employs different or multiple disciplines in a team approach to solve a specific problem. The disciplines come together to develop novel strategies appropriate for specific problems. Using the silo analogy, the individual silos build bridges connecting the silos in jointly approach the problem. I give you an example from my own research. I studied very old people over 100 years, and my research focused on predictors of longevity and survival. In the last 10 years of my research, I conducted a program project of four projects and five \u201ccores\u201d to study a group of representative centenarians from the state of Georgia. About 45 investigators from 9 universities participated in this research. The four projects investigated genetics, functional capacities and clinical medicine, personality, and adaptation. The four cores provided support in administration, cell blood and DNA, brain autopsy, data collection, and data management. The project team consists of geneticists, nutritionists, exercise physiologists, pathologists, physiologists, psychologists, demographers, physicians, nurses, and statisticians. Hence, a multidisciplinary team was formed to allow project personnel to work together to gather data and test specific hypotheses within the projects. Publications derived from specific project (e.g., genetics of longevity) employed a multidisciplinary approach in that different disciplines contributed to specific findings on the contributions of specific genes to longevity. Interdisciplinary approaches were also employed to test hypotheses across projects. An example of an interdisciplinary research question is how do specific genes influence the personality of individuals to impact cognition and intelligence of very old people. To answer this question data across disciplines need to be analyzed to examine the direct and indirect contributions of these parameters. ",

            "answer_text": "The only difference in meaning is in the prefix: \u201cMulti\u201d = Many \u201cInter\u201d = Between Thus multidisciplinary means many disciplines or fields of study. A multidisciplinary medical conference to address the impact of Diabetes on health might thus involve Cardiology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology, or more. An interdisciplinary meeting or conference between two or more fields or disciplines to discuss the pathogenesis or causes of Diabetes might then involve Endocrinology and Immunology. Thus Interdisciplinary conference is between two fields to focus on the causes of Diabetes versus the Multidisciplinary conference which is focused to understand the many effects or consequences of Diabetes on different organ systems. As you can see, in reality there is very little distinction between the two terms. ",
