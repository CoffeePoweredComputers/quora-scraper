            "answer_text": "Math, science and special education.  Stick with the basics.  Most high schols are focusing heavily on the old R's (reading, writing and 'rithymitic,) and those things only.  I would add English/language arts, but it seems like there are a lot of those folks with secondary degrees and I don't see a lot of positions in the near future. Think about shifts in the political and cultural scene in America.  We have a growing number of kiddos being identified with special needs, a growing population of non English speaking immigrants, and  anything STEM (science, maths, and technology) is really being actively recruited at the national, state and local level.  Avoid elective areas (Art, music, business, home economics, automotive repair,) as a lot of American schools are cutting these kinds of programs. ",
