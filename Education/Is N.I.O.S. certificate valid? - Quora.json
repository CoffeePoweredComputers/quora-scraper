            "answer_text": "In the eyes of GOVT. as well as legally it is valid to pursue any higher education. But our Indian society will never accept . They think Open education is waste of time and they doesn't value a student who does education by Open means, not only NIOS but they do the same with IGNOU and other open education boards. So i request NIOS students please if you faced any year backs or dropped out of education , continue your education with NIOS and prove the society wrong who say NIOS is not valid. Some private institutions won't accept NIOS certificates for admission its not because NIOS is not valid, Its because in their eyes or as per their standards NIOS has no value . Don't join such institutes or even don't argue with them . NIOS is a well recognised board run by MHRD in India and has definitely good value if you have registered online legally and written exams without any malpractices and passed based on your own hardwork.
