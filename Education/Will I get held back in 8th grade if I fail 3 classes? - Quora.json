            "answer_text": "This question requires a lot more information, such as: state you live in (don't answer that), which classes you are failing, by how much you are failing, if you are in SPED (no offense, i was a SPED teacher, is all). Has there been discussion of holding you back? Have your parent's had to go in for parent teacher conferences? Because this should have been discussed a month ago. And from the way you asked your question, it doesn't sound like any of this has been done. Do your parents know you are failing these classes? With all that said, I'm going to make some assumptions when giving my advice\u2026 First of all, make sure your parents know. They might be mad, but I bet they'll be a lot madder that the school didn't contact them (assuming they didn't). After they get over being mad, they are going to be your best weapon. All that taken care of (Whether it already was or not), ask those teachers to talk to you in private and ask what you can do to raise your grade\u2026 extra credit, whatever. Believe it or not, schools don't want to hold students back, but they will if they think the student isn't ready, or to teach them a lesson to take school more seriously. But you really have to be on the you-know-what list for that to happen to you. It's also a LOT of work to fail a student. Lots of meetings are involved, data, the teacher's gradebooks, and everything is looked at. So, failing students is a lot of extra work during a time of year that teachers are buried in work, and nobody wants that. If nothing else, the teachers will appreciate you taking responsibility and trying to bring up your grades. ",

            "answer_text": "At least in California, in 25 years of teaching, I never knew a student to get held back in 8th grade. Certainly, they may ask you to go to summer school, but even then, they cannot prevent you from entering high school. In high school students earn credit class by class. Ever class a student fails will have to be made up in some way if he is means to graduate. The more interesting question is why is the student failing 3 classes? Usually when my students were failing, there was some external stress\u2014an illness, death, move, intense bullying, divorce, homelessness, etc. It is really hard to stay focused on doing school work when life is demanding so much of one\u2019s attention. Still, life is always going to put those external stressors on a person, so 8th grade is a good time to work on being successful despite them. Usually success relies on reaching out to other resources for help\u2014teachers, counselors, coaches, the local librarian, etc. It means taking advantage of things like study halls and homework clubs\u2014or even enlisting one\u2019s friends to help one study and get organized.
