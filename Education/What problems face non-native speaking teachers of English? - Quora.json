            "answer_text": "Some of these difficulties will be dependent on what is the first language of the teacher. However, native-like accurate and fluent (speedy) pronunciation is likely to be the most problematic aspect to come up. English has a mine field of elements that are there to interfere with the mastery of pronunciation, which might explain why the native-like teachers and linguists are not inclined to remove these, as these ensure that they \u2014and only them\u2014can do the work more accurately. (John Katt's answer to What are your most controversial or unpopular opinions?) On the other hand, non-native-like teachers will beat \u2014depending on the language they know\u2014 native-speakers in spelling and depth of vocabulary. They will also be able to explain to the non-native learners in their language the inherent workings of the language and most of its aspects. In essence, the native-speaking teachers should be asked to do one task and speak, which might be going the way the dodo birds went because there is now plenty of media that non-native teachers can use to make up for the lack of accuracy in pronunciation. Bear in mind that dialects and accents are so diverse in the Commonwealth that a South-African might not be the best candidate if US English is needed to be learned. ",

            "answer_text": "I have known a number of English teachers who are not native speakers. The biggest issue I am aware of is accurate pronunciation. I am sure that a non-native speaker English teacher could have excellent pronunciation, but that would require that they work extensively with a native speaker, or use some other techniques. I have known non-native speakers who have excellent pronunciation, but they have not been English teachers. My teacher friends may not have mother tongue pronunciation, but they can easily best me when it comes to explaining grammar. I KNOW how to say things in a grammatically correct way, but I can't necessarily explain the grammar behind it. ",
