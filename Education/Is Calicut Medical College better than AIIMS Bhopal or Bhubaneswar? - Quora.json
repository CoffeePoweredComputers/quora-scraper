            "answer_text": "im from Kerala and I joined Aiims Jodhpur although I was planning to join TVM medical or Calicut via NEET And I have not regretted my decision since then. Kerala colleges are very well established but the standard of AIIMS colleges are just as good. Considering the fact that they are still up and coming. Kerala colleges are old and so Are the hostels. this was a major reason for me to pick Jodhpur Aiims - single room with attached bathroom and attached balcony.. a dream come true for me. Kerala has many established coaching centres with excellent results every year. But the internship period in the governemnt colleges are very hectic it's almost impossible to prepare for PG during the time. In AIIMS the internship period is a breath of fresh air for any PG aspirant since every day students are free by evening and get hours at night for pursuing whatever it is they want to do..study..extracurriculars.. etc ",

CALICUT MEDICAL COLLEGE - on the other hand is closer to your home and also is a very well established institution compared to the new AIIMS. A lot of students from CALICUT MEDICAL COLLEGE do get into AIIMS for PG because the coaching centres in and around kerala for PG is extremely brilliant. SO, HOPE THIS CLARIFIES YOUR DOUBT! AND YEAH I FORGOT !! HATS OFF W.R.T YOU RESULTS!! ",
