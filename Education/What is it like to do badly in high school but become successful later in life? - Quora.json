            "answer_text": "Define \u201cNot doing well\u201d, some see it as getting mostly Cs & Bs but no As. Others see it as getting mostly Cs & Ds, sometimes Fs, but no Bs or As. From what I heard, anyone can pass the final exam for High School to get a Diploma, and say you don\u2019t get it, you can always get the GED. If you\u2019re aiming for college, you have to have at least a Diploma/GED. But if you\u2019re aiming for university, you\u2019re gonna need not just As & Bs all across the board with hardly anything lower grades, but your personality will have to fit their standards (some are extremely picky and won\u2019t accept someone even if they have As only). If you want the careers like Game Designer, Doctor, Police, Architect, etc, then you\u2019ll want college or university. But if you\u2019re just going for regular jobs, then most cases you don\u2019t really need a HSD/GED - some just lie and get hired anyways. I never graduated or even made it past 9th grade, yet I was able to get jobs in various businesses that paid pretty decently. Most of what HS teaches (based on other people\u2019s accounts) doesn\u2019t really help with life in general unless you\u2019re going for a big career that some of those subjects represent. We\u2019re taught in middle school about nuclear isotopes but that honestly doesn\u2019t help unless we plan on becoming nuclear physicists or want to build/dismantle a nuke. Same with music & art classes, only really useful if we plan to be artists or musicians. Most of what will help you in the real world, school doesn\u2019t teach (they honestly should), and you can get most help from online sources, books in various libraries, or personal experience. One thing to note: My brother never made it to middle school, he was pulled out by our parent for fear of bullying. Eventually, he started reading books on carpentry & electrical stuff, and in a few months before he hit the age of 18, he became a Carpenter, Electrician, Architect, and was well versed in Agriculture. He never went to middle school or high school, hell he wasn\u2019t even home schooled. Yet within a few months he became knowledgeable enough to utilize very useful skills that can help him become a professional contractor who actually knows what he is doing as opposed to other contractors who did go to college for their trades and barely do half as well. So, can you make it in life even if you fail in school? Absolutely. Just because school ends doesn\u2019t mean your ability to learn & better yourself does as well. You will always discover new ways to make your life better, but it ultimately starts & ends with your best effort, the best things in life are not gonna simply land in your lap, you have to learn & teach yourself everything in order to get the career(s) or jobs that you want.

            "answer_text": "I know a lot of people. Lot of jack asses in high school just have a lot of energy and independence in them. They actually can make for good managers or business owners. This one friend of my brothers was a jackass like all my brothers shitty friends. They did drugs and fucked off on the school work or skipped classes etc. My brother didn\u2019t even graduate. Well this other guy did graduate I think or got a GED. He got a job installing air conditioning systems or generators. He worked hard and became foreman and then Supervisor of an entire division. He makes 6 figures now and has for almost a decade. I was B to A student and I have done many things but I failed at most of it. I\u2019m not nearly as successful as my brothers friend. Or maybe his life has turned to shit now. :p I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t met the guy in 8 years. I don\u2019t live in that state anymore. ",
