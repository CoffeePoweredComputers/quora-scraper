            "answer_text": "You can take two routes here. I only recommend one. You can hit the streets or hang with some friends who get high. This will almost guarantee you an education in drugs. When you get sick of the small stuff then you'll easily find those who will educate you in the dark arts. Or, you could enroll in a school of pharmacy and learn the not only the drugs, but also how to stuff them in a bottle for a good yearly salary. Hope that helps. ",
