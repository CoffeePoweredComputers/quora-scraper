            "answer_text": "There is no right or wrong answer for this question. It is merely different options which will yield different results. Basically you have a limitation of the capacity, and what is taught in the class is not fully relevant to your passion. There are a couple of options, a, change the school, provide feedbacks to the school that what you guys teach are not engaging, bla, bla. b. change yourself, try to develop passion about the subject that the teacher is teaching. c. change your location, switch to a different program or school which meets your passion better. d. medicate yourself, study those boring stuff during day time, after it is done, play some video games to get rid of the boredom. f. drop out of the school to work on your own stuff, steve jobs, bill gates, mark zuckerberg all followed route f.

            "answer_text": "You are conflicted. You say you don't care, yet you express frustration. This tells me that you really do care, but that you don't know how to avoid frustration. You need to focus in on what is in front of you for the moment, and give it the most attention you can give. Make it your habit to do your very best.  Not just for yourself, but for the others that depend on you (or will depend on you). Prepare yourself well for your classes. Study in advance. Prepare questions to ask to the teacher and to other students. Show interest in the subject. Make it a point to learn something new about the subject in every interaction you have. Prepare yourself well for your classes. Get the appropriate amount of exercise, eat the right foods, get enough sleep. Your social networking and video games will be there - surely they aren't as important as building the knowledge and skills that will start the income stream that will support you and your loved ones for the rest of your lives? Prepare yourself well for your classes. Take time to rejuvenate yourself through meaningful relationships with friends, family and whatever religion you ascribe to. It all boils down to finding and keeping the right balance.  Right now, it sounds like you do not have balance. Seek it. ",
