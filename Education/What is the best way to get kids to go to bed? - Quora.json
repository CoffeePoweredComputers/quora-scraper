            "answer_text": "Bedtime is bedtime. After the teeth are brushed, and the toys picked up and put away, the pajamas get their turn to come out of their hiding place and fulfill their duties, tops and bottoms. They only have the one job to do, and by golly, they want to do it! Ah, the first piece of the puzzle falls into place. Also known as imagination, or alternatively, distraction. I can\u2019t imagine anyone putting their child to bed and not reading to them for at least twenty to thirty minutes. I looked forward to it so much every evening, how could my son not? \u201cOh, boy. Mom\u2019s got that look on her face again. It must be bedtime.\u201d Which translated, meant \u2018Story Time\u2019. It also meant a time for sharing confidences, catching up, discussing ideas, or just chatting. My son was just beginning to talk, when one night, as I was lying next to him in bed, I asked him about his day at his sitter\u2019s. I worked full time, and was on day shift and my mother was away for a short time. I changed to swing shift shortly after this incident. The sitter had just the three children, which I thought was nice, and made it easier for her to spend more time with my child. Uh-huh. He looked at me when I asked him this, his baby face sad, and told me, \u201cBabysitter hit.\u201d Two words that made my stomach drop, and my hands start to shake. I tried to get more information from him, but he only had the few words under his diaper at the time. I was on the phone with the city licensing agency pretty quickly the next morning. Over at least eight years of going to bed and reading together, we went through the entire series of The Indian in the Cupboard, Narnia, The Borrowers, The Wizard of Oz (I think; that\u2019s a pretty big series), and a box full of oft read Little Golden Books, the Little Critter series, and the Berenstain Bears, besides many other single titles. Of course, Dr.Seuss was prominent, Green Eggs and Ham being the first book my son ever read, and I was the one who was privileged to teach him. He may even become a Bottom Writer himself one day. I can remember being so sleepy sometimes while reading to him that I actually fell asleep, but I kept on reading aloud. What woke me up was the sound of my garbled speech as I dropped into a pit, while managing to continue talking. It\u2019s lovely to go on field trips to museums, and movies, and shopping. But I can imagine few greater or more productive ways to show your love for a child, than to lie side by side with them on their bed and read to them at bedtime. ",

            "answer_text": "My youngest son wouldn't stay in bed either, but I was usually too exhausted to make a big deal of it, and he being the third one, I wasn't so engaged in being known to \u2018do the right thing'. So most nights, after I'd put the children to bed, he would creep downstairs, bumping down each step on his nappied bottom, initially perhaps thinking that he would be greeted by either cuddles or crossness. Instead, I just ignored him and carried on with the chores. If I was washing dishes, he liked to sit between my feet, hiding under my long skirt. I stepped over him as and when I needed to, but continued to ignore him. If I was ironing, he stayed nearby but knew to avoid my feet (I kept moving the board to avoid him, but otherwise didn't engage). He would lay on the floor quietly and play with his trains. He often fell asleep on the floor, or would climb onto the sofa and fall asleep there. Eventually I'd take him back up to his cot. He needed to be near me, and I needed to get on with stuff. He somehow understood that this was a special agreement between us. We had time together even though I didn't engage with him (he'd had plenty of that during \u2018regular\u2019 hours), although I always smiled at him, so he'd know I wasn't cross, and we worked it out together. It saved me a lot of energy, I didn't get upset or frustrated, he didn't get upset or frustrated, and he got the sleep he needed as well as the nearness he craved. Occasionally I'd sit for a few minutes and cuddle him briefly, but I never spoke, then I'd set him back where he was and carry on. He, remarkable child that he was (and continues to be), he got it, and we had this arrangement for several years until he chose to stay in bed instead, or to play quietly in his own room. There's no rule that says a child must stay in their bed once put there; it's just easier if they do. There's no rule that says you can't do things your own way; it's just peer pressure to conform, even in parenting. Every child is different; every parent is different, but if you can stay relaxed and enjoy your own unique relationship with each other, and trust yourself, you can both get what you need, and even enjoy the phase while lasts.
