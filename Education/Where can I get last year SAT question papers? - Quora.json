            "answer_text": "You will not be able get them. But, you have access to SAT official practice tests (as of now eight tests) published by College Board, who manages conducting standardized tests like SAT. You can conclude SAT preparation, by taking Official SAT Practice Tests, published by College Board, one by one and try completing all of them. This gives you practice to remain concentrated for full exam duration and also help you in bridging the knowledge gap. Practice makes you perfect and also gets you used to the rigor of actual test. Take the most recent one, answer as if you are doing in a test center and within the prescribed time. Evaluate your answers, you have scoring sheet and also explanations to answers available.Review all wrong / guessed questions and understand how you can get them right next time. Take the next practice test, adopt this iterative approach, until you complete all official tests and will definitely improve your overall score. Refer Which books are the best to prepare for the SAT preparation? and select one for your preparation. I would personally recommend Barron\u2019s. It is a bit harder than the actual SAT, but it is better to write a harder mock test than the easier one. So if you are in a time constraint, don\u2019t get demotivated by the mock test results. These books also carry practice tests for your practice. ",
