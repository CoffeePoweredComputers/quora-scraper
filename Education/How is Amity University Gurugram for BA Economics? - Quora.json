            "answer_text": "BA (hons) Economics is a newly introduced course in Amity University Gurgaon and was introduced in 2012. To be really hones it is only average. Student strength has consistently been low each year. This is because the campus is located far away from the central gurgaon and also because the course is newly started and hasn't been able to leave its mark yet. Quality teachers are not employed because of lack of student strength and even if a dedicated person does come they do not stick on for long and move on to better options. Overall lack of discipline, poor execution or course delivery and lack of focus have been key characteristics  in Amity University Gurgaon's Ba (hons) Economics course. Note: All of this has been writer's personal experience and others may hold alternating views as well. ",
