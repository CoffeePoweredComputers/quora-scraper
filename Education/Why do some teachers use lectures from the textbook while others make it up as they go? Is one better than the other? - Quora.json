            "answer_text": "There are two primary reasons why a teacher will lecture: they are a newer teacher and have not had time and experience to memorize the material, or they have developed those lectures a long time ago and do not want to change their style. When you see a teacher not lecturing and talking without notes is not \u201cmaking it up\u201d. This teacher has done this many times and they have internalized the material to the point where they don\u2019t need notes anymore. In my opinion, the lecture is not good teaching, at least not in grades under college. Students consistently say that lectures are boring and hard to follow. They\u2019re even worse if they are accompanied by slides. When I teach, I put together the slide deck that would have been lecture. I then post those to my class website and assign the students to read my notes for homework. In actual class time, we talk about the subject matter and I mediate discussion. I break the students into groups and then they do exercises based on the subject matter covered in the lecture notes. This is called \u201cflipping the classroom\u201d. When I poll my students they say the class is far more interesting and engaging, and then they can use my notes and additional ones they created in class to study for the test. When I was training in 2005, my master teachers told me to avoid lecture as much as possible, and my current boss does not hire teachers who lecture. Some people can make lectures super engaging and amazing. Hats off to those people\u2014that is not my style. ",

            "answer_text": "Instructors always do a fair amount of ad-libing and I always did especially in an attempt to give examples of how instructional content actually applies to real world situations. It is much easier for students to understand, follow, and study content from books and instructional materials. I always felt that content was the basis for the instruction in the class. It also helped me to see that the material was delivered in a very logical sequence and gave students a good road map of material they needed to know and what was going to be on exams. That is frequently not the case when instructors want to rely heavily on lecture content and students may not be as clear on what they need to focus their studies on to do well on exams. I hated it when I was in college and instructors were all over the place with their emphasis in lectures but exams seemed to have a different focus. ",
