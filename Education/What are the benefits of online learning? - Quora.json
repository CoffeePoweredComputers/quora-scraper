            "answer_text": "What are the Advantages of Online Training/E-Learning? Online training or e-learning has several advantages over other types of training that could be implemented, for example: Availability \u2013 Always AvailableAbility to Refer to the ContentNo Physical Classroom Space NeededAbility to Reach Endless StudentsAvailability \u2013 Always Available \u2022\tNo need to set hours Online training is typically administered via the internet. It can be taken or completed based on the users\u2019 schedule. You are not dependent upon set hours of availability. \u2022\tGreat for remote users This could also be the case if the training is delivered across a company intranet, depending on the setup of the firewall and accessibility for remote users. Ability to Refer to the Content \u2022\tAbility to retake and refer When training is web-based, unless student access is limited to a specific amount of time, students can typically refer to the content repeatedly. This means they can oftentimes retake the material, refer to their notes and read through as a refresher, if needed. No Physical Classroom Space Needed \u2022\tCost-Savings Sometimes classroom space comes with a rental cost to the trainer, team, organization or company. If you are training 100% online, then the student can train using their current location. This results in a cost-savings in terms of rent, supplies, printouts and food. This also results in a time-savings in terms of paperwork and organizing the rental agreement with an additional 3rd party. \u2022\tComforts of home This could also mean that a parent taking the training could train at a home office after the kids are in bed or in an external space, such as the local coffee shop or restaurant. Ability to Reach Endless Students \u2022\tUnlimited headcount If you have a classroom of students, you are limited based on the capacity of the room or conference center. However, if you have an online training course, the headcount that can be trained of your course content is limitless. Said differently, if the training was written in the language of a user, they can complete your training. \u2022\tAny device Users can take the course from their smartphone, iPad, laptop, desktop or any other device that can reach the internet. Nearly any and every device can reach the internet these days, even certain cameras. \u2022\tTime- savings Imagine for a moment that you have 10 classes to offer a world-wide population. I each of these 10 classes has a total student enrollment of 5,000 unique students, that you have 50,000 total students that your materials have taught within a short amount of time. Now think about this, if you took 50,000 students and divided them into classroom trainings in a room that held 40 students at a time, then you would have to comparatively teach each 125 times. At the rate of 10 classes multiplied by 125, you would have to teach 1,250 total classroom trainings. That is a very dramatic comparison at a huge time savings. ",
