Destruction and creation is same. A current wire and earth wire (the opposite)(when they met) (they destroy each other) but result is light of lamp. Light is creation, meeting of opposites is destruction. Same is applicable for male and female, they met in sex, at final stage, destruction and creation happen as same time. Destruction and Creation is same but direction is opposite, location is same or center. Destruction is happening every moment is each particle (through mass and gravity) and result is the time(creation). Both happening everywhere at same time. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at creation, it is just that you manifest something for a purpose, a creation which has an identity and illusion that works around it. On the other hand, destruction is just disintegration of identity and ego which revolves around it, it also may serve for the new creation to take place or may turn into nothingness. In short, they both are a dimension to infinite possibility and utmost emptiness respectively. ",
