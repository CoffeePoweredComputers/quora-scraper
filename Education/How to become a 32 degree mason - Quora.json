            "answer_text": "The first three degrees of Masonry are conferred in the local lodge, or Blue Lodge as it is often known. These are the Entered Apprentice (EA), Fellowcraft (FC), and Master Mason (MM). Those are the highest degrees in Masonry. The Scottish Rite confers the 4th through 32nd Degrees as a part of its work but they are not considered to make anyone \u201cmore of a Mason\u201d than he already is. It always make me laugh when someone says their uncle or whoever was a 32nd degree Mason as if that was really an achievement. Being made a 32nd degree Mason is nothing more than a Master Mason paying a fee to the Scottish Rite and attending a Reunion (meeting), normally held two or three times a year, and receiving the 29 degrees via exemplification or communication. My fee was $175, but that varies by region. In Oklahoma we normally confer all 29 degrees at the same Reunion. Normally this is accomplished in two days although there have been some one day conferrals. In either case many of the degrees are communicated. For the benefit of those readers not familiar with the Scottish Rite the degrees are either \u201cexemplified\u201d by means of a short play, or \u201ccommunicated\u201d by having someone summarize the lessons the play would have taught. Certain degrees are required to be exemplified. I received my degrees in a special 3-day conferral at which all 29 degrees were exemplified and that was highly unusual. I know in earlier times the degrees were presented over an extended period of time and in Europe that is still often the case. Truth is, I know some brethren who Petitioned for the Degrees, one month later received their E.A. degree and on the following weekend got a one-day conferral of the FC and MM degrees and the following weekend received a one-day conferral at the Scottish Rite. This was all properly timed, with a Grand Master\u2019s time dispensation, to take a man off the street to 32 degree in less than two months. If the new Brother had the next weekend free the Shrine or York Rite were ready and waiting. If you can\u2019t tell, my preference is for a Brother to witness as many of the degrees as possible and to regularly return to watch them again and again. There are many valuable lessons that will be lost if you do not see them often enough. Nearly everyone will tell you that you will learn more each time you see them. Nor do I in any way diminish the value of being a Scottish Rite Mason by emphasizing how easily it may be obtained. I am simply saying that the 32nd Degree is not some secret deep inner circle. Its degrees are all beautiful in both presentation and content, something I strongly recommend to all Master Masons. Beyond the 32nd degree (Black caps) is the 32nd Degree, Knight Commander, Court of Honor which is a distinction rather than a degree. The 32nd KCCH (Red caps) is award to 32nd degree Masons for their work or other activity. The 33rd Degree, Inspector General Honorary (White caps) is reserved for men who provided substantial benefit and service to the Scottish Rite. Finally, there is the 33rd Degree Grand Cross (White cap with blue band) that is extremely rare and bestowed on 33rd Degree IGH Masons who have contributed greatly to Masonry, generally through research. All of these higher recognitions as subject to time served at the previous level, limited to a percentage of the membership, and if requested must be denied. ",

            "answer_text": " Here are the degrees for each rite. It is interesting to note that these structures have changed throughout the history of Freemasonry and the country. For example, when the beloved and honoured Dr. Joseph Warren was knighted a Templar (the second in America, Paul Revere who received the same degree was third), he was done so by a combined degree of the Royal Arch-Knight Templar, which as you can see by the \u2018modern\u2019 structure is now separated by numerous other degrees. Also, the Order of Malta or SMOM being included in the York Rite shows the level of infiltration obtained by the jesuits within the craft John Templar's answer to If you\u2019re a Freemason are you then part of the NWO, and how? , for this order arose from the Hospitaliers, allied to the papacy with blood oaths and arch enemies of the Templars, who weren\u2019t.

The Templar system is about the same in USA and Canada. The Province/State/National organizations are rather different between the two countries and more different than England, Scotland and Ireland. One interesting feature of Ireland is that one must be a Knight Templar for seven years before one can be invited to join the AASR. In England one must be a professing Christian to join the AASR where for simplicity the whole 4-18 is just called the Rose Croix. For information on how these degrees are administered in your jurisdiction, contact your local Grand Lodge. The jesuit infiltration goes all the way to the 33 degree, as the oath of the degree is very much \u2018watered down\u2019 from its previous incarnation.

Each of these groups uses different titles, structure, etc.  One such group is called the Scottish Rite. The Scottish Rite is made up of 29 \"degrees.\"  These degrees are numbered 4 through 32, but they are not higher than the Third (Master Mason) Degree.
