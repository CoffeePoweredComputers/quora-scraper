            "answer_text": "If you love to explore and research than you can go for BSc in Mathematics or Physics then after BSc you can go for MSc then PhD. Always go for the best college for MSc (In IISc, IITs, or abroad) if you cannot make it for BSc in some top college. If you are interested in job or want to start business something like that i would suggest Engineering but wait, Engineering only in top colleges of India i.e. Old 6\u20137 IITs (Bombay, Madras, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Guwahati, Roorkee) or Old NITs (like NIT Warangal, Tiruchirapalli, Suratkal, Nagpur) or preferred top state colleges (Which are also named Autonomous colleges which do not come under State university for eg. VJTI, COEP in maharashtra). If you don\u2019t get admission is any such top colleges for Engineering then either take a drop and prepare for JEE dedicately and get a 2 or 3 digit rank for gettimg admission in top engineering colleges or don\u2019t do engineering. If you would love to pursue only mathematics then i would suggest to go through \u2018 What ia Financial Education?\u2019, then after having a brief knowledge in it and read \u2018Rich Dad, Poor Dad\u2019 by Robert Kiyosaki, \u2018Cashflow Quadrant\u2019 by Robert Kiyosaki then you can think of studying or getting into Finance field and later do MBA in finance. I hope this answer helps. Good luck! ",
