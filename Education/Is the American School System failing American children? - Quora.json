            "answer_text": "Can\u2019t speak for the whole system, I can speak for one in a big City in California (Berkeley High). The English teacher discusses stories, and assigns writing assignments (essays) after some discussion of the stories. So far, so good. The teacher perhaps than reads these papers, DOESN\u2019T MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS, EVER, puts a grade at the top, (such as: \u201cGood work, B-\u201d). Tell me just HOW are the students suppose to learn to write when they do not know what errors they made? You might say: \u2018Well, that\u2019s just ONE teacher, in one school\u2026\u2019 NO, this instructor is/was the head of the English Department at a school of 3,000 students. \u2014\u2014\u2014- Now, lets move on to the Chemistry Class there; the instructor sez lets be quiet (while he sits at his desk checking papers from the AP class), and read chapter X. 10 minutes before the end of class he asks: \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d Then: end of class. One day, he starts lecturing (no silent reading), and I begin taking notes. (WOW, I guess he\u2019s been postponing actual teaching until now me thinks). He put together an excellent lecture, fielded questions, and put bullet points on the board! GREAT- at the end of class I pick-up my books to leave, and look to the back of the class where an adult is sitting, monitoring the class. This was the first\u2026 and last decent lecture in High School Chemistry. Again: he was the head of the Chemistry Department.  Why can\u2019t schools simply deal with such behavior (in California Schools)? Because tenured instructors have their jobs protected by their Union. Lawyers come out of the woodwork if a teacher is fired. It takes 3\u20134 years for the district to fight the case through the courts. UNLESS the instructor has committed a heinous felony, then it\u2019s not likely the school will win. The FEE for the disctrict runs $300k if they WIN, and $500k if they lose. So the actual amount of teachers in California that are fired is LESS than .07 of one percent. With 300,000 teachers, that\u2019s less than 10 per year. They don\u2019t have a \u2018job\u2019, once tenured, they have an \u2018entitlement.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "There are many issues, but as a person with a degree in History, I\u2019m appalled by the differences between California and Texas on history textbooks. The politicization of history texts is not new, but it is always corrosive and destructive to the pursuit of the truth. Having P.E. coaches teach history, as was the custom when I was in high school, is another abomination. Teachers should be well versed in what they are teaching. Aside from that issue, it is important that the resources are adequate to the task. The bite that the Great Recession took out has not been replenished in many places, even a decade later. There are vast differences in financial allocations for students in different schools. Claims that financial resources don\u2019t matter are simply wrong; but student poverty is even more important. In higher education, the growth of administrative and other non-educational costs is eating away at opportunity for low-income students, who end up bearing the financial burden for middle and upper income students who get scholarships. Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s Revisonist History provides a good introduction to some of those financial issues. Suzanne Mettler\u2019s Degrees of Inequality: How the Politics of Higher Education Sabotaged the American Dream is another good source on this topic. The financial burden on the next generation will depress the economy for decades. We need to get rid of the financial parasites in the system. Higher education is free in Finland for Finns (foreign students will pay now). American politicians need to explain why we can\u2019t do that for Americans, but we can spend over $800 billion on a new space force. Ultimately, there\u2019s a lack of political will to address these issues. Being short-sighted will cost us a great deal in the long run. ",
