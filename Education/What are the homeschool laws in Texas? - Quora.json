            "answer_text": "It's definitely a good idea to research this on official sites and other official resources, but in general, homeschooling in Texas is fairly easy and simply since there is no standardized testing required.  I was home schooled from K-12 and graduated in Texas.  Texas views a homeschool as a private school.  So no interference from the state at all, and you get to choose a name for your school if you want to.  We did for my high school diploma.    Upon graduating and checking into colleges, I did have to provide a transcript which my my teacher/principle/mom put together.  Texas does require a certain number of credits of each basic academic area (Math, Science, etc.), but only for high school.  She found that info on a Texas State website for high school graduation requirements that weren't specifically for home schoolers, but for all high schools. ",
