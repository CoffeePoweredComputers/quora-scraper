            "answer_text": "I sorry if your thinking like Journie Nabors. But trying to leash your kids with technology isnt going to work, and is in fact rather counter productive. The first person that asked me how to bypass their parents use of Life 360 was right here on quora I answered by pointed them to a first page result on how to spoof my phones GPS. Disclaimer: I\u2019m a highly opinionated childless know it all. I have a negative opinion of this as a parental strategy. But that is independent of my assessment of the technical aspects of parental controls. But I\u2019ve worked enough IT/IT security to know that despite the promises made by the people who make and sell the stuff, parental spy/malware is at best just security theater. At first it all look and sounds all good. Until the day comes that your teen decides that its an obstacle that they need to get around. There is an internet full of people (including me) who are more then happy to help them slip their digital leash. If they want it bad enough they will find a way. A cinder-block wall costs $80/foot and takes weeks to build, a ladder cost $20 and can be there in an hour. Its the same nature of defense vs attack applies to software as well. Near infinite possibilities that need to be defended against, attacker just needs to find or make one whole. \u2026 How does one set up parental control on kid's phones and computers? Now that isn't to say that you cant have transparency and accountability for your children and their devices. Its possible to be able to locate them when needed, its just not possible to be able to locate them 24/7/365. You can have the visibility to guide and protect them, you just can\u2019t randomly comb trough the intimate details of their lives. You can be a dictator and do irreparable damage to your kids and your relationship as you attempt to strip them of their boundaries. Or you can be a decent human being and responsible parent. Me personally, I\u2019m with Christian Krueger, I want to someday know my grandchildren. How do I convince my mom not to put spying software on my phone? ",

            "answer_text": "The sheriff's office, and most recently the Madill Police Department in Oklahoma, shared graphics showing 15 apps parents should know about. The apps include well-known social media and dating apps like Snapchat, TikTok and WhatsApp, as well as location-based dating apps like MeetMe, Grindr and Skout.

It is a status symbol to have access to them and a Right of Passage to use them. Just be vigilant and occasionally tell them stories about your friends\u2019 kids [make them up if you have to] who got in serious danger when they gave out too much personal information to strangers using one of these Apps.
