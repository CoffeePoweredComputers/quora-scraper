            "answer_text": "The school system now is kind of frickity brickity if i\u2019m going to be blippity honest. Jokes aside, it actually is. Postmodernism is the cause, i would say, and its philosophy does not care about things that school was intentionally made for, in fact, it is against it completely. Truth, dialogue and logic are things that postmodernism are strictly against, and those things are essential, not only for a functionaly school system, but also for Humans themselves. That wasn\u2019t the best answer I have given, I would say, but it somewhat addresses your question and I hope that it was of use to you. I recommend you read Stephen Hicks Explaining Postmodernism, you can find some audiobooks on Youtube. ",
