            "answer_text": "I'm fifty years old and am going to take this all the way back to my first year in school when I was 4 years old. Preschool I miss having unconditional love and boundless self-confidence. I miss every second of your day being planned out for you and the orderliness of it all. I miss my pure innocence, my innocent questions my love for the world. Grade school I loved my walks to school. I miss the seasons! I miss the secret club houses! I miss the friends I made. I miss the innocence I saw the world with even though I knew it was bad too. I miss how knowledge was easily absorbed. No studying necessary! My brain was like a sponge! Junior High I miss the school subjects. I loved that I was super popular in the beginning until I started to get confused by social signals so withdrew more and more and more until friends were non existent. There is very little I miss about Junior high. High school Very little I miss about high school: the few great teachers I had and the few friends I made. College Had a professor who was open minded! He didn't buy into labels of anything: not even the idea of male and female! I didn't take it that far but loved him. It made him open to everyone and accept everyone. He was the first \u2018professor\u2019 my mom met and he LOVED her! He didn't see her as a person with limited potential like so many others had. Instead he realized how wonderful she was and encouraged her. She went back to school in middle age and it was the best time of her life. I loved my classes with this professor. Every college professor I had was awesome. I can tell you this truthfully in hopes for everyone to realize that if you are a young person and feel lost in life, just go to college. They will help you find your place. I HAVE NEVER EVER MET A COLLEGE PROFESSOR I DIDNT LIKE. COLLEGE PROFESSORS HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT!! They are the very best people on earth. If you don't get along with a professor: consider that it's your problem, your prejudices that are causing the problem. Maybe I've just been privileged but I know they are the best in the world. I have to make one exception to this: there is one professor I didn't like. He was extremely arrogant and self absorbed. His glory not his students were his priority. But this is only one out of I have no idea how many. I absolutely love my college years! I miss the relationships with my professors, but have kept in touch with many over the years. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been 2 years when I have finished my School. I\u2019m already missing everything about my school life. Morning Prayer  I miss morning prayer during my school days. We have to go to the ground in a queue and come back to our classroom in a queue. Most of the mischief me and my friend do during prayer. We are taught to close our eyes during prayer but me and my friends never close our eyes. We watch other children during prayer and make fun of them. Slapping our friends when they close eyes and act like nothing has happened. Stepping on others shoe purposely and saying \u201cI m sorry it happened by mistake\u201d. Friends  School friends are friends forever. Most of my good friends are made from school. We are still in touch and meet whenever possible. None of my friend call each other by their name. We have special name for each other which is more famous than their original name. Even our teachers know that names. I still call my school friends by their special names. Parents Teacher Meeting  If you want to see how innocent a child can be, look his face during PTM. All the innocence came out in PTM. Even our teacher on next day say that \u201cyou all become so innocent in front of your parents like you no nothing!\u201d. Teachers  School teachers are very caring and friendly (in my case). They teach good (some are exception) as well as very helping. Some of the most funniest teachers I have ever met are from my school. I have no complain about my teacher they all are very nice to me. Famous saying by all the teacher \u201c When I enter your class I feel like I\u2019m in a fish market\u201d. Fun  Chalk fight, Pen fight are the mostly things we do in our free time during school. I tell you what I enjoy doing. During winter we select one of our friend as a prey we put our sweater on his head to cover eyes. And then baam! slap! punch! bullets! (kidding) grenades!(kidding) Dhisum-dhisum (LOL) In a fraction of second he was beaten like hell and he can\u2019t do anything because he can not beat all of us. Ever heard of What goes around comes around ? I\u2019ll give you a very good example. The guy who put sweater on one of our friend (prey) is beaten by everyone mostly. You never know what can happen (LOL). Eating lunch before lunch break is very common. Sometimes teacher caught us eating and scold us but mostly they never caught us. I Miss My School days so bad! p.s- While writing this I have a big smile on my face. Hope you have too while reading. ",
