            "answer_text": "The pros : The most important one is that the hospital and the college are in the same campus. So there is no wastage of time shuttling between the hospital and college.The medical PG coaching centers are at approachable distances from the college. They are mostly at RTC X roads or in Musheerabad.The cons : When compared to Osmania, the patient inflow is little less as Osmania has separate hospitals for most of the departments but there is no dearth of patients in any of the departments of Gandhi and we also get to see lots of types of cases.On the whole Gandhi is most preferred for the 1st reason. This is all what i think. I\u2019 ll surely update the answer once i get more reasons. ",
