            "answer_text": "I will start with an anecdote and then give a more general answer. When my daughter was accepted at a top-10 university, we were invited to an alumni\u2019s home for a meet and greet. This person lived in a freaking mansion\u2014ceilings with images painted on them, tennis court, swimming pool, etc. Multi-million dollar home. We inquired as to what he did, that had generated this wealth. He owned a company that placed lawyers in firms that were looking for lawyers. (a \u201chead-hunting\u201d firm.) So\u2026lawyers do not actually produce anything\u2014they extract wealth from others who produce actual goods and services, and this person then extracted wealth from the lawyers. And he made a fortune doing so. And a lot of the richest people in the country make their wealth in similar ways\u2014not by running companies or creating products or providing end-use services, but by moving money around, betting on the stock of actual companies\u2014not actually accumulating capital and then lending it to be used to grow productive companies, but by pure financial games. In my opinion, these people are the biggest burden on modern society. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say the children . When thousands of Central American kids were being marched up to our boarder , it was no suprise. Their parents are poor and struggling , not stupid . They knew American culture from our films : no ICE agent is gonna mess with them , hell , in our country they are not even allowed to talk to them . I heard a radio host describe being at an NBA game , a child in front of him had a sign that said \u201cHi , Daddy\u201d Interested, he asked the kid which one was his Dad . At that point , Mama bear turned around and cussed him out , \u201cwhat the F@$)@k r you doing speaking to my Mo&$&k$ng kid , fool, who the hell gave u permission to talk to my chall?\u201d Now that we are in a wag the dog era , kids are raised to know that any kind of discipline by adults is illegal , and strangers are not allowed to Interact owith them. They have also been told they can do whatever they want because they are beautiful and amazing , even though they are average . They choose to be U tube stars and actors , and stay away from the building trades in droves . On the academic end , they shun STEM and go for business or something with \u201cstudies \u201c at the end of it . This has caused the biggest mismatch between skill set employers seek and skill set job seekers have in th e history of mankind . Thus , kids need to be supported as children , then grow into adults that can\u2019t add anything to society unless their father is rich and produces a movie and puts them in it , or something they can do rhat is fun and easy. . There are exceptions with some good hardworking kids , but in answering the question in general, there is nothing more of a drain than a dependent kid who is not gonna grow into an independent adult , ",
