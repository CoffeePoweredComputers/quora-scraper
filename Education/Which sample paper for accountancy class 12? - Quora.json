Also, the mind maps in each topic give you an overall idea. This ISC class 12 sample paper has all possible questions from each topic and each chapter as you asked. In addition to that, you will have many assessment test papers to test whatever you have learned so far. Generally, students find it interesting to learn from different modes like videos which are also suggested at the end of each topic in this book. Only when you appear for a lot of these tests, you will come to know which area of the subject you need more attention to.
