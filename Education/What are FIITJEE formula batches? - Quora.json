            "answer_text": "In FIITJEE's Pinnacle program, students are segregate into formula batches and regular batches. (Now, the formula batches might be know by a different name, like FastTrack batches, but the difference is visible. In Formula batches, students are trained so that they may excel at the JEE Advanced and BITSAT, while the regular batches focus more on the JEE Mains and the Board Examinations. Students are chosen for Forumla batches by an exam in the beginning, to test their aptitude and ability. However, even if one is put in a regular batch after the test, some extra hard work will push you to the top of the regular batches and by performing well consistently, one can be promoted to a Formula batch, where both the competition and teaching is of a higher standard. In my branch, we had three Formula15 batches. Although I was not initially placed in one of them, jumping the barrier was not too hard. Once one joins the Formula students, one automatically works harder due to the high level of intellect among his peers. I suggest you work hard in the start, join a Formula batch, and then give yourself a pat on the back. I can assure you this will boost your progress by a lot. Good luck! Thanks Nishant for the A2A ",
