            "answer_text": "I\u2019m delighted that you\u2019re looking at online learning as an option. At a time when everyone\u2019s safety is the first priority, online education can get you an accredited degree from the comfort of your home in an affordable and flexible way. If you\u2019re interested in a BBA or BCA, there are many options, and it can get confusing to decide. I would suggest that you check out Manipal Jaipur. It is the country\u2019s first digital campus, it is UGC-recognised, and it has been awarded the Outstanding Contribution To Digital India Award by the Economics Times. If you enrol in the BBA program, you get key soft skills needed to succeed in the corporate world, hands-on training through projects and industry exposure and there\u2019s even a special module on harnessing an entrepreneurial mindset. In the BCA course, you can be sure of cutting-edge training in the latest computer technology and software, and you can build critical soft skills. There are also modules on web design and development, multimedia and visual programming. You must have heard of Manipal already, and the good news is that the same excellence and attention is present in these online bachelor\u2019s degrees. Do let me know how things work out for you. ",
