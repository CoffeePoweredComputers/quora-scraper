            "answer_text": "Challenges I\u2019ve faced as a teacher. Lack of resources. For instance some schools or institutions don\u2019t provide you with books, worksheets or money tophotocopy the worksheets. Some of them don\u2019t even have a speaker to play listening exercises.Limited class time. Some schools want their students to be bilingual but they just give 3 hours of class per week.Students with special needs. In your teaching path, you\u2019ll find students with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, etc and they are going to be mixed with other students in the same classroom , so you sometimes need to plan special activities for them and help them learn according to their needs, while you help the rest of the group too.Control students\u2019 behaviour. I do this by setting up easy-to-remember rules for my students and I explain to them the consequences of breaking those rules in the class. I have a poster with those rules in my classroom, so they can see it and remember them. Also, I have a system of rewards to encourage them to follow those rules.",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of challenges faced by an ESL teacher. First of all, the increasing use of mobile phones has brought about new challenges; especially with older teenagers and adult learners. Secondly, a lot of schools are run by nefarious businessmen who care little for quality education and are using the TEFL boom to line their pockets. For a good teacher, being stuck in an environment like this is toxic. Additionally, stopping students from using their first language in class is a challenge. Having said that, some nationalities are worse than others for this. Finally, striking a balance between being liked and being respected took me a long time to master. It\u2019s a delicate balance that needs to be consistently worked on in order to be maintained. Overall, however, I would say the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks as becoming a teacher has helped me develop both personally and professionally. Also, the gratitude of one student at the end of a course can warm the soul for months while the disinterest of another student is forgotten in moments. ",
