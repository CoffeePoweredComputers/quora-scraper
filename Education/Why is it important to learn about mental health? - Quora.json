            "answer_text": "Thank you for this question. Here are some important facts that everyone should know about mental health: One in five Americans has experienced some form of mental illness, with one in 25 experiencing serious mental illness, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.Suicide accounts for over 800,000 deaths globally each year, with over 41,000 in the U.S. alone. It is the second leading cause of death worldwide for people belonging to the 15-29 age group.Many people do not seek treatment for mental illness due to the associated stigma. Only 44% of adults with diagnosable mental illnesses receive treatment.All of us face some kind of anxiety or stress in our day-to-day lives. Yet most of us ignore it, thinking that talking about our problems or seeking help will make us an object of ridicule or weaken our public image. This has led to a general decrease in happiness level of the people.We need to understand that it's ok to be not ok. We need to learn to open up about our problems and break all stigmas surrounding mental health. Being a college going student, I too have faced anxiety about surviving the cut-throat competition, about fitting in with my new classmates, felt the fear of missing out, and what not. But what kept me going was my belief in my self. It's important that we understand that everyone is unique:that is the beauty of creation. We do not need to compete for each and everything. It's not necessary to prove ourselves in every field. It's ok to be mediocre at something. Only thing that matters is that we should be content with ourselves. With the recent pandemic condition that has necessitated a continued lockdown, mental health issues have spiked up because people are left alone in their homes with no one to talk to.We are so caught up in our need to prove ourselves as the most productive that we have forgotten the need to give ourselves a much needed break. This is the time when we can connect with ourselves, discover new aspects of our personality or develop new hobbies. If you ever feel the need to talk about mental health issues, dToks provides a useful platform: https://www.facebook.com/groups/dToks/ Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you understand how your own mind works, the cycles of your states of being, then your potential for quality of life expands. \u201cThe unexamined life is not worth living\u201d overstates it a touch, but not much. Let's work here with the phrase \u201cmental health\u201d to mean patterns of behavior and experience generated and perceived by the conscious being associated with a brain and body. This includes healthy and unhealthy experiences. Everything you experience cannot be separated from your physical being. The thought that there is a you thinking is in itself a thought. The quality of your life will depend mostly on the quality of your physical being. Treating your body with healthy choices, diet, exercise, sleep, sanitary practices that reduce pathogens, these behaviors increase the quality of your life. Your consciousness is more than your body. You do exist, with awareness of self and not self. You perceive, experiencing an outer world and an inner world, with thought and emotion. Mental health is about the quality of thought and emotion, and the choices they compel you to make. Your consciousness is a collection of desires, some of which are necessary to continued existence, and therefore you have minimal choice about them. In terms of mental health, we're interested in your ability to choose, to direct your life. When you can guide your thoughts to a beneficial way of thinking, you can respond to the events of your life to your advantage. When you can experience your emotions without being flooded, the richness of life, the enthusiasm for living, fills your being like the breeze fills the sails of a boat. Learning all you can about mental health increases your ability to exercise your ability to choose wisely. ",
