            "answer_text": "Hey, thanks for asking. Now, if you took the admission for M Com fo any other post graduate from IGNOU, they\u2019ll give you 5 years to complete your course without any additional cost. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people taking admission out of excitement or for the sake of degree and struggling later on to complete which is why this maximum time if given so it totally depends if you\u2019r clearing your backlogs of first semester or the last. All they care about if the examination fee and if this 5 years is also not enough then they\u2019ll charge you and will give you additional 2 years depending on the course.
