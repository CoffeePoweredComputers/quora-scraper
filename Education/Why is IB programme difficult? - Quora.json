            "answer_text": "If you compare other high school courses content with IB, I\u2019d say IB is easier to A Levels and AP. But the reason IB is said to be difficult is not because of the content, but due to the work load on students. The IB Diploma curriculum requires you to do internal assessments for each subject you\u2019ve chosen. This means that a student has to make independent research paper for every Natural Science subject, a real life investigation for Natural Sciences, Exhibitions for arts, etc. This take up astounding amount of time. To make it worse, there are mandatory requirements like 150 hours of CAS (Creativity, Activity and Service), and TOK (Theory of Knowledge) presentation and essay. To add on, there\u2019s a 4000 words essay to be written. Furthermore, the exam questions aren\u2019t straightforward. They involve, as Tom Abi Samra has said, heavy critical-thinking and analysis. All of this has to be done by a 15\u201319 year old, within 20 months. Many time, they have to give up on a lot of their interests, which affect them psychologically. Also, the students usually lose their composure by not being able to manage time for all the work. Thus, it becomes really challenging for them to work. I\u2019ll sum everything up with a quote by my professor, Prof. Iyer In IB, you always need to look for the 25th hour ",

            "answer_text": "I answered a similar question here: Rhys McKenna's answer to In what ways is the IB programme difficult? I\u2019ll give you the summarized version. The main reason why the IB program is so difficult is because of the workload. Some could argue the amount of work IB students do far surpasses that of A levels and AP. Another reason why is time management. When doing the IB Diploma, time management is essential to how you manage such a large workload. Not everyone finds this easy to do. This is why IB students may feel overwhelmed at times. The amount of pressure because of the work starts to kick in and it feels as if there\u2019s just too much to handle. IB also has a different way of grading coursework and exams. They basically grade you on how critical you can think as opposed to how well you can remember and emulate facts on to exam papers, which is how other curriculums may do it. That\u2019s the summarized version. The content of IB (in the subjects themselves) isn\u2019t actually difficult at all. It\u2019s just the amount of work that needs to be done that makes IB infamous for being difficult. ",
