            "answer_text": "This is the question every young parent should think about. 1st you should know why you should invest for your child and then comes where & how to invest.  A Child is the most important member of the family and they know how to draw the maximum time, energy & attention of Parents towards them. A Young Parent always thinks the Child is too young & they assume that there is a lot of time left for the Children\u2019s higher education & wedding. But time flies & it does fly very fast. When a child becomes an adolescent, the Parent realizes that though they have built a lot of assets & investments most of those cannot come handy for the higher education, as either those investments are in real estates or locked up in some other commitments. Let us understand through an example:Mr Sippy has a big dream for his child, as he wants his child to study Management from one of the World\u2019s Renowned University and he believes that the cost of the education would be in the range of One Crore+. He could find a lot of instruments to invest, which will provide him with the One Crore fund when his child turns 21 or 22.He decides to invest 5 Lacs for 10 years in a particular deposit scheme so that his investment will be multiplied in the next 10 years\u2019 time. That is the time, he had come to know about an amazing option called Waiver of Premium Payment (WOPP). He realizes that if he takes the investment solution in insurance, even after paying the first premium if anything unfortunate happens to him, the Company would waive off the premiums to be paid for the balance 9 years but the maturity amount of One Crore+ is provided to his child at 21, as planned. In this process, Mr Sippy\u2019s dream for his child is fulfilled, even physically, if he is not there. Yes, there is a novel Waiver of Premium Payment (WOPP) rider, which comes with insurance solutions. By taking the insurance solution with this WOPP rider, if an unforeseen happens to the Proposer any time after the first premium paid, the Company would waive off all balance premiums and make sure to pay the full maturity amount to the Child in the planned maturity date. There is no other instrument offers this benefit, as if we invest in a Fixed Deposit or Post Office, the child will get only the paid premium amount back, as there is no WOPP option in those instruments. Having decided to go for insurance, what are the best plans to go for? Guaranteed Expenses demand Guaranteed Solutions. A Child\u2019s higher education & wedding are guaranteed expenses & it would be better to go for those products, which offers guaranteed returns. If the child is less than 2 years of age, go for the Endowment Plans, where the Child will get a lumpsum return between their 20 & 22 years. But, if the child is above 3 or 4 years, go for the Regular Income Plan, where the yearly regular income starts coming in during a child\u2019s higher education phase. Every parent has a dream for their children but only a few Parents give life to that dream. The dreams of rest of the others fizzle out, as they don\u2019t prioritize investment towards child\u2019s higher education when they are young and rest of the commitments catches up at later years. Young Parents, with little investment of time & energy in planning, they can channelize their earning to right investment solutions so that the Child\u2019s future is more glorious without Parents getting stressed out.

            "answer_text": "Equity mutual fund provides an easy way to create your child's education plan. We all know that education cost is increasing rapidly. If we want to give the best education to our child, we should start planning earlier. The value of education is very high because of so much competition. That\u2019s why our kids do not sustain in the market unless they have a good education. And nowadays, a good education is becoming expensive. Generally, our income increases on a yearly basis around 10%. But, here is the problem. The school fees are increasing at more than 15%-20%. If we continue to spend more money on education, we will not have enough savings for the future.  That\u2019s why child education planning is very important. Not only for metro cities, but a parent from every city should also think about child education planning before the birth of a baby. What We have to Do? Let\u2019s estimate the current education cost is minimum 20 Lac (2018). After 10 years(2028), the expected cost should be 42 Lac as shown in the figure. To achieve this large number, we should start investing from now! How to get this large number? Mainly you have three ways to achieve this number by investing in equity mutual funds. You should invest 14,000Rs monthly or 1,65,278Rs yearly or 12,14,321Rs lumpsum. As per the provided analysis, after 10 years the price of education would be nearly 41.5 Lac (considering 7.5% inflation rate and 13% annualized returns during 10 years of the period). The compounded returns of equity mutual funds will take care of your child education. By doing this, you will not need to worry about the cost of your child\u2019s education. So, if you are planning for a baby, use this method of monthly investing for his/her education plan. If you start planning earlier, the monthly required investing amount will decrease.
