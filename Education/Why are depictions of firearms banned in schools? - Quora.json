            "answer_text": "You know, just a couple weeks ago I had a chemistry project where I had to create a poster detailing a chemical reaction that people see in real life. I could have picked anything, from contact solution to hydrogen peroxide. So, in my infinite wisdom, in a high school in New Jersey, I decided to draw a diagram explaining how a black powder rifle works.  I couldn\u2019t help but notice that when my teacher hung up everybody\u2019s poster on the wall, she hung up the other side of my poster, which had a diagram about an incandescent lightbulb*. But, I didn\u2019t get yelled at, and I think I got a 95% on that project. How is this relevant? Well, I\u2019m living (albeit anecdotal) proof that not every school goes batty all the time when they hear the word \u201cgun\u201d. I think that maybe a lot of these stories seen on the news are ones that, sufficiently taken out of context with a dose of fear added, could in someone\u2019s eyes be threatening to other students. That\u2019s why you get scenarios like the pop-tart gun, already mentioned by Daniel Kaplan. Of course, it\u2019s a poster. The kid previously noted was holding a pop-tart. As mentioned by Alan Shepherd, someone got in deep crap over a bloody lego figure! There is no rhyme or reason to some of these stories, which only become newsworthy because somebody blows it all out of proportion. That right there is the kicker, I think. A pop-tart or a lego aren\u2019t interesting. But you know what is interesting? Getting your school on the headline of a major news outlet because of a bigger issue, such as gun control. \u201cThis school doesn\u2019t allow any guns!\u201d it screams, despite the fact that federal law already designates schools as gun free zones. I honestly can\u2019t help but think that it\u2019s a publicity thing. * I suppose I should clarify: I actually donked the instructions on the project a little, so my teacher had a perfectly valid reason to not hang up the poster along with the others. See Jasmine\u2019s comment for details. ",

            "answer_text": "I completely understand what schools do sometimes. If you bring an airsoft gun to school, you should get expelled. If you bring anything that could reasonably be interpreted as a firearm with intent to harm others or disrupt class, you should be punished. If you bring real guns to school, you should get kicked out for good. It likely spawns from Columbine. In fairness to them, the Columbine shooters did have a high level of interest in firearms and made home videos showcasing their guns and shooting them. In fairness to that argument. But what I don\u2019t understand? Almost punishing a kid for bringing a Lego with a 2 inch minifig rifle. Punishing a girl who accidentally brought a drill rifle to school. Punishing an 8 year old for drawing a picture of a gun in his costume designs. Sometimes, Zero Tolerance makes Zero Sense.  In the end I think schools should look at the intent of students. Let\u2019s look at this example: Homecoming photo of teens holding Airsoft guns stirs controversy in Massachusetts  These kids posed with their airsoft guns, snapped a photo, and captioned it \u201cHomecoming 2014.\u201d Now, I can really see why the school overreacted. Those look like real firearms, prom\u2019s about to begin, and they captioned the photo \u201cHomecoming 2014.\u201d \"It's not the guns, it's the connecting of that type of posture that type of thing to a school event,\" said Richard Gross, the superintendent of the high school. And he says his students' safety is his first priority, so he asked the principal to investigate. The students say she did, along with Taunton Police, as they were boarding a bus for a cross country meet Monday. Taken from the article. Okay, so far so good. But here, I have a problem with what the school did. \"They wouldn't let me say what happened. They just said whatever they wanted and I couldn't say anything back,\" Velez said. Velez and Pereira were handed a ten day suspension, and expulsion was even put on the table. I mean, come on. At least give them an opportunity to defend themselves. Cause if they did, they would learn: The students took a picture, before the homecoming dance, at one of their houses, in their evening attire holding props. The props depicted what they say is their hobby, but the problem for them is their hobby involves airsoft guns. The photo got two high school honor students in Taunton suspended. Tito Velez's dad snapped the photo of his son and his girlfriend, Jamie Pereira, ahead of Friday night's homecoming dance at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School where the two are juniors.After some formal photos, the teens wanted to have some fun. \"We took them with the airsoft guns because it's our hobby and we wanted to include them in the pictures,\" Pereira said. \u201cWe took them [photos] with the airsoft guns because it\u2019s our hobby and we wanted to include them in the pictures.\u201d Clearly these kids need a bit of a lesson in putting their stuff in proper context and being careful what they post but still. Should have they not permitted them to talk, suspended right off the bat and discussed expulsion? I do not think so. Should they have been suspended? Well\u2026 Some may say yes, as a harsh reminder of what is proper and what is not. I would say no, a suspension is not needed but a harsh punishment is needed as a reminder. ",
