See also George Pell, Vatican bank audit report, Pennsylvania grand jury findings \u2014 including the 7 page instructional document for concealing abuse.In fact the above observations and many more are what seems to be driving the obsolescence. Along with revelations of the treatment of child by the Sisters of Mercy in Dunedin, New Zealand, and the Magdalene laundries of Ireland.  Catholics that become aware of these issues, are naturally troubled by them, and often find they can no longer support the institution, the numbers don\u2019t lie, the exodus is such that churches are being sold because attendance is fallen precipitously. The institution is also having difficulty attracting recruits for the priesthood. ",

            "answer_text": "James Short, The thing is the Catholic Church is not becoming obsolete. You\u2019re still asking questions about it. It could have become obsolete when Arian Goths took over the city of Rome. It could have become obsolete when the Frankish empire fell. It could have become obsolete if the Turks took over Vienna. But it didn\u2019t get obsolete. Hey, it could have become obsolete due to the flawed bishops or due to the 16th century movements. But it didn\u2019t get obsolete. The only reason it didn\u2019t get obsolete was and is because the Head of the Church is Jesus Christ and the Church is His Bride, His body. God-Jesus doesn\u2019t get obsolete and neither will the church. ",

Look at all the different fads the world goes through, just in a decade, and this is what happens when the world loses faith in God. This world will end someday, and for you and I it\u2019ll likely end when we die. You have to choose to go with the World, or go with Christ. Which is it? If you go with the World, you\u2019ll likely choose Hell. And people choose to go to Hell. ",

Jesus said to Peter: \u201cAnd so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.\u201d Jesus promised permanent protection for His Church. It has lasted over 2000 years despite the numerous attempts to destroy it. ",

But Islam will become obsolete in grand fasion. All Muslims will perish like one soul and there will only be left atheists. ",
