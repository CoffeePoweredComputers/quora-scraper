            "answer_text": "So, what can you do with a math degree? The answer to this question is as varied as you can get, as mathematical experts are in demand across all kinds of industries, the world over. Study math and you\u2019ll have access to career opportunities in sectors you may never have even considered, including specialized fields such as in law or medicine. That said, a large number of math careers are still based within business or science and technology-related sectors, with math graduates occupying roles such as accountant, actuary, statistician, technician, economist or market researcher. Careers in accountancy and finance A career path spanning many industries, accountancy offers a range of choices for math degree graduates. Accountancy jobs include roles such as auditor, tax accountant, forensic accountant, management accountant and corporate advisor. To become a chartered accountant, in addition to an undergraduate degree in mathematics or a related area, you\u2019ll also need to gain further professional qualifications. Often, however, if you start at a company as a trainee in this field, your employer will help you gain both the experience and the professional certification needed to develop in your role. Careers in banking Opportunities in banking range from the world of retail banking to corporate investment banking. Both arenas deal with financial assessment \u2013 public and private \u2013 with opportunities to specialize in areas such as mergers and acquisitions, bonds and shares, privatization, lending and IPOs (initial public offerings). Duties can include market research, creating new business opportunities, and developing financial models and solutions to present to clients. Math careers in banking can be lucrative, but again, professional qualifications in finance will be needed for some roles. Actuarial careers As an actuary, you will be evaluating financial risk in order to manage and advise clients. Combining risk analysis skills with in-depth knowledge of economics and business, actuaries are at the heart of business strategy, ensuring sound investments are made and commercial/business goals fulfilled. New actuaries will most likely be working within pensions and insurance, a relatively low-risk area, while in the future you may get to work in banking, healthcare or investment. Actuarial roles can be client-facing, as with consultancies and pensions/insurance companies, and all actuaries will require the skill of communicating complex data and analyses to non-specialists. Statistician careers Statisticians are specialists in statistics \u2013 that is, the collation, analysis, interpretation and presentation of statistics and quantitative data. Statisticians\u2019 skills are required in numerous industries, ranging from healthcare to government and from finance to sport. You'll be tasked with managing, collecting and arranging data by means of surveys, experiments and contextual analysis. With your findings, you may then be called upon to create reports and advise clients/colleagues on possible strategies, for example in order to make good financial decisions to further business goals. As a statistician, you'll have expert analytical skills as well as solid communication and IT skills. Careers in academia and research While it\u2019s now clearly understood that careers in math go far beyond the realms of academia and research, these sectors are still very popular among mathematics students. This route may appeal to those who want the challenge of driving forward the next series of discoveries, theories and applications of the field \u2013 as well as the prestige of following some of history\u2019s greatest mathematical minds. Academic and research-based careers in math can be incredibly wide-ranging, and will depend on what area you wish to specialize in. While many are based within university departments, long-term academics are also often involved in publishing, contributing to journals and specialist periodicals, or helping to produce complete publications (while on sabbatical or alongside other commitments).

            "answer_text": "A math degree will get you into any analysis/finance/data-based job you want. Want to work in finance? A math degree will help you pass any test the business will throw at you whether it's the CFA, actuarial exams, or the series 6. Silicon Valley more your style? Not only are they constantly hiring financial analysts, but also data analysts to interpret and optimize literally everything there. Math usually requires you to do some computer science so why not just double major? Then you can work in development as a software engineer. Speaking of engineering, a math degree will get you into literally any graduate degree program your heart desires. Financial engineering, another math degree, computer science, law and even medicine! Long story short, math is probably the king of all degrees alongside statistics, computer science and physics. ",
