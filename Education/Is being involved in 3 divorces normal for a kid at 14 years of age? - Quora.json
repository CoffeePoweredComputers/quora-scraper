            "answer_text": "No. Not even in Western countries, though results vary by ethnicity and economic class. In well over half cases, marriages are stable arrangements, even though the trend is downwards. (One possible explanation for this is longer lives, by the by.)  Figures for second and third marriages get substantively worse, though. If a second marriage occurs, the failure rate increases to over 60%, the third ends in divorce in almost three quarters of all cases. (The High Failure Rate of Second and Third Marriages \u2014 sorry for the pop reference, but it was the quickest one to google.) For a kid of 14 years to have been through three divorces already, the parents relationship probably last somewhere between 4.6 and 7 years on average. This is not a good situation for a child to be in \u2014 and not, by any stretch of the definition a normal experience. Though the child may, of course, perceive their situation as the norm \u2014 which does not bode well for their own future relationships. (Edit: Take my last sentence to mean aggregate outcomes, not individual ones. Poverty alone is a great risk-factor for disease mental and phyiscal already. Add to that the stressors of repeated divorces \u2014 and their reasons \u2014 and you have a very high-risk population.) ",
