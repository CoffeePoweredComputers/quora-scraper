I need this no later than April 10, 2018. Should there be any questions, please contact me by email at yourname@gmail.com or 545/231\u20131234. Thank your for your consideration and help. Sincerely, Your Name If time is critical, consider hand delivery to his office or registered/certified mail. The key point is to clearly identify course number, name, student name, when course was completed. Make it easy for him to dig out the information and send along to you. Adding a date needed by also will spur him to action. ",
