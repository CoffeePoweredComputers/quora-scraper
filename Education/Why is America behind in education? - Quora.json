            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy is America behind in education?\u201d We\u2019re not behind in the quality of what\u2019s being offered in our schools as much as we\u2019re behind in whether or not that education is being used. America has a very large segment of their population that sees no real value in education. In some countries anything less than an \u201cA\u201d is unacceptable and parents will do whatever they have to do to help their children excel in school. In America, in to many homes, as long as you pass into the next grade they don\u2019t care what your grades were. Also, a lot of homes don\u2019t even care if you graduate and a lot of peer pressure from your \u201cfriends\u201d to not succeed in school doom many kids to failure. I think a good portion of the blame lies in the fragmented homes that kids are being raised in. Kids need 2 parents to succeed. A strong father figure and an equally strong mother figure. But in too many homes the father is absent. Some mothers succeed in fulfilling both roles in their children\u2019s lives but most are overwhelmed and can\u2019t \u201cdo it all\u201d. Kids are also much better off when they have an extended family to fall back on. Grandparents, aunts, uncles \u2026 they all contribute to the raising of children. In America families are spread out from coast to coast and hardly ever see each other, except maybe at reunions, and those are few and far between. Another factor mentioned by others is the lack of control in local schools. The US Department of Education has attempted to create a one-size-fits-all education system and they\u2019ve failed miserably. The control of local schools has got to be returned to the parents whose children attend those schools. Until that happens America will continue to fall behind in education and instead of rating in the middle of all countries where education is concerned, we\u2019ll find ourselves in last place. ",

            "answer_text": "Public education in the USA a typical government f***-up. It is a top-down, government operated socialist monopoly. Children are assigned to a school, based on their zip code. Wealthy areas have good schools. Economically-depressed areas have crap. The teacher\u2019s unions and the politicians have the schools by the short hairs. We no longer have one telecommunications firm. We broke up AT&T, and brought in competition. Service improved and costs declined. We used to have three television networks. Now we have hundreds of channels. Part of the solution, is to bring in school choice. Give families a voucher, equivalent to what would have been spent in the public school. And let them select a quality non-public school. Competition has improved nearly every other enterprise. Competition will surely improve K-12 education in our nation. see Diane Ravitch's blog ",
