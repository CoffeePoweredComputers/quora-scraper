            "answer_text": "Not usually. However, it depends on the school you want to transfer to. Some more elite schools may not even consider accepting you if you attended a community college, but many in-state schools have articulated agreements that require them to accept students with transfer degrees (2-year degree completed at a community college.) Even then, there is a minimum GPA to transfer; from that baseline, some schools are requiring higher GPAs to compete with their alloted number of transfer students. Straight A\u2019s may not be needed, but a strong GPA may be. ",

            "answer_text": "No. When I was at UCLA, I had a few friends that transferred with around 3.4\u20133.6 GPAs. In fact, transfers often have an easier time getting admitted to schools than freshman applicants, especially transfers from California community colleges to UCs (and all of the UCs except UCB and UCLA have transfer admission guarantees for students with >3.5 GPAs).

            "answer_text": "To my knowledge, this isn\u2019t true anywhere except for possibly the uber elite colleges. Most universities will accept transfer credits if the grade is a C or better. Admissions will usually require at least a minimum 2.0 (C), with some tougher universities or programs within universities requiring higher GPAs (usually no more than a 3.0 minimum at the high end).
