            "answer_text": "Moms try to make good decisions for their children. She may realize you do not have the focus and self discipline yet to handle your own education. She may realize you need socialization with other kids and adults and you will benefit from extracurriculars. She may realize you are not an independent learner with great study skills. She may not be able to provide you with proper supervision if she works. Your state might require her to pay for your online school and she doesn\u2019t have the money. Think about why you want to do online school. Is it to escape something unpleasant in your current school. Do you think online will be easier? It isn\u2019t. Talk with your Mom. Find a quiet time. Tell her you want to talk about a concern. Tell her how you feel and what you think will be good about online school. Be polite. Let her talk. Listen to her reasons. If she doesn\u2019t agree to what you want, then accept it with maturity and grace. You can do a great deal of free online learning anyway. Maybe if she sees you using online resources well, she will eventually let you try it. ",
