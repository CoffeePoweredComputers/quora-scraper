            "answer_text": "Greetings, Please understand that everyone associated with education these days are struggling with the inadequacies of on-line classes. This is your opportunity to master the valuable skill of effective time management. While your academic obligations seem to be tedious, irrelevant, and never-ending, in reality your required school work should take no more than three hours per day. Please consider creating a schedule for yourself that allows ample time for rest, proper nutrition, school-related work, and dedicated periods for recreation and goofing off. With a sensible routine to follow, you will not lose your motivation, your mom will get off your back, you can spend time with your friends, and your grades will skyrocket. For those who remain healthy, COVID-19 is an inconvenience, but it also presents us all with a rare set of circumstances in which to learn valuable skills that will allow us to adapt and succeed in the face of unexpected obstacles. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",

            "answer_text": "Change the schedule of topics you work on. Do what you don\u2019t like first. Make a list every day and draw a line thru what you have finished. Keep the lists and look at them every few days and pat yourself on the back for a job well done. Contact a class mate and challenge each other, if you like challenges. Talk to your Mom about some way you can reward yourself for your continued dedication. She should understand the value of reward for achievement, it is not all self gratification. Maybe some shared time with her to review your accomplishments would be motivational, a discussion of how what you have learned can be applied to your everyday life. She might be very impressed with you, and learn reward is more motivational than punishment. ",
