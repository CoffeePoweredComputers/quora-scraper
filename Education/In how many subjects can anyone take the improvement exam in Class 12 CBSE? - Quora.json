            "answer_text": "CBSE improvement exams are a way to retain your lost hopes in life xD , I swear to god . For anyone who has messed up their board exams but is hell bent on a course he desires Eg - Me , I am a freaking huge defense fan and an aviation enthusiast , the only thing I leterally think about is planes and such , so obviously Aeronautical / Aerospace engineering was my dream . I always kept searching for the best colleges in India for this course . Now comes the twist , all the engineering institutes required a minimum of 60 mks aggregate in PCM , 6 months ago , I was like ( haha 60% is nothing for me ) but sadly I was very bad at math , yet never lost hope in it solved 30\u201340 questions per topic , and so many topics per day , yet I failed to do well in a simple test . Then came the board exams , I screwed my Math exam , ( ik this time the paper was easy , but I just didn't happen ) so I came home , thought about what's gonna happen next in my life . Quickly calucated my % I KID YOU NOT IT WAS 65\u201370%. In total , I was shocked . For someone who has dreamt their entire life about the dream course , such a thing is the worsr news ever . But CBSE IMPROVEMENT EXAMS is a very motivating concept for those who haven't lost the hope in what and where they want to be in life , it offers to chance to rebuild your presonality , gain back parent's trusts and yourself being added back into the not do weird society again . You can appear for Improvement exams in all 5 subjects WITH MINIMUM 1 SUBJECT . CONCLUSION Minimum subjects - 1 Max - All Conditions - you must pass in all 5 subjects the first time you give your board exams , or pass in the compartment exams . Only then will you be eligible for Improvement exams next year . ",
