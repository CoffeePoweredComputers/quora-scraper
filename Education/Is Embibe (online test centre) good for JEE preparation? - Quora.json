            "answer_text": "Myself subham sahoo aipmt air-140. Though i am not a jee student but on coming across this question regarding embibe i would like to recommend embibe for online preparation. I had subscribed for the one year pack on embibe n the service provided is worth it. The question bank is enormous and the NOTES are quite efficient when u want quick revision or the FINAL REVISION and the best of the lot are the tests, i can assure u that embibe gives the mostly scientific and complete analysis you can ever imagine. The most important factor in aipmt i feel is time, n embibe is conscious about it too. You not only have to get it right but also get it in right time. SPEED AND ACCURACY is the mantra. The weak area analysis helps you to recognise the chapters which need urgent care. The indicator of the marks for getting good college is a constant motivator.  Finally embibe team is quite vibrant in guiding and this i really mean it bcoz i have not picked up their calls several times as they are there even before you need. Sorry team embibe!! ",
