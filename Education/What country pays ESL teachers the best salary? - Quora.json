            "answer_text": "Everything depends on qualifications and what you are looking for in a position. I am an American and I\u2019ll be answering from that perspective. I have not really considered European positions because they seem to prefer the British system. China has some of the best salaries around\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t want to teach at a university level. There qualified university positions are horrendously underpaid. If you compare qualification \u201capples to apples\u201d at every other level though, China currently pays the highest.  Vietnam seems to pay their university employees very well, but not nearly as well for the entry level positions. Korea has mostly even wages and benefits, but those wages have been stagnate for the last 20 years while taxes and general cost of living have sky rocketed. The qualification process for working at a university has also gotten out of hand. They have created a catch-22 where the only way for a person to be legally hired at a university is for that person to already have 2 years of experience working at a KOREAN university. This is ultimately unsustainable, but there is still a chance if you have a lot of luck (and a close friend involved with hiring). Saudi Arabia and the UAE still have high salaries, but it seems to be very difficult to break into that market without a large amount of qualifications and experience right now. Anyone is free to agree or disagree with me on these opinions. I am sure that there are unicorn jobs in every market listed above. I have been living and working in Korea for the last 7 years and I am moving to China in August. I settled on my school after spending a full year of researching and reviewing the common job sites.

            "answer_text": "Typically UAE is known to be on the top amongst the most ESL paying countries, other middle eastern countries are also on top of that list. One thing to keep in mind, and what I have learnt from when I taught abroad, is that you also need to account for cost of living and other activities. Some salaries, at a glance might seem less than other countries and regions, but at the end of the month you might end up with the same amount of savings, when you've spent on food, other necessities and entertainment. You can find a a detailed comparison on what you can expect in terms of salary vs. cost of living from this teach abroad guide. You will find that European countries tend to offer less in salaries. Asian countries vary, and with low cost of living, some can even be at par with middle eastern countries. I taught in Spain, and although the salary wasn\u2019t that great, the experience was priceless! At the end of the day, it depends what you are looking for, and I hope you\u2019ll find something that fits within your teach abroad aspirations. One final pro tip : do make sure that you are qualified before you start your job applications and save yourself some time! ",
