            "answer_text": "The short answer is yes! Yes, there is hope for you. Please don't give up. Thanks for the Ask to Answer, and thank you for adding details. So, now for the long answer. Let's look at what you've said, one by one:  I am 22 years old college student, living with parents. I dont have any friends, no one ever called me to outside before. I had a girlfriend in high school and no girls looking at me for six years I guess. (Last years there was a girl but it was just for sex, online dating)I am bald thanks to my genetics.  Lots of 22 year olds live at home with their parents. No shame in that when you're in school and working hard to get your life together.  No girls looking at you for six years? Are you sure? Have you asked every single one of them? Don't answer that you have because that's not possible--you'd have to devote 24 hours a day to asking women if they'd looked at you and that would just be a waste of your time. You tell me you're bald. So? A lot of bald, young men are actually quite good-looking. Shave off what's left and give yourself a smooth, nice look. Feels great under the hands.  If being bald is one thing that's shaking your confidence, try not to let it. I love bald guys, personally, and I know I'm not alone! (I'm married but that doesn't mean I don't like to look. There are single women who share my opinion.)  Actually i've gone some courses such as dance and language, tried to go student clubs etc. But it seems like i am such a disabled person, no one wants to \"hang out\" with me. Good job! I think it's great to put yourself out there and take risks. That's a positive in your corner. The problem might be that you're seeing yourself as \"disabled\" and focusing on what's negative rather than what's positive about you. Name three things that are great about you (you don't have to do it here, just make sure you do it). Focus on those three things that you do well, or think might be cool about you. Focusing on your flaws only drags you down further. If those flaws are out of your control, turn them into something positive. For example, I have a prominent nose. I could be all down on myself and negative about it, but why should I? It balances out the rest of my face and keeps my eyes from looking like they're too close together. If you can do something about a perceived flaw, give it a try. Find ways to improve yourself. You can do this. You're only 22 and you've got a long and possibly awesome life ahead of you if you keep pushing on.  This situation come to an obsession, when i go outside just for walking and see people laughing with their friends at cafes, i go crazy. At first, i blame others. \"They are not mature like me\" etc. But after seeing \"while EVERYONE doing and I CANT\", so i started to hate myself.  Hmm. This sounds like you're isolating and amplifying. When you see these people having fun, you feel alone. This causes you to react by isolating yourself even further. You're saying \"I can't be like them.\" But yes, yes you can. It might take some psychological homework, but it's not insurmountable. I know because I used to do this myself. I would see people having fun together and would feel lonely. Broken off from the crowd. I was \"too weird\" or \"too loud,\" or whatever negative label I chose to put on myself. One day, during my own therapy, I got tired of it. Eventually, I said \"fuck it,\" and just started talking to people about my interests, fun things I liked, and waited to see what would happen (at the behest of my therapist at the time). You know what? People started to respond. Some liked the things I did, and some didn't. And that was okay. I made friends when I stopped trying to be like others and started just being myself. Of course, sometimes that takes time to discover. Try treating it like an adventure instead of a chore. You CAN. It's just a challenge.  i hate my life totally. i hate myself actually. please dont say, \"oohh come on, i am sure someone for outside you\". If i ask people lets go someplace and no one cares, if people live their life when i just watching, fuck this life. If i will be like this when i graduate, when i get \"well paid\" work, fuck that money. You know what? I don't know what you'll experience next. Neither do you. There is no crystal ball that will tell you you'll make friends and millions of dollars, crores, yen, or rubles. But I can tell you this: it's worth exploring as long as possible. Because we just don't know what will come next. It can be great and glorious, and it can be dreadful, but it won't be boring. If you like science, treat it like an experiment. Find as many ways to fail as fast as you can until you succeed, because eventually, the odds will fall in your favor, especially if you look for what's positive about things. Do yourself a huge favor, though, and stop fortunetelling. Stop predicting your future as bleak, because it'll affect the way you look at the good things that come your way.  Tomorrow morning i will go to pshyicologist in university center, this is my last shot. i give myself one year may be if nothing happens again i will kill myself. though before but could not do it. I'm really proud of you for seeking help with a professional. It takes a lot of guts to seek help. It would seem completely senseless to me that you would kill yourself at 22 with so much promise. I really hope that you will seek help whenever you feel unsafe and in danger of committing suicide. Please don't. Please wait and see what's around the corner. If you cry off now, you'll never know the cool people that will come into your life. I know they're there, and I think that part of you knows it, too. Because you're bright. Bright enough to ask for help, and bright enough to reason and think that maybe there is hope. There is. You just have to keep looking. Stay curious. Fight on. I don't offer these as platitudes, I offer them as a person who has made it to almost 40 years now, and I've made friends, am happily married, and I know that life just sucks sometimes. But I also know it's worth pushing through, and holding off on giving the Reaper his prize for as long as possible. It gets better, if you let it. I wish you the best of luck.

            "answer_text": "Yes.  There is lots of hope.  You haven't begun to tap the resources that are available.  It's good that you are seeing a psychologist.  You should also go see a psychiatrist.  It takes forever to get an appointment with one these days, but do it.  Because you need drugs.   Yeah.  You do.  Some people have a problem with psych drugs but those people aren't you and those people don't want to kill themselves so those people are not invited to weigh in on this issue. Drugs are important for two reasons.  One, they might really help.  And two, and I cannot stress how important this is, they are a daily reminder that you are not just a glum chum, you are sick, you have a condition, and you cannot and will never think your way out of it.  You need help, medical help.  For many people, taking medication is the first time they really admit to themselves that they have a problem, a real problem that needs real help -- not just platitudes and pep talks. Next, read \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\".  It's a classic for a reason.  Here is what I consider the most important sentence in the book:  \"You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.\" Note, the world outside of college is way better than the one inside -- despite what you may have heard.  Yeah, in college everyone made their friendships freshman year; by junior year, no one is looking to make a new friend.  That's just a thing about college.  But don't sweat that -- college is short, life if long. Here is a hard truth: no one wants to date a bummer who hates life.  Women want to share their lives with a man who lives passionately, who is full of love -- for her and for life.  You're probably not that guy.  So you can't be surprised that you don't get a lot of attention from the ladies.    What to do about it?  First, are you working out regularly?  Are you in great shape?  You should be.  You see, that is one thing that is totally in your control.  Get to the gym, take up a sport.  It wouldn't hurt if that sport was traditionally coed.  Tennis perhaps.  I can almost guarantee that if you start working with a psychiatrist and get really good (for an amateur) at tennis, those two things alone would turn how you feel about your life completely around.   Bald?  Cultivate a style that includes a lot of cool hats.  No, for real.  That's what you should do.  Get in to hats.  You have got to stop worrying about other people.  What they are doing, where they are going, how they feel, what they think -- THEY ARE NOT YOUR PROBLEM.  THEY ARE NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.  You have got to stick to your own life and your own problems.   I think that everyone should read Emerson's \"Self-Reliance\" at least once a month.  You should probably read it once a week for a while.  Here is a passage that I want you to consider especially:  \"Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it. We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. \"To the persevering mortal,\" said Zoroaster, \"the blessed Immortals are swift.\"  Lastly, as soon as you are able, get your own place.  Living with your mom is emasculating after the age of 23.  There's no way around it.  When you can afford it, buy a house.  There is tremendous life-giving dignity in owning your own home.  Good luck my friend, there is lots of hope, just tons and tons of hope. Now get to work. ",
