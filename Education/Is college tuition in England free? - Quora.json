            "answer_text": "\"College\" as meaning University used to be free for British students. Eg. It was free when I was an undergraduate in the 1980s. Fees were \u00a3300 per annum paid in full by the government. In fact the government paid us to attend university back then. However only 10% of school leavers went to university in those days. However everything changed in the 1990s and 2000s. British students now have to borrow money from the government to pay for their tuition fees ( currently  \u00a39000 per annum ). Once they graduate and are earning more than \u00a321000 per annum they have to start repaying the loan. It's repaid as a monthly deduction from their salary. The amount repayable is linked to their salary. Anything left to repay by the time they are about 55 years old is written off by the government.  If they are unfortunate enough to be stuck in low paying jobs for the whole of their working life never earning more than \u00a321000 per annum, they don't have to repay a penny, the whole debt is written off by the government when they are in their 50s. Students can if they want to opt to pay the tuition fee up front when they are at university. Financially better off students often take up that option. ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly no, but it is heavily subsidised and as a result a student\u2019s annual fee is capped at \u00a39,000 (just over $13,000 at current exchange rates). Furthermore You only start repaying your loan once you've graduated and you're earning more than \u00a321k a year. After that, you'll pay back 9% of anything you earn over \u00a321k. So if you're earning \u00a326k a year, you'll lose \u00a3450 in loan repayments - \u00a337.50 each month. So if you graduate and never make more than \u00a321k p.a, you get tuition for free. As an international student (as you would be if you hypothetically decided to come and study over here), then you could be expecting to pay anything from $17,000 per year to around $51,000, depending on the course type, course level and university among other factors.
