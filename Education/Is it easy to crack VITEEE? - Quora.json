            "answer_text": "If you are well prepared for JEE Mains then VITEEE is easy for you. If not ,then VITEEE might get a bit tricky for you. See the thing is in VITEEE, there is no negative marking so everyone attempts all the questions (even if they are not sure about their answer). LUCK might favour a few and they might get a better rank than you. Secondly ,VITEEE is conducted on different days and 3 different slots per day ie different batches. It is all about relative marking. (eg : A person getting 80 in a batch where 60 is the average will get a better rank than one who scores 80 in a batch whose average is 90). These things aren't in your hand\u2026.the only thing you can do is give your best in the paper. Remember : Speed + Accuracy is the key here Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Can't say that it is easy but yes it is easier than many other enterance exams like JEE and BITSAT. Though it is totally on how much you know.I can't judge an exam for someone else because if I do so, I will be judging it on the basis of my extent of knowledge which may not be same as the other person. But VITEEE has certain points that makes it a quite easy one There is no negative marking.The paper has 5 questions from English.The questions of Chemistry are very easy.Maths and Physics questions are more of direct type.It is relative marking examination.Moreover it has so many slots that makes it easy for candidates to ask their friends the difficulty levels of each section. Hope this helped. ",
