            "answer_text": "I see you as a beautiful young woman already! Far too young to be considering cosmetic surgery. One truism about cosmetic surgery is if you rely on it for your \u2018look\u2019 10 years is the max before it needs to be done again. Save it for when you\u2019re an old woman like me. Ok, your face is a bit plumped up but it may not need cosmetic surgery! I can\u2019t tell if you are a little over weight from your face picture but would encourage you to try less invasive (and expensive) options first. If you are a bit overweight maybe a healthy diet combined with Pilates or Zumba classes for toning would make the physical changes you want. I\u2019m pretty slender but I have chubby cheeks, wrinkles and the start of \u2018turtle neck\u2019. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Frankly cosmetic surgery is outside my financial range. But I adhere to a vegetarian/ Mediterranean diet that keeps my weight low. I suggest you try 6 months of diet and exercise before you start to save for cosmetic surgery. ",
