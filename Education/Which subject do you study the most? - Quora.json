            "answer_text": "I used to study all the subjects.. whether it interests or not, because I had to clear the exams. In my early school I used to study social studies n English the most. These two subjects interested me the most. I was and am fond of reading.. so liked studying English as it had a lots of stories in it. I never got a chance to pursue higher education in English..had to take up commerce.. as for studying English I had to take u arts as my stream if education.. as we still live in a society where arts is taken up by students who are weak academically.. I used to love me social studies a lot as was very much interested in history and civcs.. I used to read my history books as if reading a novel or story book.. Even while pursuing my chartered accountancy course I used to enjoy studying law.. OMG.. writing this has taken me back to my golden days of childhood. Looking back to those days brings many memories back.. it rightly proves that nobody has a control over time.. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to like Yoda sound, think I? I study life. Since I heard of the Savior, \u201cI came that they might have life, and more abundantly\u201d, and thus that life is not a thing of existing and breathing air and eating, but of something greater, something that is eternal, I have always viewed human interactions, and today even the study of the \u201cline\u201d between living and non-living, and of energy itself, with the above viewpoint in mind. When I study music, I have an interest not only in form and tone, but of the life of the composer; and in studying form and tone there is a way to make the music live, if you will, and a way to just play it mechanically. Curiously, I now write at the computer, and it reproduces my ideas the same way every time, and each not identically, in perfect time, with no subtlety of rhythm. Yet I can find a passage dull, and tweak a couple of notes, and suddenly it springs into life! I especially like to study history, read classic books and biographies, and humor, both in cartoon and print. I learn easily as much about the human race from Scott Adams (Dilbert) and Watterson (Calvin & Hobbes) and Dave Barry and James Thurber as I have from history books. ",
