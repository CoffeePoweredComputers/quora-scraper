So 20% students failed in both the subjects! Please Note:- ~ means not/inverse here and u means union! For more clarity here is the venn diagram representation of Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion and de Morgan\u2019s law:-   All the best! I hope you understood well! Keep upvoting and sharing! ",
