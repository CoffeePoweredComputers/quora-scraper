            "answer_text": "The opportunities are ever increasing for students who have completed their BASLP, and further. Being a BASLP student myself, I can guarantee you that the field has so much more to explore than most people speak of it. When you get into it, you realise there is more depth to the subject and there's always so much you can do to improve. In terms of job opportunities, people have diverse settings to choose from; they can work in hospitals, schools, or public/ private setups and the profession is quite demanding nowadays.. A fresh graduate can expect a salary of about 40\u201350k in the field, but this is dependent on few factors. A MASLP student can expect around 20\u201330k as starting salary if they work in government setups, and this may go up to 40\u201350k if they work in private setups. Moreover, In a country like India, it does matter where you finish your undergraduate program from. So from this point of view, studying in a reputed college like AIISH (All India Institue of Speech and Hearing, Mysore) has its own advantages. And plus, you can also choose to work on an independent research project with grants from the government so if you're interested in research alone, you can have endless opportunities in that stream. Good luck! ",

But on the plus side, you get to work in different areas and find out what your area of interest is before going for post grad studies and you gain more experience which helps you during that time.
