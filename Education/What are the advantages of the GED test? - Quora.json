            "answer_text": "Compared to a high school diploma? There isn\u2019t really any. People think you weren\u2019t smart enough/aren\u2019t smart enough to pass plain old high school and the more educated they are, the dumber they think you are. Compared to not having a high school diploma? A GED has an advantage because it says you were smart enough to recognize you should have completed high school. It means, if you apply for a job and the other applicants don\u2019t have a diploma or GED, you have a better chance. And most community colleges will let you start classes with a GED which can get you an Associate\u2019s which will mean you will have an advantage applying for jobs against people without GED\u2019s, people with GED\u2019s and people with high school diplomas. To sum up: The only time a GED is an advantage is if you\u2019re young and applying for jobs where no one else has a high school diploma or GED or you have no diploma and you\u2019re going to go to community college to get a degree. Even the military won\u2019t take someone with a GED unless they also are above average intelligence AND complete a semester or so of college classes. So, please stay in school if you can. Otherwise, get a GED and go to community college. ",
