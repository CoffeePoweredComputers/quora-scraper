            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll admit I have not actually started working as a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer (DMS) yet, but there\u2019s a lot I\u2019ve learned and taught myself. I\u2019ll assume you already know what DMS is. It\u2019s a good fit for you if\u2026 You like or don\u2019t mind interacting with people. Contrary to other diagnostic-type jobs where they might just tell you to sit somewhere, take pictures, and you\u2019re out, being a DMS might require more interpersonal skills.You like or don\u2019t mind moving and being on your feet a lot. Though it depends on the size of the rooms in the facility you work at, you might be on your feet a lot.You have (or can develop) good attention to detail. When you\u2019re looking at black, white, and gray images, everything can look the same to the untrained eye.You don\u2019t mind fast paced jobs (which it can be).It helps if you don\u2019t mind or enjoy learning new things. I think this can go for anything in the medical field too, but for DMS specifically you\u2019re likely to encounter new things. Here\u2019s some general pros I can think of: Great pay. It\u2019s more or less depending on where you live, your education, experience, and what you\u2019re specialized in. More education and experience = higher pay.\u201cMonster Jobs named Diagnostic Medical Sonography as the second best paying job you can get with an associates degree, and U.S. News ranked it #5 in the best healthcare support jobs. The median salary for Sonographers was $69,650. The top 10% earned $99,100 and the bottom 10% earned $48,660, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (May 2016).\u201d - from Ultrasound Technician SalaryJob outlook is great so far.\u201cThe projected percent change in employment from 2016 to 2026. The average growth rate for all occupations is 7 percent.\u201d Job outlook for DMS is 17%, 10% higher than average. Diagnostic Medical Sonographers and Cardiovascular Technologists and Technicians, Including Vascular TechnologistsCompared to other parts of the medical industry, DMS is relatively new. So, there are new improvements coming out, making it more accurate and precise as technology improves. For instance, other than regular 2D imaging, there\u2019s also 3D imaging.All of the DMS I\u2019ve talked to love their jobs, especially those who have specialized in OB/GYN. They love getting to tell new expecting parents about their soon-to-be-born children.\u201cThe sonography field is experiencing an amazing amount of growth at the current time. It is in part due to the fact that a large majority of people prefers to be treated with sonography rather than experience invasive surgery or a high dose of medications. Another growth factor is the clear increase of the elderly population. The sonography field is set to remain a booming industry for many years to come which inevitably provides a sense of security and stability to the lives of those who choose to work as ultrasound technicians.\u201d Ultrasound Technician and Sonography career: Pros, Cons and Salaries\u201cDoctors employ ultrasound technology quite often as there are very rarely any side effects and it is relatively inexpensive compared to other methods of examination that could be used.\u201d\u201cPatients prefer ultrasound technology as it is non invasive and painless.\u201dIt\u2019s cheaper to perform ultrasounds, so it tends to be insurance companies\u2019 go-to for diagnostics.It can be more accurate than some other imaging techniques. I say \u201ccan\u201d because it depends on the Sonographer using the tools.For example: One DMS I shadowed found the tiniest fracture on a patient\u2019s patella (using smaller movements) when the x-rays missed it. Potential cons: Some DMS (from long term work) experience wrist injuries due to physical duties, though this can be helped with regular stretching. Other work-related injuries might include any that result from standing for long periods of time.\u201cMajor employers of sonographers are open for extended hours at a time or even continually in certain situations. Therefore, working on evenings and weekends is unfortunately extremely common and to be expected.\u201d Though this goes for most in the medical field.If you\u2019re not very interested in science and don\u2019t like learning new things, you might not enjoy working as one. Although it pays good and has great job projections, it\u2019s not just easy work for a lot of money. If you have an aversion to working, this is not for you.The common cons that come with working in the medical field, such as potential law suits, negligence cases, etc. It\u2019s beneficial to know some health care law because imaging professionals can be affected too.If you can\u2019t handle stress and a fast-paced work environment and/or you wouldn\u2019t have the ability or patience to handle agitated patients, DMS (or any other position in the medical field) may not be for you.",
