            "answer_text": "I almost flunked out of high school, and started community college on probation, but eventually earned my degree in Accounting at CSU Hayward when it was a small school with about 3,000 students. It\u2019s now much larger with about 14,000 students, but felt I really got a good education. I started as a Field Auditor for Florsheim Shoe Company, and after 3.5 years was promoted to Audit Manager with a hefty salary increase, but we had to move to Chicago from California. After 3 years, we missed family, friends and the climate, so we moved back to California. It turned out fine, because I was controller for a couple of small companies, then started doing small business consulting. That\u2019s where I enjoyed my work the most, and earned good money. I was able to travel the world, and retired early. Don\u2019t let the 1.7 GPA discourage you, but you need to really put in the time to study more than you ever did in your life. It\u2019ll all be worth it; trust me. BTW, start with community college to increase your skills in English composition and math. You\u2019ll need at least College Algebra. In Business, I had to take a course in Statistics. Never had to use it in any of my jobs. Also, I learned that Accounting majors put more time into their studies, and that helps with other courses that you take. Good luck. Believe me, luck has much to do with one\u2019s success. Being at the right place at the right time always helps. I was one good example of that. When I majored in Accounting, I had four job offers before I even graduated. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true any more. The following article is encouraging. Give it a read. What is the Job Outlook for Accounting Graduates? - Top Accounting Degrees ",

            "answer_text": "I personally do not know of any colleges that accept a 1.7 GPA and I was under the impression that must public schools require at least a 2.0 GPA to graduate. The transition from high school to college is extremely challenging, especially the first two semesters. Looking back at my college career, I did nothing but study the first several years. Actually all four years. If you are determined to go to college, I would start by taking either a course online to see how it goes, then ease into taking 1 or 2 courses at a local community college. If you succeed at those then consider going full time. College isn\u2019t for anyone and that\u2019s not meant to be a negative comment. There are plenty of people that have gone straight to the work force and done incredible things with their life. Another option could be to consider learning a trade. There\u2019s a lot less schooling involved and you can enter the work force very quickly. Moreover, I would highly recommend that you do some soul searching to figure out what you want to do with your life. Make decisions for yourself, not anyone else. It\u2019s so much more important to be happy in life than to follow someone else\u2019s dreams. I personally am grateful that I was \u2018pushed\u2019 to go to college and guided to work at a good company but not because I enjoyed what I was doing but because it afforded me an opportunity to do what I\u2019m doing with my life now. Anyway my point is that you have your whole life ahead of you and it\u2019s a lot easier to figure out when you\u2019re younger what really drives you (e.g. passions in life). You have an opportunity to do that now. I wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question prompts me to think of my introduction speech that I have to my classes at the community college. I stated I have no problem in giving everybody As, I also have no problem giving everybody Fs; however, if I am giving everybody Fs, then there is something wrong with me as an instructor. A 1.7 GPA is composed of results from several classes, and is a warning indicator. At this point I suggest that one does honest introspection - is it partially because you are not getting enough to eat, is your home life distracting you from academics, are you trying to do too many extracurricular activities, are you partying too much, do you have undiagnosed learning disabilities, etc.? I definitely suggest the community college route because they have programs for at-risk students & testing for learning disabilities. A four year college is too ambitious given you have had some academic troubles already. ",

            "answer_text": "You should probably reconsider your desire to go to college. College is like High School but on steroids. Everything that made high school difficult will still exist in college but at a more challenging level. The exception is your home life. If you had abusive parents, were homeless, etc., perhaps you could do better living on your own or perhaps in a dorm. But if you struggled because the material was too difficult, or you were lazy and lacked self-discipline, run away from college and go to a trade school or apprenticeship. Don\u2019t go to college because you believe you\u2019re supposed to. Go because you are trying to make more money when you graduate. Pick a degree that will allow you to make more money. College is the second largest investment most of us will make in our entire lives, and we\u2019re only 18 when we do it. Picking a worthless degree (history, gender studies, literature, sociology, etc.) or a degree that is too challenging for you to complete will set you back at least a decade. ",

Are you sure you want to take 50+ more courses in four years? College is not for everyone. In fact, most people do not have a college degree and the world keeps spinning. Speaking as a three-time college dropout who took \u2014 ahem \u2014 the scenic route to get an AA, BS, MA and PhD, you can do it if you want it, but you gotta want it badly enough to take a bunch of courses that will not even count toward your degree. These will prepare you to be at the place everyone already started with. Community colleges are perfect for this. ",

You should consider career and technical education (CTE, aka vo-tech) programs alongside AAS programs and transfer programs. Realize that you can spend a lot of time and money at community college, burn through one-time, limited financial aid (e.g., Pell grants), and rack up debt, all without moving toward the finish line. You are (presumably) graduating high school because the system causes that to happen. There is no equivalent \u201cup and out\u201d in any community college program; at best, you can get thrown out before wasting more money and time, but even that\u2019s getting harder. I would start with one course. Freshman composition, probably. If you have a lot of energy, add in whatever mathematics course you place into. If you can\u2019t maintain a 2.0 GPA, just stop. Rethink. ",

You don\u2019t provide information about why your GPA from high school is so low. I would give some serious thought and self-reflection about that and speak with the high school guidance counselor about it. If you spent your time socializing or on other distractions from school and didn\u2019t apply yourself, then you will need to develop better habits to succeed even at community college. If the academic rigors were too much for you, you might discuss other alternatives to college such as technical or other occupational type schools with your guidance counselor. If you were in special education, speak with your counselor about the special programs and accomodations that may be available at your community college. ",

            "answer_text": "My first thought is to ask whether you\u2019re going to receive your high school diploma at all with that low an average. I would have thought that you\u2019d need at least a 2.0 to get your diploma. Without that, you would, perhaps, only receive a certificate of attendance. I\u2019d suggest you take some time off in the workplace to discover whether you learn that you would really like to get some further schooling. Next, you should seriously consider an area of education satisfied by a two year degree from a community college with an option to continue further after several more years in the workplace. Since community colleges offer a number of programs keyed to health sciences and the trades, you should be able to find an area of study with which you can succeed at a higher level, while discovering something you\u2019d really like to pursue. Always remember that our system of education, unlike any other in the world, permits you to re-enter school at any time or age to pursue further study or to change professions and prepare for greater challenges. Your low grade point average in high school indicates, at least, a lack of motivation and maturity to pursue serious study. You must address this problem within yourself before you start seeking to reach any further academic heights. This doesn\u2019t mean that you lack to potential, but you have yet to show anyone you can achieve academically. That means you have some work ahead of you. ",
