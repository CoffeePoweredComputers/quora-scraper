            "answer_text": "The current trend seems to be to involve machines in some aspect of design. This is more than the synthetic form of sanity from combining methods and mediums of various approaches. The notion was that the mind could be thrown anywhere on the planet and absorb that culture's ways so additional domains should be no problem. That also means the mechanics of  the math where someone can compute a concept that would not have occurred to them otherwise. It is like what the idealists used to think about nature as informing their style since that is where the tension originated. Now they are up against artifacts of an nth-order derivative variety which are complex enough to be non-intuitive so evolution is not necessarily an immediate advantage. The species that is going to thrive there has yet to be imagined. There is also the aspect that the design regime which has become dominant needs to be surpassed and that is not going to happen by following the rules as set forth according to the interpretations of the authorities or experts. Rather than observing formalities, they need to somehow inspire them. That may lead to a lot of anthropomorphism for a while, but eventually something more effective may emerge. Narrative is interesting for writers, for instance, because they get to try to find ways to work in new words. Presumably designers can find a way to accomplish something similar with their own insights and the objects at their disposal. How it will be iterated by industry is another matter. Someone somewhere will see what it means in terms of design literacy and that means hope for those outside the accepted circles. ",

            "answer_text": "As a kinetic sculptor I would say one example is where a project requires architecture, mechanical engineering & art. For example see photo & video at,FactoryWearing the architects hat I needed to design an overall look and structure\u2013 then, switching back & fourth to my mechanical engineering hat, I need to incorporate a functioning mechanism within that structure. Next, I put on my ceramics hat to model & color the little articulated factory worker up top. I suppose to add a logician's hat when I was designing the random marble-chute-chooser mechanism. I think in the bigger picture though I think skimming down this page from Harvard might give one a good feel for how 'interdisciplinary design' might fit into the future world.Harvard Graduate School of Design ",
