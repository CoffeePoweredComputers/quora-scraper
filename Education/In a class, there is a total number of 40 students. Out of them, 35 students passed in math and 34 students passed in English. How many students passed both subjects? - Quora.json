Let E = the total number of students who passed English (that is those who passed only English, plus those who passed both subjects).Then we can write these statements symbolically as follows:E = EO + B or 34 = EO + B ...............(1)M = MO + B or 35 = MO + B ................(2).We add equations (1) and (2) as follows 34 + 35 = (EO + B) + (MO + B)to obtain: 69 = EO + MO + 2B ..........(3)Consider the total number of students in class; these are made up of three groups (those who passed only Math, those who passed only English, and those who passed both subjects: 40 = MO + B + EO .............(4)Subtract (4) from (3) to obtain 69 - 40 = (EO + MO + 2B) - (MO + B + EO) 29 = BTwenty-nine students passed in both subjects.

            "answer_text": "While I think Sivaji is close, in that there is a piece of information needed to simplify the problem. However, one can deduce that hidden part from the question. That hidden piece is the number of students that failed both tests.That number is five(5). Determined by showing that the total number of failures is 36 with one fewer in English than maths. Therefore the answer is to determine the number of both passes is calculated from the 35 remaining students. This simplifies the process. In this case the answer is 34 passed both subjects. given: a=total students with at least one pass b=students passing maths c=students passing English d= students passing both so: d=a - ((a-b)+(a-c)) d= 35 - ((35 - 35) + (35\u201334)) d=34 (# students passing both) Sorry if the arithmetic over-complicates what is actually an intuitive answer once the hidden piece of info is found.
