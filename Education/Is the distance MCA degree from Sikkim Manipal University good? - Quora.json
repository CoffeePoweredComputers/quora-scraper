            "answer_text": "Yes, It does, there are two options with Tab or without tab, the way of teaching the courses in MCA by using EduNxt it is much simpler to understand and examination dates and time is of your choice in a specific month if in case you're a working professional. And UGC recognised. Most important thing, It is often seen that people say it's useless what's the point in it by pursuing it from SMUDE but when you get your degree it's of SMU, it's not of SMUDE. The learning process and criteria is just amazing, I am pursuing Distance MBA Tab enabled program form SMU. From my best point of view, you should go for it. It's good for your career. Scholarship is also amazing. ",
