            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll find everything from remedial classes that cover basic adding and subtracting all the way up through higher level classes like topology or advanced calculus. If you\u2019re really asking what math classes you\u2019ll have to face in college, that will depend on your major. If you intend to study a STEM-related field, you may end up taking 2 or 3 semesters of calculus or more. If you study something in the arts or social sciences, you\u2019ll probably only be required to take college algebra, which is like a fast-paced review of your high school Algebra II and Trig/Pre-Calc class. Hope this helps! ",
