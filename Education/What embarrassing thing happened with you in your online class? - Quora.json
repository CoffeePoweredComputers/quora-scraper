Yesterday!! And i swear this is the most embarrassing thing that has happened to me in months So i was having one of my classes yesterday and it was one of the common classes, meaning that people from the other sections were also there. Let me give you a little background, so that its easier to understand- So because of this whole online class drama, my sis got my dad\u2019s one for the classes while my dad was using a keypad phone this whole time. Now the problem was not about him using a keypad phone, but it was my sister getting an android phone at just 10years of age, while i got mine in 11th!!\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 So I was trying to convince my parents to make her take her classes on my laptop (which i got recently) but she somehow managed to manipulate them EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! So yesterday, finally, apna time aaya\ud83d\ude09 (my time came) My dad was having his breakfast and somehow i managed to convince him and my mom\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 Now my sis told me to transfer her kpop songs from dad\u2019s phone to my laptop, and me being a very good sis *sarcasm intended*\ud83d\ude02 started doing it\u2026 Meanwhile my parents went downstairs for some work. The moment they left, my sis took a 360 turn and said that she isnt returning the phone as mom and dad had not told her to do it!! And i was like-  So my classes were going on in my phone (i had just entered the meeting) and we both started arguing and fighting like cats and dogs, using some *indecent* language. Suddenly i hear my teacher saying \u201cwho\u2019s this?\u201d in a very angry tone, and i had a gut feeling that it is me. I picked up my phone with shaky hands, and guess what, Not only was my mic on, but i saw that my video was also on the whole time!!\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30 I swear I've never felt this much embarrased AND scared at the same time before. I just quickly turned both of them off and left the meeting and realized that i not only made a fool out of myself in my own class, but also in other sections. Great-) What i did after that?? Went to my mom, told her about the whole incident, had a good laugh, tried forgetting it but failed And let me tell you, I'm embarrassed and scared to the extent that I'm not gonna attend my classes for the next 2\u20133 days.  Lets together pray for me\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude02 ",

I don't know how girls can be so punctual, I mean an online class at 8 am and they were like well dressed and I was like lost and out of the world and have no idea what the hell was going on. The incidence was like that: HOD- Turn on your camera otherwise you will be marked as absent in the class. Me- No idea what the hell was going on but just joined the meeting (don't know why) . HOD- Yashu your camera is not on. Turn on your camera otherwise I'll remove you from my class and a message will pop up in your father's number that your ward is not attending the class. Me- Yr papa k pass msg chla gya to band baj jygi. (If my father will receive the message. He'll kill me. He was very strict for my studies and I am too very much scared of him) HOD- Yashu, this is your last chance. Turn on your camera otherwise get out of my class. Me- in my mind, ajeeb musibat h yr yha ankh ni khul rhi camera kha se on kru. (I can't even open my eyes and she was yelling at me for turning on my camera. How would I ? ) Me- Unwillingly turn on my camera and ma'am starts pulling my leg. HOD- Inko dkho bs esa lg rha h so kr uthe h ar bs camera on kr k baith gya, km se km face to wash kr leta bvkoof (Class, just look at him, he has no idea what is the time of the class. He just opened his eyes and turn on his camera. Yashu at least you can wash your face before turning on your camera idiot) HOD- Have a look at all of the girls, they were attending the class with full enthusiasm and you idiot. Everyone was laughing and I was like itti sbh sbh kaun tyar ho kr class leta h vo b online \ud83d\ude11 (How anyone can attend an online class so early and well dressed too.) This was really an embarassing moment for me because I was lost at that time and after few minutes I realised that something was wrong then I got to know what had happened there in the class. I still don't have any idea how can girls be so punctual, just because of them I got an embarassing moment \ud83d\ude13 Edit 1- Ohhoo my first answer got more than 2k+ views. Thank you all for reading. Didn't expect that girls can help me in getting more than 2k views on my answer. ",
