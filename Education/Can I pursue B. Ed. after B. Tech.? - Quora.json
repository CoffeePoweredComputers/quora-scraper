            "answer_text": "Yes you can do so through some universities while some will not allow depending on the branch. Try to do B. Ed only if you have B. Tech in applied mathematics or applied physics else stay away from doing so. If you want you can do diploma in education which is also known as BTC is some states. B. Ed is for 6th and above while BTC is for 1 to 5. Many universities allow only those candidates who have B. Tech in Applied Mathematics or Applied Physics to pursue B.Ed. And with that allow you will be able to teach up till 10th only. For 11th and 12th you need post graduation in the teaching subject. Those having B. tech in Computer Science or Information Technology can teach computer science in schools without doing B.Ed also but for getting promotions you need to have B.Ed. Thank You. Edit 1: Government has now allowed B.Ed to become primary teachers which is a very good news for those who have done b.tech and b.ed and are from any stream of engineering as they can become primary teachers where requirement is just graduation with b.ed and tet qualified without any specific subject. This will create a lot of employnent opportunity for those who wish to teach in schools. Best of luck to all. Edit 1: In june 2018 ncte relaesed a gazette according to which b.ed holders can teach primary classes and hence it made easy for engineering graduates of all the branches having b.ed and tet or ctet. But they should clear tet or ctet of class 1 to 5. And no need of doing BTC. Edit 2: If engineers want to join schools they can opt for bachelors in libarary science of one year and become librarian in schools. Its more easy and safe. They can do Masters in Psychology of two years and become health and wellness teachers in school. Every school needs one such teacher. They can do B.ed (special education) and become Special Educators which are in great demand but supply is not their to teach students of special needs i.e handicapped ones. Hurrey! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! Yes. Absolutely. Until 2015, some universities didn't allow B.Tech students to opt for B.Ed. courses, but now most have lifted such criteria. First of all, I must appreciate your stand which you are likely to take up.Yes, you can surely go forward with B ed after B tech. Since your Engineering degree is a graduate degree, so there exists a scope for your persuasion in B.Ed degree.In this context, I would recommend you to have a regular degree course of B.Ed from a recognised university in order to enhance your chance to be selected as a teacher. A lot of engineering students aspire to become teachers. As some guy wisely said - In India students first become engineering graduates, and then decide what they want from their career. Therefore, it's a phenomenon unique to India that B.E. or B.Tech graduates want to pursue career in teaching in primary-level, middle or high schools. This might mean to some that they are leaving behind their technical careers, but it is a reality for majority and we must embrace it - till the time comes when serious amendments are made to the education system. This course is mainly for those who want to pursue a career in teaching. Especially to teach in higher primary and high schools, it is mandatory to have a \u2018first\u2019 degree of B.Ed. This course is of a duration of 2 years. The minimum eligibility criteria for B.Ed. is the completion of an undergraduate degree course in any discipline. National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) is the panel which oversees the standards, procedures and processes in the education system of India. Few of the leading universities for B.ed are : Delhi UniversityI P UniversityLovely Professional UniversityIGNOUBanaras Hindu UniversityMumbai UniversityKolkata University and few moreAs per my experience I would suggest you to have a look over Lovely Professional University. Bachelors of Education programme at LPU aims to prepare teachers as per NCTE guidelines through comprehensive curriculum, intensive training and field engagement with special focus on developing ability to qualify CTET/STET. I hope this helps. All the Best! ",

Doing B.Ed. after a professional course doesn't seem to be appealing as the new Degree can get you into the teaching line only at School level, whereas your technical degree may not fit the QR or much sought after. To teach in an Engineering College, you don't need a B.Ed. qualification, whereas passing NET may be more useful to pursue a teaching career. Think over again and take a second opinion. ",
