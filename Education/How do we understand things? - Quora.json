            "answer_text": "For my psychology class, I just barely read a chapter about the brain and what the different parts do, so the neurological answer would be that different neurons in the brain are specialized for certain tasks. For example, in the part that works with sight, certain neurons activate if there\u2019s a vertical line, others if there\u2019s a diagonal line, different ones if something\u2019s moving, etc. With all the specialized cells performing their part at once, we are able to interpret and recognize what we are seeing, hearing, and feeling. Now for the psychological answer: Even if two people have the exact same experience, they can understand it in very different ways. For example, one person might take a test, get a C, and understand that experience as being good. Another person might take the same test, get a C, and understand that as having been a very bad experience. They might even take it farther, such as questioning beliefs or blaming others. In that sense, the way we understand things that happen is due to three things: our genes, our past experiences, and our habits/decisions. Our genes affect us in that they make some people more likely to be depressed while others are more likely to just forget it, as an example. Past experiences, however, can determine quite a bit as well. In the testing scenario, the person\u2019s past grades will probably have a great impact on their understanding of this experience. The ultimate determining factor, however, will be our decisions. How do we normally decide to view educational situations such as test. If we have always paid more attention to the stress, that\u2019s probably what we\u2019ll focus on, more than the grade, what the teacher will think of us, or what we didn\u2019t understand. ",

            "answer_text": "I once read that we understand things in two different ways:  We can either play with the idea a little bit so that it fits \"our mentality\", meaning you basically focus on the parts your brain \"likes\" and understands, and leave out the rest. OrWe change our mentality to that it fits the idea.So think of it like a puzzle. The complete puzzle would be you understanding. So you have a missing piece, and that missing piece is the idea. You can either find a way to fit the puzzle so that it suits the piece, or if that doesn't work, you find a way to change the puzzle so that it fits the piece. This might not be 100% accurate, but it's what I understand. Good luck!  ",

Our knowledge about the interaction of elements may be incomplete. The number of elements of the model may be more real than our imagination. There are still intuition. Then the relationship between the elements is not amenable to logical analysis at the level of consciousness. But there is a confidence that something is what it is. By the way something in the theory that intuition does not exist by itself, but operates with the facts. Ie people do not have to build a reason, but can know the answer, which is subsequently found to be correct. ",

            "answer_text": "It is always easier to understand a new concept,when it is in pictorial form. For example you want to learn coding in a new language ,say c++ or java ,then the basic step is to make a Flow chart depicting the various steps and operations in the program. In this way you will be able to analyze the problem clearly. This technique is applicable even for other subjects/concepts as well. Always try to relate new concepts with the ones which you have already learnt .  Once you understand things clearly,it is easier to explain the concepts to others.  Edit 1- The first step towards teaching is understanding the concept properly. If you have not understood the concept ,then you can never teach others. So always understand the fundamentals clearly.

If you have experienced a lot (say from education of time spent learning) that your model includes more knowledge. The more knowledge we gain the more we can understand. A lot is based on how well we apply ourselves to what we want to know. ",
