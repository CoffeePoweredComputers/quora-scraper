            "answer_text": "It has always been relatively easy to graduate from high school if you select the right track, or one too easy for you. The trick is to choose a curriculum which is challenging enough for you to use your education to help you progress in life as far as your capabilities will let you go. Finding easy ways to slide by simply taking courses to easy for you will guarantee your learning one important lesson. That is, \u201cMy education didn\u2019t help me at all!\u201d That\u2019s a lesson you don\u2019t want to learn. If you\u2019re planning on staying in high school long enough to graduate, it\u2019s time, maybe even past time, to make some preliminary goals for yourself. Do you plan on entering one of the skilled trades? Do you hope to become a professional when you finish school? Is college in your plans? What do you see as the next step in your life after completing high school? Beginning to find workable answers to these questions for yourself is perhaps the most important part of your first year or two in high school. If you plan on attending college, what kind of school do you hope to attend? Luckily, in this question, people are not as locked in to earlier bad decisions as students in other countries. The development of local, low cost community colleges in the U.S. have made re-entry and re-imagining your life easier than it is in other places. You need not attend an elite college, for instance, to become a lawyer or a doctor. But you do need to take school seriously, to consider who you are and where you think you\u2019re going, and to establish work and study skills allowing you to achieve your objectives. School is not a game you play, it\u2019s a way to prepare for life. ",

            "answer_text": "Easiest thing ever. Millenials have no work ethic and we cater to their every whim. Or we could go with reality. The more requirements added the harder it is. Students start working on transcripted classes in middle school. My generation could just skate by without any consequence towards graduation or gpa. When I was in school We thought about what we might want to do when we grow up. Now if you don't have a career map by 5th grade you're a failure at life #MCD's. Middle school students are having nervous breakdowns over it. So kids these days have it easier than we did walking uphill,barefoot, five miles each way in the snow to school. They need to stop being petty, precious snowflakes. How dare they challenge cost vs reward. How dare they demand workplaces free of harassment. More importantly how dare they question anything. They need to accept being a cog in the machine. We have a solution. Sort them by perceived abilities and make the losers ask if you want fries with that. Tl:Dr No and it will only become more difficult. ",
