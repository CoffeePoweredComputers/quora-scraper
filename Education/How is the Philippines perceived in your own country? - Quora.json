            "answer_text": "Being married to a Filipina, I am afraid to say that the Philippines is not perceived in a very favourable light here in the U.K., or so it seems to me. I suppose that most people form their very impressions or opinions of a place from what they see on television, and whenever the Philippines is featured on the TV here the three aspects that are given prominence are (i) the poverty and poor living conditions of many of the people; (ii) the sex industry and especially the abuse and prostitution of children; (iii) the corruption of President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda (with her 4,000 pairs of shoes), who plundered the country\u2019s assets, (iv) the recurring natural disasters wrought by typhoons, floods and volcanic eruptions, etc. and (v) President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d. For a few days in November 2013 the TV news here was dominated by the destruction and loss of life wrought by Typhoon Haiyan (known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines) in the city of Tacloban and along the south coast of the island of Samar. As my wife comes from Lawaan, Eastern Samar, her family were badly affected by the typhoon and many of them were made homeless, with one family member also losing her life. More recently there has been some critical TV coverage here in the U.K. of President Duterte\u2019s \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d, especially in a BBC TV current affairs programme \u201cPanorama\u201d. TV and press coverage has reported how innocent people have been murdered for allegedly being drug dealers, but actually because they only have a quarrel with the person who has murdered them, and who has been encouraged by Duterte\u2019s appeal to the population to murder drug dealers. I think the Philippines would be viewed in a more favourable light here in the United Kingdom if either its cuisine here became better known and liked, or if it became a more popular holiday destination and received good reviews from those who had visited. With regards to its cuisine, whenever I see a cookery book in a shop here on the subject of Asian cuisine, it will cover the cuisines of various countries, but the one country that is always omitted is the Philippines. The one exception to this is the celebrity and TV chef Jason Atherton, who has from time to time included the cuisine of the country in his books, but this is because his wife is from the Philippines. Also whenever you see a series of TV programmes here on the subject of Asian cuisine, such as those by Rick Stein or The Hairy Bikers who visited different Asian countries in each programme, the one country they miss out is the Philippines. Above all, one reason why the cuisine is not becoming well known here in the U.K. is that there are very few restaurants where you can sample dishes from the Philippines. A few years ago a couple who are friends of ours opened a restaurant here in Nottingham specialising in Philippine cuisine which claimed to be only restaurant here in the U.K. outside London where you could find this cuisine, but the restaurant closed after a couple of years, proving that Nottingham was not yet ready for what it was offering. Although a few more people from the U.K. are now visiting the Philippines than was the case previously, it is still not a popular tourist destination for the British. Again if you visit a bookshop and browse through the travel section you will find few books that cover the Philippines, apart from Lonely Planet of course, who cover every destination in the world anyway. Even books that are about South East Asia in general will include all of the countries of that region of the world, but usually miss out the Philippines. If you visit a high street travel agent and look at the brochures on the shelves, it is very rarely you will find a holiday in the Philippines in their pages, even though you will find other destinations in South East Asia. Although Thailand, Bali (Indonesia) and Singapore have always been popular for British holidaymakers, other destinations such as Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and even Myanmar are advertised by travel agents more than the Philippines is. Also come to think of it, I cannot recall the Philippines ever being featured in a TV travel programme, like these other countries have been from time to time. It seems that the Philippines has some way to go before it can be considered as a popular travel destination, while in the meantime you get the impression, at least here in the U.K., that a good number of the people who go there now are only obnoxious paedophiles and sex tourists. In conclusion, just as it seems to us in the U.K. that the one Caribbean country that is not a tourist destination and receives all kinds of negative press and media coverage (compared to all of the others) is Haiti, the one South East Asian country that is less of a tourist destination than other countries in that part of the world and receives more (both deserved and undeserved) negative publicity is the Philippines, sometimes making me think that the Philippines is \u201cthe Haiti of the Far East\u201d or Haiti is the \u201cPhilippines of the Caribbean\u201d.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think the opinions of some are quite right. The Philippines is more known than other parts of SEA because our government puts more focus on the tourism development in the country. We built some of the largest known malls in the world. Our global cities are patterned after the western looks esp. the US. We are a musically minded people we have some of best singers in the world. We conduct the best beauty pageants in this part of the world. We conduct economic and political conferences where leaders of industries and politics are invited. We are trying to beautify our beaches, inner city looks and clean up the ocean. We have one of the more reknowned TV programs conducted in English for the whole world to see. But as always there are some people who wants to belittle it by citing only negative things about it. ",
