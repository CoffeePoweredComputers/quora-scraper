            "answer_text": "We use repeated measure design studies to determine changes in a population of process output over time. Parents often do this by measuring a child\u2019s height each year. Quality engineers use the method to monitor the output of processes that use consumable tooling, such as diameters turned on a lathe; to check for the effect of tool wear. Knowing how repeated measurements compare over time gives us the information we need to recommend tool change intervals. ",
