            "answer_text": "Short answer: Definitely yes! Some Background: The MBA and its predecessors were originally developed to provide non-business undergrads with the background to manage a large organization. Thus, a degree in educational administration plus an MBA would seem to be a good combination for a business manager for a school system. A degree such as your humanities degree plus an MBA would provide a good background for managing arts organizations, museums, and other non-profits. The list goes on: Engineering +MBA to run a factory ; MD plus MBA to run a large health care organization. As a non- business major, you may have to take some preparatory courses in such fields, as organizational behavior, accounting, finance, marketing, and management information science to get you up to speed to engage your graduate courses fully. Some MBA Programs have very liberal \u201cwaiver\u201d and substitution policies for these preparatory courses, and you would do well to consult with an MBA adviser very early in your program in Humanities. For example, consider taking some courses as part of your Humanities Program that will also meet the prerequisite requirements for the MBA. For example, Advanced Statistics, and an advanced course in Industrial/Organizational Psychology might provide background for the MBA\u2019s required graduate Business Statistics and Organizational Behavior courses. Your college may even have a Minor Program in Business which could help considerably. Talk to your Academic Adviser and an MBA Admissions Adviser. Best of Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes \u2014 but you would be at a huge disadvantage in the job market. Since the mid-1970\u2019s, most liberal arts degrees, \u201caren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re printed on.\u201d Employers don\u2019t care if you studied philosophy, political science, English, Women\u2019s Studies, etc. With majors like those you will likely be considered \u201cunskilled\u201d. Why would they want to hire a liberal arts + MBA job candidate when they have a pile of resumes from candidates with a relevant undergrad business or tech degree + MBA? Plus, there are two \u201ckinds\u201d of MBA (same degree): Train in business someone with no formal business training. For instance, a nurse (BSN), engineer, computer science major, etc., who wants to get into management in their field.Specialized more broad training for someone who already has a business degree, e.g., someone with an economics degree takes some graduate economics courses applicable to their current economics work plus courses in other business areas such as human resources.In both those cases the MBA holder is building on an existing business-related education. Also, in most such cases the progression is 1) business/tech degree, 2) several years degree-related work experience, 3) MBA that builds on the work experience. But with liberal arts + MBA there would not be either the related undergrad degree or related experience. ",

            "answer_text": "The most important things you can carry with you into any graduate school experience are curiosity and sound research skills. You can build them into almost any undergraduate program where you major in a more-or-less traditional discipline. While colleges are offering a number of undergraduate degrees in trendy areas to attract students who attend for \u201cfun,\u201d most of these popular undergraduate majors don\u2019t really lead any place useful. An undergraduate degree in history, political science, or even English, however would be a fine basis on which to build graduate studies in Business. Remember, once you begin graduate school, whatever area you decide to pursue, your work will be single-minded and purposeful, leading towards a degree. In your case, some element of business. It\u2019s there you\u2019ll learn the content and skills to apply in your career, but there won\u2019t be an emphasis on becoming a complete person or emphasizing developing and nurturing a wide variety of interests. But you may have your undergraduate education, all of it, to help you. Keep yourself as broad as you can while meeting the requirements of your advanced education. But be sure to become a lifelong learner. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that is a great idea! I don't think there are any prerequisites for a MBA, though a little math may help, but you can pick that up in business school. For example, they had two quantitative analysis tracks in 1973\u20134 at Rutgers when I got my MBA. I did STEM, so got in the Quant IV and V track; others went into I and II track. I always felt education should have a strong humanities piece to develop the whole person. Grad school tends to be much easier than undergrad, so you should not have a problem. A MBA should help in the work side of education. I had a history minor as an undergrad, and got a humanities degree, and a couple psych masters later, to round me out. I do not believe any of these degrees propelled my career though, which I did not expect anyway. I also think that top business schools would look kindly at a humanities undergrad. But, this is my opinion. Look at both sides of the argument. If you like humanities, that is another factor to bolster your idea. ",

I have supervised such students for a business school, and they have tended to do well because the study in the humanities requires a high intellectual level and articulate expression. ",
