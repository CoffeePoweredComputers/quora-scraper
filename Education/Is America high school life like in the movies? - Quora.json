            "answer_text": "Yes and no\u2026 and also, it depends. I went to three different American public high schools, and this is what I observed about different elements of high school they show in movies. School Dances:  (From Napoleon Dynamite) Yes, many schools have at least three school dances a year, some only two. There is homecoming court and prom king and queen, but these are not really as big of a deal as movies make them out to be. If you do become prom queen, good for you, but no one really cares much besides you and your friends, and hardly anyone talks about it after the night is over. School dances aren\u2019t that magical. I always laugh because high school movies tend to make a HUGE deal out of school dances, like it will be the night the guy of your dreams confesses his love to you in some big way in front of the whole senior class. Ha, you\u2019ll be lucky if your crush even asks you to dance. And if you do go with a date, there are NEVER enough slow dances, which I guess is okay for all the single people (e.g. me many a time) who have to stand awkwardly to the side or slow dance with their friends while they lament about how \u201cforever alone\u201d they will be. School dances can be a lot of fun, especially when you\u2019re getting ready beforehand with all your girls, but rarely do they result in anything but being surrounded by a bunch of grinding hormonal teenagers and adult monitored punch bowls. Cliques: There are cliques in high school, but they are not as clearly defined nor are they as exclusive as they are in the movies. Most of the time cliques are just a bunch of people who have similar interests, and it\u2019s just a natural thing for these people to gravitate towards each other. Of course band kids are going to relate more to band kids and athletes are going to relate more to athletes. But there are many people who have several groups of friends, and rarely will you find a person who will tell you you can\u2019t be friends with them because you\u2019re not a cheerleader. Lunchtime:  (From Clueless) School food is often as bad as the movies. It depends on where you\u2019re at though. If you go to a school with lots of funding, school lunches will be better. But the school food is usually very bland and trying (or failing) to be healthy. Sometimes, schools will have third party caterers like Domino\u2019s and Chick-Fil-A on certain days, which are always the best days of the week. People are rarely as mean in the lunchroom as they are in the movies. If you ask to sit at a lunch table, no one (I don\u2019t literally mean no one; there are some jerks out there.) will tell you you can\u2019t sit with them. Most people are actually really friendly when it comes to that sort of thing and will welcome new-comers. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone you sit with wants to be your friend, but most people are nice enough so that you don\u2019t end up sitting in the bathroom stall. Hallways: Lots of American high school movies spend a lot of scene time in a school hallway. In real life, school hallways aren\u2019t super exciting, and depending on where you go to school, you might not even spend a lot of time doing anything but walking through them. If you go to a large-sized school where many of your classes are spread apart, you rarely have time to stop and chat with friends, or you might not even see your friends too much throughout the day. Also, in schools with a high concentration of kids, lockers might be scarce so not everyone has one. In a smaller school, you might have time to chat before going to class. In two of the schools I went to, this was the case. I would walk to class with one or two of my friends, and we\u2019d talk before the warning bell rang for us to get to class. The first school I went to was relatively small, so everyone had a locker, and it didn\u2019t take too long to get to class, so I spent more time in the hallway around my locker. However the second school I went to was much bigger, and I rarely had time to even make it to my locker or to chat with friends, and the hallways were always too busy to stop and hang out in. The last school I went to didn\u2019t even have lockers, and while I did take time to stop and talk with friends, it was often a hassle because the hallways were filled.  Oh, and yes, this does happen sometimes. (From Prom) Jocks and Cheerleaders:  (From Bring it on: All or Nothing) Okay, so I\u2019ve had different experiences with this topic at different schools. Freshman year I was actually a cheerleader myself, and I didn\u2019t continue with it because of the social politics of it all. The girls on the team were the \u201cpopular girls\u201d as defined by movies, but they weren\u2019t as terribly heartless and even as psychopathic as movies like to portray them. They really were just awfully immature, and many of them were going through unimaginably terrible things. They did spread rumors about each other; they said terrible things behind each others backs. Some of them were friends, and I had no idea why because they secretly hated each other. This is a sad truth, but that part actually happens. However, this isn\u2019t solely a cheerleader or popular girl thing. This happens in all circles of high school, and it even happens beyond high school. Cheerleaders really aren\u2019t as big of a deal as they are in movies. Besides pep assemblies, people rarely even acknowledge that you\u2019re a cheerleader, and no one really pays attention to them at games unless the team is REALLY good and does a cool halftime show or something. However this could be different at other schools; some schools are known for different sports, which make the people in those sports more well-known around the school. Some schools are known for their drama department, and that makes those people more well-known because everyone sees them in the school plays. Bottom line is the more involved you are at school, the more people will know who you are. I never felt special as a cheerleader; that never made me popular. Similarly, there are many football players who I wouldn\u2019t consider popular, and no one will simply go out with you because you\u2019re the quarter back unless they already have the illusion in their head given to them by those very movies we are talking about. Pep Assemblies: These are never as exciting as they are in the movies. Some people really enjoy pep assemblies, but there are also some people who really hate them, and some kids even ditch them. Most of the time you are sitting in a smelly gym or out on the football field, and some kids you\u2019ve never talked to before are screaming at you trying to get you to cheer. Then some other kids do some obstacle course, and sometimes it\u2019s funny, and sometimes it\u2019s not. But hey, you get out of class. School Projects: For some reason in high school movies, the students are always doing some elaborate project, and they go to someone\u2019s house to finish it like seven times a week to work on it. I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gone to someone\u2019s house for a group project in all of high school unless it was like a really good friend whose house I\u2019d go to anyway. Usually group projects consist of the teacher giving you class time to make a poster or powerpoint, and if you have to do work outside of class, you do it individually at home and collaborate through Google Slides or use free period hours to work on it at school. Bullying:  (From Mean Girls) Bullying does happen. But it\u2019s usually not as obvious or dramatic as it is in the movies. Never have I seen anyone being thrown against lockers or ganged up on by a bunch of horrible girls nor have I seen blatant acts of cyber bullying on social media. But that doesn\u2019t mean bullying doesn\u2019t happen. It does, and sometimes someone might not even realize they\u2019re being bullied. Bullying in high school can be as simple as the people you hanging out with continually saying rude things to you \u201cas a joke\u201d because you guys are \u201cfriends.\u201d The sad things is that because of movies we have this idea in our heads that in order to be a victim of bullying you have to get your head shoved into a toilet or harassed 24/7 on social media. However, some of these major things do happen. I know a guy who used to get thrown in trash cans while he was at school. This surprised me because I thought this was something that only happened in movies. I think the main form of bullying in high school is gossip. Gossip is like wildfire in high school as well, and this is one major thing that made me sick about high school my senior year. Even good people fall into the bad habit of gossip and don\u2019t realize they are being bullies just by perpetuating rumors (I\u2019ve been guilty of this myself), or they justify the gossip because they are speaking badly about someone who is a complete jerk and did something jerkish so that person deserves to be talked about. Gossip is never okay. In conclusion, American public high school does not have to be as bad as it is in the movies, but yes there is drama and definitely a huge emphasis on the social aspect of it. Everyone\u2019s experience is different, and it can even differ with region, whether you\u2019re a guy or a girl, or whether you go to a large school or a small school. This is just my experience, and you can\u2019t take anything I said here as law, but I believe many of these observations hold true for other people. I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has experienced otherwise. P.S. This NEVER happens in real life unless you\u2019re a drama geek ;):  (From High School Musical) Thanks for the A2A! ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. Real American high school has much more emphasis on actually learning. Kids don't have time to spend infinite amounts of time talking in empty halls or going to parties every night. They have work to do. Many have jobs. They have to go to classes. The social aspects you mention in movies are still there, though: \"jocks\" are much more likely to have girls fawning over them. The popular kids often are downright nasty to nerds and less physically attractive or more socially awkward kids. So the social aspects are kind of spot-on, but the kids don't do anything to the level you see in the movies. ",
