            "answer_text": "See, first you need to send transcripts from University directly. That can be done by posting transcripts from University post office. Next, you need to send photocopies of degrees which you are getting evaluated. For that, send your degree in a separate envelope. In my case, I sent transcripts from University post office and degree (photocopy) from a post office near my home. Hope it helps! All the best. ",
