            "answer_text": " I am frequently asked: what are the best books on investing? How do I develop my investment philosophy and process? How do I become a good investor? I have mentored many aspiring investors, and I also teach the Value Investing Seminar at the F.W. Olin Graduate School of Business. The investing books that I describe below have helped many aspiring investors make their journey from a beginner to an investing expert. Best Investing Books That Will Make You a Good Investor Reading even the best investing books is not enough. You need to have a process for using what you learn to develop your own investment philosophy and investment process. As you read each of these investing books, you should also be doing three things: 1. Understand \u2013 You should be able to understand the key investing ideas in each book, not just quote them. Do you understand why the master investor used the approach that he or she did? What was the historical context or investing environment that they were in? How are the different parts of the investment process related to each other? 2. Apply \u2013 Investing is not a theoretical endeavor. The most successful investors in the world have not been professors merely armed with theories, but rather practitioners who understood theory and were able to successfully apply it in practice. If you don\u2019t practice applying the knowledge that you glean as you read these investing books, you might be left with a deceptive feeling of mastery of the material where none exists. 3. Customize \u2013 You are not Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham or Phil Fisher. Your strengths and weaknesses are different. Your investment operation and constraints might be different. So don\u2019t run around trying to be the next Warren Buffett. Instead, become the strongest investor that you are capable of becoming by customizing what you learn. Use the insights in these books to build your own investment process, don\u2019t just blindly copy theirs. The list of the best investing books presented below is in the order in which you should read them. You will increase your odds of becoming a good investor if you study each book before moving on to the next one. Don\u2019t rush \u2013 this is not a list of easy investing books that you can master in a few weeks or even a few months. Instead, this is a path that will take most of you years to master. I have read the first book on the list, Benjamin Graham\u2019s Security Analysis, four times in my almost two decades of professional investing. Each time I have learned something new, informed by the additional investing experience that I have had since the prior reading. As you read each of these investing books, keep asking yourself these questions: What about this approach appeals to you and what does not?How much of the approach was influenced by the investor's personality and how much by the external environment during which they were investing?How successful would this approach be in the current investment environment?",

            "answer_text": "Like any other skills, mastering fundamental analysis implies two aspects. The first is theoretical preparation, while the second, more important, is practicing. Starting with theoretical preparation, there are numerous books disputing this subject. A few examples that are indeed worth the time are \u201cMastering Fundamental Analysis: How to Spot Trends and Pick Winning Stocks Like the Pros\u201d by Michael C. Thomsett and \u201cSecurity Analysis\u201d by Benjamin Graham. Read them like school textbooks, noting down the most important metrics and indicators to take into account. Also, keep in touch with the latest news. However, I've noticed that some aspiring traders only rely on theoretical preparation and don't feel ready to start even after years of research. The most productive preparation is when you do both at the same time and apply the rules recently read right afterwards. To start, analyse a few stocks based on the main fundamental analysis metrics such as price to earnings ratio (P/E) or EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) for industries like tech, debt equity, price-to-book ratio (or P/B ratio), Free Cash Flow. Don't limit yourself to the current rate, use this metrics for numerous stocks on a long run and notice how did they evolve in time. To finish, take a foundation course and soon afterwards start trading applying fundamental analysis, because otherwise you risk to waste too much time on theoretical preparation alone. ",
