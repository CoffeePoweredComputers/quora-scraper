            "answer_text": "I\u2019m anonymous because I have quite a following on Quora and I don\u2019t want to lose it because of what I did 50 years ago. This wasn\u2019t in the USA but jails are much the same everywhere. I did a 6-month sentence for having sex with someone underage who was fully consenting but didn\u2019t know it was a crime, and she did her best to cover up for me when the authorities found out. The Police put it to me this way: \u201cIf you plead not guilty there\u2018s a good chance you\u2019ll get off because our evidence isn\u2019t good. But if you do that we\u2019ll charge her as a juvenile delinquent and have her sent to borstal for three years. If you plead guilty and co-operate with us we\u2019ll leave her alone.\u201d Was I going to get a 15-year-old girl locked up to save my own skin? What would you have done? The Police were as good as their word. I went to jail with a professional career in ruins and they found her a job in another town. It was a small jail with 30 inmates so we pretty much ran everything ourselves under strict supervision by guards who mostly came from another country. I got one of the better jobs as storeman. Very little violence and we quickly learned to judge people not by what they used to do or why they were there, but by what kind of social companions they were day to day. That was a lesson that stayed with me for the rest of my life. Most criminals are only bad in a small area of their lives. The soul-destroying bit was having very few possessions and nobody in authority taking any notice when we needed anything. A plaster for a cut finger? Maybe on Friday when the nurse visits. Everything was done by the book including rations. I had to weigh out the right amount for every meal to match that days\u2019s muster and give it to the cooks, and my records were checked by the prison clerk. No higher-priced foods like coffee or bacon. Three slices of bread daily and three eggs weekly. A saucer of sugar on each table containing exactly four teaspoons. Any inmate who took more than their share was in trouble. You get the general idea. The inmate cook had been a chef in his past life and did a really great job with what he was given, but the sameness every day soon got boring. He was doing a long sentence for safe blowing and was quite forthcoming about the rather specialized skills needed to do it well, also the time he\u2019d been asked to help when a team of locksmiths couldn\u2019t open the jammed safe of a big retail store in town! His long long sentence was reduced by a month as a reward. Now and again the prison chaplain brought in a basket of apples or lemons and that was a welcome change. He was a good man and I still remember \u201cGod won\u2019t judge you as harshly as people do, because God understands why you did it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a punitive or brutalizing jail but very robotising. You did exactly what you were told and not much else, and the only real freedom anyone had was to choose library books (all rather old as they were donated) to read in your cell after lock-up. Every day was the same: from cell to ablution, yard to mess room, work to yard, yard to mess room, recreation to lock-up an that was it. I wasn\u2019t ill-treated but I did have to accept occasional humiliation from guards. I had a pair of prison shoes with squeaky soles (prison supplies were usually seconds) that I hated and I had to put up with a guard telling everyone \u201cHere comes Old Squeaky\u201d and pretend I didn\u2019t mind. Another picked on me whenever he could. In the meal queue he called me out to re-fold my bedding (one corner not quite straight) and by the time that was done I was the last one to be served and someone had taken my ration of sugar. He never did it to anyone else. I had to bite my lip or I\u2019d be in trouble. Other inmates told me \u201cYour real punishment starts when you get out\u201d and I watched others getting more and more fearful as their release date approached. We were in jail because the world had said we should be, so how was it going to treat us when we returned? Nobody slept on their last night in jail and it wasn\u2019t excitement, it was naked fear. It was a long and difficult road back. I was making a fresh start in another city where nobody knew me, but everywhere I went I still felt exposed and vulnerable. Others had told me \u201cYou\u2019ll think everyone\u2019s looking at you\u201d and they were dead right, I couldn\u2019t shake that feeling for a long time. If a stranger sat beside me on a bus I\u2019d shiver internally and think \u201cIf you knew what I was you wouldn\u2019t want to sit with me\u201d and be thankful when it was over. I was truthful with employers but nobody wanted me - most said they didn\u2019t mind personally but their staff wouldn\u2019t like working alongside an ex-prisoner. Eventually by accident I met someone I\u2019d known years earlier who was setting up a small factory and needed someone with exactly my skill set to manage it. The staff were never told of my history and I spent seven years building that business up until my offending was long behind me and I could offer future employers a clean track record. But I still shiver when an occasional politician demands a public register of past sexual offenders. I\u2019ve got a clean 50-year record and nobody in my present life knows I was ever in jail. Probation brought its own problems. The Court had put a 1-year restriction on places I could go and people I could associate with, and it was often quite difficult explaining why for instance I couldn\u2019t attend a meeting in the local schoolroom or attend a function of a certain kind. Gradually the shame and guilt eased and I had the support of a couple I\u2019d known for many years, but they had young children and Probation only allowed me to visit during the day and another adult always had to be present. When the year was up with no further restrictions they invited me to a weekend summer camp where the adults would stay with relations and the kids were to sleep in tents at the camping ground. When we settled in the kids\u2019 mum told me to take two of them to sleep with me in my tent - and in the same bed. They were used to sleeping with adults and had always called me Uncle. I was wide-eyed with surprise - \u201cAre you sure? Have you forgotten what I went to jail for?\u201d Her answer was a major turning point in my life. \u201cWhat you need most right now is to be trusted. I am trusting you to sleep with my children because I know you love them as much as I do and I know you will look after them.\u201d I cannot find words for what a difference that made to my life. A profoundly healing experience, and what a wonderful insight into what had been eating away at my sense of well-being for so long. Two lovely young people sleeping cuddled into me in total trust - and for me the beginning of a new road back. I wish the world was kinder to ex-prisoners. They\u2019re not all bad by a long way. Edit: Thank you to those who made supportive comments. They were mostly women! I can\u2019t reply individually without losing my anonymity, but I do want to say two things about it: one comment said my crime would follow me to the end of my life. It didn\u2019t, but people like him have a mission to follow me to the end of my life and 20 or 30 years later I still had to deal with people who somehow found out and were acting as if I needed to be punished all over again. I didn\u2019t want that to happen on Quora. As an aside he was wrong about the law because we\u2019re in different countries and there have been changes since then.my other reason for anonymity was I wasn\u2019t sure how my story would be received and I wanted to find out without any of the baggage people who already knew me here would bring to it. 10K views, 127 upvotes and some very favourable responses from people who have no idea who I am have told me that Quora is full of good and fair minded people. So thank you everyone.There aren\u2019t many bad people, but a lot of otherwise good people make bad choices. ",
