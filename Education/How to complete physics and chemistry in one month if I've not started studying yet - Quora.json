Class notes are often treasure for students because teachers gives the notes in the most comprehensible way and since you have attended the classes you can easily understand and keep them in mind. 2. NCERT books can be easily understandable. So read the book chapter by chapter. 3. Get a good sleep of at least 6-7 hours. It will help you to keep you cool in the exam hall next day and you will be able to recollect this. 4. You can pick 3-4 most important chapters for that subject based on marks distribution in previous year's question papers.Make sure you read them completely from the main textbook like NCERT book. 5. For chapters with less weightage, focus more on going through notes prepared by you or someone else. REVISION is the Key\u2026 Whatever you learn, keep revising them regularly. Many students complain that they forget learned topics after few days. It is a common problem. With regular revision you can overcome it. Try to solve sample paper at least once a week to feel confident about your preparation. Solve last 10-year question papers. First, prepare those chapters in which you feel comfortable. ",
