            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not unusual to be annoyed by certain questions, certain people, or even random moments where even you are surprised by your own irritation. I ask myself whether I want to let it slide (smile, reply with a distraction); try to improve the situation long term (teach this person where my boundaries are so we don\u2019t cover the same ground repeatedly); or communicate that I am feeling truly disrespected. I personally prefer not to answer questions that feel inappropriate. I think it encourages people to be insensitive, not only with me but others. How we handle these situations impacts - either positively or negatively - our relationships. Replying thoughtfully and honestly not only protects our relationships, but improves our communication skills. I love that you posed this question, and I hope you are rewarded for sharing your dilemma! ",

I too have less grades. Do you know what I do when someone ask me the same question. I usually smile and say they are less ( \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 grades ) and ignore the question. And if someone is insisting me to tell my grade points I tell them and directly say (5 or 5.5 or 6 out of 10) whatever the pointer is. Because its wisely said that a single sheet of paper cannot decide our future.  ",

Use it if you are truly serious about ending inappropriate questions. If you are not all that serious, I wouldn\u2019t blame you for having fun with your questioners. I think I would.
