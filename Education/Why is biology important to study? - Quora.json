            "answer_text": "Biology is life. Understanding biology helps you understand how your body functions and how your pets\u2019 bodies function and if you have children and/or a spouse, how their bodies function. This matters because it affects your health and diet. You can communicate better with doctors, veterinarians and other health professionals if you understand biology. Biology helps you understand what you read on the Internet or elsewhere that relates to science, health and medicine and evaluate if it\u2019s true or not. Biology helps you raise plants or tend a yard. When you go out hiking in nature, biology helps you understand what you are seeing and the importance of it to the earth and humanity. I remember when I was 16 and backpacking that I was lecturing the counselor about the ecosystems we were passing through (something I had been studying). The health of the planet and humanity depends on the health of ecosystems. To fully understand ecology, though, you have to understand the foundations of biology too\u2014chemistry, physics and cellular biology. When I was in college, one of my biology professors took us to a university that was built wrong for the ecology of the area (not taking into account what the ground was made of) and the buildings were sinking because of this. It was hard to even open some of the doors because of the sinking. He said if the builders has hired an ecologist this wouldn\u2019t have happened. So biology and the related sciences (geology) affect building construction as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you so much for your question John. If I asked this question of my first year undergraduates, many of them would answer, \"Because we have to take a science and chemistry and physics are too hard.\" So I always begin a new semester by telling students that studying biology allows one to appreciate one's place in the natural world; that humans are certainly the most accomplished of species but are, by no means, necessarily the most important species on the planet; and that even the most sophisticated of organisms are dependent upon the simplest of organisms for their existence. Okay. I know that mine is more a philosophical answer than what you may have been expecting. But it is true that all organisms in the biosphere are intricately connected and we humans-though we go to school and get degrees and build skyscrapers and walk on the moon and do all of these great things, are, biologically, not different from any other organism on the planet. So whether you are a bacterium; a mushroom; a fish, bird, or snake; a Labrador retriever, giant redwood tree, or humpback whale; or a human, all living organisms have the following things in common: 1. They are made of cells and those cells are highly organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems. 2. They use energy [Plants (producers) make chemical energy from sunlight while animals (primary consumers) obtain energy from eating plants and higher animals (secondary consumers) obtain energy from eating those animals.] 3. They strive to maintain a stable internal environment. [We call it homeostasis.] 4. They reproduce. 5. They have genes and are able to transmit those genes (and ultimately their characteristics) to subsequent generations. [We call that process heredity.] Getting back to my first year students: It is my hope that sharing all of these things will instill within them (and within you) at least some semblance of appreciation for the totality of the natural world and their places (and your place) within it. And, that, my friend, is why we study biology. Biology Coach Online  ",
