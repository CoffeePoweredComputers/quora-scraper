            "answer_text": "There is no option as Biology is not a compulsory subject.. On the other hand physics and chemistry are compulsory one.. you have to study in 11th and 12th and then you can choose biology as a major.. interesting thing is after 11th and 12th the competitive exams still includes both chemistry and physics\u2026. and if you somehow go for b.sc.. then you have to choose a particular subject of biology like\u2026 biochemistry , biotechnology or botany and many more\u2026 and this is a big disadvantage.. as there is nothing like biology honours but there is physics honours and chemistry honours\u2026 and also in the long run biologist should also have a logical mind as many experiments and working on high tech computers requires logical mind\u2026 ",
