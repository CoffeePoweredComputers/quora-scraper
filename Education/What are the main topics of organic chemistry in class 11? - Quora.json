            "answer_text": "Organic chemistry is the most interesting and important part of chemistry. It is totally depend logic and lots of practices every day. Class 11 is the base of organic every chapter is important in first you have to learn all the basics of organic chemistry and it's start with Nomenclature one the most important chapters if you don't know how will you identify the product . So it's one of the most important chapters. 2. Then another most important chapters is mechanisms in your entire journey of organic chemistry you have to apply this chapter so now get the importance. Another chapters which are related to mechanism are also very important Alkens, Alkynes, Alkanes, also Alkyl halides, Hydrocarbon very very important most of the questions ask every year from this 3. And the most conceptual chapter is and important but as not as previous ones is Isomerism you need a very good visualization power for this chapter it's a important chapter not as much as previous chapters but questions are ask in regular basis 4. In short every chapter is importantof class 11 if want to learn and solve organic chemistry questions. Class 11 every chapter has it's own importance And for questions perspective for jee-main most of the questions come from alkyl halides , mechanism, Hydrocarbon etc. ",
