            "answer_text": "It depends. Yearly cutoffs change. But I'll try to give you an idea. I had nearly 135/200 marks and a rank of 135 in 2015. In the same year the general admission closed around 122 marks. But times have changed. Ranks would be a better indicator. In the first counselling, admissions should close around 300\u2013350 rank for UR, 7\u2013800 for OBC, 10,000 for Sc/St. But, if you really want AIIMS Bhopal, attend every counselling there is!! Because in the 3rd round you could get admission with ranks as much as 700 for UR, 1500 for OBC and 20-25000 for sc/st. And after that there is a spot counselling, ranks vary a lot in them. Even at 1500 rank, you might get a UR seat. Do attend them. ",

This year this cutoff may decrease a bit as there are many top state medical colleges which would be preferred by the aspirants. So, expect you will get it under 600\u2013700. ",
