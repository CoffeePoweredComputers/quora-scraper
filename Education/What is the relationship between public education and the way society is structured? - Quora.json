            "answer_text": "Thomas Jefferson believed in public education but he felt it should be two-teired, one track for the ruling class and one for the laboring class. Public Education was this way for generations. In the past half-century it has become more democratic (small d). However the result has been the lowering of standards. I like the more democratic system. Still I do wish standards weren't lowered so much. There is opportunity through public education. This is why the conservative right has waged a war on public education for the past 60 or so years, ever since it was illegal to segregate. ",

            "answer_text": "Public education was brought in in various countries in Europe in the late 1800s. Children working in factories for 12, 14 hours a day had been legislated against by men like Lord Shaftesbury in the UK. So, what do you do with the children now free of factory work? Some, no doubt worked on the land but factories needed employees so in order to make better employable people schools taught reading and arithmetic - writing was not immediately brought in in the UK in case they \u201dwrote seditious articles against the government\u201d. But the idea was to create obedient employees and young men for the army and navy - and future taxpayers! ",
