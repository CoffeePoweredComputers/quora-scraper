            "answer_text": "Computer Science is itself the most interesting field at present because you have a lot of choice to study in this field in whichever part your interest lies.  Most of us are interested in this field because its the innovative field ,daily 100\u2019s of Idea comes in CS students mind and the best part of it is that you don\u2019t have to bother about the resource to develop anything your laptop is itself your teacher as well as your industry. When you will read the day to day innovations in CS you will definitely find some of your ideas to implement in that and sometimes combining all these you get something new which has been never invented. The more and more you will read about it the more and more you will gain interest in it.Follow some of these points:- Get a laptop with you have a net connection and start exploring the Computer Science field in which ever part you find interest ever using all the things related to computer Science like your mobile Applications,Bluetooth,etc. that how they are build and what the process behind their working.Start from the basic reading getting knowledge about that and then start implementing it by yourself at smaller scale.I will give you an example Start building an website of whatever you like. I m providing you some links from where you will be able to get about it.HTML Tutorial learn the basic of html and start building one website and try to be innovative in that surely you will gain interest after some days. For further studies find all web development tutorials on W3Schools Online Web Tutorials  Its up to you that in which part of computer science field your interest lies.Computer Science is a very vast field.Various of its section are: Development fieldTesting FieldProgramming FieldDealing with HardwareGraphics and Animations and many morenow its up to you in which part you can prove yourself good and have an effective growth.If you are good in Mathematics and have skills at problem solving then you must move towards Programming field.   It must be started by studying some standard programming languages and at the same time implementing it by making some small small programs. Secondly comes the testing filed its considered best for the people who are not good at programming and find difficulty in solving problems. This part is just having some sort of theoretical knowledge of the machine and just you have to sit and look at the proper working of the system.. The third is the Development field it too requires some sort of creativity and effective thinking such that you are good in developing something effective. Various parts in this are Web Development and Android Development. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is too broad. There are so many scenarios to consider. It depends on your starting point, what you want to achieve with the degree, and how much time you have. If you only have a HS degree, then a Bachelor in Math would be very useful. That would be my preference. If you have a bachelors degree that did not include studies in calculus, linear equations and statistics, then it would be helpful to go to a community college to get those courses under your belt. Then apply for a MS in CS. If you have the right background, or after bridging to it, apply for a MS in CS. It also depends on the stage in life you are at. If you have a full time job, the best options maybe an online degree or night classes. The best strategy might be to get the curriculum from a masters degree and then analyze your starting point so you can trace a roadmap to your goal. ",
