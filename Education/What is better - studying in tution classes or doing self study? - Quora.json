            "answer_text": "If you join  tuition classes it will be good and if you not want to join then at least join correspondence classes at least because it will help you in keeping eye on your test performance test by test. How many hours should I study at home? Some of you out there must be toppers of your class or among the top 10% of your class. But that is just a performance in your class or best at a school level. It means till now you have been competing among a small student base of 50 \u2013 1000 students. But once you start preparing for IITJEE or AIEEE entrance, the competition is huge. This year in 2008, over 3.2 lakh students appeared in IITJEE and over 9 lakh in AIEEE. So my advice is that you seriously need to scale up your efforts to face the competition. Are you ready for this? You need to prepare yourself mentally as well as physically to face this competition. Mentally, you need to think wide when you think of competition you are facing. Remember there are more than 10000 schools (just CBSE) in India. So don\u2019t get defocused and remember that you have to compete with unknowns. Most of you would have scored well in your school level examinations by not even spending 20 hours on studies at home. This is not going to be enough with such a huge competition. You need to scale up your efforts and set a target of 50-55 hours studies at home every week. But just sitting in front of the books for these 50-55 hours is not enough. You have to study with full concentration, no disturbance, and continuously for 3 hour sessions. The idea is to simulate real exam conditions. While studying, you have to create an atmosphere as if you are sitting in exam. Avoid doing following during a 3 hours session: It also true that you are not going to get start studying for 9-10 hours suddenly its require proper strategy. For the first week you try to  cut down your times which you are spending in other works by 2 to 3 hoursNext week cut down your times  which you are spending in other works again by 2 to 3 hoursYou cannot start studying 1o hours a day suddenly where as earlier you are studying for 3 to 4 hoursTry to do same as earlier, Increase your study time from 3-4 to 6-7 hours and in next week or after 2 weeks scale up to 9 to 10 hours.How you study for these hours? You have to study with full concentration, no disturbance, and continuously for 3 hour sessions. The idea is to simulate real exam conditions. While studying, you have to create an atmosphere as if you are sitting in exam. Avoid doing following during a 3 hours session: Study on a desk if you have it at home. Avoid studying while lying down on a bed.Don\u2019t get up from your desk during 3 hours of study session. Even not for drinking water.Don\u2019t listen music during studies. If you have a habit, then slowly come out of it by reducing it day by day.No phone calls and no SMS during studies.  Study with 100 percent concentration as if you are sitting in exam.  Things you should not do during JEE preparation! Remember that for next 2 years you have to give your best to get admission in a good college. So to take out 55 hours every week, you need to sacrifice some of your time sucking activities. If you are involved in any of the following activities mentioned below, I suggest you should stop it immediately: Don't socialize too much:-Avoid too much talking on phone with your friends. Not more than -30 minutes every day. Keep yourself away from family discussions and don\u2019t get into arguments with parents and brothers/sisters because it will only wastes your time and energy. Be selfish to focus on your career.Don't spend long hours on TV, Internet and playing games:- If you are too much into TV, cut down immediately. Don\u2019t spend more than 1 hour in front of TV every day.  Internet is the biggest addiction of all time. Real time sucker. Don\u2019t sit on computer for more than 1 hour unless as their any study need. Don't play outdoor sports:-Those who are playing physical games a lot should reduce them. These games are very tiring. If you are physically tired, you would not be able to concentrate on studies. I suggest evening walk or light exercise either in the morning or evening.Don't study late night:- Those who study late nights, sleep whole day. This is a bad schedule. If you don\u2019t sleep well in the night, you will feel sleepy in school and in your coaching classes. So best is you should sleep for 7 hours any time between 10 PM to 9 AM. Those who don\u2019t get study atmosphere at home in the day time, in worst case they should study till 2.00 AM and get up at 9.00 AM.Don't sleep for long or two short sleep hours:-You should target for 7 hours sleep every day. Also avoid day time sleeping for more than 90 minutes.Those you could manage to sleep less, I would not recommend a sleep of less than 5-6 hours. If body is tired, mind cannot function properly.Don'ts go to school daily:-I suggest that if possible, go to school not more than 4 times a week. School studies are not going to play important role in your career at this stage. Even school studies should be done just before the exams say 1-2 weeks before exams.for more go to my blog IITJEE PREPARATION TIPS ",

            "answer_text": "Every parent and student has faced this situation of deciding whether or not to study in tuition. Most of the times, it\u2019s the parents\u2019 decision to join their kids in tuition/coaching class after school.There are many types of tuition. Some offer extra coaching of academic subjects for Primary, Secondary and Higher Secondary students. Some institutes offer tuition for specific subjects like Science, Commerce, Accountancy, etc. Advantages Of Self-Study Children do not depend on external help.They don\u2019t experience the peer pressure and are relaxed. They get time to live their childhood.Their reasoning, analytical skills and social skills are good.They get time to spend with their parents, friends and extended family, thereby equipping them to be part of a healthy society.Limitations Of Going To Coaching Classes Physical exhaustion: Students spend about half their day in school. They become tired while coming back home. They don\u2019t get time to take rest as they have to rush to their tuition classes. They come back late in the evening with no energy left.Extra Fees: Lower middle class, middle class and people above poverty line struggle to pay school fees. It becomes almost impossible for them to join their kids in tuition where the fee is expensive and charged on hourly basis.Unwanted pressure on students: Parents push their kids to tuition thinking that it is the only way to become topper of the class. They don\u2019t realize that only one kid can become a topper.Students lose their childhood: In the chase of marks and grades, children lose their precious childhood days. They lose out on playing with other children, fun, and creativity. Most importantly, they spend very less time with their parents.",
