            "answer_text": "YES I did just that for 6 years. UPDATED ANSWER\u2026.YES, you can work. But the legality is questionable at best.Over a 6 year period I worked in 5 different schools. The first school I worked at was a public school ran by the government. My contact at the school also worked at the local government offices for visas etc. It was a small city so it wasn\u2019t that odd.At the time I hadn\u2019t even finished my diploma, let alone a Bachelor\u2019s degree. Due to his connections in the government I\u2019m pretty sure my visa was legal. \u201cLegal\u201d in the sense that he abused existing loopholes. At my second school I was working at a private training school, on a business visa. Again I think this was a legal loophole. But a far less acceptable one. Where in the first school I spent the entire length of the contract in the city, for my 2nd school I was required to travel on a day trip to Hong Kong once per month to reset the visa. My third school had me working illegally. No doubt about that. Mainly because after the first 6 months when I tried to renew my visa the police said there were issues with the paperwork and forced me to leave the country. Fourth school was a public school again. It was all legal. Fifth school was a private training school again. It was legal on my part. But the school itself did some questionable practices. So even when I try to do the right thing the school might screw me over. . Moral of the story; you ARE breaking the law (or at least abusing loopholes) by not having a diploma and a work visa. The diploma doesn\u2019t need to be in teaching, but you need a diploma and a work visa; otherwise you run the risk of getting kicked out of the country. ",

            "answer_text": "When I read the responses here, I am amazed at the number of posts that suggest that people work illegally in China. It is you and only you that you are being put in jeopardy by doing this. You will suffer the consequences for illegal employment if you are caught. You will face questions when returning to China from one of your \"exits,\" at some point. You will face questioning when trying to legalize yourself later. You will not have work experience that you can say that you earned or show to qualify for anything. Illegal employment includes that of working while not holding a work permit and a related residence permit. Working with any other type of visa constitutes illegal employment (e.g. tourist or business visa, student visa, spousal visa, etc). It also includes situations where employees hold a work permit and the related residence permit, but the employer listed on the work permit or the position listed is different than in reality. Additional employment is also usually not legal, as well. In general, a state-certified teaching license or a degree in education or a related field is not required, especially if you are teaching ESL in public schools or training centers; however, for more structured programs such as IB departments of international sections of Chinese schools or international schools, then it is highly likely that one or both of such certificates is required. Also, many people mentioned other requirements for a work permit and the related residence permit. In general, you need to be from one of the countries that China considers to be a native speaker, 2 years or more of related work experience, a medical exam performed at a state approved medical center, original degree certificate, and a statement of non-criminal record. You also need to fit between a certain age bracket. If you are a non-native speaker, but have a degree in education or a related field from a native country, this may be considered. Further, if you are not teaching English, but rather a specialty that you have experience in but the delivery is in English, then this can be considered, too. The statement of non-criminal record and the degree needs to be notarized and authenticated. Some places also require this for the TEFL certificate. The TEFL certificate needs to be for 120 or more hours and it needs to be issued somewhere even if it was obtained through online courses. The degree can be verified by a division of the Ministry of Education in China. Generally overseas notarization or authentication is valid for 6 months. The verification from the MOE does not expire. The reason that I mention above regarding the position and the employer is because particularly with training centers, but also with some public schools, many of them try to hire teachers under other positions or put them in other companies. Training schools generally don't have the education permits to hire teachers as teachers. This not only could give the teachers a legal problem, it could also give them a problem if they try to change institutions later. As mentioned in one of the comments, generally, internships is not the same as teaching. If one is here as a student (holding an X visa) then they need to meet the requirements of that visa. The internship has to be in a company related to their area of study, and cannot go over a certain number of hours per week, so in rare cases such as with education or related majors could an internship in a school be possible. Internships also don't count toward the two years or more of work experience. Students cannot be paid, but rather reimbursed for certain expenses up to stated maximum limits.

Teaching ESL doesn't usually require a degree but might require a certificate such as TESOL, TEFL or CELTA. Be aware that new visa regulation have recently been implemented in most big Chinese cities which mean that non-native English speakers cannot be hired as ESL teachers - only native speakers are allowed to be granted a legal work visa for such positions. These regulations are regional and may not apply accross all cities in China. ",
