            "answer_text": "As you asked I will answer specifically for England (and, so an extent, Wales and Northern Ireland) because it is very different in Scotland (education was one of a small group of things not included in the 1707 Act of Union, so the Scots education system is totally different). Anyway, at the broadest level, state schools in England are called\u2026 \u201cstate schools\u201d. Never, ever \u201cpublic schools\u201d - a \u201cpublic school\u201d is the very antithesis of a \u201cstate school\u201d. For age purposes, these are divided into \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d, the former for ages 5\u201311, the latter for 11\u201316, though many primaries have \u201cnurseries\u201d which start children as young as 3, and many secondaries have \u201csixth forms\u201d for 16\u201318 year olds. Some areas have \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201cmiddle\u201d schools instead of primaries, and \u201cupper\u201d schools instead of secondaries, for ages 5\u20138, 8\u201313 and 13\u201318, but legally middle schools will be \u201cdeemed\u201d either primary or secondary. You can divide secondaries into two categories - selective and non-selective (or \u201ccomprehensive\u201d), with the former divided into \u201cgrammar\u201d and \u201csecondary modern\u201d. However almost all secondaries are now non-selective, and even some \u201cgrammar schools\u201d are now non-selective. Traditionally (well, since 1944*) schools have also been \u201ccounty\u201d, \u201cvoluntary aided\u201d or \u201cvoluntary controlled\u201d which tends/tended to mean who owned the physical building. County schools were owned by the Local Education Authority (LEA) (normally the county council), while voluntary schools were owned by someone else (most often a church). Of the voluntary schools, in \u201caided\u201d schools the buildings were also maintained by the owners, which gave them all sorts of extra management and curriculum rights, whereas \u201ccontrolled\u201d schools were maintained by the LEA, and had few extra rights. Aided schools also tended to be Roman Catholic, and controlled schools tended to be Church of England, but there are hundreds of exceptions to that. But now it\u2019s not as easy as that as schools now come with a blizzard of different names thanks to a riot of different government initiatives which can make things really, really confusing. For example, many schools are now called \u201cacademies\u201d, which means that are not part of their LEA but financed directly by central government, and are even freer from the rules than Aided schools. In addition some schools now call themselves \u201ccolleges\u201d or \u201ctechnical colleges\u201d or \u201cvillage colleges\u201d or even \u201cuniversity technical colleges\u201d, even (in some cases) if they are just primary schools (which emphasises the meaninglessness of the word \u201ccollege\u201d in England). [*Before 1944 schools tended to be \u201celementary\u201d (for ages 5 to the then school leaving age, 14) or \u201csecondary\u201d, which were in practice almost all selective grammar schools.] ",
