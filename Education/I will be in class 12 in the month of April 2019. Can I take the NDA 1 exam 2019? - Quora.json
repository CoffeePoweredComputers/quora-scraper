            "answer_text": "You can take NDA written exam, but even if you clear it and also clear ssb and also get in the merit list still you cannot join the academy as before joining the academy you would be required to submit 12th class marksheet which you would not be able to produce. If you want to give written for experience then its fine, but ultimately you wont be able to join the academy. Better start preparing from now and give the 2nd NDA of 2019 so that if you clear then you can easily join NDA(which is my dream as well and i am trying to somehow reach to it). All the best for your future, keep the josh high. ",
