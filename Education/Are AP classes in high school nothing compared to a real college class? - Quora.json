            "answer_text": "A real college class is\u2026.. 10x easier. While I am a history major and can\u2019t really speak for most STEM classes (aside from ones which are requirements, like biology), pretty much every basic college gen ed class (which are the ones that your AP exams provide you credit for) are a lot easier than your AP classes in high school, and the material you\u2019ll see on college exams is also a lot easier than the ones you see on AP exams in high school. Essentially, it all boils down to the fact that college courses are shorter, and the sort of professors who teach freshman courses are typically adjuncts (in my experience; also an \u201cadjunct\u201d is a professor who does not work full time at your university, and may work at 2 or 3 schools. Adjuncts in my experience are usually only people with masters degrees, rather than doctorates, which is what most upper division course professors have). In many college courses, your final grade only boils down to a few assignments or a lot of little assignments which don\u2019t really require the level of intense studying that is expected of you in a high school AP course (such as discussion posts) plus perhaps a few tests and/or papers. In your first year of college, you will take a lot of stupidly easy classes, write a lot of fluff-filled discussion posts, and a ton of 3-page papers. Usually the most difficult classes are the ones that cover material that you\u2019re not necessarily super fond of or the ones with professors who attend to act like high school teachers (being overly involved in you and overly critical of your work, despite not really being experts in the field). High school teachers tend to seriously overexaggerate the level of difficulty of college. As long as you show up, do the assignments, and study for any exams you may have, you will find (at least, your first two years) of college to be a pleasant and easy experience. The most difficult part is honestly just showing up, because in college you have so much freedom that it\u2019s difficult to force yourself to be responsible, especially when you\u2019re essentially adulting at 17 or 18 years old with zero parental supervision. My advice concerning AP courses: if I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered with them. Unless your goal is to be the valedictorian or get into Harvard, AP courses don\u2019t really do anything for you that dual enrollment and honors courses can\u2019t do better. If you\u2019re looking to get college credits and graduate with an Associates degree (or almost an associates degree)- which SHOULD be your goal because it will save you money and time (super important especially if you plan on graduate, medical, or law school)- take CLEP exams on your own time and focus on becoming eligible for dual enrollment. CLEP exams provide you college credit for just a 2 hour exam. They\u2019re super easy, and you can even take them for free, using this website, which will send you a CLEP voucher if you study for the exam with them, which is also free: Home - Modern States Dual Enrollment is also something I HIGHLY recommend and wish that I did in high school, because you can actually take real college courses at the same time that you\u2019re graduating with your high school diploma, and your high school will typically even pay for you to do it! If you want the GPA boost that taking advanced classes gives you, focus on taking honors courses (or maybe just a few AP classes that you KNOW you\u2019ll do well in with little stress). It\u2019ll still give you a higher weighted GPA, whilst not taking up all of your time and giving you gray hairs at 15. I really hope that you take this advice to heart, because these are all the things that I wish I could\u2019ve told teenaged me back when I was a freshman in high school. Try to stay low stress, try to save as much money as you possibly can for college (via the ways I\u2019m telling you that you should), and focus on having fun with your friends and doing extra curriculars that will make you look really good on your college applications when the time comes. Good luck!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR: I think nothing is too strong of a word to say that, I\u2019ve skipped a considerable amount of classes through APs, and the classes arent actually harder, or even that big of a leap in work. Every AP is teacher dependent, whether they teach to get you to pass, or they teach to engross you in the material. A real college class is not much harder. Having taken 8 AP classes, using pretty much all the credit in college, I can say that AP classes are not necessarily \u201cnothing\u201d compared to a college equivalent class, they don\u2019t have as clean of an answer as you might think. Since I am primarily studying engineering, the biggest AP classes for me were AP Physics C, AP Calculus BC, and AP Chem, and I think they speak volumes of the value of an AP class. At my high school, physics was taught over 2 years, spending about a year on mechanics, and a little less than a year on E/M. Though yes, we went through a year\u2019s worth of material in nearly 2 years, I still think the rigor of the classes was fair compared as the physics classes right after, which I took in college, weren\u2019t a huge jump in rigor or difficulty. Hell, I studied for my AP exam with college lectures so something must count for that. I will say that my college\u2019s E/M class does stuff on AC signals, though its only a big deal if you do electrical-ish engineering, and even then intro circuits will teach that to you Calculus 1 and 2 (BC) was taught in my high school all in about one year, like most college students learn it. If you can do this test and get a 4 or 5, the next logical classes after are not super difficult. They are a challenge, but still very fair in terms of difficulty. AP Chem is a class that does genuinely prepare you for college, no questions asked. My high school taught it in a year, and frankly that class and that AP exam felt exactly like what my friends were taking in their college freshman year, because it is quite literally Gen chem 1 and gen chem 2. The big thing to realize is that especially in big engineering colleges (specifically Penn State), a lot of people come into engineering but most people don\u2019t make it out of the initial calc and physics, because the schools purposefully make those classes extremely difficult, to weed out students who aren\u2019t cut out for it. The fact is, these classes, at least at Penn State, are not representative of what \u201ccollege math/physics\u201d really looks like. As far as other STEM, they follow similar patterns. AP Biology prepares you for intro Bio well enough, AP Computer science frankly prepares you better than college, etc, etc. Non STEM classes can go either way. Its a lot about absorbing tons of information, processing it, and spitting out quality essay after essay, and from the few non STEM college classes I took, high school prepared me extremely well for that stuff. High school AP classes are nice because its easier to get to know the teacher and have them know you and really learn the topic in as much depth as the teacher wants. As every answer probably says, these are teacher dependent and college dependent. ",

Your college courses count towards meeting your remaining two years of high school, and you still graduate from your home high school, but you may or may not have even set foot in it for two years. So, the moment you graduate from high school, you are a college junior. At my university, I had started a program for gifted high school students (there are others across the US) who entered as full-time residential college students while they were still officially high school juniors. So, after two years, they were awarded high school diplomas, and immediately became college juniors. Some took more courses than required and graduated from high school almost as college seniors. So, they graduated from college at the age of 19 or so! We had one student skip high school entirely and join the university at 13. He graduated from our university at the age of 17, and got his MD at 21! We had another student join us at the age of 11 (he was not residential). These students were among the most active in class and in undergraduate research. Many of them presented at competitive national conferences for college students and held their own with 22 and 23-year olds. Some of them published articles in regular (meaning, not student) journals. We did some amazing things with that program. Students in such programs typically take regular college classes with regular college students. However, they do have separate living arrangements and tight supervision, including curfews.A similar scenario, except that the college program itself awards the high school diploma after two years. In this scenario, you sever your official ties to the high school when you leave after your sophomore year. Students in such programs may have classes taught by college professors but exclusively for the younger students, without regular college students being part of that class.",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on what college you go to and for what. I took AP calculus in high school. AB and BC. I scored a 4 on the exam. I got an A in both semesters without really trying. Now that I\u2019m at NC State, a very good engineering school, I\u2019m taking calculus here and it\u2019s 20x harder than anything I have EVER taken. I made a C- and a D+ in calculus 1 and 2: AFTER taking their equivalent courses just one year previously. I\u2019m in 3 right now and it\u2019s kicking my ass to kingdom come. The depth and difficulty is so much greater than it was in HS, and with less room for error. Getting the right answer in HS by any means necessary will usually net you full credit. I got every answer correct on a calculus 2 test once and scored 71 because I didn\u2019t use the proper work on half the questions (I made assumptions I knew to be correct, but lost credit due to not connecting some topics to bring said assumptions into context. Basically I took shortcuts and paid for it). Now, I also took AP US History. Similar story: 5 on the AP exam and an A in the class. It was challenging but I had an amazing teacher and he kept us engaged. I\u2019m taking a course on Middle Ages history now, and that\u2019s remarkably similar structure wise to what I did in APUSH. Pretty consistent difficulty as well. Also have a great professor as well. So in my experience, College Calculus >>>> AP calculus AP US History ~= College History. At some schools, the ratio is flipped. Others, everything is similar, at other still everything is easier or harder, or some combination of all. ",

            "answer_text": "In the summer after sophomore year, I took a first year calculus class at my local community college to skip to the upper level calculus class at my high school starting the next school year. To me, the the high school class was quite a different level compared to college. For example, the class at school gave a massive amount of worksheets, and was oriented into a group like manner, so there were numerous times in class where problems and worksheets were to be solved in these small groups. The tests were decently challenging and very rarely partial credit was given. Even if you had like four hours of sleep the night before, it wasn\u2019t that hard to stay awake and focused. In college, you pretty much never work with the people around you. The majority of the time is spent listening and taking a very big amount of notes and trying to keep up and stay awake. I took a class that was around two and half hours each session and there were no breaks. Thus, I saw people easily falling asleep. The tests did not have partial credit but if you paid attention to the examples in class, then you would be rewarded. In the end, AP classes are not so much easier (it definitely depends on your school) but college classes are definitely much more challenging in terms of physically and psychologically following along.

            "answer_text": "In my personal experience, AP classes were harder than the actual college class. I've been to 2 different universities, and this opinion still stands. I took AP Us Gov and Pol in 11th grade, and half of AP US History before dropping it, and I also did the summer work for AP English Lit before dropping that the first day of school because I knew I couldn't handle it and would much rather be in the Honors course with a teacher I had before that I liked way more than the AP teacher. AP Gov was hard, but it would have been harder if not for the awesome teacher I had. I passed the exam thanks to his dedication to actually helping us learn the things with tons of evening reviews at local restaurants, and I and a few other students were welcome to eat lunch in his classroom and he'd quiz us during lunch to give us extra help. He really cared about his students doing well and that is what makes a good teacher. APUSH was abysmal for me. I had a job and honors classes to deal with so it just\u2026just didn't work. And I developed a strong disliking for my APUSH teacher over time because she told me that she didn't care that I was the only student that had a job in her class, I was doing poorly and falling asleep and I needed to do something about it or whatever. Never mind the fact that I needed my job\u2026not like I wanted to go to it. I had to. I am so happy I dropped that class. Honestly, my college history classes have been way more interesting and they don't follow some ridiculous schedule making vocab maps and doing FRQ practices (or was it DBQ\u2026BBQ? I don\u2019t even know. Something with a Q!). I was excited to learn more about history. I soon realized learning wasn't the goal. My teacher might argue otherwise, but if you look at it closely, we didn't touch base on anything long enough to actually retain anything about it. The thing with the two classes I was actually in, though, is that they were teaching to a TEST. Not like a regular class in college where you spend 1 semester learning new concepts every week, have a midterm, then eventually a final, and move on. AP Classes are a year long test study. You learn how to take the College Board exam at the end of the year. That is\u2026basically what you do. Yes there's content. But a lot of it is that stupid test. That dumb, dumb, dumb test. And if you get less than a 3, all that hard work was for nothing. I don't know how it is at other schools, but in my experience and in my opinion, AP classes aren't really about learning. They're about learning some content and then learning how to do a test to gamble for some college credit. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience as a student in the 1980s. Calculus I took Calculus AB senior year in high school. I got a B in it. I took the AP test, and scored a 5. Which caused my math teacher to ask why I didn\u2019t have an A in her class. Hey, it was tough! I took Calculus 2 at the University of Virginia, getting a B. I then took Calculus 3, and got an A-. English I actually got an A in AP English my senior year. I then took the AP English test and scored a 3. Hmm\u2026 My second year at UVA, I took Shakespeare in English Lit. I got a B-. I also took Greek Mythology, a lot of reading and writing. I got a C. For me, AP Calculus AB was a truer \u201ccollege\u201d level course. AP English, not so much. Based on other answers here, there does seem to be some dependency on how the teacher approaches the course. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on several factors: what school you go to, classroom sizes, teachers you get, how good the department is. If the school is a lot larger and classroom sizes go from 30 to 100 or 200 or 300 students depending on the course, that means a lot less interaction with the teacher. You probably won\u2019t be able to ask the teacher questions if you don\u2019t understand the material (I\u2019m just guessing it\u2019s what it\u2019s like). My classes have always been capped at 35 so I\u2019ve been lucky and don\u2019t really understand what it\u2019s like to be at a big school. I can say that in terms of work, the work wasn\u2019t much different from HS to college. The main difference was the grading system. In college most classes will be based on 2\u20133 big tests plus a final, and maybe a paper. So for my science classes I had 3 tests plus a final (always), history I had 2 tests, paper and a final, and then for some classes like english, it was 2 page essays written weekly plus 2 7-paper essays. I guess the main thing to consider is for some AP courses, it might be slower paced (if you take AP Calc AB only- that\u2019s a semester\u2019s worth of math spread over a year). But if you have a good AP program it should be about the same depth as a college curriculum. ",

Mathematics in particular is often taught at wildly different levels of challenge. Also, it\u2019s entirely possible to do very well in an AP course and be incredibly unprepared for the exam. AP courses are not nearly as important in life as bright high school students believe. Honestly, I think the world would be better off without them. ",

My AP classes had a lot more higher workload than my major classes have thus far at my university where I have compeleted many of my major courses and have a semester left. For example: AP Gov. in hs was easy but time consuming, I found my high level political science courses to be easier and less workload. So, it kind of depends. In general I found that my workload and homework in general was tougher and more time consuminh in hs than at my college. That being said I go to a medium sized liberal arts university that isn\u2019t really that hard if you put in an effort. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the AP teacher and it depends on the college. On average, I\u2019d say the AP class will definitely be significantly easier due to the slower pace. High school classes are typically a full year and college classes are either in semesters (2 per typical school year) or in quarters (3 per typical school year). However, there are exceptions: Some colleges are not very rigorous. I\u2019ve heard some people say that their college courses were easy due to a fairly rigorous high school curriculum.Some high school AP classes are very rigorous. Some teachers assign extra work or supplement with extra material to beef up the material. In my school, we didn\u2019t take pre-calculus until Junior year. If you wanted to take calculus, you had two options: take calculus AB or go straight to calculus BC. calculus BC is the equivalent of calculus 1 and calculus 2 which does correspond to 2 semesters in college, so the pace was very similar. In addition, we missed 2 weeks in the fall due to a hurricane, so we needed to pick up the pace a bit more in order to be ready for the AP test.",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Are AP classes in high school nothing compared to a real college class? AP classes for the most part are one semester college courses taught over a year by high school teachers. With the exception of AP Calculus BC which is a two semester course covering single variable calculus, AP classes are taught at a slower pace. The difference between colleges is who is teaching the course and who is taking the course. An AP class at top private boarding school like Philip\u2019s is roughly the same as a course at MIT. The same cannot be said for a public high school in a poor school district. The reason I prefer dual enrollment is the courses are taught by experts in the field at a college pace. It is one thing to take a calculus class taught by a high school teacher compared to someone who has a PhD in math. ",

For me, I found the level of difficulty in my classes to be about the same, if not harder, than the classes I'm taking college. For example, I took AP Calc AB and AP Stats. I was blessed to be taught by a state/nationally recognized teacher in high school for calculus. Most of her students routinely scored 5s on the AP test, myself included. Because of how she taught the course, I was very well prepared for my calc classes in college. I'm in calc 3 and probably will end the semester with a solid A. However, I might have had more difficulty if I went to a different school. For Stats, I also had difficulty in high school. My teacher made the class difficult but I came out of it with a solid knowledge of statistics, scoring a 5 on the way out. I'm currently enrolled in Applied Statistics and doing very well (another solid A) as the class feels like a good review to me. ",
