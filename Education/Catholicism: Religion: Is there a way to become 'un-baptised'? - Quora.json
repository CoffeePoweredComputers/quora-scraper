            "answer_text": "I think this is a question that tells more about the asker than he or she intended.  The short answer, as provided quite ably by others, is that there is nothing formal any more, but you might ask your original parish priest if there is anything he can do.  But I would turn the question back to the asker, what is the necessity of such a process? If you are being honest, you cannot pretend it didn't happen, regardless of whether you wanted it or not, or regardless of whether any records of it exist.  This is true of any event in your life, whether you liked it or not. For instance, I personally wish sometimes I'd had a different dad, but I didn't. I can't change my past, but I can change how I let it affect me going forward. But this requires an honest examination of yourself and why you feel so much animosity toward the Catholic Church that you wish to undo something that should have no bearing on your present life.  This is something that all the Quora answers in the world, all the philosophy, all the rationalizations cannot do for you. I wish you well as you seek the answer to what is ailing you. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have a motive other than being \"removed from the list\"? If not, I don't see why this is an important issue for you. Do you really care so much about the false numbers they print? Do you think they make a difference to the world? Governments use census data etc, not figures published by religious organisations, for any policy issues. If I invent a religion right now, and tell you that I've just performed a ceremony to baptise you into my religion, and then I'm going to publish a paper stating that my new religion had two followers, you and me, would you go out of your way to be unbaptised from my religion? Or would you care so little about my religion that you don't believe in equally to Catholicism that you'd probably ignore it? I'd ignore it. If you don't believe in God, you can't believe in the idea that the water you were baptised with is holy. So you're essentially asking for the Catholic Church to strike from the record that a preist washed your forehead as a baby. Who cares? ",

            "answer_text": "It saddens me to hear that but answer your question, there is no way to \"un-baptize\" yourself. Baptism leaves an ontological mark on your soul and thus cannot be undone. That is why you can only be validly baptized once or receive Holy Orders (priesthood, deaconate) and Confirmation once. That said you can formally sever you ties to the Church by writing to the bishop of you diocese or maybe even the priest of your local parish and stating as much. However, if memory serves me correct stating your claim publicly, as you are, may also be \"technically\" enough as the Church counts her members not necessarily by baptismal records but probably by parish registrations and/or a combo of both.  I wish you the best on your journey through life and certainly hope and pray that you reconsider Catholicism. ",
