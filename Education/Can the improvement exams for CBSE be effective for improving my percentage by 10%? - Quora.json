            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know from where this kind of question surface in young minds who are mature enough to take a year drop. CBSE improvement exam is same as your boards exams, everything will be same for a regular student and for you, except the fact that you are getting 1 extra year. So there is possibility of one scoring greater than 95 percent or getting below 50 marks. It just depends on your preparation, If you prepared well then you will score well. Now coming to 10 percent improvement: How can I tell you that\u2019s possible without knowing your percentage. If you already have 90% then 10 percent improvement is impossible as you must be having English in which scoring full isn\u2019t possible. If you\u2019re a student having percentage of 60\u201370 then its very much possible to improve your percentage by 10 percent with slightest of the effort from your side but with the amount of time you have, I would recommend you to aim for 85+%. Sorry for being rude initially but the point is; Everything is possible in this world and the key to convert impossibility to possibility is hard work. You must have watched recent champions trophy in which The Pakistan Team the lowest ranked side won it, they got crushed by India initially but they came back, This time boards may have crushed you but the next time don\u2019t let others tell you that it\u2019s possible or not, let your hard work pave new ways for you.
