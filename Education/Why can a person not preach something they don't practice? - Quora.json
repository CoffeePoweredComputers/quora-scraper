            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to answer this based on Aristotle. That philosopher held that any speaker or teacher had three modes of persuasion: pathos, logos and ethos. Pathos is the emotional argument. A speaker can rile up you emotional connection to their cause through a variety of emotions. Logos is the logical argument. A speaker can attempt to persuade you by carefully laying out a reasoned plan of action. The final mode is ethos which is the presentation and entire being of the person themselves. George Washington speaking for something was enough to move the entire United States to agree (i.e. the new constitution) because his ethos as a person was unparalleled (\u201cfirst in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen\u201d). Of those three modes of argument, ethos is the most important. A person who doesn\u2019t practice what they are preaching, is a person whose ethos contradict any pathos or logos they might use. Their very being says don\u2019t believe a word they say. The simple man of faith using unadorned language and simple argument is often more persuasive than the most polished orator. This is because of ethos. ",

            "answer_text": "Why can a person not preach something they don't practice? Double negatives. So useful. Such clarity. Why can a person stay silent about something they do not do ? Still not getting it. Why can a person avoid talking about something they do not apply ? Sounds better but still not entirely sure I have the meaning. Perhaps if we took out the negatives; Why can a person talk about something they regularly perform ? Buggered if I know. It does not seem likely that there is some intrinsic nature of people that prevents it. For example; \u201cFamily values\u201d politicians are always being caught having affairs outside their marriages. Perhaps the question was more like:- HOW can a person not preach something they don\u2019t practise ? The answer to that is (at one level) simple. People are complicated. Everywhere you look people do the wrong thing for the right reasons and the right thing for the wrong reasons. Almost all of them think they are doing the best they can. ",
