            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t give you that number but I\u2019ve seen analysis done by class rank and teachers are clearly not from the top ranks. First, that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s difficult to relate across standard deviations (IQ) to understand how difficulties appear in other people\u2019s understanding of what you\u2019re explaining! You don\u2019t necessarily want the very brightest people teaching average people. Second, it\u2019s an indicator of how desirable the job is. Let\u2019s call it: the job generally sucks. It\u2019s low pay, low prestige, high responsibilities and unstable nature means only some sort of highly motivated, high ideals kind of person would walk that road. So teachers are not, on the whole, the best and brightest, so what? They are often really fine people doing a really tough job. They deserve your respect. They earned their degree, they earned additional credits through training and often this leads to a masters degree. They are a long way from average! They are on your side, trying to teach what they really Do know. Thank them profusely or see them disappear leaving you with who or what\u2026a viewing screen? IQ is not nearly as important or critical as people make it out to be. Hard work wins out. Teachers are hard working people! I understand the question seemed a simple one but it indicates in its simplicity a misplaced faith in a single measurement. I\u2019ve tried to satisfy your curiosity while giving you a answer suitable to a poorly understood context. I\u2019m trying to teach :-) ",

            "answer_text": "I think my IQ was 165 while the normal ranged between 85\u2013115. I was first a child who went to school, then to the Army and ended up taking more than 120 courses while earning 2 bachelors, 2 masters and a DD. I worked in Compton where 85% of elementary teachers were black females who didn\u2019t speak with correct subject verb agreement, ie, \u201cI be going\u201d so I would say on a racially-biased IQ test they would be on the low end of 85. However, seeing that their students were primarily blacks and Hispanics it took more of nurturing than IQ to motivate the students to learn, therefore I would say IQ is not a factor of being a teacher. As a matter of fact I think it might\u2019ve been detrimental for me as I had ideas on how to improve the system and how to make it more cost effective; BA-Accounting and MBA. Something Compton didn\u2019t want as they were $40 million in the hole which was supposed to be impossible. ",
