            "answer_text": "Learning light need not be bright but be eternal. In my view, we can learn by 2 ways: 1.Learn from others A real learner is never biased with the source of learning. To be more clear, real learner learns from the people around her/him irrespective of their position. And a real learner has a quest to learn. 2.Learn by yourself In my belief, a person learns the most from his/her experiences rather mistakes. And beliefs are built on your experiences. Trying new things will create new experiences and of course will add to your learnings. ",
