A general comment about studying. Learn to study smart. Not hard. In other words \u201cIt\u2019s not the hours you put in. It\u2019s what you put in the hours.\u201d I know. That\u2019s corny. But true. Fact is, what works for one person won\u2019t necessarily work for another. Some people have to hear the material spoken aloud. Others have to write it down. Still others have to move around (I may well have worn a groove in the floor of the Math Building studying for my PhD comprehensives). Others have to be doing something with their hands (one of my daughter\u2019s high school teachers used to give out squares of that blue sticky putty that you use to stick posters on the wall - that way the kids who had a compulsive need to be doing something ith their hands could squeeze that and not bother anyone else). Some need dead silence. Others want music playing in the background. Some need \u2026 Figure out what works for you. And I don\u2019t care if your mother is a teacher - just because it worked for her or it\u2019s what she was told in teachers\u2019 college it won\u2019t necessarily work for you. And be sure to use all the resources available to you. Don\u2019t hesitate to speak to your teachers. If your school has some sort of \u201cacademic assistance\u201d or a \u201cdrop in center\u201d be sure to use that. (Those are both terms I\u2019ve seen applied to a classroom staffed by a rotating slate of teachers who are there to help you with problems you may be having. Both my kids\u2019 schools had variants on this. Fact is, the math departments of the universities I attended (as both an undergrad and grad student) had the same thing - they were just staffed with grad students.) I\u2019ll close with one very important point. There is no such thing as a dumb question. I repeat: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DUMB QUESTION! If you are having trouble understanding something that the teacher it\u2019s pretty much a given that half the rest of the class is in the same boat. I know that when I used to teach first year university calculus and started to see blank looks I\u2019d ask \u201cWho doesn\u2019t understand?\u201d and maybe two or three hands would go up. However, if I asked \u201cWho does understand?\u201d at most half a dozen hands went up. So don\u2019t be embarrassed to ask the question. ",

            "answer_text": "If I had to provide just one piece of advice on how to get better grades, it would be this: Review your notes every night. Within 20 minutes of a lecture, most students forget almost 50 perfect of the information they have written down. After 2 days, that number goes over 50 percent. Just attending a lecture and taking notes is not enough to say that you have truly learnt something. To truly learn something, you must go over the material several times so that it actually sticks in your mind. Therefore, the best way to increase your grades is to go over all your notes from every class, every night. This doesn\u2019t have to be more than 10 minutes per class or more than 1 hour total. However, the small amount of time allocated for every class will double your retention so that you know all of the information for any assignment that you may be graded on. This is what the APA says: As soon as you can after class, do what Elliot Aronson (2010) did. Having done poorly on his midterms, thanks to his lousy note taking, he came up with a new strategy: \u201cAt the end of every class, I would find a little nook \u2014 sometimes even the nearest stairwell \u2014 read over my scribbled notes, and neatly summarize them in a page or two. At the end of the semester, when it was time to prepare for the final, my notes described the heart of the course. More than that: They revealed the scope and pattern of the professor\u2019s thinking and the way the lectures dovetailed with the readings. I had taken the first step toward mastering the art of getting to the essence of a topic... I found I was also learning to love to learn, and, perhaps most important, I was learning to think critically and challenge unsubstantiated assertions. For the first time in my life I understood what it was to be a student.\u201d[1] Reviewing your notes ensures that you can recall the material later when it counts.
