            "answer_text": "Unlike many other majors, you generally don't study philosophy just for a job. Studying philosophy can greatly improve your critical thinking skills and writing. 1) Not definitely, but lecturers provide a great deal of information and experience. Having studied these matters closely for years, they provide a perspective that is invaluable. I spent several years reading philosophy before I began a formal education in it. I definitely learned a lot with some guidance and perspective. Everybody learns a little differently, of course. 2) Philosophy is sometimes subjective, sometimes not. You'll even study the difference between subjectivity and objectivity and argue over whether or not one or the other really exists. But philosophy is usually about finding the truth of things, and usually has the assumption that there really is truth out there. You can't just say whatever you believe and stick to it. Philosophy requires open inquiry and challenge to one's own perspective. Of course, topics like ethics tend to be more subjective, since it's difficult to find a philosophically secure foundation for ethical beliefs. Logic, on the other hand, studies the principles of reasoning itself, and is generally not thought to be subjective -- at least at the undergraduate level. 3) If we're talking about a whole program, the course of study in philosophy usually starts with a critical thinking course, then moves on to the study of specific periods of philosophy: ancient, medieval, modern (enlightenment-era), and then on to 19th-20th century and contemporary continental and analytic philosophy. You'll also take introductory courses in ethics and logic. With a bit of understanding of the key thinkers and the development of philosophy, typically then you start to study specific thinkers in an entire course, or specific topics such as Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Law, Philosophy of Religion, and so forth. 4) The typical joke is that there are no jobs for philosophers. That's not entirely true, but there are few. If your main goal is to study and later teach philosophy, then it's on to graduate school for a Master's and a Ph.D., followed by further study and lots of rejection. But that's not the only course. I have several friends who now work in government after finishing their degrees. Philosophy is an excellent undergraduate degree to take before law school, both in the way it prepares you and in the way it is viewed. Some jobs are available in government and private companies for specialists in ethics. If you're looking in to getting into politics, a philosophy degree is an asset as well.  Many people get jobs that are nowhere near philosophy afterwards. Alex Trebek has a degree in philosophy, for example. The study of philosophy is more about improving your own understanding and thinking, and rounding you as a purpose than teaching you specific career skills. I think everyone should take some philosophy, beyond a simple first-year course, in their undergraduate degree. If you really enjoy that, it may be a good choice of major. If you're just looking for a clear career path in a highly sought-after field, it might not be for you. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many reasons. i am going to list out a few of them: 1. To become a better thinker and reasoner. Once you\u2019ve mastered basic principles of logic you will be able to recognize an argument when you see one\u2014not in the sense of disagreement but whether sound reasons are being offered for some claim. You will learn to figure out pretty quickly when someone is trying to sell you a bill of goods. You\u2019ll know what fallacies are and be able to spot one. You\u2019ll see through people\u2019s stated views to their unstated assumptions. You\u2019ll note, finally, when someone doesn\u2019t care what is true at all and is just jerking your chain. You can avoid them. 2. To understand the influential political tendencies of our time, whether of the so-called Right or the so-called Left. You\u2019ll be able to trace them to their origins, where you\u2019ll find major political philosophers such as Leo Strauss (in the case of the so-called Right) or Herbert Marcuse (in the case of the so-called Left)\u2013or perhaps Saul Alinsky, whose well-known tactics can be used by either Right or Left, because they are so effective on unprepared minds not schooled in logical reasoning. 3. To be able to articulate what your values are, and why you believe what you believe. In other words, to begin to put together your soundest arguments on what you care about\u2014scientific, moral, political, or otherwise. 4. To think really well about whether you should believe in a God or Supreme Being, and why\u2014based on the efforts and failures of the great philosophers who have addressed the question. 5. To articulate your worldview: your most basic beliefs about what kind of world this is, including how or whether a God fits into your particular answers, and what is of greatest value in life or most worth pursuing. 6. To gain patience and appreciate the need for attention to details. The great works of philosophy\u2014from Plato down through Kant and Sartre\u2014are difficult but not impossible to understand. By reading with a pen (or highlighter or the electronic equivalent) you\u2019ll master the details of complex reasoning and have a sense of accomplishment: not to mention being better at all of (1) through (5) above. And this is a skill transferable to a lot of other endeavors, obviously. 7. To improve the health of your brain, especially if you are older. The use of your brain to set goals, work out strategies to achieve them, solve problems that come along the way, tackle new tasks (learning a new language or mastering a philosophical topic) is a known guard against Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of late-life mental deterioration. Intellectual challenges are everywhere. Make use of them. 8. To guide us into the future. We live in an incipient global civilization now. Technology is the reason. We all know this. At present, though, we\u2019re still a bit bewildered by it. Some understandably fear a coming \u2018new world order.\u2019 But global civilization doesn\u2019t have to be a top-down affair, dominated by a \u2018one percent.\u2019 We can build it from the bottom up\u2014by assuming ownership of it, having assumed responsibility for our lives, our families, our educations, our communities, our nations. This is a daunting task. It may put our values to test. On the basis of new evidence and new perspectives, we may want to change some of them. We may have to cease making money the central concern of our lives. Then what? We start to value the people in our lives for who they are, and the experiences we have for what they teach. We\u2019re on a journey. Let\u2019s enjoy it. 9. To appreciate the central fact of the human condition: mortality. Our days are numbered, and the clock is ticking. We don\u2019t know when the sand in our hourglass will run out, but know this: nothing entitles anyone to a given number of days. Realize this, and you see the need to make each day count. You\u2019ll understand the reason for cherished time spent with elderly parents: they won\u2019t be here forever. You\u2019ll value the moments in your lives, whether alone (giving you time to read or meditate) or with family and friends. Because in the final analysis, these are the things we know for sure we have. You\u2019ll recognize that we have to care for one another\u2014strangers, too (including the homeless man in the street); animals as well; the planet itself (it\u2019s the only one we have). This is a process\u2014that of gaining wisdom, knowing what we don\u2019t know and valuing the time we have. That was the original, etymological meaning of philosophy: the love of wisdom.
