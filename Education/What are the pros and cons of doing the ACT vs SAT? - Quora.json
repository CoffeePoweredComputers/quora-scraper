            "answer_text": "The tests are fairly similar. You\u2019ve just got to decide which one fits your testing style and go with it. These are a few of the pros and cons that I have found to be true regarding the ACT vs SAT. Pros: You can use a calculator on ALL the math questions, not just the designated section on the SAT. You may find the vocabulary seems easier to you. The SAT has more challenging vocabulary on both the reading and writing sections. If you enjoy science and score well in that section, it is weighted the same as the other sections and could help your score. Cons: There are more questions. There are 215 ACT questions and 154 SAT questions. Time crunch. If you don\u2019t do well when faced with time limits, you probably want to take the SAT. If you struggle with geometry, the ACT has three times as many geometry questions. You are also not given a formula chart like the SAT does. You can always do some practice questions for each of the exams and get a feel for the different types of questions. You\u2019ll probably be able to tell which one you like best. Or join half of all students and take both exams and see which one you get a higher score. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You have less time per question on the ACT. The ACT has four sections, not two like the SAT. If you are not strong in Math, for instance, it is only 1/4 of your score, not 1/2 like the SAT. And the Science section of the ACT should not be that difficult if you can read charts pretty well. Contrary to Susan\u2019s answer, the ACT is as preferred as the SAT. The SAT people set up shop in Iowa City and seemed to clone some of the stuff from the ACT as the ACT has become more prevalent than the SAT. ",
