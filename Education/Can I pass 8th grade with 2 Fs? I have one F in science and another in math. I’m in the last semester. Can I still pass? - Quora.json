            "answer_text": "I hate to sugarcoat the truth but most likely not. To make matters worse, you may not be able to graduate from junior high school. I know you would be cursing at me and the entire world and stomping your feet and so forth. Reality has given you a knockout punch in the face. Anyway, I digress. Here are three tastes for the bitter truth: Let us just admit that you are a poor test taker (includes quizzes, and other exams). You did very well or excellently on HWs and/or classwork. You put your whole mind, heart, and soul into studying but you still failed. Well, we can all relate to that. Even I have been in those shoes numerous times.In this case, YOU NEED TO OPEN YOUR INNER SHELL AND ASK FOR HELP!!! Admit to your parents, \u201cI HAVE FAILED ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TESTS OR EVERYONE. I LET YOU DOWN! NOW I AM BEGGING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS. PLEASE HELP ME!!!\u201d Go attend tutoring. During class, ASK QUESTIONS!!! DON\u2019T ASK SOMETHING OBVIOUS BUT SOMETHING CRITICAL!!! Think before you speak! That\u2019s how we learn.You are in the \u201cpretend world\u201d. You go, \u201cWTF does that mean?\u201dSimply put:In your room and behind closed doors, you are playing video games.Parents ask you, \u201cWhat are you doing, son or honey?\u201d You say, \u201cI AM F@#$KING BUSY!!! I AM DOING HOMEWORK!!!\u201d Actually, you are hammering away on your Xbox.You stay in school late, pretending to study with friends. Actually, hammering away on computer games.Go to a friend's house to \u201cstudy\u201d, you and your friend outside playing basketball.Got a test on Monday, all weekend in bed, and on your phone. Did absolutely no HW nor any studying.A popular one: Friday night. You know you got big on Monday. You think, \u201cI\u2019ll study before the test. I\u2019ll be fine \u2026\u201d You spend the weekend playing with your lover.Another popular one: Friday night. Spend the weekend getting drunk.I mean, I could go and on. I know all you get the point I\u2019m trying to make here. You simply don\u2019t do any studying whatsoever. After school, instead of going to do HW, you go party with friends. You did for the entire year, what do you think the outcome would be? Fail the grade. Your teachers don\u2019t know what you do outside of school but what they do know is that you fail EVERYTHING and you do a sloppy job on the HW or don\u2019t even do it. In that case, you deserve to not only repeat that grade but a horrendous thrashing from your parents. You have failed your parents who have expected you to graduate from junior high school and get into an excellent high school and moreover an excellent college. You\u2019ve just destroyed their dream. You may say, \u201cF my parents and their dream.\u201d Well, what about YOUR life? When you are approaching 40, what are you going to do? Go back to school, not quite feasible. It is time to wake up and get yourself together.You\u2019ve failed your major subjects. Science and math along with English and Social Studies weigh more than art and Phys. ed.With all that being said, see which scenario fits you and act upon the advice given. Couple more advice: DON\u2019T HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS!!! AVOID OBVIOUS QUESTIONS BUT ASK SOMETHING THAT IS CRITICAL!ATTEND TUTORING!!! DON\u2019T BE SHY!!! WE ARE NOT PERFECT BEINGS!!! People are willing to help you. That\u2019s only possible if you ask for it.Visit your teachers outside their teaching time. Have a one to one conversation with them. It will help build your connection with them and when you need a grade booster, that connection will be valuable. BEWARE: THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU DO ALL THE HWs/CLASSWORKS/ASK QUESTIONS/GO TO TUTORING AND IF YOU GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE TEACHER IS DOING IN THE CLASS!!!Hope it helps! Sam ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Relax! Most U.S. public schools practice social promotion, so you could fail all of your classes and still be elevated to your Freshman year. However, there is no reason a student of average intelligence in an ordinary public middle school to fail any class. Students who complete some assignments, pass some of the tests, and not make trouble for staff easily earn respectable grades. At high school, you must earn a prescribed number of credits and at least pass the required classes to graduate. Start working on your new approach to improving your academic performance now! Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",

Sadly, in my experience is that 8th graders almost always get moved on to the next level, especially if it is a new school. When I ran a middle school for expelled students, we had students who had been put out of school and then referred to us too late to pass anything. The principals always sent therm on to high school because they were done with them \u2014 not because it was good for the student. ",

We do not know the requirements to pass the grade, we do not know what other classes you have passed or failed, and we do not know what other options you would have. I would say though, if it is truly only two classes that you are not passing, maybe you have a chance to make them up during summer. But I do not think anyone on quora can give a concrete answer. ",

Take this seriously, and repeat the classes, not just to pass, but because you definitely need this knowledge. ",
