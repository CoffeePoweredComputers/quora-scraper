            "answer_text": "So first question we should ask ourselves is whether we are talking about modern combinatorics with all the fancy terms, or just it\u2019s uses in \u201creal\u201d life? As we know, combinatorics is often thought to originate from XVII Century with French mathematicians who first developed probability theory - Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. With first insurance houses and games of luck, starting to describe \u201cchances\u201d became really important. Ok, so we use combinatorics in statistics and probability, but is that it? Of course not! If we go back in time to Ancient China, around XIII Century B.C. , we would come across a writing which says that everything in the world is separated in 2 genders. Let\u2019s mark M as male and F as female. Further it explains that if we compare 2 things, there are 4 possible solutions: MM, MF, FM, FF. When comparing 3 things, there are 8 possible solutions, and so on\u2026 So it describes idea that each time you add another element, there is 2 times more cases. In writing \u201cZhe-Khim\u201d was written a story about Imperator \u201cIju\u201d. At the moment of the story, Iju has been alive for over 4000 years. China was in grave danger from floods, so Iju took a walk beside a river thinking about how to stop it from flooding. At that moment he saw a turtle that had weird drawing on it\u2019s shell:  When he wrote numbers instead of dots, he came up with the first \u201cmagical square\u201d (try to see it for yourself ^^). Then he opened a map and marked those points on it. He invested into flood defenses in proportion to the drawing, and he never had troubles with floods again. From that moment, the turtle became \u201cHoly\u201d, and was referred to as The Savior. After that people all over the China started searching for other \u201cMagical Squares\u201d. Okay, that\u2019s a nice story, but it has nothing to do with my question, right? - Nope! You asked for uses of combinatorics in \u201creal life\u201d, and we only came to the Ancient Greece. Finally we meet with some concrete calculations on this topic. Philosoph \u201cKsepokrat\u201d tried to count syllables in IV C. BC. In III C. BC. \u201cHrisipi\u201d was sure that number of sentences made from 10 axioms is over 1 million. Gipnarh thought that from same number of axioms, we cant form even 103 049 combinacions, where when adding odious sentences, that number rises to 310 952. Many more philosophers tried to count possible events. So we come to the conclusion that Greeks thought that combinatorics is very important. Back to the question: Where do we use it TODAY? So lets write some examples where we use it: Statistics and Probability, in Languages (for example when counting syllables), Molecular Biology ( patterns of atoms and DNA for example), Computer Science ( Networks, Cryptography, Databases, different simulations), and many, many more. I hope you find your answer in this post, and i apologize for names of mathematicians, as it\u2019s very hard to translate them from my native language. ",

            "answer_text": "We never asked these questions when we were learning Maths. It is important to understand Maths in its entirety and have belief that the topics are useful in various ways. The more you learn, better you can see the world. Better you understand the world. Suppose you have a fixed set of digits for the product code, and want a sale in excess of 5 lakhs but less than 20 lakhs. Then you can put it in the equation, 5 lakhs < n! < 20 lakhs. You can solve for n (using computers) and find the value of n. This value of n is available due to knowledge of combinatorics. The bar code you see on the products are also examples of permutations and combinations. So many such possibilities are there with a bar code that every human on earth can be easily reached. Rest assured, Mathematics is not irrelevant. Certainly not the Maths you study till graduation. ",
