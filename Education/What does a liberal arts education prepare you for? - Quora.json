            "answer_text": "There are two ways I can answer this question: one in a broad explanation, the other is a working list of jobs you can do with a liberal arts education, or liberal arts as a foundation to a masters/ PhD program. Liberal arts education teaches you critical thinking, how to read, write, and interpret what is in front of you to form some form of judgement. Apply this when selling yourself on the job market. As for a working list of careers you could do aside from menial jobs that do not require specialized education, here is a short and incomplete list: Teacher, lawyer, journalist, professor, clinical psychologist, social worker, priest/minister, ESL teacher, medicine, counselor, life coach, non-profit organization, policy developer, nursing home director, etc. Most of these career require a lot of additional education or have more than one way to obtain the educational requirements. For example a nursing home director could be an RN, however a liberal arts education in gerontology and a masters in gerontology would also give you qualifications. Non-profit sectors may hire gender studies graduates, or social workers to help run their organisations (e.g. shelters, food banks, mental health services). Teachers require any bachelor degree prior to getting a bachelor of education. The list can go on because I honestly do not know every single job that people fill out there. Many government jobs may take a person with a degree over someone without a degree. Liberal arts in particular teaches you about reading, writing, and how to think about things. For those who are not convinced about the value of a liberal arts education (economically and personally), I recommend you read the works of Alain de Botton (I know the philosophy kids are groaning). However de Botton has good insights on liberal arts education. We often study subjects in the humanities (e.g. history, philosophy, or literature) and are unsure how we can get paid to watch films, write essays, or read books. De Botton states that we simply have not figured out what we can use arts and culture for. If you visit his youtube channel, \u2018School of Life\u2019, search for the video about liberal arts graduates. He offers some great insights, consoles us, and tells us the good news about those who struggle with finding their way in the world with this wonderful education. ",

            "answer_text": "I would tell you that a liberal arts degree proceeds from the more traditional and older university offerings from Medieval Europe or that period where they offered scholastic studies in the liberal arts, preparation for theology, and studied in Classical Latin. You are preparing a college education that proceeds from K-12, is much more academic, studies various subjects of knowledge, and have a trade, occupation, or profession as a secondary concern. It is straight forward to see that liberal arts degrees who complete teaching credentials are the most qualified to teach the multiple subjects in elementary school, where pupils are learning how to think, how to distinguish subjects, and what their freedoms and rights are in a developed society. Many subjects in liberal arts are academic and not business or trade or professional at all, but focused even on arts and music, as well as pure sciences or social studies. I would say that if you want to prepare for a job, you can do that with internships, work experiences, or mentorships at companies that offer a business that produces goods and services in a market of exchange. You can learn what a professional does, how they apply their education, and what their market value is among all professionals, trades people, or employees of various businesses. This applies also to public service people who work in government, offer public resources and utilities, and maintain the working state. I would say that jobs can be classified into those groups and 1 more, and that pretty much outlines societal profession as we know it. They are working in a business, for government, or a non-profit organization or foundation. A school or university in that regard can be classified into a business, government, or non-profit based upon its founding grant, endowment, and how it maintains a financially solvent institution. ",
