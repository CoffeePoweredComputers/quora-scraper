            "answer_text": "The hard way. I kept throwing all my receipts in an envelope thinking I\u2019d get around to it later. Only \u201clater\u201d never happened and by then it was too late; so, suddenly, it became extension time and I finally got serious. I was just (still am) a lowly shlub in 1976 with a four-plex and a grunt job for the above so it\u2019s not like I needed a tax lawyer; although someone with a modicum of experience would have been beneficial to keep me for depreciating a $10 item over 7 years using sum-of-the-year-digits. Seriously. I still rationalize that extravagance as being how I taught myself basic accounting. But I didn\u2019t get good at it until LOTUS 123 entered my life (198x.) I sold my four-plex in 1983 and bought a a second or third tier mansion in a previous life which morphed in the 60\u2019s into a 3 floor, 3 kitchen, 4 bathroom, 10 room, 17 bed rooming house and this was when I found out about LOTUS 123. Without LOTUS 123 I would never have been able to keep track of the whole mess. With it, every transaction\u2014cash in, out, or accrual\u2014was recorded using double-entry accounting. One year I used a macro I wrote to meticulously kept track of how long it took me to record every accounting entry. The next year I purposely as an experiment went back to throwing everything in an envelope and then doing it all at once; again keeping track of how much time it took me. Wait for it. 40 hours, either way. Longer than necessary surely; but I was really anal about using LOTUS. A couple of years later my record for actual finalizing and mailing in my taxes was maybe four hours spread over two days because I did such a nice job of separating and categorizing each transaction. The hard part was depreciation. But, damn, my ledger entries and journals were PRETTY. Long story short, I sold my student rental in 1993 and I needed a CPA to sort out how much my net operating loss was over those 11 years. When he saw my LOTUS 123 ledgers and journals he broke out in one of the biggest grins I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cThis will be easy,\u201d he said. I didn\u2019t grin nearly as much when I found out that despite my best efforts I still came in down $9000. Fast forward to 2001 with my broker losing $350,000 in unrealized capital gains in the dot-com meltdown because he knew how to buy but didn\u2019t have a clue about selling in a down market. Back to the CPA again and I haven\u2019t filled out my finalized taxes since. It is cheaper to pay my CPA to handle my Schedule D for 2001 (and the ensuing drawn out trickle down of writing off those stock losses) than it would be to visit a psychologist to keep repairing the damage that would be done if I were forced every year to revisit my inability to know the difference between a genius stock picker and a roaring bull market. Now I have a duplex. I keep track of the ledger entries; transfer everything to the appropriate journals; dummy up my 1040 and Schedule E as best I understand it; turn it all over to my CPA; and I forget about it. He handles all the depreciation. Peace of mind at last for only $200 a year. ",

            "answer_text": "Like Jessica Gray, I have filed my own taxes every year since I first had a job. The basic design of the forms tends to stay the same over the years, so you get used to them. I had an income tax class in law school, where some of the general principles of interpretation were discussed. I also had a class in basic accounting in undergraduate school, though I don\u2019t keep books in quite the same form. But mostly I figure my taxes using the instructions to the relevant forms that are provided by the IRS. They\u2019re pretty comprehensive, they\u2019re all easily accessible on the IRS\u2019 web site, and for me they\u2019ve been more than adequate. (Except the ones for Form 4562. Form 4562 is the tenth circle of Hell.) There are also \u201cIRS Publications\u201d that give pointers on more complex topics, and if worse comes to worst, I\u2019ll break out the regulations and read those. That\u2019s quite rare for my own tax return, but occasionally I encounter a client who needs some direction with regard to a strange issue. If I had something more complicated than a sole proprietorship where I use a straight-up cash accounting method, I might seek the assistance of someone who is in fact an expert in the matter. ",

            "answer_text": "On a Monday morning in March 1971, Mr. Lechowicz, my Eight Grade mathematics teacher, distributed copies of the IRS 1040 instruction book, blank Federal 1040 Forms from that year, and a mimeographed fact sheet of his financial particulars. A packet was handed out to each of the 28 students in the class. Our homework, his prepared return, was due that Friday. No classroom instruction. It\u2019s just a big word problem, folks. A typical American do-it-yourselfer tiptoes into the intricacies of the tax code over many years. There\u2019s not a whole lot to deal with the extent of your finances is a summer job stocking shelves in a grocery store or washing dishes at a restaurant. The fact that the first few sentences about things like \u201cS-Corporations\u201d seems utterly opaque is your assurance that the line does not apply. If some of the wording of a line-by-line instruction seems to make it possible it applies to you, then read the paragraph. Yes, sometimes you need to jump to another form. But back in the day, that meant a trip to the post office or library with the racks of forms and instruction booklets they put out every winter. Now they are all PDF\u2019s online. The extra forms and schedules take years to accumulate. Save your work from prior years. I recommend a high-level functional read-through of the Form 1040 and key schedules, and review of the instruction booklet before using tax preparation software. Definitely check the first part of the instructions that provide an overview and highlight the changes from the prior year. Major newspapers, those primitive paper and ink website mock-ups, also run a multi-page walk-through of the major forms and schedules, every spring. ",

But this was pretty simple, as they were wage earners with the most common deductions -- home mortgage, property tax, charitable contributions. I've read over instructions for forms I didn't need but was curious about, most notably schedules C, D, and SE. The instructions around depreciation and cost of goods sold, I am sure I would have to read much more closely if I found myself in a position where I needed to file information about those. In more recent years I have on occasion needed a schedule D, but I don't worry about it any more, software does it for me. ",

I did that for a few years but then finally fired them. Why? Because they basically were just using the same tax software everyone else does. Even worse, they would call and ask me specific questions even though they had complete access to my books as well as my personal financial information. I took them back and have handled them ever since. The last couple of years have been a but complicated because we my wife had a salaried position, a sole proprietorship, and I had a salary as well as pass through income from my business. I am also filing corporate taxes. It takes about 10 hours each year for both returns. Most if that is looking up information and double checking. I will say without the web I would not attempt it.

For corporate taxes, I learned from the CPA that did those taxes - compiling schedules, verifying estimates (annual asset valuations), obtaining needed forms from relevant investment brokerages, and accounting basically for every single penny that the business spent (this mostly happens throughout the year, otherwise it\u2019s just one daunting task that can take weeks). Once all the books are in order and all accounts are reconciled, it\u2019s just a matter of plugging numbers in and checking that there are receipts to substantiate transactions.Well, that and my love of accounting - and special care towards keeping it all in order (I love details and reconciliations, you know).

Articles published can give the lay person a decent overview and understanding of taxes without having to spend the new five years of your life reading about specifics that don\u2019t really apply to you. I\u2019d also recommend trying to get an overview about the different types of taxes which may include things like: personal income taxes (federal and state)sales and use taxesproperty taxespayroll related taxesretirement related taxes (medicare and FICA)business related taxesexcise taxesfranchise taxesOne you\u2019ve found an area that interest you, you can always dig further into finding out more and, in the extreme, reading the tax code itself. Good luck with your studies. ",
