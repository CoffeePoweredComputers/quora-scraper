I used to be able to play video games with much more concentration and skill but now I just can't concentrate, and they just don't seem as fun as they used to be\u2026 I just got battlefield 1 and I got my first windows laptop (I used mac) this year, but it just doesn't seem fun. Why you cannot concentrate? probably Battlefield 1 Isn\u2019t a great game plus the laptop experience kinda sucks for the price you get, only real advantages is alot less space and more mobility for much weaker compartments you could\u2019ve bought an actual setup not to mention the laptop keyboard is un-intuitive and will require a mechanical keyboard for responsive precision. Maybe it is a deeper issue you are unaware of, despite that paragraph of info in the comments which isn\u2019t allowed but I won\u2019t snitch on Quora, hope they don\u2019t find that, but yea deeper issue not enough information so I\u2019m going to guesstimate probably bothered by studies, responsibilities of being a teenager or olde, hormonal changes, real life changes in general, not feeling appreciated, lack of common friends, lack of best friend, shitty mom, shitty dad, that\u2019s all I got for now, gotta go outside, Chao.

            "answer_text": "Most video games are well designed to capture and keep your attention. If you\u2019re having a hard time concentrating, it\u2019s because your mind really wants to think about something else. Next time you\u2019re playing and you find yourself distracted, ask any or all of the following questions: What thoughts are coming?How do I feel physically?What emotions am I having?What is happening in my physical environment?What just happened in the video game?Take a pause from the game, as soon as you can, to answer these questions. Bonus points for writing about them. Repeat this cycle a few times, until you see a pattern in your thoughts, feelings, environment, or game interactions. Whatever that pattern is, that\u2019s your major distraction. When you identify it, you can start to examine where it\u2019s coming from. You can see what triggers it, and if it occurs in other areas of your life. And then, if you like you can make a change. Remove things that trigger distraction, practice reacting differently to the triggers, or having a different attitude. Maybe decide that this \u201cdistraction\u201d is interesting enough in its own right that you plan time to think or deal with it for its own sake. Or just, notice that you get distracted by that thing and let it be. And for any who get distracting during other activities, you can use pretty much the same process. This is based on mindfulness and self-reflection practices, and it\u2019s powerful stuff. If you start practicing it (even just while playing video games), it can change your life. ",
