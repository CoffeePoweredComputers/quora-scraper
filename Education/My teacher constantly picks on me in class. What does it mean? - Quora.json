            "answer_text": "Whatever his intentions are, they are not good, especially since you specifically asked him to stop. Either he is trying to flirt with you, which is not at all ethical for a teacher, or just really likes to tease you because \u201cit\u2019s just kind of funny\u201d, which is a form of bullying, if not harassment, however he masks it. To make sure the school will act on this, talk to your parents and have at least one of them to accompany you to school and speak with the guidance counselor, if not the principal already. What your teacher is doing is really wrong behavior and uncalled for. Do you have a classmate or friend that will be willing to testify for you? If so, better have him/her on your side in case they ask you for any witness. ",

Whatever his intentions are - you feel picked upon - and don't know why a teacher would be engaging in such behavior - and his explanation was that he finds it amusing.There's nothing healthy there - go to a guidance counselor and get some help in moving this teacher toward establishing a productive, working relationship with you.
