            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a cultural anthropologist that\u2019s been working in the field of Design Research for about 18 years. As far as I can tell \u201cDesign Anthropology\u201d is largely the umbrella term anthropologists use to describe work in two main areas: 1.) The anthropological study of design as a cultural process and category. 2.) The leveraging of anthropological and other social science methods (Ethnography, interviews, projective methods, surveys, diaries) to help inform the innovation and refinement of designs in different public and private contexts (Technology, healthcare, education, etc.) The first category tends to be more closely aligned with academia. Here you will find people bringing theoretical and analytical perspectives to design culture. An example of this would be Keith Murphy\u2019s study of Swedish Design Culture at Ikea: Swedish Design: An Ethnography (Expertise: Cultures and Technologies of Knowledge) by Keith M. Murphy The latter category tends to be MA or Ph.D. trained anthropologists who have left academia and work as practicing anthropologists in the public or private sector. Here they apply a variety of methods, and sometimes theory, to inform and inspire designers. A variety of publications on this topic are attempting to unpack this field by providing theoretically informed case studies. Examples include: Design Anthropology: Theory and Practice by Wendy Gunn (Editor), Ton Otto (Editor), Rachel Charlotte Smith (Editor) and Handbook of Anthropology in Business 1st Edition by Rita M Denny (Editor), Patricia L Sunderland (Editor) The Epic Conference on Ethnography in Industry is a major networking space for this type of work, and other conferences continue to emerge. EPIC - Advancing the Value of Ethnography in Industry There still seems to be somewhat of a wall between category 1 and 2 above, but I think that will change as Academic opportunities shift, and more people in category 2 publish about their experiences. I would say that Design Anthropology is still an emergent subdiscipline of the larger field of anthropology, but also one of the more innovative and exciting spaces to be an anthropologist. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a cultural anthropologist who has done some design research projects, not a design anthropologist. (I am, however, an anthropologist of design - I do research on how Chinese companies design products, which is somewhat related.) So, I might not be the best person to answer this question. But, based on my experience, anthropology gives you a conceptual framework to understand how people fit into social institutions, and how cultural trends influence everyday life. Take a project I did on working mothers for example. I was working with some hardware designers who were adapting a device used in hospital settings for parents to use in their everyday lives. They assumed that mother-child bonding would be the key issue, and hoped to position their product as a tool that would foster bonding. First, the anthropologists I was working with did a review of literature on the major trends in parenting in the US. We found that working mothers in professional careers have an incredible amount of stress placed on them due to two main trends. The first is that professionals are increasingly required to work long hours - with the amount of time you spend in the office being representative of your dedication to your job, and your own self-development as a professional. The second is that mothers have an increasing amount of pressure placed on them to manage their children's lives. Whereas in the past child raising was seen as giving kids a nurturing environment in which they could develop, today there's an emphasis on actively managing your child's development with enriching activities, and making sure your children develop according to norms. The existence of this conflict is born out through studies of working mothers, which show them to feel higher levels of stress, being pressed for time, etc. than any other group of worker. WIth that in mind, we conducted interviews with working mothers, which showed it to be the case. Mothers we spoke to weren't especially concerned with bonding, their main concern was a feeling of not being empowered to have the motherhood experience they wanted. So, we made recommendations on product design, branding and marketing with that in mind. I think that anthropological perspectives bring two main things to the design process. The first is a holistic perspective, which looks at individual groups of people in terms of larger, complex social systems. That can help you identify the key issues individuals face in their everyday lives. The second is that we start with the assumption that we don't know what the important issues are. So, some interviewers have a standard set of questions they ask everyone, checking off different boxes as people respond to them. Anthropologists, on the other hand, let people talk about what's important to them, and allow interviews to progress more organically. A lot of the time what seems like a digression at first can give you a key piece of information. So, one of the mothers I spoke with started talking about how great her doula was, something that had nothing to do with the questions I started asking her. But, after she talked for a while it was clear that she saw the hospital as a large institution with authority figures pressing their decisions on her. Her doula was an ally, who empowered her to have her childbirth on her own terms. Once I heard that, I went over my other interviews and it was a clear theme underlying a lot of what people were saying. (There is, of course, a danger in going too far off on tangents. I'm working through some life history interviews for my dissertation right now that are filled with fascinating digressions, but are really light on actual details about my interview subjects' lives.) The only user experience people I've spoken with were anthropologists who have moved into UX, so I'm not sure how representative they are of the field as a whole. But, my sense is that they're a lot more structured in their research methodologies. So, I don't know if that answers your question - I'm not a design anthropologist, but that's how I approach design research as an anthropologist. ",
