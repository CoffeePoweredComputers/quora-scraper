            "answer_text": "You can do a math investigation on anything that has applications that are slightly out of the reach of the IB math course you are taking. So anything you find interesting. The permutations and combinations of a rubics cube. How is it that it can always be solved in less than 20 moves? Making money in a casino? Why is it only possible in blackjack in the long run? What are the hindrances in the other form of gambling? Why is it that casinos still host blackjack if they can loose from it in the long run? How does politics use statistics to benefit their agenda? What are different forms of statistical manipulation and how far can you go? Ex. Taking this birth control pill will increase the odds of you getting x by 200% ! You can die if you get x during birth. That sounds pretty bad huh? But if x only has a 0.0001% chance of occurring, then you are only increasing the odds by 0.00002% then that's not bad at all is it? There are millions of cases where politicians use statistical manipulation to furthermore support their agenda. Artificial intelligence and computer sciences is a common topic, but in my opinion it is just plain dull. There are a lot more interesting topics for the mathematics that you have as an IB student. Stuff can quickly get out of the reach of your investigation, so at least make sure you are enjoying the investigation. You will always make it far if you do something you enjoy, because then the only thing that stops you is time. Whereas if you do something that is easy for an investigation, you will run into scenarios where you think \u201cahhh fuck it, this is good enough\u201d, whereas if you are driven by passion and interest, you will go beyond that. I got a 7 on my math IA by writing on why the sum of all the natural numbers is (-1/12) and what the implications of it are, and if it is a legitimate answer. Ie. Riemann zeta function where zeta= -1 . Regards ",

            "answer_text": "A really popular topic these days is Machine learning. Several algorithms in this domain use important ideas from probability and statistics. IB math HL (at least when I took the course) gave a rudimentary introduction into these topics. While many topics in machine learning may be over your head with the math, I think you will find the field to be an interesting extension and practical use of the probability and statistics you learned in class. Here are some examples of some algorithms you should take a look at, and with some effort, you might be able to understand: Naive Bayes classifier Linear discriminant analysis Decision tree learning ",
