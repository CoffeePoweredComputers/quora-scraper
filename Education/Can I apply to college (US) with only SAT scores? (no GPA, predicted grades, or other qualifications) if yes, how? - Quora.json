A daughter of mine had her records and school destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.  We gathered what documents we had and applied to another school.  This was in middle school so documents were not so pressing.  Without a good explanation there would be questions as to why you don't want to give out the data.  It is unlikely there would be financial aid without a complete application. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have an SAT score, you have some other records available.  So if your question is, \"will a school admit on a 2400 SAT without looking any further?\" the answer is No.   As Mr. Fox said, if there were some problem of a catastrophic nature that made it impossible to get your records there might be an exception, but I doubt it. If you're in college, did every single one of your professors die, and the sponsor of every activity you participated in? And how did you survive this calamity? So I'm assuming there's a way to get records, and you don't want to submit them because they're not as good as your SAT scores. ",
