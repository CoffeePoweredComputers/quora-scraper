            "answer_text": "There were 3 friends (boys) , two from rich families, one from upper middle class. They studied together in an affluent boarding school - two of them because they were good as students, and the third one obviously due to his father was rich. The rich guy was a womanizer from teenage and very frank in making quick relationships, taking girls to bed and simply forgetting afterwards. All of them started smoking,boozing and sometimes drugs together - which continued afterwards as well but in different intensities.Few years down the line the upper middle class guy becomes a lawyer and his only objective in life is to help everyone get divorced. He has obviously had relationship with his lawyer boss who is a married lady , with a kid - but no worries, He doesn't care about it.The other super rich kid is all spoiled in life, drives Bentley gifted by his father, his night starts at 6am after all the clubbing. How stupid rich kid with a golden spoon! He is separated (not divorced) from his wife because the boy found that they were not compatible although it was a love marriage where his dad has spent some 10crores, and being the male driven, male chauvinist society we are, his dad said ok leave the girl I will settle it . This guy smokes endlessly , is drunk even in serious family events and drives recklessly while he is drunk most of the time.The third guy was in a relationship with his love for 3 years and the girl proposed to get married , which he agreed and finally they came back to India from Sweden and the girl\u2019s family being a traditional Indian family were more than happy to arrange a big fat Indian wedding. But on the day of engagement this stupid boy ditched the girl on the stage, in front of numerous guests, and pushed her on the stage, she got hurt - neck almost broken.All three boys, gathered for the occasion of their friend\u2019s wedding, are so frustrated with the situation that the boy who pushed the girl on stage, ran away from the stage just not to be found for hours altogether and boozed whole night (poor boy), the super rich guy obviously finds a girl in the event, forgot about the wedding event and did the important thing - took her to bed, the third guy drank so much that he puked all the night without being aware of the drama happened on stage.Next day these poor guys decided to go to Bangkok and have fun to come out of the stress (!) in their lives. Drank , flirted, doped and swim naked - to de-stress themselves.This is wrong with our Society today!!NO , WAIT, reverse the situation , make the gender opposite in the story, all of them are girls, doing all this to boys. This was the most acclaimed story of EMPOWERED WOMAN in 2018 by Bollywood \u201cVeerey di wedding\u201d. And now you know what is wrong with our society !!I am obviously anonymous because the section in the name of fake, pseudo women empowerment is going to hate it. [Peace]Edit 1- Respectfully, I don\u2019t want to argue with different comments people made, still some people connected it with any color [read saffron] : you need to really have some fresh air , go out and smell roses. No where I brought even an iota of religious or right/left philosophy. [Peace]Edit 2 - Guys, I know it is just a film and so it is ok as well if I mention Sweden not Australia and decrease one character [yes there were 4 friends in film]. On one hand you want to have a chill pill saying ohh it was just a film on the other hand you are not ready to accept it as ohh just a Quora answer.Edit 3 - Yes I don\u2019t want to get into stupid arguments with so called FemiNazis or Feminists or Women Empowerment brigade. And along with that , yes I don\u2019t want popularity so I am anonymous. [Peace]Edit 4 - To answer who is an empowered woman - Sarojini Naidu was truly empowered (so many years back) ; Kalpna Chawla was empowered ; Kiran Majumdar is truly empowered ; every other girl who offers her seat to an elderly, is empowered; So many mothers (particularly single mothers) , sisters , friends are empowered across the world but they don\u2019t shout from the rooftop \u2018women empowerment\u2019 because simply they \u2018are\u2019Edit 5 - Many thanks for the upvotes, obviously upvote was not the objective when I wrote this piece else I would have not been anonymous. So many of you liked it, means we still have people who can understand Black n White and most importantly Grey as well. ",
