            "answer_text": "There are two main motives. The first, and by far the most common, is that while ultra-nationalism (the gateway to fascism) easily appeals to low educated classes, you still need people who create the ultra-nationalist agenda and understand how propaganda works, particularly in modern societies, and this requires educated people. In other words you need the utra-nationalist fascist leaders. An since the post of leader has always been highly looked for... The second motive, and to me a more honorable one, is just plain elitism. Never it was better laid down than in Shakespeare's Coriolanus. Coriolanus attempts a coup against the Roman Republic because he can't bring himself during the centuriate assemblies to speak to voters with a pleading, insincere and flattering tone for support to his candidacy, when his valor shown in battle should be enough by itself. Coriolanus hates to compete with other candidates without merit, who can only outclass him for their lack of dignity and restraint in flattering and manipulating people ignorant of public affairs. And, say what you like, but Coriolanus has a point here. When in tv debates we hear someone say \"voters are smart and they won't fall for your lies\", the most honest among us know that this is not the case, that voters are not that smart after all, and that calling them such is just another trick of electoral propaganda: the captatio benevolentiae. There have been people who have been attracted to authoritarian regimes simply because they found the level of insincerity, of parliamentary systems, in addressing the masses, demeaning to their dignity and sense of honor. After all, Plato's Republic was far from democratic, and behind today's modern political elitism the archetype of the philosopher ruler still acts. On the other side of the political spectrum the so-called \"workers vanguard\", which would lead to the Bolshevik \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was not far from these concepts. How democratic was Lenin? ",

            "answer_text": "The terms \u201cfascist\" or \u201cnazi\" are fallouts of events leading to the second world war. The terms refer to the political parties led by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Both these leaders are denigrated because they had happened to lise the war. The Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin had governed the Soviet Union with the same brutality as Hitler or Mussolini, but happened to end up on the winning side. Since then Communist dictatorships are differentiated from dictatorships preaching other political dogma. This differentiation is illogical but politically prudent. Henceforth I shall use the generic term \u201ctotalitarian\" for all dictatorships, whatever the brand classification of their dogmatic political faith. \u201cHighly educated people\u201d in the context of this question means, I believe, people who have gone through a prolonged academic life acquiring several degrees from several prestigious and renowned universities and academic institutions. Most of these people join the teaching faculties of prestigious universities. Others join intellectual professions like that of reporters, consultants and expert lecturers in public media. This concept excludes those holding technical quslifications like engineers or medical practitioners. These people get used to telling others what they should do. A large number of people have a regular lifestyle with which they are satisfied. They don't aspire for more. They are convinced by the educated people that the existing orderly system is a result of the educated people's intellectual abilities and are convinced that their best interests are served by obeying orders formulated by the educated elite. Educated people, after some time, develop a complacent and arrogance about their intellectual infallibitity. This leads to a tendency to authoritarianism. Clever political practioners approach the educated elite cleverly gratifying their arrogance, These politicians want certain things to be done to empower themselves. The public must be directed what to do without question. The educated elite, gratified by the politician's attention and the resulting social publicity, assist in formulating the orders directimg public conduct in a manner that the public would accept willingly out of awe and respect for the educated elite. This politician - educated elite nexus creates ultimately a totalitarian state. The highly educated elite are attracted to a totalitarian state because they have seen that falling in line with totalitarian political groups would give them an easy access to a high social and possible financial status by little intellectual effort or excercise. All that is needed is a wide vocabulary and a clever syntax. The University degrees would do the rest. ",
