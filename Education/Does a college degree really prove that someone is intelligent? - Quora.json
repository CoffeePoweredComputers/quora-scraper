            "answer_text": "No. There are different kinds of intelligence, for one thing, and college degrees only rely on some of them, and more importantly, intelligence is a measure of your ability to be educated, not a measure of the education that you have. Intelligence is your ability to be educated. Ignorance is the extent of your education. It\u2019s possible to be highly intelligent and uneducated, therefore ignorant. It\u2019s also possible to be much less intelligent but educated, therefore less ignorant, although probably more ignorant than someone who was both highly intelligent and educated. It\u2019s possible to educate yourself, of course, so having a college degree doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ignorant. I educated myself for six years before starting college at age 23. I read intensely, and I read difficult material. But my reading was all over the place and completely lacking in many areas, so if I\u2019d continued on that path I wouldn\u2019t have known what I know, and I wouldn\u2019t have known what I don\u2019t know. Organizing your study makes a lot of difference, and having a college degree helps with that. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure why people always talk about college degrees like it\u2019s one thing. There\u2019s huge variation between someone who got a B.A. in Business Administration at Sacramento State vs. someone who got a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCLA. And many people have graduate or professional degrees, too, and they tend to be smarter, but there\u2019s a huge range in selectivity and quality of students in graduate programs, too. Someone with a lame major at a little-known school that accepts 85% of its applicants who aren\u2019t all that high achieving in the first place is probably going to be much less smart than someone who got into Caltech or MIT. I read that 118 was the average IQ of a college grad. So is that someone who got a BA in communications at Bowling Green State University, or someone with a BS in bioengineering at Stanford? The IQ of people MUST vary by college, and what their field of study is, too. And people with grad degrees from top universities must have even higher IQs. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but it makes for a richer intellectual environment and development,it gives me a concrete statement about my intelligence, focus, and motivation, and it frequently makes me more employable. A degree doesn\u2019t prove intelligence, but it also true that if one is NOT intelligent enough to perform the basic tasks of scholarship, one will likely not get the degree. Intelligence and education (at any level) are separate things, but they are partners. Like it or not, we live in a world that will not always take our unsupported word for our intelligence, or for our suitability for employment. Personally, no matter how intelligent s/he is, I don\u2019t want a self trained doctor doing my surgery, or a well intentioned but untrained teacher responsible for my child\u2019s education, to name only a couple of areas.

One must also be educated. An intelligent person who does not want to become educated is wasting their intelligence, which is really quite stupid. ",

A degree nominally denotes that you have attained some level of knowledge and to some extent are capable of using it. It doesn't make you anything; it's supposed to be a marker for what you have done. ",
