            "answer_text": "Do you mean besides failing the course, having the cheating being reported to the appropriate administrative office, the accusation becoming a part of the students permanent file, and the possibility that the students would consequently be expelled from the university? There was a reason that I would report cheating whenever it occurred (and in my experience, it only rarely occurred). At my university, a report of academic dishonesty would be placed in the student\u2019s file. If, however, a second such report was submitted, expulsion from the university was nearly automatic. Because of that, I would explain to the student involved that as long as there was not already a report of cheating in their file, the only consequence would be an F in the course. But the risk of ever cheating again in their remaining time at the university was quite high - they would likely be expelled. ",
