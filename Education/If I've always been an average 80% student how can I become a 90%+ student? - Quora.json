If you try to be an A student and get a 93% on everything, things are going to happen. Maybe a test sneaks up on you, and you don\u2019t have enough time to prepare. Or an evil professor decides to make the world\u2019s hardest exam and decides not to curve because that would \u201cdiscourage teamwork.\u201d Whatever it is, suddenly your big dream of getting a 93 takes a hit, and you\u2019re back to getting another 81. If you want to get A\u2019s you\u2019ve got to try to get 100% on every. single. assignment. This is why research has shown that a 4.0 GPA results in significant amounts of stress. You\u2019ve got to aim for perfection. Now once again, with this different mindset things are still going to happen. But this time, things are a little different. Since you\u2019re starting point is an 100%, when things go wrong you move down to a 95% or maybe even a 93%, but you\u2019re still getting an A. That\u2019s the key to getting A\u2019s. ",

It takes penultimate patience with yourself and the ability to go over and over the material until you master it. There are no shortcuts. Find a place which is conducive to study without and I underline without distractions and that means, the cell phone, social media, radio, etc. I spent four years in college living in the libraries. The more you practice, the better you will become. Get plenty of sleep and good nutrition, keep hydrated. Of course, the above is not easy, but as they say, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. Have Savlanut, patience in Hebrew. You can do it! You just have to want to do it badly enough and no one can do it for you. Best of luck! ",
