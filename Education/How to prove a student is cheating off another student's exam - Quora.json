            "answer_text": "This is a difficult thing to handle, and it has to be handled delicately.  It may not be possible to find iron clad proof, in which case you should not accuse the student of wrongdoing.  You might report your concerns to a supervisor or discuss it with other teachers who know the student . You can: Compare the student's paper with those seated directly nearby (yet another reason for assigned seats)Check the surface of the student's desk for written answers or evidence of such answers being rubbed off (the trash too may contain a \"cheat sheet\")Compare the student's performance on the test with the trend of past performance (proves nothing definitively, but is enough to justify scrutiny on future test dates... and is yet another reason to design your assessment schedule well and before the course begins.)Your best defense is to teach a quality course and use valid assessment practices.  If your lessons aren't well-structured, don't offer enough guided practice and don't engage students actively enough, many students will become frustrated or passive and be more tempted to cheat on tests.  The amount of time you should invest in course design varies depending on the content and level of course, but if your units are mostly pulled from a folder of loosely related activities, students will often have trouble identifying learning priorities and studying effectively.  They will then be more likely to \"get creative\" on test day.  Also, asking students to memorize things may be necessary to your course, but if you directly assess memorized material on a regular basis, you can expect cheating to be a problem.  Cheating is all about saving time and avoiding effort, so assessments like that will be cheated on simply because doing so is a matter of just concealing a bit of discrete information. Testing protocols also help a lot-- random seat reassignment, checking for concealed papers, multiple test versions, diamond pattern test distribution, keeping materials secure, etc etc     I had a pair, and I dealt with it by creating a special version of an insignificant multiple choice quiz just for them.  I separated them quite far apart, but made sure that none of the answers on their tests matched the answers for any other versions of the test. As expected, Student A copied all answers from Student B.  They must have worked out some kind of signaling system, I don't know, because they were a few rows apart. Anyway, Student A was quite upset ",

            "answer_text": "My high school computer science teacher had an interesting way. We wrote our mid-term supervised by a teacher who wasn\u2019t our computer science teacher, and wasn\u2019t familiar with the poorest students who were also frequent absentees. He was, therefore, a bit easier to fool. This was just before the Christmas break. We came back in January and our computer science teacher walked in and said: \u201cBad news guys. I lost your exams. You have to rewrite them.\u201d He had 30 blank exam papers with him and we acquiesced and rewrote our answers. It was the same exam we\u2019d written in December. After 90 minutes of exam writing he collected our papers and told us: \u201cI had a feeling that two of you cheated on the mid-term. I wanted to use this as a way of proving it. I would never lose your exams.\u201d He never did tell us if the two had cheated or not, but I suspect he caught the cheaters. ",

So don\u2019t worry if you think they did it in the past and got away with it- let that one go. Instead, prepare to catch them in the act next time. And how do you do that? Give them different versions of the same test. Don\u2019t make the tests wildly different, instead, make them slightly different so that the questions appear pretty much the same, but the answers should be very different. And then just see how they do on it. If they cheat, you\u2019ll hopefully be able to tell. ",
