            "answer_text": "You can join Recon before that even if you wished. If you really wanted to you could go the Recon route before you even join. If you enlist as an infantryman, you have to go to boot camp at Parris Island or San Diego. After that you complete infantry training with the Infantry Training Battalion at Camp Geiger or Camp Pendleton, which is 59 days. At that point you would normally go to a Victor unit aka infantry battalion. (Usually, there's a few cases that don't besides Recon or Security Forces/MSG guys but I've known only 2 Marines the entire time I've been in that have done so.) Now for you, potential hard-charger, at this point you would graduate and be sent to the Basic Recon Primer, which is five weeks long and is pretty mentally and physically taxing. This is simply to PREPARE you for the Basic Recon Course (BRC). Ok five weeks has gone by and you've been properly hazed. (kidding((ish))) Now you attend BRC, you spend nine weeks at this course through three different phases, which all have different objectives. At the end of it you have successfully earned the title of 0321 or (basic) Recon Marine! (Emphasis on basic, because you're going to be going to A LOT more training) You'll be sent to one of the three active-duty Recon battalions or if you really really want to do Force Recon you'll be sent to Marine Special Operations School I believe but I've known very few Force Recon guys but a lot of MARSOC Marines. The paths are similar not the same. So that's the path to take if you want to do it right off the bat. Which there's pros and cons to and I'll be happy to list them and what I think if you like. If not and you choose to enlist and serve elsewhere or in a different MOS first then the path is still pretty much the same, except if you're an 0311 already, ALL Recon Marines must pass the Rifleman training at SOI before attempting Recon training, non-negotiable. (it's the Marines, nothing is negotiable) Now at your three year mark or after two deployments you wish to do Recon still you would go see your career planner for your unit and they'll start the paperwork, you'll have to re-enlist though or extend at a minimum. Unless you're like me and decided to sign a 6 year contract. After that it's all the same as I said, but in short yes you can after 4 years, 3 year, 2 deployments or if you enlist straight into it. Either way I hope this helps and wish you fair winds and following seas in whichever path or endeavor you decide to undertake ",

            "answer_text": "The question was about Force Reconnaissance vice Marine Reconnaissance. Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) is the advanced, or masters-level, if you will, of Marine Reconnaissance. There are only five FORECON companies (three active and two reserve in the entire Marine Corps), so selection is very competitive. Some who have answered the question are apparently confusing \"standard\" Marine Reconnaissance with FORECON. Yes, one can enlist specifically for a training path that would qualify one as a Reconnaissance Marine and a Marine infantryman could apply for Marine Reconnaissance, so it is possible to become Reconnaissance Marine in four years. However, since FORECON generally requires that a Reconnaissance Marine has experience prior to being accepted, that experience would most likely have been gained through service in one of the reconnaissance companies of a Marine division's reconnaissance battalion. (The three active FORECON companies are actually company D of their respective parent reconnaissance battalion.) Therefore, one should expect that the norm would possibly approach closer to five or six years of total Marine Corps service, with the commensurate training, assignments, and deployments of an infantry and/or reconnaissance Marine prior to selection for FORECON.
