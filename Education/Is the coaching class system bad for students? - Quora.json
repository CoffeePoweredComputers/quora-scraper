            "answer_text": "Yes, offcourse it is not good for students but in today\u2019s India, psychology of students are changing. They thinks that coaching class will make their future but it is wrong, only your self study and concentration to the study will give you the selection in top exams. 1.Additional expenditure on education \u2014 Nowadays, the cost of education is rising with every new academic cycle, and if students who are weak in studies or want to score well in exams seek extra help for studies with coaching institutes then it adds to the cost of education. Not every parent can afford extra expenses for education along with high tuition fees at school. But, because they want their child to good in academics at school they take the pain of coaching institutes fees as well. Moreover, sometimes teachers at school offer tuition after school and parents think that their child would get the required attention and help in academics, therefore; they send their child to tuitions from the teacher. This should not be done because then teachers at school do not teach students properly as they think of extra-income with tuitions. 2. Extra homework burden on students \u2013 Coaching Institutes give students a lot of homework because the students need to practice well in order to prepare and score well for exams. Students already get homework for each subject from school, and if they get homework from coaching classes as well then students do not get enough time to refresh and they feel burdened with homework. 3. Different from school academic structure \u2013 Coaching institutes follow a personalised study pattern for each student and schools follow a generic pattern for each batch of each class. This leaves students in a dilemma as they have to keep up with school studies as well as coaching classes learning. 4. Developing stress in students due to competition \u2013 Coaching Institute aims to train students specifically for examination and hence, they prepare them extensively for gaining a competitive edge. For board exams, admissions tests, and competitive exams students are prepared along with hundreds of students and they are made to compete among themselves to analyse their preparation level. Such environment develops anxiety and exam stress in students. 5. One coaching institute is not suitable for students from different schools \u2013Coaching institutes already have different study curriculum from schools and when students from different schools join the same coaching institute then the conflict in students\u2019 pace and understanding arise. The coaching institutes are not limited to a type of school, and students from different schools or education boards join the coaching institute. Therefore, the education pattern of schools or board is not same and when these students get coaching under the same institute then every student has their own problems in concept understanding. Students must know the Advantages and Disadvantages of Coaching Classes ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to highlight the merits and demerits of coaching system: Merits: 1.Normal coachings provide additional help to students who are unable to catch up well in school. 2Extremely helpful to the students who have access to coaching classes. 3.Keeps students focussed and polishes them for perfection.  4. If attended at the right time with full dedication, can build future and make one stand out of the crowd. Demerits: 1.Creates disparity as there are many students who do not have access to it (Rural areas) when needed though they are as sharp and bright as the other students who have access to it. 2. We all know that cracking tough and sought- after exams like JEE MAINS, ADVANCED, AIPMT, AIMS etc. is too difficult with normal school curriculum, without the help of coaching classes. Hence the current exam pattern makes coachings inevitable for students. 3. Due to the competition met by students in coaching classes, students suffer from depression. Unfortunately, there have been cases of suicides too.  4. Not everyone is able to afford the high payment fees.  5. Due to pressure of exam and cut throat competition, the joy of learning is reduced. 6. Kill the importance of schooling. In many cities dummy schools have been established so that students can focus entirely on coaching.  7. In many cases, school teachers take coaching classes and do not teach properly at school to supplement their income. This trend is famous for board level preparation. Hence, I would say that there should be uniformity in resources available to every student and success should only depend on hard work and intelligence. ",
