            "answer_text": "That depends on a lot of individual parameters\u2014-is the homework just practice? Is the teacher attempting to give credit for effort and timliness/responsibility, etc.? What are the instructor\u2019s goals for both the grades and the homework lesson? What are the building requirements? (I taught in one school that required me to give a set amount of homework every week, and estimate the time it would take the student to do it. Since everyone works at an individual speed, I found that to be just silly\u2014-but nobody asked me and, as the teacher, I tried to follow the rules and still be fair to the students, which affected the amount of weight I gave homework on a grade.

            "answer_text": "If it doesn\u2019t count as a grade, most students will not take the time to do it. Like with every process of learning, practice is required to master it, and there is not enough time in a school day for the practice needed to master the skills being learned. Just as muscles for a particular sport need to be trained for \u2018muscle memory\u2019, the brain needs to be trained to reach its full potential. Homework is practice for the brain. ",
