            "answer_text": "Answering for the Int. Ph.D. admission test. The long and short of it is- you can\u2019t. The papers were taken from us immediately after completing the test. However, some of the questions might be repeated so you\u2019d do well to talk to someone who gave the test the year before- they might remember some of the questions. However, the questions back when I gave the exam were quite conceptual and easy, though they could be construed to be a little tricky, especially if your concepts aren\u2019t clear, because some of the options (it was a multiple choice paper) were quite similar.
