            "answer_text": "As I write this\u2026my thoughts turn to my time in school\u2026early years\u2026then all through the remaining time. The teachers that I had in grade school remain in my memory the clearest. They spend more time with us\u2026we saw them every school day. Later on, when we changed classes and rooms and teachers\u2026our relationship with them was not a familiar or intense. Everyone reading this\u2026everyone, will now think back and remember their school days and all will remember one or more of their teachers. They will remember those teachers that were kind\u2026were caring\u2026were pretty, or handsome, were stern and strict, who we brought flowers to, and book reports and who we wanted to please and make them proud of us\u2026who we were afraid of. My point is, of course, that no matter how old we become, the teachers that we spent so much of our lives with, had a tremendous impact on our lives. They, outside of our family members, were the most important people that we saw and interacted with. They helped make us the people we are today. I worked with hundreds of children over the years. Many had been beaten, starved of food, kindness, love or raped or beaten or ignored, belittled,\u2026all those things that twisted and cruel people do to children\u2026because they can. And, one of the few things in each of those children\u2019s lives that still mattered to them was to go to school. School was one of the few constants in their lives\u2026their place of refuge\u2026no brutal parent lurking there\u2026no fear of sexual assault or being bitten, burned or beaten\u2026they were safe\u2026they, for a while, were normal\u2026they belonged. Sometimes\u2026that was the only place\u2026they felt safe. So\u2026.\u201dstigma\u201d of being a teacher? The \u201cstigma\u201d is and should be\u2026a statement of pride\u2026a statement of worth\u2026a statement of meaning and fulfillment\u2026teachers shape and guid young minds and young ideals\u2026The greatest statement any of us can make\u2026about what we did in life is \u201cI was a teacher.\u201d Go\u2026teach\u2026become a golden memory to thousands of children.
