            "answer_text": "Let me ask you straight - if you dont like the subjects then who is forcing you to study? In my view, you should do where your heart is. Will Sachin Tendulkar be a great mathematician or Amitabh Bachchan be an ace sportsman? Clear answer is they may not be and even if they try doing something else other than their current profession then even after being successful they will not be happy! So friend, first decide where your heart is and dont force yourself to love anything which you dont enjoy. Its your life and you have every right to chose the profession where you enjoy spending your rest of your life. Hope it helps, Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the simplest answer, If you are trying to get your head around year 10 (or below) phy and Chem use these study tips: Find what kind of learner you are- visual, auditory, hands on etc. Feed in more conceptual information visually.Physics is conceptual mathematics. Get you math stronger.Improve memorisation skills when it comes to chemistry so that you can present your equations betters with all necessary elements, compounds, states of matter, reaction conditions etc.Etc etc etcIf you are trying to work on phy and Chem just because they are a prerequisite for your university course, drop that idea and move on to arts or literature mate. Cuz when something is a prerequisite for a Uni course, it means you\u2019ll have to do it for the rest of your life! ",

What I am doing right now is: I study these subjects in a good atmosphere and when I am in the moodIf I get bored by studying these subjects then I study that subject which I enjoy the mostI take regular breaks just to ensure I am not boredI carefully listen to what teacher teach in the class and try to \u2018understand\u2019 as much as possible so that during learning I have to learn it word-to-word according to the exam pattern but at the same time I know what I am learning",
