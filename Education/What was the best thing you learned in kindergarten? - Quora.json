            "answer_text": "Kindergarten was a mere fifty-five years ago. Just like yesterday. Kindergarten was not required back then and there were no kindergartens in public schools. But, my parents enrolled me in kindergarten at our church. Every morning, I would cross our street, walk up our neighbor\u2019s driveway, through their backyard, step over the fence, walk through the church parking lot and into the back door of the church - the entrance of my kindergarten. Crazy that I remember that like it was yesterday. And on that very first day, I learned the best thing ever. As if it was yesterday, I remember our teacher standing in front of us and telling the class, \u201cCan\u2019t doesn\u2019t live here.\u201d It was a forbidden word. We learned that rather than can\u2019t we needed to think about needing to grow more or to learn more or to try harder or to try a different way, but \u201cCan\u2019t doesn\u2019t live here.\u201d It was an academic kindergarten not a play school. We actually completed much of the curricula used for the first grade that year. And, very early in first grade, I taught my teacher a lesson. She used the word can\u2019t and I parroted the words of my kindergarten teacher. Funny, fifty five years later, I say those words to myself often. \u201cCan\u2019t doesn\u2019t live here.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Breaking rules can be good. There were two kindergartens at my public school in the early sixties. The shared a small building, and had a fenced in playground the size of a pocket handkercheif, with a line down the center\u2026half a playground per class. I made good friends with a girl from the other class, and we often crossed the line to play with each other - until ordered back over the line. We didn\u2019t care. We liked each other. We are now in our sixties and still fast friends. ",
