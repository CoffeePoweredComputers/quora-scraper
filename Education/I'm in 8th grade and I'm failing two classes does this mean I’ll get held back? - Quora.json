            "answer_text": "In Elementary school students are retained when they fail one of the basic areas: math, language and social sciences. In secondary school, students are allowed a maximum of two courses failed in order to be promoted. If they fail three or more, they should repeat. Wikipedia \u203a wiki \u203a Grade_retention Grade retention - Wikipedia Don't think of this as good news though. You shouldn't be even close to failing given how easy U.S. public schooling is. If you can't handle this then it would have been better for you to repeat. Ask your teacher for extra help, ask your class mates, ask anyone for help seriously, even if you don't know them. Usually people fail because they skip class or stare at the clock like a zombie. If you don't understand then you need that 1 on 1 help. If it's a common question then your teacher will explain it to the whole class if they aren't an asshole teacher. ",
