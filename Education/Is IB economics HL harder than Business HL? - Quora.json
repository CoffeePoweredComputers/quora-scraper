            "answer_text": "First things first, IB Business and IB Economics are very different from each other despite seeming otherwise. As a person who took both Economics and Business HL in the IB and scored 7s in both, I think I\u2019m qualified to give you my opinion. Economics might seem more difficult because of how technical the subject is. There are a lot of concepts and each one will require you to memorise the definition, corresponding graph, etc. However, if you understand the concept- you might not find it as tough. Also, if you do Economics HL you will have to take the Paper 3 which is based on quantitative economics. You don\u2019t have to be great at Math because you\u2019ll be allowed to use your calculator, but you will have to remember all the formulae and their applications. On the other hand, Business is a more practical subject and allows for more individual opinion or creativity in terms of approach to answers. You don\u2019t have to memorise as much as Economics. In Business, you will have quantitative questions- usually in Section 1 of Paper 2 and in Section C of Paper 1. However it\u2019s easier compared to the Economics section because you\u2019re not only allowed a Calculator, but also given a formula booklet so you don\u2019t have to memorise the formulae. You only need to understand their application. Coming to the style of questions, I personally thought Economics was much easier because of the fact that Paper 1 is pretty straightforward and theoretical and you only have to answer 4 questions. In comparison, the Business papers have more questions and the style of writing answers is a lot more difficult. It\u2019s more about finding the right balance between Concept, Context and Content. Anyway, in my personal opinion it really comes down to you. If you find theory and memorising easier, I\u2019d suggest Economics. However, if you\u2019re looking at being more practical and creative you\u2019ll want to do Business. In my experience, I found both Business and Economics equally difficult/ easy and I\u2019ll admit, very very enjoyable to study. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I had Economics HL and Business Management HL as my subjects during IB. According to my experience, Economics HL is theoretical in nature if compared with Business Management. This is because BM as a subject is very practical in nature. So it\u2019s simpler to understand. On the other hand, in Economics one has to study models and theories, for example Classical and Keynesian model which are based on many many assumptions away from the real world. In other words, one can connect with the real world easily while studying BM, however many people find it difficult to do it with Economics. That\u2019s why people find this subject difficult. Nevertheless, these two subjects are considered as the most simple subjects in IB. There is nothing like Economics is hard or BM is easy. It depends on what interests you the most. ",
