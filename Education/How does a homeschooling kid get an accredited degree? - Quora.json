            "answer_text": "My home educated professor son has four degrees, BS, MS, PhD, and now teaches. When he went to college they wanted to know the color of his money not his accredited school history. He graduated Cum Laud with two degrees and went to post grad stuff afterward. I often wonder if he will ever get a real job. I am a well seasoned adult. If I were to attempt to enroll in the local university, they would not give a damn what high school I went to, nor what my grades were. They would want to see the money. The institutions of higher learning regularly test for placement due to the poor nature and quality of so-called elementary and high school education received in the U.S. Most current college attendees are taking some form of remedial classes before they are allowed to even attempt higher education. Of course, if you are a rich famous celebrity you can just buy the grades for the grads; once again, show them the money. Why are those who offer bribes prosecuted, yet those who accept those bribes are given a bye? Hum? ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest way for homeschooling kids to get an accredited degree is to enroll in an online school which is accredited by a leading accreditation agency. It will not only help the students by providing a set up of curriculum, time table and study resources, but it will also ensure that the students take up proper assessment exams. In the past many homeschooled kids have been questioned about not passing formal examinations, which is considered the ultimate test of learning. With online schools, this issue is well addressed. The accredited degree provided by the online school would be termed as valid. ",

In the US there are tests that can be taken to demonstrate competence; in the UK some home educated students take public exams, and some create portfolios, and some do foundation courses that can lead to degrees. If home educated students do not want to go to a physical university, and prefer to continue studying at home, then institutions such as the Open University offer full courses, taken on modular form; they are useful for people who want to study part-time, while continuing a job, or for those who want to take longer than three years to get their degree.
