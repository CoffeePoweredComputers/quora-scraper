            "answer_text": "According to the PL 94\u2013142 you MUST have a disability to have an IEP. An IEP is an Individualized Educational Plan. To qualify for one you must have undergone extensive screenings, which are then gone over by the school and your parents. If there is an area of concern, a diagnostic plan is formulated and your parents would have had to sign for you to have been tested. Once all testing is completed your parents and the school officials would gather back and discuss the findings, this would be the diagnostic summary. Based on the summary, if there was an area of concern that qualified you to have met criteria for service and IEP would have been compiled.

            "answer_text": "Have you asked your counselor or parents what your IEP is for? You may not have clear-cut signs of a \u201cdisability\u201d but for some reason you have an IEP. Which could be very helpful for you. You need to find out why you have an IEP. Usually students know. You have the right to find out. Then you can center your learning more easily.
