            "answer_text": "I agree with Mary Stenger and Paul Ryberg and assume they are talking about a public library, not a school library where problem students can be more readily be brought into line. The librarian or any adult in charge of the public facility should remain calm and assert his/her authority in a non-confrontational manner. One should try to do this quietly thereby denying them the audience they often crave. Perhaps with a friendly sense of humor combined with reasoning, the adult can bring the troublemakers to a peaceful solution. They must be made to understand that, if they want to remain in the library and/or return to it another day, they have to realize there are rules that must be followed. If the attitude of the troublemakers remains unruly or poses a danger to others, they have to be removed from the library without delay either by a family member who has been contacted or the police if contacting the family is not possible.

Don\u2019t allow bad behavior one day then go nuts over minor discretions the next\u2026be consistent. If you aren\u2019t good at correcting behavior without yelling watch some videos on correct ways to handle problems. Also have a policy in place for infractions and follow the policy. Our policy has written requirements, parental notification requirements, and removal steps. ",
