            "answer_text": "How much you give for a high school graduation depends on how close you are in the relationship Are you a friend, a teacher , a relative, a parent? It also depends on your financial condition. High schoolers like money as a gift. Twenty dollars is a good place to start, or a relative might give $50. As far as parents are concerned, the range is between $100 and a car. Sometimes just a card would be acceptable. Other teenagers who come to congratulate their friend usually don\u2019t even give a card because they are there for the food and they have invited each other to celebrate at each other\u2019s open house. I think a basket where the people who are invited put the card into a basket and then sign a guest book would be the way to get the cards to the graduate.. Otherwise, it is an awkward situation if the cards are opened at the party. Comparing the gift of money against other people's gift is not a good idea. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on many things\u2026 How close are you to the graduate & the family? Have you exchanged gifts with them on other occasions? I often give a leather-bound journal, or an organizer, for children of my friends. For close relatives, or children that I have known for a long time, I will give a monetary gift. No one should expect a specific amount as a gift. A great gift is a thoughtfully written letter, reviewing how you know the graduate and how proud you are of them - as well as letting them know that you believe in them. That and a moderate gift card could be the best gift of all\u2026 ",
