            "answer_text": "Hi! I did all the 2nd semester in remote/online learning and I did find some advantages in it: you grow to be more autonomous and disciplined (since we had to do lots of homework and research on our own because sometimes the materials we were given weren\u2019t enough and also because staying at home and doing your classes while everything in your house and cellphone can be a distraction (and you have no one to supervise you directly) is hard. Also, it was a good opportunity to work on my shyness, because I had to ask my teachers (through emails and in the platforms during class) every time I had a doubt. Remote learning was also good for us to work with new platforms like Microsoft Teams and Zoom. In my experience, those were the main advantages, but I am sure there are more. :) I would say that remote learning can be used in the future but changes must be made first. I actually ended up writing an article about my experience with online learning and how classes and exams were handled by my university. Here\u2019s the link: University in a quarantined world Bye! \ud83e\udd0d ",

Kids can digest course material at pace that works for them. They have more flexibility when it comes to sleeping in, eating when they want, and avoiding longer commute times to school. ",
