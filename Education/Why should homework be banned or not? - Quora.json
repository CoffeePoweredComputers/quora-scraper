            "answer_text": "According to me[A student] Homework should be banned because. 1)If the kids haven't learned the concept by the time they leave the classroom homework should be banned 2)The number two reason why most of the kids do not get enough sleep is because they are staying till 11:00 every night doing their homework 3)If there was less homework the students would get enough exercise. and get to bed early because if the stay up till late night they could have a head ache 4)It's basically forcing students to go home after a stressful day of school and activities and do pointless homework. Teachers should be teaching these things in class, not making the students learn it themselves. It's preventing children from leading balanced lifestyles, with a healthy amount of sleep and activities to keep them fit and active. How is a student supposed to do 3 to 4 hours of homework, study for a plethora of tests and quizzes, play sports, get involved in the community, eat food with nutritional value, and get an adequate amount of sleep, all in one day? That's not possible. The amount of stress homework causes kids is ridiculous, especially when they're already under so much pressure to get into a good college and do well in school, along with making friends and staying active. Homework is not necessary. Below are some funny things about homework.    {Image source:Google} Note:sorry guys if I hurt anyone it was just Plus:This is my first answer so please upvote That's all folks\u00a1 ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends upon the purpose of the homework. Should teachers avoid assigning homework for the sake of assigning homework? Yes, but there is a lot more to homework than just keeping students busy. Homework creates the opportunity to rehearse and review skills learned in classes. By completing additional practice, skills can gain fluency and schoolwork can get easier. Homework also doesn\u2019t always mean completing things like worksheets. Some teachers flip their classes where the lecture is watched as a video for \u201chomework\u201d and the class time is used for discussion or practice. Some teachers require a specific amount of reading as part of homework to help build reading comprehension skills. Longer-term assignments bring with them a host of valuable skills to acquire such as time management and planning that are incredibly important to later success in life. Learning these skills in school when you can be supported by a teacher is important. With that said, homework needs to be intentionally assigned. Teachers need to think about why something is going home and how it will benefit instruction the next day. Homework needs to be able to be completed independently and have a feedback mechanism to ensure that mistakes get corrected. ",
