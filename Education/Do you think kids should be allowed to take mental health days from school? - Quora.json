            "answer_text": "I actually had this when I was in late middle school and high school. It wasn\u2019t some sort of organized and official program by the school for actual mental health. It was just something my mom did. I basically got one day every semester when I just didn\u2019t have to go to school for no good reason. Yeah, not fair. I know. I think it was her trying to compensate for a great deal of hardship we were enduring as a family. She was nearly overcome by cancer twice in that period, money was a real issue, and grandma was losing her mental clarity and showing signs of needing to go to a nursing home. I didn\u2019t have mental health problems from that. It just sucked. I was a good kid who pulled good grades, so I think she just felt I needed a break. So my mom started giving me a \u201cmental health day.\u201d The name was always viewed as a joke and just a time for me to be lazy. As a kid, it was nice. Of course. What kid wouldn\u2019t want a day off from school just to relax until they woke up and play video games? But I won\u2019t do it for my kid. I abused it. There was never any reason to have a \u201cmental health day.\u201d It was just a day when I stayed up too late, and wanted to sleep in. It contributed to my laziness. It should never have been an option for me as it wasn\u2019t productive for me to think about, \u201cwhat if I just stayed up late and took my day off?\u201d Adults don\u2019t get to think like that, so I shouldn\u2019t have had that as an option. If it was never an option, many, many times I would have just powered through a lot of things I should have done, and not been so irresponsible. After working with kids of that age, I know that the majority of them would abuse it too. Economists can describe for you clearly the phenomenon where when a system rewards being a victim of some traumatic circumstance, the number of people suffering that circumstance rises dramatically. If you give kids that option, a majority of them who use it will not actually be sufferers, but malingerers feeding an unhealthy victimhood mentality. The problem is also bigger than just be one kid goofing off for a day. In a school with 1,000 kids assuming something like my set-up, that\u2019s 2,000 absences a year. Absences, for any reason, contributes massively to a decline in student learning, drop out rates, and given that many schools are funded based on daily head counts( the number of kids who actually show up rather than those enrolled) it would also cost the school thousands of dollars in next year\u2019s funding. Look, I get that people want to do nice things for kids who have it hard. I get that, but the problem with \u201cMental Health Days\u201d, like so many things, is that it is a poorly thought out plan to help people in need and unintended consequences are too great. It doesn\u2019t actually do much to cure or even relieve mental illness for those that do suffer from it, creates a means for delinquency and laziness in the other 97% of kids, promotes victimhood instead of overcoming issues for everyone, and finally, makes it harder for teachers to teach because dozens of kids are now missing from school every day, and may even hurt everyone when it costs the schools in form of state funding. To fix all of these problems would be a monumental undertaking requiring more convoluted schemes than the contrived solution of \u201cmental health days.\u201d It makes whatever problem actually exists into a much, much bigger set of new problems. This is just not a well thought out solution, but a feel good one for administrators and activists who don\u2019t have a firm grip on the realities of education and teenage behavior. If you want to help with the mental health problem, come up with a better method than feel good solutions like mental health days. ",

            "answer_text": "Not all children. Not in a systematic way where the school somehow regulates these separately from normal sick days \u2014 because they are sick days. And much like parents are usually the ones to call in sick days, so too should they be able to judge if their child needs a day to recuperate and relax. It's no secret how much some children would abuse any kind of scheduled release from school. But children, especially teenagers, can and do have mental illnesses. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, anything. Taking a \u2018mental health day' is for when you can barely get out of bed without trouble. When everything is stress and the thought of going to a place filled with more stressors makes everything worse. Taking a \u2018mental health day' is about saving face. For if you're going to be crying through every class and you don't want the questions, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cDo you need help?\u201d and probably someone reporting you to a counselor who will then sit you down in their office for a talk you don't want to have. Taking a \u2018mental health day' is recognizing that you weren't going to get anything done anyway. You would sit through your classes, unable to focus on the lesson, and wait desperately for the bell to ring at the end of the day. It shouldn't be something regular, an extra weekend day to play games and avoid class. And if they had the option, some students would make it that. That is not what it is for. But for the genuinely afflicted, sometimes taking a day to recover when the going gets rough is almost necessary. Take care of yourself, kids. ",

I could cough up a lung and struggle to get out of bed and my parents would be like  I\u2019d still find myself at my desk when the bell rang. My parent-teacher conferences in fourth grade were all different variations of \u201cKulsoom\u2019s such a dedicated student - she even shows up when she\u2019s sick!\u201d and my parents would give me that \u201cSee?? Told ya so!\u201d look. Forget trying to fake being sick - my parents were doctors, they saw right through me. I think a less extreme version of this would be genuinely good for most kids. It was really crucial, at that young age when I was not really that overwhelmed, stressed out, etc., for my parents to emphasize the importance of school and attendance. When I got to freshman year of high school, and everyone talked about ditching like it was normal and totally fine, I never really thought that. When we procrastinated on projects and they were graded for punctuality, I had many friends who would immediately think to skip class and finish it; I, on the other hand, would be doing everything in my power (full MacGyver up in this place) to get a presentable project finished. Fastforward to now, when I\u2019m a senior. I\u2019m juggling two jobs, dual credit, shadowing a physician, school, and extracurriculars. My parents trust me unequivocally about school at this point, because I\u2019ve never deceived them about it. When I tell them \u201cI gotta get out of XYZ class\u201d, or \u201cI cannot go to school today\u201d, they know it\u2019s not a small thing, and they have my back. They\u2019ll call in for me, let me get my shit together, whatever. If I want an off day with a friend after a really hard test, and I tell them I\u2019m not missing anything, they trust me and consider it fine. You have to build trust in order to capitalize on it. However, every kid is different. Their needs are different. I, as a kid, did not need to take breaks from school. I felt comfortable in that environment, I never felt unsafe there or was targeted. The same is not, unfortunately, true for every student. You need to consider the needs of your kid. Also consider why a student may feel unwelcome at school - most kids do not inherently hate school until much later. ",

            "answer_text": "My guess is that school districts do this not for the mental health of the children but for the mental health of the teachers who are under siege from parents, the school administration and students alike. When I was a lowly substitute working my way through the hoops and hurdles of higher education on the road to credentialing, a few days were stressful but it was easy enough to walk away while the rest of the teacher staff stayed after school for the inevitable meetings filled with new directives, paper work and complaints, from the school board, the principal, parents, the PTA and anyone else who had two cents worth to add. Luckily for myself, I got a call that followed up recruiters from the CDC and I started training a month later in the career that changed my life, opened the door to more education and ultimately into the world of university teaching and a career as a psychologist. Teaching children today is fraught with many perils and can be one of the most stressful experiences for teachers who are ill prepared for a highly charged classroom atmosphere. Only the very best who have egos of iron survive and if they get a mental health day, even though labeled for the children, they deserve a short break from the battle. ",

Granted, mental health days don\u2019t outwardly change anything: the situation won\u2019t change whether a child goes to school or stays home, but a tiny break of 24 hours to not have to deal with all the crap-whatever that might be-just may be the mental & physical rest that child (and possibly the parent) needs. As an adult, there have been times where I\u2019ve felt overwhelmed by a situation-add in that I\u2019ve been sick, haven\u2019t slept well- and just need a short break to regroup, before continuing. Kids go thru hard times in their own lives and sometimes need a day, where they get a break from everyone running their life. They need a day that they can retreat to a safe place-it may be in their room, in front of a screen playing gamrs, it may be outside at the park or riding their bikes, or it might be with a parent/ grandparent or other trusted adult soaking up some extra attention or getting the chance to vent their frustrations, etc. I definitely do see value in everyone having a mental health day every once in a while. I think other people benefit from kids receiving a very needed break. So long as it\u2019s not overly used, days off can help us (& kids) be better able to cope with life and all of its roller coaster turns. ",

            "answer_text": "No because this is now becoming a norm and an excuse for some. There has to be some guidelines to define the problem more clearly. There is not much done to address the symptoms. For example, recently Ronda Rousey came on TV and said she had suicidal thoughts after she lost her match the first time. Now she lost the second time. I wonder how she is behaving now. It could have been a natural reaction the first time as she was on such a high before with her life style. It was like a drug rush type of life she lived. Then it all went down so its natural reaction. Its not mental illness. The symptoms and guideline have to be defined. Yes it could be different person to person but there should be some pattern or trigger points that shows that behavior of the individual is dangerous. I think more research will eventually lead to such results. Its way too early. Plus school is not dangerous and kids will have more fun playing and learning with each other. Encourage them to participate in more school work then video games. If you think the problem is serious then why not send the kids to yoga and meditation classes. The problem will be solved this way. Encourage them to stick with it. At first its hard but it will do the trick. I would encourage every school in the world to have such programs where students can meditate and do yoga. ",

The problem is, if you fake an illness, you get treated for an illness and you still have to make up your homework, now you have twice the homework the next day. The pressure! The pressure! But children have been dealing with this pressure. You schedule your *cough* *cough* illnesses on a Friday and you get a friend to bring home your homework to work on the weekend. At least you have two days to do the work. I bet both teachers and parents have been in on the gig and no one\u2019s been fooled. So the question come down to, can kids take a true day off without homework and without making it up? No. That is shirking your responsibilities. As an adult you can take mental health days, but you still have to make up the work, you still have to meet deadlines, you still have to keep your responsibilities. In school, it\u2019s part of growing up. It\u2019s one of our growth pains, and it\u2019s not so bad of one. I do believe we need to bring this out of the shadows and stop faking an illness, but you still need to keep up with the same responsibilities. Call it taking online school today. ",

Even good kids and good students sometimes feel overwhelmed with school and come up with ways to stay home or worse. I did that a few times, too, even though I felt bad about it. The prospect of going to school on that particular day felt worse. Yes, it was my own fault for failing to do an assignment, or prepare for a test, and perhaps I should have learned to face my failures head on, but the point is, I didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t feel I could. To this day, I don\u2019t know if mom saw through me. I think she suspected but gave me the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019d rather have my own children honest with me than fake a sickness. Less worries for me, less shame and guilt for the kid. If it happens very rarely and there are no signs of some underlying problem, I think it\u2019s fine. Also, my friend\u2019s mom, every year when the first snow fell, would take him sledding instead of school. It\u2019s still among his fondest memories decades later. You tell me if one more day of school, once a year, could possibly be more important. ",

My school lets us have one unexcused absence per marking period (four a year), and this year, I have taken 3 days off (I'll take one more, but the fourth marking period just started). I'm one of those people who tries to be organized, and as more stressful things come into my life, I become completely unorganized. Usually I will take these days when I'm not feeling great, but not unwell enough to go to the doctor (sore throat, runny nose, ect.). To me these days are a chance for me to get my s**t together. I clean my room, organize my backpack, catch up on TV shows, and catch up on homework and other assignments. Like recently I had tech week for a musical I was in. If you don't know what tech week is, it's the week before the show with usually 5\u20138 hour rehearsals, with lights, sets, and costumes. At the end, I'm usually whipped, so I don't get anything done. After the show ended, I took a day off to get some sleep and clean. Also, sometimes, you just need a break from the work, and the drama that high school entails. I definetly believe that mental health days are benifical for any students who need them. ",

            "answer_text": "I live in an area where too many children in high-achieving high schools are killing themselves. I attended one sych school thirty years ago, and I recall joking that even the stoners went to college. Many of my classmates were accepted to elite universities. Kids used to weep cathartically after big exams back then, but no one killed themselves. My point is, school was a pressure cooker back in the 80\u2019s. My sons recently that same high school, and from my observation, it's even worse now. Kids cannot finish their assigned work even if they stay up past midnight, and the pressure to perform is inescapable. Remember when I said no one killed themselves while I was in high school 30 years ago? about three years ago, they lost *six*. From suicide. I spoke to one former principal of one of these schools, and she told me how after these suicides, they tried to ease back the academic load for the kids\u2019 welfare, and provide them some balance. This was short-lived: the parents demanded that the same super-rigorous programs return. TL/DR: I am all for mental health days. Compared to suicide and self-harm, I'm happy to let a kid take a day off. ",

The mind and body are connected. Mental health issues carry just as many intense risks of complications. People can die, and are dying from mental illness. If you tell a student that they have to attend school despite their mental health concerns, you are telling them that their success is important, and their mental health is not. This is the perfect recipe for a downward spiral. If it is negatively affecting their life in any way, it is worth it to seek treatment. If they need to take extended time off school for their mental health, options for doing schoolwork at home can be discussed to try and avoid falling behind. But they should absolutely have that right. They are not just trying to be lazy. TL/DR: it shouldn\u2019t just be allowed. It should be encouraged. ",

One of my fondest memories was a day in high school. I was dressed and ready to walk to the bus stop. But, I was dragging. It had been one of those weeks. A couple of tests, some other stuff, etc. And then, my mom looked at me and asked, \u201cDo you really want to go to school today?\u201d I was kind of surprised. Mother went on to suggest that I just take the day off and stay home. It was so out of character for her that I didn\u2019t know what to do. But I stayed home and rested and loved every minute of it. Mama knew that I needed it even if I didn\u2019t know it. ",

However, it is also not to be used as a crutch to avoid responsibility and accountability for getting work done and their lives managed. There is a balance to be struck-it is not an easy \u2018out\u2019, but it is a necessity. ",
