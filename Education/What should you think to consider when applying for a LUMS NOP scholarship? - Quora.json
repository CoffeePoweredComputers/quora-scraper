The National Outreach Programme of LUMS has allowed students from all over Pakistan of diverse income backgrounds and educational experiences to access a quality education at LUMS. I would keep in mind the following elements for my application, if I were in your shoes: What my goal for my studies is, and how I expect it to be fulfilled from my education at LUMS.How a LUMS education is beneficial for my academic learning and skill development in the workforce and beyond.This scholarship programme has typically been selecting students whose ability to access LUMS is the generally the least out of Pakistani students. Accessibility, in this case is defined as: Geographical distance: if the student resides in a non-urban area distant from Lahore, Punjab.Financial access: if the student belongs to a household with limited disposable income for private education.Educational access: if the student belongs to a non-urban school versus an urban school.Social access: how capable the student is socially able to access LUMS - whether they have classmates, relatives or associates who are students or know a student.",
