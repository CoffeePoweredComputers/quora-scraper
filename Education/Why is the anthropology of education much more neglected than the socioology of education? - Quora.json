Consider these definitions from Merriam Webster: Dictionary by Merriam-Webster: America's most-trusted online dictionary UPDATE: ADDITIONAL DEFINITION AND CITATION: Definition of institution a significant practice, relationship, or organization in a society or culturethe institution of marriage also : something or someone firmly associated with a place or thingshe has become an institution in the theater Definition of INSTITUTION Definition of anthropology 1: the science of human beings, especially : the study of human beings and their ancestors through time and space and in relation to physical character, environmental and social relations, and culture 2: theology dealing with the origin, nature, and destiny of human beings Definition of ANTHROPOLOGY Definition of sociology 1: the science of society, social institutions, and social relationships, specifically : the systematic study of the development, structure, interaction, and collective behavior of organized groups of human beings 2: the scientific analysis of a social institution as a functioning whole and as it relates to the rest of society Definition of SOCIOLOGY While anthropology and sociology both have to do with the study of human beings, sociology is the one that focuses more deeply on human INSTITUTIONS. Education is an institution. Thus, a study of Educational Anthropology would probably be far less common, and much more likely to be a narrow field of a few Ph.D. level and beyond for research, while Ed Soc is a functioning and useful field of knowledge for educators in the field and is thus considered more often.

            "answer_text": "Funding. No funding institution here cares about education in a non western society, where it may be profoundly mixed with religion, politics, or what we consider \u201ctrade schools\u201d. Sociology takes the approach of Education as 1 of the basic institutions, as a process of socialization, and therefore has an application that is both designed for and ( not surprisingly ) well suited to the Western concept of Education. All of Western Societies approaches are to bring our style of education to other societies. That was the implicit understanding in not allowing *native* children to speak in their native language. That was, on a basic level, dysfunctional to the mission of teaching them ( socializing them) how to work and live in a western society. There is a reason that anthropology is either unloved, neglected, or outright hated by many people. It is the reason archaeology is the most loved part of anthropology - anthropology preserves and attempts to understand - on the terms of the other culture - another culture. The cultures that archaeology studies are either western- and aggrandize our past and our progress, or non western and non threatening. They are dead and gone, or consigned to the scrapheap of history. By tightening and controlling funding, any curiosity that isn\u2019t part of the grand scheme ( functional and sometimes unconscious) to further our societies dominance is left to whither and die. ",
