            "answer_text": "Economics is something which is never gonna die. No wonder DU puts cut offs for Eco. courses starting at 99. Its a reputed degree anybody can get for graduation, and can land you a well paid job. Amity is easy to go to and anybody can go to Amity. That is what makes the studies done there less valued because you are not competing with anybody. You are not leaving behind anybody. But i guess you tried everywhere also, alas, couldn't get your hands anywhere else like most. But since the reputation of the course itself is a lot you don't have to worry much. Just make sure you give your most to it. Dont just rely on the academia which Amity will provide you. Take extra steps. Like studying things in detail than asked for. Start interning from 1st year only. Make plans for post-graduate and start preparation. Undoubtedly there will be a gap between your graduation and people doing their graduation from SRCC. How you can compensate that gap is upto you entirely. And you will only have three years for that. Hope i motivated you enough. Lol. Good luck with your grad life. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, \u201cIt is not the degree, it is you\u201d. So the University will give you a paper of degree mentioning your full time course but it is only you who can use that knowledge effectively. So the Answer is - Yes. It holds a great value because the University is recognised by University Grants Commission (UGC) and also you will have lot of things to learn in University, more than some of the colleges from DU. It depends on you how you perform in your semester , how much knowledge you gain and how effectively you apply your theoretical knowledge in the practical world. Faculties and Staff are very good but University focuses more on academics so attendance is definitely a big issue. Apparently it is the biggest issue in Amity University. 75% is compulsory and if above 95%, you will get 5 marks for each subject and believe me those 5 marks matters a lot in your Internal Assessment and overall CGPA. With my experience of past 5 years at Amity University, I can proudly say Amity University definitely gives you thousands of chances to grow yourself (from library to Incubator) but it is only upto you how you utilise them . P.S - H Block is Best. ",
