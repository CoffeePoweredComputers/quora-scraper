            "answer_text": "There are many to choose from. The BABOK and PMI Practitioners Guide are excellent source material. Distilled books such as seven steps business analysis is also a very good source. I can vouch for this one, as I know the author and the publishing company. Early works on business analysis suggest that use of specific diagrams, possessing a technical background or being a strong facilitator is what makes a successful business analyst. Seven Steps to Mastering Business Analysis advances the field by illustrating how all of these factors combined, along with many others, are the key to success. This book gives insight into the ideal skills and characteristics of successful business analysts and provides a foundation for learning for effecting business analysis work. This guide will also help prepare you for business analysis certification by explaining the tasks and knowledge areas in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK(TM)).

            "answer_text": "There are so many book\u2019s available in the market to learn the business analysis. According to me top 3 are1. BABOK 3.02. Delft Design Guide3. Sprint (I prefer this one) We have 4 levels for business analysis domain in the market: Level 1 - ECBALevel 2 - CCBALevel 3 - CBAPLevel 4 - CBATL My recommendations to all students who want to go in the business analysis: I suggest you to go to any good middle level IT company (I suggest you to try in service base) and ask then to take you as a trainee in Business analysis domain. Most of the company don\u2019t hire the fresher\u2019s for business analysis domain as it was very difficult for them to train the new candidate for business analysis domain as compare to any developer or QA member or having 1 year of experience. If you also want to do an MBA from good college with good placement record , they will also ask you to have atleat 2 years (24 months) of work experience in BA domain in past. Here I am listing out some of the tools/process business analyst must know :1. Agile process 2. Scrum process 3. Complete microsoft office 4. Microsoft Visio 5. Atleat 2\u20133 wireframing tools 6. Project management 7. All kind of documentation like FRD, BRD, SRS, SOW\u2026etc Different company use their business analyst in different way like some of the company use business analyst for project documentation, some use them for wire-framing, some use them to create test cases, some use then as a project researcher \u2026etc. I hope My answer will help you to make your decision.
