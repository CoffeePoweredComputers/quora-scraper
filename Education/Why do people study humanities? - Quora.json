            "answer_text": "I wish I\u2019d write an answer so beautifully elaborate and compelling that your heart melts with pleasure and your mind blooms wisdom. I\u2019ve yet to reach such personal balance and mastery of the written word, so instead, I\u2019d like to offer you something else, a superficial, yet humorous, I hope, explanation:  People study humanities for all sorts of reasons: \u201cBecause they\u2019re girls and girls aren\u2019t good at math or at tech stuff.\u201d This is sadly a widespread stereotype so deeply embedded in modern culture that it actually affects how interested girls are in tech/math/science and how well they perform on these subjects. In fact, there\u2019s such a connection between the two, that the moment \u201clife-science\u201d was cool for girls, a huge number of girls started, all of a sudden, being good at life-sciences. Somedays I wonder if this would happen should we eliminate the gender-separators in sports, you know, have women outclassing men in the same race. That would be something.Because some people absolutely love stuff that other people have no interest in, or are, perhaps, intimidated by, or can\u2019t really find a way to understand or be good at. Stuff like topology, artificial intelligence, turing-complete programming languages, bayesian statistics, stochastic processes <insert a georgecarlinesque enumeration here>. Or mechatronics, which I\u2019ve mentioned separately because it\u2019s such a funky and cool word. Could you believe it, there are other people that are interested in poetry, psychology, literature, sociology, philosophy, logic, argumentation, aaah, all the \u201cogy\u201d and the \u201cion\u201d at the end..Because, broadly speaking, you\u2019re dealing with people, no matter what you do, even if you study mechatronics, you\u2019re dealing with people, you need to learn something about people in order to do your job. You need to know people have fingers before you can make a keyboard, and you need to know about how humans learn so that you can develop a keyboard people find easy to use. I could go on, but there\u2019s not one profession in this world that isn\u2019t, in some way, human-related, even if all you do is wipe the dust off the hdds in the data center of some corporation, those hdds still hold important stuff on them with or about people. That\u2019s a really bad example/analogy I just gave, nobody wipes the dust off hdds in data centres, I just couldn\u2019t go with the \u201cyou could be the janitor\u201d, because I happen to believe that janitors are really cool, and I\u2019d actually include one in one of my novels as a main character.Because people have a drive to look for meaning, and humanities teach you about meaning, how to see what it is, how to find it, what it\u2019s made of etc Consider that essentially all of what we have in terms of knowledge today indirectly developed from humanities. Even more so, all of the freedoms and the liberties that you have today, you have because of humanities. Because of the art of deliberation, negotiation, strategy and manipulation, other words that end in \u201cation\u201d, such as nation. Meaning is something you, I, everyone, needs. It\u2019s this huge wordplay and irony, I suppose, though I\u2019ll answer that later.Because they take your brain on a trip upon a magic swirling ship. I had this one interview I was supposed to talk about \u201cwhat my values are\u201d. That was horrible. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know what values are. I can evaluate what other people have as values and I can see what their value hierarchies, and potentially even come up with a theory as to why they ended up with such a value system, and relate that to a lot of other things. I can do a lot of things, I know a lot of things, I know a lot of words, I have the best of words. Yet I found myself not able to come up with any half-decent answer. Some days later, pondering, I realised why: I\u2019m likely a self-denying self-actualizer that\u2019s going through an existential crisis OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. It\u2019s not the vocabulary, it\u2019s the concepts. I had the concepts to frame my inability and diagnose my issue. I still haven\u2019t fixed that issue, though trust me, no amount of pills ever will. The only way anything but self-knowledge and exploration and love will fix my issues is if you build me a time machine and teleport MY MIND into my 3-year old body, with all the skills and memories I have today.Because humanities people rule the world. Sure, you get 400k and some other perks at facebook, fine. Not you personally, \u201cMann\u201d sort of like in German, which is an awesome language. Do you think you\u2019re happier than I know how to be? Hah, let\u2019s not talk about me, there\u2019s something intrinsically wrong about me, let\u2019s talk about someone awesome, such as Dushka Zapata, she wrote a book about \u201cHow to be ferociously happy\u201d. Do you understand, there are simply so many things you can understand in so many ways, can you, will you? Being happy, that\u2019s something that many people, sadly, need to learn. And that\u2019s something humanities can offer (unless you figure out a way to normalise the use of heroin). Least we forget about all the Presidents and politicians, leaders of whatever sort of company or corporation you know \u2026 etc etc It really is mostly humanities people.I\u2019ll leave this one empty, for your own thoughts to fill:",
