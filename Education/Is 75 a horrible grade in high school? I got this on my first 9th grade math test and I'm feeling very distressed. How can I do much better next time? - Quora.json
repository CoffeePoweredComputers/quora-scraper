            "answer_text": "In all honesty, it\u2019s your first test. You have nothing to worry about. That being said, I think that it\u2019s good that you recognize that there is room for improvement and that you worry now over something like your first math test of high school. Don\u2019t ever lose that, especially as you go into your 10th, 11th, and 12th grade. With that, what you got is about a solid C which means you passed, but it is a matter of you\u2019re own standards. I am going to assume that you want at least a B since you are asking about whether or not a C is bad on your first test. As long as you use this test as a learning moment and aim to do better in the future, then you should be fine. Just don\u2019t let the 75 become a routine thing. In the future, make sure to ask your teacher lots of questions. If you don\u2019t understand something, ask your teacher for help. If that means you need to schedule individual meetings to sit down and go over content, then you need to do that. Also practice lots of problems. Especially with math, you have to keep practicing. Find problems from your textbook, internet, or your teacher. There are also plenty of online resources as well for you to use to assist you with math and other subjects you might be struggling with. However, the most important thing you can do it to stay DETERMINED. For a lot of people, a 75 (C) can be discouraging, but don\u2019t let it do that to you. Instead, use it to motivate you to do better on the next test and try to figure out what you did wrong on this test. As long as you believe in yourself and continue to try and study hard, you should be just fine! ",

            "answer_text": "75 is not a horrible grade, it's an ok grade. You can improve by paying close attention in class and making sure you understand the concepts. Sit in the front of the class if you can. Back in the day, I took extensive notes when the teacher went over problems and read the definitions of the expressions from the textbook to understand. If that wasn't enough, I searched math problems online and general concepts. Practice as much as you need to. You sound like you care enough to do an awesome job in the future. Stay focused, I believe in you. ",
