            "answer_text": " 1- Decoder :- so this app does nothing but we can write or develope our code (python cpp java etc) here  2- Quora:- best place to share knowledge and learn something new.  3-Udemy:- probably the best app here the provide almost all subject [PAID]  4- Wikipedia:- This dates me a little, but I remember a time when people actually had multiple volumes of the encyclopedia on their bookshelves. Nowadays, we have Wikipedia. The Wikipedia app is a wellspring of knowledge on virtually every subject from academics to pop culture. Instead of lugging around multiple heavy volumes of the encyclopedia, you can now access millions of articles at your fingertips. Students be warned, however. Because literally anyone can edit articles in Wikipedia, most teachers do not consider it a reliable source of information for essays and other assignments. Instead of citing Wikipedia as the source, look up the original sources listed at the bottom of a specific Wikipedia article and then cite those in your research papers. the last but not least  5- Khan Acadmy:- Khan Academy is the non-profit brainchild of Sal Khan (no, not the Star Trek villain). Before founding the world-famous organization, Khan was a teacher, entrepreneur, and hedge fund analyst. In 2012 he was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. What\u2019s different about the Khan Academy app when comparing it to services like Ude my or Lynda, however, is that all its courses are offered 100% for free. Like, literally. You can take as many of Khan Academy\u2019s professionally taught courses at absolutely zero cost to you. Most of the organization\u2019s classes focus on more \u201cacademic\u201d subjects, such as math, science, and the humanities, though there are some great courses on c omputer science, too . ",
