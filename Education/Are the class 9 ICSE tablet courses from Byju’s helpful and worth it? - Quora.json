Well if you are asking this question I assume you have already downloaded the app but the thing is we don't provide the ICSE board syllabus in demo so you seems to be confuse don't worry about the syllabus. Second thing its usefulness well take any standard from 6 to 12 visualisation of concept and in from of video makes learning more easy. Consider your self reading a interesting novel. Tell me how many days it will take you to complete it ? May be 4 or 5 days. Now think about the movie which is based on the same novel. How much time you feel you require? At max 4 hours. Now observe the time difference. At the same time video makes your concentration skill sharp. Again think about your self reading a book. You first read the text so your brain first process it and try to visualise it how it will look. Think about video you will not have to visualise we will do that job for you all you need to do is focus. Last but not the least you may be reading a book at the same time lost in your fantasy. But when you want video if you lost somewhere your video will miss out and you will need to watch it again. Coming to quality of video I Guess our advertisement had said enough about them and you can check demo app by your self. Plus there is testing facility too. Adaptive practise sessionMultiple choice questionsSubjective questionsQuozo to test your skill with entire globe.So over all it's complete self study pack where you can learn and improve on your all fundamental concepts. If you have any query regarding price or more details feel free to drop a comment or message me. Happy learning\u2026.!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, i am a student of class 11 th and i think that atleast at this stage you dont need any such tablet courses. And to be honest they aren\u2019t good too. Let me make it very clear that those courses will go serial wise. Chap 1 then 2 then 3..... which is definitely not going to happen in your school. After all performing in school is your concern in class 9(which is not the case in class 11.) All you need is good teachers and regularity in self study, nothing else. Such courses become a hindrance in your school preparation. ",
