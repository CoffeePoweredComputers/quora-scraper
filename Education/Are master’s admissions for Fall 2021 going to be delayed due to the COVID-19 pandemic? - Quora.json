            "answer_text": "It is too soon to tell the effect of COVID-19 on the Fall 2021 admissions. Universities, at large, are hopeful that operations will start running smoothly by then. Though, I should mention that there will be some tough competition in 2021 during admissions. This is because many students have either deferred their education or are thinking of applying for a Master\u2019s next year. It is likely these students will face tough competition as colleges will receive applications in large numbers. This, however, is just a speculation. Fall 2020 is the best time to apply for your master\u2019s because there is less competition. Many universities have even let go off the admission requirements of standardized tests \u2192 Northeastern University - Standardized Academic Tests Waived Off You can watch this video to know more about the impact of COVID-19 on Fall 2021 admissions.

            "answer_text": "Well if we look at the admission cycle in India, majorly the university academic year starts in end of July or first week of august, We are still in end of April, a full three months away from start of the next academic year. According to most experts the pandemic curve will peak out around mid may in India and then it will flatten. With large number of measures being taken including lockdown, social distancing and now even the antidote and vaccine are almost ready, In my opinion I see the session starting on time. And regarding admissions, almost all the major education leaders have already started the online admissions processes including the entrance tests some large universities like LPU have even concluded the video interviews for Management programs. Even in worst case scenario I don\u2019t see the admissions and academic session delaying beyond one month from normal times. I hope this serves the query. DVD ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question Ravi. It's really soon to comment on impacts of Covid-19 on Fall 2021 master's admission as everyone is being really very optimistic. If we succeed in getting vaccine and proper treatment by then, world will be in a better shape. But yes! Covid-19 has a huge impact on Fall 2020 Master's admission. I was supposed to go this year but I am not going and I know lot of other people who have already decided that they aren't going for Fall 2020. Below are the reasons behind this decision. Very obvious reason Covid-19 itself. High death rate, restrictions on international travel, Visa embassies temporarily being closed.When there was financial meltdown in 2008-09 it took 20 months for things to comeback to track then recovery started in late 2010 and early 2011 so people who went to study in 2008 and 2009 had a nightmare. Everyone is giving enough thought before deciding anything.Point 2 will still be valid for Fall 2021, but let's hope for the best. If we come out of this problem soon, world can still cope up with the hard hit economy and things will be better for international students. Please go through my below answer to get more clear idea on how universities are dealing with everything for Fall 2020. Shreya Singh's answer to How will covid-19 affect MS applications? Hope this helps :) ",
