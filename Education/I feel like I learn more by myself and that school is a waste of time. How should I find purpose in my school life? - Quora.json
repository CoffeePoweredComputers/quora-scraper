            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a fact that adults know that you haven\u2019t yet learned. Sitting in class while a trained lecturer spoon-feeds you curated knowledge is the easiest and most efficient way to acquire basic knowledge. If it wasn\u2019t, school would be different. You cannot understand the relevance of some of the stuff you\u2019re learning (political history, for instance), because you haven\u2019t been called on to use any of that knowledge yet. Math is the same, you can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d ever need to factor a polynomial. That comes later. You have to trust that the stuff they teach in high school is the stuff that almost every single person needs to know later in life. OK, maybe not factoring polynomials. Pace too slow? Wah! Get a job. Then you\u2019ll be grateful for the slow pace. By the way, when you go to college, you won\u2019t have any trouble with the pace being too slow or the material too basic. In my locality, the public school system has an agreement with the community college system to permit high school students to take free college credits. This may ratchet up the level of the coursework enough to suit discerning tastes such as yours. Your root problem may be that you find spending six hours a day on anything but playing video games to be tedious. I\u2019m with you there, bro. But the thing is, it\u2019s how the world is. Very, very soon, you\u2019ll be out in the world working 8 or 10 hours a day to make a living, and you will suddenly come to realize how minimal were the demands of high school. If you studied diligently, you will be qualified for a job that buys you way more video games. Your parents already told you this. They actually teach parents a class in how to break the news about the world to their children, so we all say the same thing. You take it when you\u2019re expecting your first child. Children never listen to their parents\u2019 good advice though, so go on railing against \u2018the man\u2019. Rebel a little, rebel a lot. In the end you will knuckle under and become that which you hate. Because it\u2019s reality. Ain\u2019t it a bitch. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s good that you feel you learn well by yourself. That skill will come especially in handy once school is over. The trouble with leaning on that ability too early is that we tend to learn on our own only what we want to learn, and what we want to learn is not always what we need to learn. My 5-year-old nephew is a pretty smart kid, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s learning new skills and information all the time on his own. At his age, with every other experience being new to him, much of what he learns he does unconsciously. If you ignore this unconscious learning, however, and consider only what he learns of his own volition, you are left with: how to use TNT to destroy everything in Minecraft,how to make a variety of fart noises, andhow to tease your younger brother until he cries.Now, of course, you aren\u2019t 5 years old, so your ability to distinguish useful from useless is likely superior. And if you have the discipline and ability to: curate or obtain a meaningful curriculum,engage in all of the related reading and exercises yourself, andmaster its contents truly better on your own than with the guidance and motivation of a teacher,then maybe school is not so important for you. This is the way that smart, successful adults continue learning all the rest of their lives. The very fact that you have asked this question, however, suggests to me that your self-assessment is a bit inflated, and that, while you\u2019re a substantial ways away from being my nephew, you are not quite ready to make it on your own. What you\u2019re learning in school is more important than what you think is important. Trust this statement\u2014at least for now. After all, you have many years ahead to make up any lost time as an independent learner. See also Jason Roos's answer to Why do we need to go to school? ",
