            "answer_text": "The common career path would go as follows: Graduate high school well enough to be accepted into a UniversityStudy for 3\u20134 years to get your bachelors or undergraduate degree as a prerequisite for obtaining a masters degreeStudy for 2 years to get your masters degree or graduate degreeApply to a PhD programAs I\u2019ve come to know, some universities in some countries let you pursue a PhD straight after your bachelors, so you\u2019d end up with 3+4=7 years of studies. I suppose that\u2019s more for people who are oriented towards a career in Academia and you\u2019d then be looking at at least one or two post-doctoral appointments, each somewhere around 2 years. As a physics professor told me, then you pretty much only get a PhD for three main reasons: You\u2019re interested in it and want to know moreYou want a career in Academia and you can\u2019t do it without a PhDThe job you want to have required a PhD in some fieldUnless it\u2019s one of those three, you don\u2019t need a PhD and you\u2019re totally fine with just a masters. But to my knowledge, which of course is limited, I don\u2019t know of any programs that allow you to do only four years of studies (equivalent to a bachelors program) and then give you the right to be called \u201cdoctor\u201d. To me, after having spent five years in university, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise, reasonable or warranted. A PhD means you have mastered your field and unless you are a truly, truly unique and gifted individual, it is very unlikely you\u2019d succeed in four years right after high school. I don\u2019t recommend it. Plus, every smaller defense prepared you for the big one - it can be hours. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure you can - as long as you meet the requirements for entry to the program. However you\u2019re unlikely to find a program that doesn\u2019t require a bachelors and likely even a masters degree in the field, including very specific expectations for which courses you\u2019ve taken and how you\u2019ve performed in them. And to be considered for entry to most doctoral programs you\u2019ll need endorsements from professors in the form of letters of recommendation. Not to be negative, but - good luck with that. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it would be possible in a very rare circumstance (which I really can\u2019t envision). However, it\u2019s highly unlikely and improbable. My experience is that doctoral programs require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree as a prerequisite; the degree need not be in the same course of study, but the college is looking to see if the candidate can handle the rigor of college study. Also, many colleges also require a master\u2019s degree as a prerequisite for doctoral study. There are notable exceptions to this, but it\u2019s important that the candidate read and understand the admission requirements at the college or university he or she is applying to. ",

Depending on the country you\u2019re in (and the results you get beforehand), you\u2019ll need at least an undergraduate university degree to qualify for a PhD. In some places - and with some results - you\u2019ll also need a masters-level degree as well. Obviously you\u2019ll need to have completed secondary education before you move into tertiary education, but you won\u2019t be able to graduate from school and go straight into PhD research. ",
