            "answer_text": "I started learning Russian a year ago. I found a few people on MyLanguageExchange with whom I'm practising weekly in return for help with French. Russian works fundamentally different from English or French, which makes it quite interesting to learn for anyone who likes to look at things (in this case, languages) from a different perspective. Plus, I get to talk with interesting people with various life experiences and various backgrounds. And I even get to practice my communication skills. Yeh! Learning a language is certainly something you can enjoy and something you can benefit a lot from. ",
