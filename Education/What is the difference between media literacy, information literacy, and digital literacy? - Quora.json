            "answer_text": "It might help to substitute the word \u201csophistication\u201d for \u201cliteracy.\u201d It means more than a surface or textbook understanding of something. To understand how things operate in the real world. Media seems self-explanatory. Without further adjectives, it means all methods used to distribute information. Information literacy to me means a more abstract understanding of how we communicate. It means person to person; person to machine; machine to machine. It can involve language, voice, visual forms, etc. A 1976 theory by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene, introduced the concept of another form of communication called a meme and launched the field memetics. Digital literacy is the field of packaging information in bits and bytes and all the new technologies this has made possible. It's vast, and has advanced in parallel with quantum physics. I am fascinated by both, but pretend only a layman's grasp, having satisfied my science requirement in college with an auditorium class called \u201cPhysics for Poets.\u201d I don't think these are precise terms, hence some variation in their meaning.
