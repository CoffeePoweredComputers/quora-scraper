            "answer_text": "Well, speaking very frankly, I can say you that there's no separate cut off is being released till this year. It is same for every board and the marks scored by you will be the decider. So there is a very less chance that even a BSEB topper will get into top 10 colleges of DU. It means either the admission criteria of DU is not considerable or the marking procedure of BSEB is not good. We know that a CBSE student who scores 90%\u201395%, can score only 72%-77%. But this is the truth of our system. So if one have to get into DU, he/she must have to join CBSE. ",
