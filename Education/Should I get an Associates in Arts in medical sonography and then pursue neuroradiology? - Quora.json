            "answer_text": "A degree in medical sonography let\u2019s you perform ultrasound procedures. You then take additional courses and testing for certificates in ob/gyn, vascular, neurosonography, echocardiography, abdomen/small parts, opthalmic etc. Asides from performing newborn head ultrasound or carotid doppler, there is not much neuro work in sonography. There are ways to get involved in Neuroradiology as a technologist. You need initial training as a registered technologist - 2\u20134 yrs curriculum. Then additional training in CT/MRI or Interventional Radiology. These technologists do neuro work, only part of the time. They also work on other parts of the body. To become a neuroradiologist takes much longer. You need a Bachelor degree (4 yrs), MD degree (4 yrs), internship (one year), radiology residency (4 yrs) then fellowship training in neuroradiology (1\u20132 years). There is no pathway that allows you to go directly into neuroradiology. ",

Do you realize how many additional steps are required after obtaining an AA degree? Think about it first, then rephrase your question from scratch. Good luck. ",
