            "answer_text": "Science is a part of alchemy. Alchemy requires a desire to improve oneself, something which science is missing. Science only concentrates on the materialistic/measurable. Alchemy stands far above science. The Will and Intent are still way beyond science. See alchemy as a spiritual practice that incorporates science as a tool. What is magic? What was once magic is now incorporated into Materialism. In terms of alchemy, it also encompasses magik. However, it has nothing to do with wands or sorcerers. The same can be said of Wikka magic, especially the white kind. Alchemical magik is simply understanding nature way beyond what modern science can fathom with its self-imposed limitations. More than 99% of existence cannot be measured by modern science. Science relies on fairly simple instruments and simple experiments. It does not use the power of the extremely complex human body. It solely is concerned with the \u2018objective\u201d which is actually a small portion of the subjective. It is primitive in my opinion as a practicing scientist. Yet, it does help allege human suffering in its primitive way. Science is yet young. Alchemy stemmed from Egypt or possibly before. That makes it at least 5,000 years old. Modern science is just a baby. Give it time to catch up. Magic is all around you. Just pay attention and forget science. It is trivial. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Both. Alchemy is the precursor to chemistry.  It was an attempt to understand the world around us. People noticed that matter could be changed from one form to another. That you could, for instance, extract gold from ore. And they attempted to understand how this was done.  But two problems emerged. The first is that the scientific method hadn\u2019t been properly formalized yet. It wouldn\u2019t be until 1621, when Francis Bacon wrote \u201cNovum Organum Scientiarum\u201d. Meaning that alchemy was as much baseless speculation as inductive reasoning. The second was that alchemists were secretive. Modern science is an international collaboration built on the free exchange of ideas. Alchemists, at least Western alchemists, jealously hoarded knowledge and kept it stored in ciphers and metaphorical codes. The result of these two problems is that a lot of alchemy isn\u2019t just wrong, it\u2019s completely unrelated to reality. An alchemic text might have an actual explanation of how to produce a certain tincture, derived from actual observation. It might also have a completely baseless explanation of how this process occurs due to the interactions of the four elements. And the whole thing might be hidden in a picture of salamanders. Magic as much as science.  Eventually the magic part was abandoned as being useless. Experts differ on exactly when, but the discovery of oxygen is a pretty good boundary. Conclusive proof that air was not an element but a mixture of multiple elements was the last nail in the coffin of alchemy. And the birth of the science of chemistry. ",
