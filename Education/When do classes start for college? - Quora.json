Depending upon the size of the student body, many classes are offered at different times and/or on different days. it is often the case that old schedules, from the year before, are closely followed, although the instructors may be different. Some classes are only offered in even or odd years and some only in the evening, especially graduate courses (for working students wanting a master\u2019s degree). ",
