You now have all the ingredients in order to solve this problem. Now set up a proportion, 28/100=392/x28/100=392/x where x represents the total number of students. Cross multiply and you know have, 392\u2217100=28\u2217x392\u2217100=28\u2217x Now divide 28 on both sides (392\u2217100)/28=x(392\u2217100)/28=x Do the arithmetic. The total number of students is 1400. ",

The question that you should then ask yourself is that if 28% corresponds the 392 students who failed the exams, then what would 100% of the students correspond to? Take 100% and multiply it by 392 students then divide it by 28% to give you 1400. This now becomes the total number of students that sat for the examination. ",
