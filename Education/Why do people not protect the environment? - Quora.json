            "answer_text": "People don\u2019t want to protect the environment because they have jobs dependent on unsustainable practices, and they don\u2019t want to see entire ways of life disappear. Look at logging. People in logging towns have been chopping down trees for generations and benefitting from the economic boom it gives their town. But then, instead of creating ways of sustainable logging, we just decide to constrict the places they are allowed to log at (which just makes corporations log elsewhere) and that pits the working class against the left, the opposite of what should be happening. No, we should have nationalized logging that uses special practices so that we still get wood and our children can get wood. However, the environmental movement is full of educated and posh urbanites who do not understand that people need to have jobs, and that it should be left to the libertarian right to try and systemically target the working class and leave them unemployed. Another example is fishing. Instead of kicking out large corporations, setting up cooperatives of local fishermen and setting up regulations justified by the idea that the people will not be able to fish anymore if there are no fish left, the environmentalists just made it about shitting on blue-collar people and ending their way of life. And now, we have fish raised in fish farms, which are incredibly inhumane are in defiance of nature. And then there are the times when environmentalists are just plain ridiculous. Chasing steel mills out of a city because they are making a city smoggy is just posh idiocy; smog is part of living in an industrial society and if there isn\u2019t smog in America there will be far more smog out in China. If you want to invent new steel mills that don\u2019t burn coal I would love to see them but we don\u2019t have those yet. Now, I am not saying all environmentalists are like this. I consider myself an environmentalist. I believe in global warming, I think green industries would help people and the planet. I am not one to defend big oil or any other large corporate lobby like them that are destroying our environment. But far to many environmentalists are like how I am describing, and they are the reason more people are not pro-environment. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole question of what \u2018people\u2019 do for the environment is worthy of an essay all by itself. I can speak for myself alone here. I have fought the good fight. But the US is set up to favor suburbia over urban areas, to favor car commuters over people who use mass transit, and to favor energy-wasting built environment over anything that might have a shot at sustainability. In the case of NYC, things are actually going backward from when I moved here many years ago. Car ownership is increasingly necessary because the people in charge have allowed the transit system to fall apart. city residents now have much longer commutes, which is putting huge wear and tear on a century-old subway system; and households have to maintain two or more fulltime workers to keep up with housing prices. Walkable shopping has declined as real-estate interests have swept in and replaced affordable shopping as a way to force gentrification in neighborhoods, so a grocery trip nearly always requires a car. And government at all levels is choosing to fund the worst polluters and fuel users. The US has the worst excuse for a passenger rail system in the industrialized world, even as it\u2019s become clear that commercial airlines are untenable at the fuel prices anticipated with oil depletion. People can make individual choices that are more or less environmentally safe. But the really big choices have been made for us by politicians who think they can keep the status quo forever. I think people actually want to be actively involved in saving the planet. But beyond symbolic actions like swapping out lightbulbs and buying e-cars, the people who decide whether we\u2019re going to protect the environment are the people at the top getting fundraising checks from industries that (apparently) want to see the planet burn.
