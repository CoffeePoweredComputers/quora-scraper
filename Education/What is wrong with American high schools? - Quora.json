            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in high school, and I had a 96% in Biology last semester. What did I learn? Almost nothing. Counselors visit our home room class on occasion, to remind us of the critical importance our GPA will have on our lives. It determines whether we will hire people, or be hired. It determines whether you will drive a Mercedes-Benz or scrap metal liberated from a junkyard. GPA is everything. I consider myself lucky if I get six hours of sleep on a school night. That\u2019s a luxury I can seldom afford. Last year in Health class our teacher said us teenagers should aim for getting eight to ten hours of sleep if we want to stay healthy, but the entire class laughed. We thought that was hilarious. It was more likely that we would all grow wings and fly out of the classroom than get that much sleep. Last week I missed my goal of three to five hours of sleep, so in desperation I used a piece of military-grade caffeinated chewing gum as a pick-me-up. I was jittery and shaky the rest of the day, unable to focus. My handwriting was little more than scribbles and crazed gobbledygook. You can see how sleep deprivation can be a problem, especially during a time in which we are growing more than any other time in our lives. Being in high school is not fun. It\u2019s not the \u201cglory days\u201d as members of the previous generation call it, but a continuous cycle of ruinous nights, extreme stress and anxiety, and loneliness. I have never attended a party. Hardly ever hang out with friends. Never had a girlfriend. Why? Schoolwork. And that goes for everybody. Parties aren\u2019t really a thing anymore because everyone is so busy with work they have to do. Parents today scold us because we use smartphones. It\u2019s not my fault I was born seventeen years ago. I can\u2019t change that. I can guarantee that if anyone in history could be reborn seventeen years ago, they would use smartphones too. The world is so much worse than it was, say, forty years ago. Parents say, \u201cOh, but you didn\u2019t have to go through the Cold War\u2026\u201d or \u201cYour parents didn\u2019t have to fight in \u2018Nam, did they?\u201d This is true. But we have to deal with much than a dreaded attack from the Ruskies. I was born in an age of terrorism and fear. When I was born, the world seemed a relatively happy place, at least in the United States. But ten days later, that all changed. The 9/11 disaster occurred. There are documentaries about it every September, around my birthday. Middle aged people retelling the same story about how terrifying it was. And I feel so bad for those that had to experience that. But I\u2019ve had to grow up with this. It\u2019s normal to me. I\u2019ve become desensitized to terrorist attacks. Oh, another suicide bombing, another guy shooting up a mall.. it\u2019s horrible. But it doesn\u2019t faze me anymore. People of previous generations are crippling the environment. I\u2019ve made several speeches at my school as to why this is an issue, but to little avail. The President of the United States is an absolute joke, swearing and insulting minorities, trying to build a multi-billion dollar wall just to keep brown-skinned people out of what used to be their territory (Texas used to be part of Mexico). Tomorrow is supposed to be the Fake News Awards. What an embarrassment. Every day we have to wake up wondering whether the President has started a war with North Korea. Hundreds of white supremacists stormed the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, just a few months ago, donning swastikas and shouting \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d and racial slurs. I saw countless videos of African Americans being beaten by gangs of young white men, some of whom did not look much older than myself. I should not feel ashamed of the color of my own skin because of the barbaric racist history tied to it. The last thing I want is to be called racist because of my skin color. I saw a political cartoon of an old man watching the news, the headline reading \u201cCharlottesville Protests\u201d with a member of the KKK waving a Nazi flag on the screen. His face was in his hands, and he said \u201cNot again\u2026\u201d To me, this speaks volumes. It\u2019s like moving into your new apartment, only to find out it\u2019s been trashed. Beer cans litter the floor, a lamp is broken, the bathroom is filthy, paint chipping off the walls. Parents wonder, \u201cWhy are millennials so depressed these days? Must be those darn iPhones.\u201d No, it\u2019s because the Earth is dying, terrorists are thriving, America is floundering, and the Nazis are back. And my generation has to inherit it all. ",

            "answer_text": "Introduction: Providing some context for myself, I went to a smaller high school built exclusively for STEM subjects, and picked students from the surrounding areas that applied, so I have a bit of a different experience. I also took classes at other high schools during middle school, so I\u2019ve been around a bit. A lot answers point out the flaws of a traditional school system, such as excessive use of memorization, lack of support, extensive stress, focus on getting into college and disparity in terms of background, skill level, etc. These things are around because they\u2019re hard to fix. Causes: Some of it comes from the fact that the system is outdated. In today\u2019s economy, it\u2019s really really hard to be stuck inside one thing without rubbing shoulders against a bunch of other disciplines, and schools don\u2019t reflect that. Colleges are more demanding than ever, so high schools are desperately trying to get their students to become more and more exceptional, at the cost of emotional support. Societies run faster, so there\u2019s less time to do things. It doesn\u2019t help that funding is poor in many places, as Gaberial Poelman pointed out. Some of it comes from the fact that, well, high school students are teenagers. They need time and experience to transform into adults (I\u2019m almost 20, so I still feel the mental growth side quite a bit), and different people grow at different rates, depending on a whole host of factors. It\u2019s not easy being a teenager, especially in a complex environment such as ours. Balancing school, work, entertainment, friends, etc, while you are also trying to become more emotionally mature and socially independent is really, really hard. You\u2019re bound to screw up somewhere. I did. I\u2019m sure a lot of other high schoolers feel the same way, especially given the pressure of college applications these days. And lastly, some of it comes from the inherent problem of a system that should have been individualized. Every person learns differently, and everyone needs a different way of approaching the same thing. Subjects: Take history, for instance. Some people prefer timelines, dates, and organized events. Some people are frustrated by the fact that history is never clear cut, so doing this whole timeline thing is arbitrary. As Brooke Schwartz mentioned, rote memorization is a problem. It should act as placeholder in STEM subjects, and be secondary in liberal subjects. History, in particular, should not be treated as a memorization subject. It defeats the purpose; to teach history is an attempt to educate your society on said society\u2019s past achievements and problems, and to see where current problems come from. That takes discussion and time, neither of which classrooms can afford much of. With math, it\u2019s even worse. The only way to achieve mathematics on a level proficient enough for an engineering major is to apply it, and apply it heavily. There\u2019s no tricks, no way around this. You cannot go around learning Bernoulli, Navier-Stokes, or the Rocket Equation without a seriously solid background in calculus, and you have no chance in calculus without algebra solid enough to withstand and explosion of four or five variables. Algebra takes practice, hundreds, even thousands of problems of grinding through math. Now put in each of the other subjects, their own peculiarities, and add them on top of each other. What you end up with is a nightmare for both teachers and students, in a large part because no one can specialize enough at this early stage, and everyone is expected to do something. Given the efficiency of our education system, this becomes almost impossible. A student who was trained from an early age on how to study like me has an advantage. I kept my grades at the A line until the last year of high school. But this doesn\u2019t prepare you for the actual subject, which is why APs are in question in a lot of universities. Why teach college prep classes when your kids are not ready for the subjects in college? In a lot of colleges, the people who teach you the subject are actual professors, who spent their lives dedicated to said subject. Learn a social studies topic? Someone wrote their thesis paper on it. Learn linear algebra? The woman you are listening to probably has a theorem named after her. Learn computer science? Maybe the professor wrote his own language. Against this kind of rigor, a half-shot, hastily assembled base is useless. And poor funding and bad teaching exasperates this. The only way to do it properly is to individualize the approach to every student, and that\u2019s basically something the student has to learn from him or herself. Emotional Support, Sex Ed, and Counseling: On top of doing badly in the subjects that schools were supposed to teach, picking the right subject isn\u2019t always great either. Living in a dorm or an apartment requires the student to probably know how to cook, how to keep a budget, and if they have a job, how to pay taxes. These things should probably be taught, not only by the parent, but also by the school. The education system is supposed to prepare the student to become a member of society, both productive and prosperous, and the backbone of a society is their ability to feed themselves and interact with each other, along with the ability to sustain their population, form meaningful relationships, and form families, whether traditional or not. It\u2019s not just a question of more funding. It\u2019s a question of how we\u2019re approaching the problem. Counseling is important because to prepare a student for his or her future, there needs to be some sort of mentor who\u2019s been there, as well as people who understand how the age group in high school are best served. You can\u2019t just have a counselor who knows how to get kids into college, but you need at least that. High schools need a better understanding of how to teach sex ed, without being constrained by petty politics. An understanding of anatomy and physiology, contraceptive measures, and sexually-transmitted diseases should be taught. Better yet, understanding of healthy relationships and how to notice signs of depression and mental illnesses should also be included in a similar program, because people need that. People of all ages, but teenagers should be taught this in high school because they have a particular massive capacity to adapt and learn. What, and how, to Teach: How to learn is more important than what to learn, especially today. All the knowledge in the world is probably so massive no single society could have all of it at a time, let alone a single person, but people take different paths through life and they will need to know different things. High school, in particular, is a time where students are most available and willing to take in information, having the maturity to understand that they are growing, and the relatively blank slate of pre-adulthood, where they\u2019re not shackled by social and financial responsibilities. This is the best time to teach them how to learn, how to study, and how to understand not only academic, but technical, social, and even political ideas and topics, because they\u2019ll likely do that for at least four years in college. Ideally, high school students who go into college should be independent enough to live on their own, socially capable enough to make friends, and academically capable enough to not only approach a classroom, but a library or the Internet and start picking up things, finding out where to get mentors, building up knowledge with peers, etc. Some of these things come naturally from being around other high schoolers, but a lot of these could be improved with better approaches to high school education. Time, and Some Ideas to Solve These Problems: So how do we do all of this without killing the student? Here, we approach the final problem of the high school system. Students are burdened, overly so. Between extracurriculars and schoolwork, sleep time is lower than ever, and stress is higher than ever. A big part of this is to cut down on college applications. Give a better solution than 100,000 people applying to UCLA and only a few thousand getting in. Have more particularized rather than higher requirements, and lower costs for college so students don\u2019t kill themselves maintaining a 4.0 for their scholarships. Lower requirements means spending more time on things you actually really need for longer futures. If you\u2019re a STEM kid, you could afford to not play sports for 4 years in a row, and focus on building that app you always wanted. If you want to be an artist, you could apply based on your skills and talents. Grades reflect your competency in a subject, not your ability as a person; or at least, they should. Right now they do neither, and that wastes massive amounts of time. Homework is another big one. Math, English, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, all of these require practice. Large amounts of it. So make sure when you give homework, it\u2019s as efficient as possible. A better mixture of problems and projects would help, because it\u2019s as important to see things in a larger context as it is to be good at particular things. More teachers is another big one. Raise the pay, raise the reputation, and raise the amount of aides. Have more systems where talented students can help other students by becoming TAs in subjects, note-takers, and tutors. Use online learning to get the immediate summaries across, or even better, switch some homework time with some subject time. Particularly the earlier stages of teaching a STEM topic, because three heads are better than one, and there\u2019s usually three heads in a classroom and one at home. Distill textbooks. Problems can be generated. Textbooks are not worksheets, and do not require page after page of problems no one bothers to use properly. Teachers need to do this, so you need more teachers and more TAs. Available manpower is a big problem in high schools when you look at it this way. None of these things, of course, will entirely alleviate the problem, because we have an old system to work with. But engineers don\u2019t usually rip away the old thing entirely; they work with what they have, and what we have is a system capable of putting students in and putting some students out. Tweaks here and there, streamlining, and modifications could go a long way. It\u2019s picking the right changes that is hard. ",
