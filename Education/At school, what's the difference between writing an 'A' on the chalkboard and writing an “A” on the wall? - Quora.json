            "answer_text": "The former is probably a part of classroom activities. The latter (writing on a wall) is possibly an act of vandalism or at least property damage. Also, having spent my career largely in higher education, I have to say I haven\u2019t seen a chalkboard in many, many years. They have been replaced with whiteboards that use erasable, colored markers with which to write, smart boards to write digitally and project, and projection media (PowerPoint, etc.). A sampling of obsolete technology that I used at one point or another is a walk down the lanes of history! Mimeographs, microfiche, card punch and card sorter machines, carbon paper, correction tape or liquid, NCR paper, Selectric typewriters with type \u201cballs\u201d rather than individual keys, dot matrix printers, dumb terminals, dial up modems, bursters and decollators for greenbar printouts, etc. etc.!And yes, blackboards / chalkboards \u2192 whiteboards.",

            "answer_text": "A chalkboard (or, more commonly these days, a whiteboard) is a teaching tool. Its purpose is for people (teachers and students) to write on it. And yes, it\u2019s attached to the wall. Chalk or whiteboard markers are easily erased, so the board can be reused again and again. Any other wall, in most cases, is not meant for writing. Chalk or marker ink are harder to remove. Many teachers use the wall for educational posters, information and the like. Writing on it is considered defacement. So, teachers often invite students to write on the board\u2014show others their work, display examples for feedback, etc. This is part of regular teaching practice. Unless a teacher has specifically invited you to write on a wall, doing so is defacement or ,possibly, damage to someone else\u2019s\u2014or public\u2014 property. That\u2019s the understanding in schools. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Aaron. I can\u2019t answer a question of this nature with any authority. It is a philosophical one. Public property, to my mind, should be respected and appreciated because it belongs to you AND me. Thus, defacing public property is BAD, both intrinsically and extrinsically. The latter may be penalized by time in jail or imposition of a fine. The fine must cover remediation of the damage done to the property that was defaced (and the perpetrator may receive a lighter penalty if s/he performs the remediation). However, as mentioned, this is a societal/cultural question only answerable by members of the locality in which the property is situated. Of course, the property has not been defaced by chalk or other substances that can easily be washed off but rather must physically be restored using more costly methods of repair. Furthermore, even water (which will be transformed by the process as waste) is becoming or is a precious commodity in some localities/regions. Vandals should think twice about destroying public property (which is the intrinsic attribute of this breach of the social contract by individuals I alluded to. Maybe sitting in jail will allow the perpetrator to dwell on the extent of harm s/he has committed.) ",
