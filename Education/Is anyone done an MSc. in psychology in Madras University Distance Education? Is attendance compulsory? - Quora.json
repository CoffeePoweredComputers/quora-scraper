            "answer_text": "To answer the first question - Yes, I did my Masters in Psychology through IDE of Madras University. For the second one - One will have 10 theory classes per year and 50% attendance is mandatory in theory classes to be eligible to write the exams. Or else there will be a problem in getting your hall ticket generated. In the second year in addition to the theory classes, there will be classes for practicals which will be conducted on weekdays. Attendance on all 3days is mandatory. It will be a bit hectic and sort of fun also. It will be worth your time. Getting hands on in conducting questionnaires and such. The practical exam will be also on a weekday before which you will have complete your record for the exercises done and submit it on the day of the exam. Hope this addresses your query :) ",
