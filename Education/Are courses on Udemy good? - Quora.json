            "answer_text": "Udemy courses actually are pretty good, it\u2019s just a matter of picking the right ones and making sure you read the reviews. Hundreds of thousands of free coupons are claimed on Udemy daily. Udemy will run promotions on their site to give massive discounts on a wide range of course, but all \u2018free course coupons\u2019 will be issued by instructors, unless the course is free to begin with. The reason why many courses are free, is to help bring awareness of the course and to increase enrollment and reviews when the course first goes live. Once there are a decent amount of students and reviews for a course, it can then be switched over to a paid course that will earn money. If you can\u2019t find coupons for a course you are looking for, try contacting the course instructor and see if they will offer a free coupon code in exchange for a review. Check Facebook \u201cUdemy Coupons\u201d Groups for the latest coupons, and also use Google to search for \u201cfree Udemy courses\u201d. The reference below is updated often with new coupon codes on a monthly basis, while also listing other top Udemy coupon sites and blogs as well.

            "answer_text": "No, They are not. Though few are good, But 99% of the courses are delivered by non professionals. And not only that If they were good, Udemy would not have Sold $200 course at $10Money back guarantee for 30 days, tells even Udemy don\u2019t have trust in its course.Even you can deliver any non sense course on udemy as long as you course is more than 30 minutes long, have atleast 5 lectures and have HD quality video with no Background Noise.They don\u2019t have any professionals who can go through each course, but they do have staff for checking Noise and Video quality as told in point 3.Thus, even 10 hours long course do not guarantee Quality course.Also they have some stupid Trust and safety staff, which only looks for the safety of the Udemy Profits. what I mean is that if they find Instructor is trying to get students email Id or so, they will remove the instructor. And similary, if student asks for FREE coupons or so, they will close students Udemy Account.Udemy will never ever allow instructors to have students email id, because they think Instructor will Spam it. But, They themselves spam students email id. It seems correct to them.Overall, Udemy is meant only for making money , by just providing their Platform for selling non sense courses. Udemy is not for serving students.As far as Ratings are concerned, they are mostly fake. Because, Instructors generally distribute the FREE coupons to their relatives and friends to get those fake ratings. In case Udemy wanted transparency, it would have not allowed FREE users to provide any rating to the course.Also, Hypocratic Udemy\u2026.. Shows some bade of Best selling courses. But I have not understand so far, if they themself give bestselling stamp to the course, then what is the use of rating system.Overall, Udemy is surviving only due to it Advertising marketing policy.",

            "answer_text": "The question is really - how do you find a Good course on Udemy and when you do find one - how do you know that its good? There are over 20,000 courses on udemy and certainly over 8,000 instructors. There is a lot of wheat to separate from the Chaff. Here are my thoughts on the subject. Firstly, look at the instructors profile. You will be able to see straight away how many courses, how many unique students and how many total reviews the instructor has. The basic message here is the more the better. If you want a benchmarkt, 10,000 students, 6 courses, 100 reviews. This will enable you to be confident that this is a serious instructor - but its not the whole story. Find a range of courses that you think you may be interested in. Udemy search is not Google but use keywords close to your subject matter and open potential courses in new tabs. Now take a look at the courses themselves. How long is the course and how many lectures. Focused courses are good but they should be at least 20-30 lectures long - real lectures not text document padding and the videos should be 3 to 6 minutes long each. Very long videos (the max is 20 minutes) suggest either a waffly course or the instructor has cut down his material from some other origin and repurposed it for a udemy course. Read the ratings and reviews, particularly the bad ones. Check that the good ones come from people who have photographs. There are too many instant accounts and \"fabricated\" reviews which game the system Take the opportunity to check out the Promo Video and any videos which are on Preview - try before you buy! Compare the courses you have selected against each other - how do they cover the material and which course seems to do the best job of it. Where are the gaps? Which course most closely approaches a solution to the problem you have? When you are ready to buy....don't. Add the course to your wishlist and wait. Udemy has promotions all the time. Expect to pay between $10 and $19. If you are in a hurry, message the instructor and ask for a coupon - he/she can only say no but are much more likely to say yes. Why? firstly because you are offering to pay something and not just chasing a freebie (there is nothing more irritating for an instructor than getting a message from someone they have never heard of, asking for a free coupon in return for a review). Secondly, the instructor will much prefer you buying with one of their coupons as they receive 97% of the proceeds, providing you have not signed up as a result of an affiliate link - but they won't be able to see that ahead of time, so they have to assume you have not - its simply the luck of the draw. If they do provide you with a coupon - do the nice thing and leave a good review for them anyway At the end of the day though, remember, Udemy has a full refund 30 day policy which means if the course does not meet your requirements, get your money back and buy a different one. I hope this is helpful. I might mention that I have recently launched a 2015 Udemy Course Directory (as a Udemy Course) which uses the amazing (and free to download) Visokio Omniscope Viewer. The course is priced low to make it widely accessible. I am sharing $5 coupons to the course (priced at $9 normally) in the launch period and you might like to check it out (don't forget the 30 day money back guarantee :) ).

            "answer_text": "I am currently using Udemy and been subscribing to more than dozen online courses since last 2 years back. For me Udemy, is one of my references for learning as i refer to multiple sources if i want to have a better understanding on a subject.Here are my takes on the courses offered by Udemy I been doing lots of programming course which the video of the course ranging from 10 hours to 40 hours duration. I find video streaming course was slow for my pace. And sometimes i prefer other online course which is more oriented toward text-based content such as w3school or codecademy. I am not saying the Udemy course was bad, it is just a matter of personal preference.One of the things i hate about udemy was the rating feedback pop up that appeared upon finishing a video topic. i wish i can give feedback once i finish the entire course not after a topic. (Imagine the course i am doing right now has more the 300 video topic) i think this is Udemy\u2019s marketing strategy to garner more review to entice subscription which in my humble opinion may mislead the future subscriber.Based on the point above,most of the 5 star rating reviews if delved deeper consist of simple remarks such as \u201cgreat course\u201d, \u201cBest online course ver\u201d etc etc. My assumption was that most of this ratings and remarks was given by the students who been fed by this continuous rating pop up at the early stage of the course which is easy and fun until the course become harder at the later stage (i notice that the Q&A\u2019s frequency dwindle as the subject become complex,)Video buffering. The video from udemy was slower to stream compare to other video platform such as Youtube ( i did the comparison text). I think contribute to my first point why i prefer text-oriented learning.Conclusion, Is it good? For me in term of contents, most of the time yes. Is it worthy?. Since i just spend around 10$-15$ dollar per course, so i can say yes well. ",

Coming to the course quality, It is TRUE that any TOM-DICK and Harry can create course on udemy, needless today, quality is not assured from all instructors, but Udemy actually make sure that quality is assured.

            "answer_text": "Course quality regardless of the medium directly correlates to the quality of the course instruction. Take a peak at this article. It goes on to say that an effective class depends on the quality of the facilitator. Regardless of the course design and quality of the materials, a weak facilitator with a weak delivery will inhibit your ability to learn. Essentially, you can have a freakin awesome layout, pretty design, course concepts & topics mapped out, but if your assigned instructor of the *virtual* classroom doesn\u2019t deliver the content to students in a way that facilitates learning - all of that means nothing. I personally haven\u2019t taken a course at Udemy. You do have the ability to read reviews on student\u2019s experience which might be helpful. I\u2019ve explored a couple of others that have been mentioned such as edX and LinkedIn learning. No true complaints, I didn\u2019t get as much in-depth knowledge as I was looking for. When it comes to marketing courses, there\u2019s one I\u2019d like to recommend from my (biased) perspective that I haven\u2019t seen mentioned yet. If you\u2019re looking for data-driven, self-paced marketing courses, you should check out CXL Institute. Dislaimer: I work at CXL I\u2019ve taken courses online at CXL Institute. And - what I really like about the Institute (again, from my biased perspective) when comparing it to other learning platforms out there, the courses are led by practitioners who have true depth of knowledge in their craft. They\u2019re not full time teachers. They give real world examples from their actual industry experience which helps you understand how to apply the skills their teaching to your own job/business/projects. I hope this is helpful :) ",

On the 15th of March, I bought two courses on Udemy: The Web Developer Bootcamp and Ultimate Photoshop Training: From Beginner to Pro. After that, on the 19th of March, I was charged for a purchase that I did not make for the course \"Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch\". I've got in touch with the Udemy support - request (1668891) - and they've cancelled the purchase and refund me the money. But after that, I was charged again, two other times for purchases that I didn't make. \"Luckily\" my credit card was blocked because of the first not authorised purchase and this two other weren't approved. I've realised that my credit card information was stored on Udemy website so I deleted my information hoping I wouldn't get charged again, but even so the problem continued. Today I got more emails from Udemy saying that I bought ANOTHER course (which I didn't) and on top of that an email saying that I CHANGED MY EMAIL AND MY PASSWORD. SO NOW I CAN'T ACCESS MY ACCOUNT. This is the worse service I've ever had. I need explanations and I need to get my account back so I can cancel the courses and get my money back. ",

            "answer_text": "As everywhere you can find high and poor quality content. To choose best courses you should always check course reviews and rates. The more popular course and still having around 5 stars rating, there is much more probability that it's content is high valuable. So always look at the number of students and rating score. I always hesitate when course is quite new and have little number of reviews even if there are only 5 star ratings. Remember if udemy course is very popular and rates are around 5 stars for few hundreds reviewers it's much more trusted. I have an account there. I always try to catch some interesting opportunities for courses. On Udemy are often great promotions like the last one during Christmas time, you could buy a lot of courses at a price of only $ 19 for each, even those that would normally cost $ 500. After the new year was another promotion that allows to buy a number of courses for a symbolic $ 10, but the collection of courses with so low price was much smaller than those offered in the christmas holidays. My strategy is that if I don't need to quickly learn some things, but I just found a nice course that sometime in the future I would like to buy. Then I add this course to the wishlist and wait for promotions that beat the price down of this particular course that I'm interested in. It should also be noted that for new users Udemy gives 50% price discount for first purchased course. If you are interested in computer-related courses, eg. Design, graphics, programming. You may find interesting packages on stacksocial.com where you can often buy a few courses together for the price of a few dozen dollars. I hope my opinion helped you :) ",

            "answer_text": "Ashwani Deswal ( Author, Healer and Life Coach) recently launched the amazing program called Energize Your Life- Complete Wellbeing Program on udemy. I have one line for the program - IT IS SO MUCH WORTH THAN THE PRICE YOU ARE GETTING HERE. It has been uploaded recently and is one of the best program available presently on the udemy. I have recently enrolled for the program and have recommended to my friends too about the same. Program is about the ancient eastern modalities of healing, wellbeing and learning certain dynamic tools to enhance our individual life. I was really amazed to see so many dimensions in one program and really loved the concepts shared in the program. I was hesitant in the beginning as it is a newly added program and doesn\u2019t have many ratings. Still, I went ahead about it as I have read his book and it was amazing, to be honest. So, I was somehow was looking forward to it. He is very charismatic and has a wonderful personality that will keep you engage in the videos. So much vast information was shared in this program and you will not be disappointed after opting for it. The best thing about the program is the dimensions that it provides. It will talk to you about many different modalities like Energy concept, art of manifestation, Yoga, and importance of breath, Meditation and mindfulness tools are given too for you to practice, techniques of Mind to de-stress yourself, ancient modalities of healing and wellbeing, food and daily routine that can enhance the daily output of your behaviours. It really helped me to make my things improve and I would really like to thank Ashwani here for providing such a quality course. I am very happy that it is available for such a discounted price and to be honest I would have paid 5 times more than it's the price for this kind of information and knowledge. Meditation was just out of the world and you must try it if you are really wanting some great inner transformation and inner growth. He has influenced many thousands of people and more and is still doing the same. I would recommend this course to one and all, in fact, gift this course to your friends as a healthy wellbeing tool and they will appreciate you for the same. Video Concepts really amazed me and I would highly recommend this course to everyone. Just go for it without any second thought. Thank You. ",

The best courses lend real skills and not generic content that passes off as \u2018advice\u2019. The rule of thumb is to spend some time understanding the instructor behind the material (and there are amazing folks on top of their game here). While Udemy does maintain guidelines on how to publish courses, the bar isn\u2019t high and pretty much anybody could share their experiences on the platform. A key point in favour though is most Udemy courses are cheap; you could help yourself immensely by learning the right content because at the end of the day this is a knowledge-sharing platform and a good teacher can make all the difference. TL/DR choose your courses wisely. ",

But in rest of the comments People will praise udemy and leave some website link or Udemy affiliated link, so that they can earn money from your purchase. Whole Quora is filled with Praise and affiliate links. LOL: Even This question is posted by some affiliate user as you can see some affiliated website link How to get top 100 Udemy courses etc.  Conclusion: Udemy is excellent platform for earning money by selling some junk courses at $10 sale ( that never ends), And students often spends $10 considering it as a small amount. But for genuine learners it is not good, as certificate and courses don\u2019t have any value or authenticity as you get from coursera, Edx etc.       Well it is also true that 99 % of the courses are junk , but 1 % is awesum at such a super discount price for learning purpose only, but thier certification holds Zero Value.

The second one i took was pretty lame and the course was NOT EVEN COMPLETE. I got to the final section and it said CONTENT TO BE ADDED which is a really bad User / Customer Experience IMO. These are not free courses by the way. I was lucky to get a discounted course for only $19 but if I had paid the full price ($100+) for that course I wouldve never gone back to Udemy. Like Dave Espino on this thread says, some of the courses are great and others not so much or downright stink. I have also been using Treehouse to learn and update coding skills (CSS, HTML, JavaScript) which is a great company and the courses are amazing. And then there is Lynda, which is a great value and always has relevant and COMPLETE content for a great price. With all of this competition (subscriber based and free), I feel Udemy needs to up the game a bit in quality if it is going to keep users coming back for more. ",

I also have 1 course I published on Udemy, I think it is good, so far the reviews are great. Just like anything you shop for online. Look at the reviews (what do people like, what don\u2019t they like, focus on the ones with explanations not just the 5 or 1 stars with nothing but the stars).Look at the free lectures (Each has at least 1\u20132 free videos. Teachers confident in their content often have 4 or more free lectures available for viewing before you buy).How is the sound/video/content quality?All courses have 30 day, no questions asked, money back guarantee.Thor Pedersen | Productivity Coach | Udemy ",

Depends on your learning requirements, capability, time , money and interest. Courses on Udemy can be worst, bad, average, good, very good or excellent. Don't generalize udemy because it is open for all. Anyone can teach and earn or Anyone can learn. Udemy courses can be worst/bad where the instructor was keen on earning with little knowledge about subject. In some cases instructor creates course just because they are in demand and ends up in creating a mess. Udemy courses can be excellent/par excellence when the instructor was genuinely interested in the topic and has the complete knowledge of subject as well as course creation. Do not generalize any platform. Analyse each platform (YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, Udacity, Edx etc) and in that analyse the available content as per the learning requirements. Learn from everywhere. I know its about time. But you have to spend time and effort to search good content. ",

The bigger issue for me is site performance. The videos never load, or sometimes I can't even log in. It's not an issue with bandwidth - I have a 200MBPS connection and regularly get 125MBPS+ during peak hours.  When I took my first course 2 years ago I had no problems, but lately the site has just been non-functional. I've followed their troubleshooting advice to no avail, and their support group has never responded to my requests. SO... I recommend trying a free or cheap ($5 or less) course first to see how the performance is, before spending more money on a course you won't be able to use.  ",

Lectures that SHOW (not just by talking) PLENTY of examples and Practices. Preview the course to find out.2. Look at the instructor's profile. Look at how many courses he or she is  teaching. Are those courses laser focus on the niche area he or she is  teaching? If the instructor is teaching more than 10 courses, chances  are, the content is poor. You don't need to enroll 10 courses from the same instructor to learn the same thing.3. Check out if instructor updated the course from time to time in order for the course to stay relevant. This means the instructor is committed. Don't simply judge a course by number of students and number of good  reviews. Because some students are giving good reviews simply to  reciprocate the courses they receive from the instructor. Number of students does not mean the content quality is good. Sometimes it is better to pay for the BEST courses using promo code. Learning takes energy and time, as well as your motivation to keep learning. ",

My advice to you is check out the courses using the preview - you have four minutes per email identity you use UPDATE My course Eggtimer economics has 3000+ students.

Knowing what a typical Computer Science, Data Science, or \"insert your favorite major\" degree plan entails allows you to develop a good foundation that you can then build upon into different skill branches. Look for 4+ star courses with lots of reviews that will contribute to your personal/professional development, $10 sales, and coupons that occasionally drop them to free. Don't get overwhelmed by the sea of choices, know what you need based on what you're trying to do (build a game, website, server, etc.), and go for it. ",

I was recommended this course \u201cENERGIZE YOURSELF- Complete Wellbeing course by Ashwani Deswal\u201d I must say that I was really lucky to get that course at such a low and discounted price. I got more than 7 hours of video and around 20 more resources to gain the knowledge and concepts of life mastery. Ashwani Deswal is a life coach and has trained many people in his life coaching seminars. I have seen his many videos on youtube and he is a man with crystal clear idea and vision. I got inspired by his personality and presence. I would really recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a great course on udemy. It is one of the best available there for such a discounted price. Make use of it before it is too late. Regards ",

With so many courses i feel there\u2019s little to no quality control anymore, so I keep to smaller educational platforms. How is even possible for them to check all of the courses that are being uploaded?? The business model of udemy seems to be sell you a course for 10$ and HOPE you never watch it, cause it\u2019s crap. Stick to lesser known educators who still care about customers. You can find better information on youtube,bitdegree,coursera,brilliant,skillshare,pluralsight. Youtube is the same video only format just for free lol. BitDegree offers interactive courses, while coursera partners with universities. Basicly everything is better than udemy. ",

However, we have seen that there is a big lack of courses taught to higher standards, and have made it our goal to help fill that gap. We have instructors who currently work at Sony on the newest Death Stranding release, Naughty Dogg, on their latest Last of 2 series, Disney, Guerrilla Games, Sucker Punch, and more. We have accredited instructors who teach at a university level, so you not only are getting the most talented instructors, they are instructors who know how to teach the skills necessary to start working. Our courses are set up to teach you the production pipeline from some of the best studios in the world, so that you can hit the ground running with the skills taught. We are slowly building courses at the mid and entry level so that the courses are more accessible for everyone, and even working professionals can brush up their skills to add to their current skillsets. We currently teach 3D animation, character modeling, concept art, environment design, music/sound, design/graphics, and will be adding much more in the coming months. Udemy is all pre recorded, so it does lack some of the personal interaction that some online schools provide, however for $10\u201315 you get a ton of material, we spend months creating our courses, and making sure that the experience is up to the university level courses that we also teach. If there are specific courses or skillsets that you are trying to learn, please let us know and we will work towards getting that experience created for you. Feel free to get in touch with us Class Creatives ",

My answer to this question is such because what I\u2019ve observed is that the Udemy site is too heavy to load therefore posing a serious issue for students to access the courses. If I can easily access Facebook, Youtube, Amazon India, Amazon Prime Video and Instagram on my laptop with ease then why can\u2019t I enjoy the ease of access with Udemy? I\u2019ve experienced this problem for quite some years and have therefore time and again \u201crestrained\u201d myself from subscribing to the Udemy courses. This year I was excited about one course, subscribed to it, made payment and boom it ain\u2019t loading anymore!.This is the last straw on the camel\u2019s back atleast for me. Ease of access is the crux of online education, and Udemy\u2019s lack of concern for this issue is saddening. Adios! ",

You must understand that purchasing an online course is just like purchasing a book from a store. If the author of the book is not genuine then reading that book would be a waste of time.
