            "answer_text": "American Exceptionalism is a belief held by we who have the opinion that the USA is the greatest nation in the history of the world, that we have been blessed by Providence. It does not give full credit to British and European values, laws and ideas we received, and puts too much influence on American effort as opposed to the providential benefits of geographic isolation and vast natural resources. This special opinion does not recognize our poor treatment of Native Americans or the Old World diseases that killed many. American Exceptionalism is consistent with U.S. slavery in these respects: weaker Africans died during the Middle Passage, the USA was the best place to be a slave after 1808, Americans shed a river of blood over slavery, and as Booker T. Washington held, African Americans are doing better than any other similar number of African-descended people anywhere else in the world. This doctrine cannot be separated from Judeo-Christian values and excludes those Sharia laws and values inconsistent with the United States Constitution. While the USA played a leadership role in defeating colonialism, fascism and communism, American Exceptionalism unfortunately can be used to justify unwise actions when it becomes an excuse for overconfidence and hubris. The pinnacle of American Exceptionalism is respect for the United States Constitution, the most wonderful of secular documents, which too many Americans regard as our fully unique contribution to superiority. Americans continue to insist erroneously that the English Constitution is unwritten. And speaking of exceptionalism, if a conservative wanted to help African-Americans, you could not go wrong making a contribution to Tuskegee University, the only African-American college or university to award Ronald Reagan an honorary degree.

            "answer_text": "Take your pick: (from wikipedia) \u201cAmerican exceptionalism From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia German professor Sieglinde Lemke argues that the Statue of Liberty \"signifies this proselytizing mission as the natural extension of the US' sense of itself as an exceptional nation.\" American exceptionalism is one of three related ideas. The first is that the history of the United States is inherently different from other nations. In this view, American exceptionalism stems from the American Revolution, becoming what political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset called \"the first new nation\" and developing the uniquely American ideology of \"Americanism\", based on liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, republicanism, democracy, and laissez-faire economics. This ideology itself is often referred to as \"American exceptionalism.\" Second is the idea that the US has a unique mission to transform the world. Abraham Lincoln stated in the Gettysburg address (1863) that Americans have a duty to ensure that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" Third is the sense that the United States' history and mission give it a superiority over other nations. The term exceptionalism does not necessarily imply superiority, although some neoconservative and other American conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense. To them, the U.S. is like the biblical \"City upon a Hill\", a phrase used by British colonists to North America as early as 1630. The theme of exceptionalism is a frequent target for attacks from liberals and groups that adhere to Democratic Party ideologies. The theory of the exceptionalism of the U.S. can be traced to French political scientist and historian Alexis de Tocqueville, the first writer to describe the country as \"exceptional\" in 1831 and 1840. Similar beliefs have existed elsewhere in the world, such as Whig history in Britain which held that the political system of the British Empire was the apex of human development and uniquely suited to ruling foreign peoples benignly. Also, Sinocentrism in China, which regarded Chinese culture as more ancient than or superior to other cultures and neighboring countries as mere offshoots of China. Neither of these views is common today\u201d. ",
