            "answer_text": "Really\u2026.! It\u2019s just a revision test. It's not a school pre board exam. There's nothing like a minimum score otherwise you will not qualify in IIT JEE. And it all depends on the kind of paper your coaching classes set. It depends on which topics they have put more weightage on. And are those topics really relevant to your JEE? For the moment I consider all conditions ideal. You should just be in a comfortable score range from which you know you can improve on to a good score further. Let it be lesser than some of your own decent scores. And most importantly in the coming times try to fill up this gap between 11th and 12th class. Try to remember them as a unified concept all related to reach other, every part supporting and collaborating with others. It would help you a lot for the JEE ,even more than scoring well in the revision test of class 11th. Hope this helps :) Feel free to ask any further doubts\u2026. And DO UPVOTE\u2026.. ",
