            "answer_text": "Everyone changes as they get older. You may discover that your first degree doesn't align with your career or life interests you had at 17. You may discover a new passion and find that a second or advanced degree or set of university courses is what you need to make a career change. People will be in the workforce well into their 70s in the future. It won't be uncommon for people to have two or even three careers. (Just as it won't be uncommon for people to have two or even three marriages or long-term relationships). Our expectations for career and relationship permanence are based on the disappearing and ageist assumption that people are washed up at age 40 or 50 and should be moved out to pasture with the other elders. Get used to rebooting every dozen years or so. Going back to university may be expected. ",

            "answer_text": "One word :insurance. Having a degree is insurance against unemployment. During the great recession who do you think was able to keep employment or get an employment when they lost their job? It's a question of supply and demand. When there's more demand than supply those without a degree can get by. However conversely when there's more supply the demand those with a degree and experience always get the jobs first. Not to mention the fact that those with a degree can qualify for executive level positions within companies, and these positions generally have a $100,000 plus income. It's rare for those without a degree to climb the executive ladder. Get your degree and quit wasting time, 4 years are going to pass anyway right? I highly recommend WGUWestern Governors University ",
