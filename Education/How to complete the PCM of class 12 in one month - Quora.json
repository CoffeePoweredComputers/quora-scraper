If you know a little bit about your subjects ,chapters and concept involved it will be great help for you ,for short and precise preparation in 1 month . First of all very carefully analyse previous years question asked in board exams , mark the chapters with greater weightage , get your maximum focus/ concentration on those chapters in pcm .No need to get panic ,go ahead by step by step ,keep your focus for at least 1 month , don't try to study each and every topic in depth . If you follows as I suggested you above ,you will definately get good marks but remember all things get boil down to the level of hard work that you put in your preparation . BEST OF LUCK ",
