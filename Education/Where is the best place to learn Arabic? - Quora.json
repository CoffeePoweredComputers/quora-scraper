            "answer_text": "Right now the best place to learn Arabic is Egypt. Before the Syrian Civil War the answer would have been Egypt and Syria. First of all you won\u2019t face any major issues with regards to your legal documentation. Visas are not a hassle to attain. Egyptians are extremely friendly especially to foreigners, and especially to foreigners learning their language. Egypt is an incredibly cheap country - you can rent a room in downtown Cairo with other roommates (whether foreigners or locals - I\u2019d recommend locals of course!) for about 100 USD a month. Double check whether alcohol / the other gender / visitors etc. are permitted as there are quite a few residential building that do not allow these things. Egypt is definitely a socially conservative country and the doorman and all the neighbors talk. A lot. The Egyptian dialect is moreover widely understood across the Arab world, and not only that, many Arabs have in my experience found the Egyptian accent quite funny. This makes it easy to socialize with Arabs that are not Egyptian too. The security situation is not that bad as some might have the impression of. Crime levels are low practically everywhere except perhaps the slums where it seems to be a local issue. If you keep your mouth shut the police and intelligence will not hurt you. People in general don\u2019t own guns or use knives nor are predatory robberies a common thing like in South America, even if people are poor. Most will welcome you and be happy to teach you a word or two and be patient with you. The fact that Egypt is the #1 country to learn Arabic is also because of the failure of the other Arab countries, economically, socially, politically and even language-wise, lets take the Arab countries, or countries where Arabic is spoken from West to East: Morocco has a huge French influence and you will end up with a practically useless dialect. Yes you can learn MSA / Fusha there, of course, which people will understand only to reply in their dialect. Algeria: See above. Tunesia: See above. Libya: The country is falling apart and the dialect is practically useless. Egypt: See all the good reasons above! Israel: Expensive to live in. Hard to get visa extensions. The Arab minority is much less open than the Arabs in the Arab countries - unemployment and overpopulation is less of a problem, so there will be less people to talk to whenever suits you. Live busy lives compared to the real Arab world. Palestinian territories: Gaza \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t go there for many reasons, including the horrible economy, the overpopulation, the occasional hostilities, the conservative social climate and the difficulty of getting in. Neither the Israelis nor the Egyptians give the Palestinians in Gaza much leeway in terms of anything. West Bank is a better opportunity: Ramallah is a modern city 15\u201345 minutes from Jerusalem with a proper and thorough Arab feeling that you don\u2019t quite get in Israel. Immersion is very important to learn and Ramallah is a good place to do so. The Palestinians in general are friendly, helpful and very willing to help a foreigner learn their language and dialect. I can recommend Ramallah. This being said, it doesn\u2019t have the feeling of a big city at all. Whatsoever. Without friends it can be quite boring and feel like a small town. Expect to be subject to existential questioning on the conflict and the politicization of everything from technology to food. Lebanon: I wouldn\u2019t go to Lebanon to live these days for security reasons, but that is up to your own judgement of course - communal tensions, millions of refugees, Hezbollah and its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, the non-existent Lebanese state etc. Beirut is a very expensive city. Many/Most people you\u2019ll meet in downtown Beirut where you\u2019d likely find yourself speak excellent English and French - this is especially true for the Christian minority. The Lebanese dialect is sexy and easy on the ear, so that is definitely a plus for the female students. Syria: Syria was a great country to study in before 2011 and a country with a rich, rich history and terrific urban centers with all the amenities and conveniences of modern life yet still with an authentic Arab feeling. This is of course sadly no longer true. Syrians has a long road before them before they will regain what they have lost throughout this bloody war. Iraq: Iraq\u2026 Who would go to Iraq these days? The country is self-destructing and the only functioning part of the country is the Kurdish autonomous region where most do speak Arabic but of course as mother language Kurdish. You -can- study in Erbil or Sulaymania. Another outsider candidate is Jordan. They do have some excellent schools and programs in Jordan and these days a very interesting mix of Bedouins, Palestinian Jordanians, Syrians and Iraqis live there. Moreover many Palestinian Jordanians have lived in the Gulf. Rich diversity of Arab dialects in one place. Personally I don\u2019t like the capital Amman at all with its hilly one-way streets and non-metropolitan feeling. It feels like a village that grew overnight - which is exactly what happened with the influx of refugees from the Arab/Palestinian/Israeli conflict and now later the Iraq war and the Syrian Civil War. There has been no city planning in that city whatsoever and it completely lacks the splendor and feeling of downtown Cairo or Beirut. Moreover it is not very cheap to live or study in Jordan. Legal documentation usually not a problem. The Gulf countries are wealthy countries with highways as wide as anywhere in the U.S. The natives are few and in general, though friendly, live quite isolated. You don\u2019t meet people in the cafes on the street like in Cairo because you need to drive your SUV to the mall first. They are moreover extremely expensive and quite frankly very boring countries. Legal documentation? Good luck with that. *Oman might be an exception here. Small country that despite some wealth in general live simple middle-class lives- they try to stay out of all the politics in the region. Citizens are very friendly and will be happy to help you. Not expensive but not cheap either. Remaining we have Sudan and Yemen. I wouldn\u2019t visit either of them these days for many reasons; civil war, extreme poverty, Saudi missiles, unfriendly authorities. Common people are exceptionally friendly however, but they do live in very harsh conditions these days. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s Jordan or Turkey that comes first.Jordan has a center that\u2019s well established, which goes by the name of \u201cQasid\u201d. Also, Turkey has been attracting a lot of Arabs for different reasons. And there\u2019s quite a rich environment for learning Arabic there, as well as immersion programs, such as that found in Ibn Haldun University in Istanbul. You can Google it. The teachers there are impressive. They have a lot of fun activities that can make you feel as if you were playing, while you\u2019re still learning and developing. ",
