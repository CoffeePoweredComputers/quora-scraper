            "answer_text": "First, a few interesting observations. In response to Stuart, I've always known Stuyvesant High School as \"Stuy\", not SHS.  Perhaps it's somewhat connected to the administration turnover in recent years, or maybe it just reflects the changing of the tides. At any rate, \"Stuy\" has always carried more of the carefree millennial vibe for me, while SHS reminds me of a Stuyvesant of the early 2000s, recovering from the wake of 9/11 and not yet experienced with the social controversies that were to come.  Also, in response to Will, I definitely feel like Stuyvesant students embody procrastination and \"maximizing time\", whichever one pleases you more. I always felt it beneath me, sort of like an undercurrent that passes throughout the halls of the school. These days, it's not just reflected in the fact that kids are always trying to do the least work possible to get the highest grades (maximizing ROI), the least amount of energy to get to class (elevators are fare more popular than ever), or even *gasp* copying homework from other students, but it's also seen in how much Facebook and social media sites are used and discussed casually in the school newspaper and even on the school's website.  I'll probably update this answer once I've actually finished school, but I felt it was important to at least document how Stuyvesant's been for my generation. Getting In  I actually moved to New York late into the year, so I ended up taking the August 2013 test for Stuyvesant. It was still the same SHSAT, with the same admission process. For me, however, since I didn't grow up in the same environment as most of the other students, I didn't feel the pressure of achieving a high score and attending prep school to test into the school. For better or for worst, this gave me a more relaxed mindset towards high school. The way the SHSAT is formatted, you can only gain admission to one specialized high school. As a result, placing Stuyvesant first is imperative to gain admission, since Stuyvesant has the highest cutoff score.  At any rate, almost everyone who is admitted to Stuyvesant enrolls the following fall.   The First Years Because of the large range of students coming in, the school really makes an effort to even the playing field. Except for exceptional cases, this does affect students who had taken higher level classes in middle school.  On the bright side, they do ensure that all students graduate with calculus, at least one AP (a newly implemented policy), and with strong writing and analytical skills.  Another thing to note - most students accepted to Stuyvesant comes from middle schools where they were basically the cream of the crop, valedictorian, honors students, etc. Even if they weren't, the achievement of getting into Stuyvesant usually placed them on a pedestal higher than that of their peers. As a result, most freshman come in with over inflated egos, excited and ready for what they presume to be an easy ride through high school. So that's definitely one hallmark of the early years at Stuyvesant.   Education There are so many classes offered in every department that finding room to fit all of your favorite electives is more of an issue than filling up your schedule.  Teachers teach most often out of genuine love for their subjects. Social studies and biology are probably the departments with the most electives offered, however, which definitely entices a lot of students to sign up for these classes and strengthen their respective departments. On the other hand, there has been a recent surge in computer science in the last decade or so, and I expect this to be a rising trend.  Almost every AP is offered except for AP Studio Art and Art History, which has led the art enthusiasts at Stuyvesant (most of them are students whose parents refused to allow them to LaGuardia) to protest against the administration. I'm curious to see how this goes - I do believe that Stuyvesant's  blatant disrespect and apathy towards the arts is something they can improve on, if they have the means. Additionally, technology courses are treated as a joke. There is a requirement (carried over from the olden days when Stuyvesant was a trade and vocational school) for students to take drafting and a 5Tech/10Tech, or technology educational classes. Most recently, Video Production was replaced with Web Design, but other classes include Jewelry Making, Robotics, Woodcrafting, Cisco Networking, etc.   After School In terms of clubs, one thing immediately noticeable is the abundance of leadership opportunities and extra curricular activities. There is absolutely no way you cannot find a club that fits your interest - the Stuyvesant administration really make it easy to start clubs and organizations in school. Unfortunately, tying into the entire \"college frenzy\", a lot of these are started by students who aren't so keen on actually following through with the club, and many end up being bogus clubs that exist only in name. This has actually prompted a student in my year to start a club called \"I Made This Club to Look Good for College Club\", which has ironically had a better track record of attendance and engagement than most registered clubs in the school.  Popularity is a strange concept at Stuyvesant as well. Though everyone in the school knows the top mathletes and winners of science competitions, far fewer know the top members of the cheerleading team or the football team. In addition, while the tendency is that the Student Union members are more popular with the student body (more parties on weekends, etc.), there is still a collective apathy towards school government that prevents them from being \"popular.\"  Interestingly enough, distinctions like having a perfect SAT/ACT score, a 97+ GPA, or being an Intel STS Finalist allow students to achieve god-like status within the student body, which really is a statement towards who students value at this school.  The College Process In addition to my observations above, there is a definite focus among the students and faculty towards getting acceptances to prestigious colleges. Only at Stuyvesant will you hear of students applying to 20 schools, yet listing Cornell as a safety.  Almost everyone I know who has graduated and had acceptances to a wide range of schools chose the one with the most prestige. Whether it was because of location, financial aid, or simply name brand, that's definitely a trend among Stuyvesant students.   School Spirit ...or rather the lack of it. Occasionally, the school really does bond, such as over prom, SING!, or during its many after school performances. There are also many Senior Sprit events - the senior conga line, senior cut day, prom/promposals, Spirit Days among them. Within each department, however, you do get cliques of kids who are deeply passionate about whatever subject it is that they pursue. I've found that these are often more indicative of any sort of \"spirit\" than a collective school wide phenomenon. For instance, you have the: English One of the most defined departments. The English teachers regularly put on a performance during Open Mic each year, the newspaper (Spectator) and yearbook (Indicator) are fairly well-known and respectable groups with stellar leaders, and the literary magazine has a very defined personality.Fun, Carefree, Thoughtful Math The Math Team is probably the pride and joy of the school (although its ratings has been dropping over the years - I'm unsure of the reason at the moment.) Math Research is also a popular freshman year elective, and the math classes are expansive and go all the way up to 2nd year university level courses. Advanced students even opt to take classes at NYU for college credit. Most tend to be math competition enthusiasts and are affiliated with the NYC Math Circle and the NYC Math Team in some way, and many also attend math camps together. Serious, Crazy, Geeky (which are typical of math departments anyway)Computer Science (not yet a Dept.)Most students get sucked in after mandatory sophomore year Intro to Computer Science and are usually pretty happy with the result. The teachers are incredibly passionate about their work, and there is really a close knit community among the CS nerds (annual CS prom, spirit days, Halloween, pranks, etc.) There is an entire website dedicated to Stuyvesant CS and an alumni mailing list.Fun, Passionate, Creative BiologyMost of these students are premed hopefuls and spend most of their time either with Science Olympiad, one of various science competitions, or in labs around the city. They are usually incredibly intelligent, focused, and dedicated to their work.  Serious, Dedicated, FocusedPhysicsDuring my time, we literally had a group of kids collectively known as the \"physics kids\". This was before the school got rid of Freshman Physics, which used to be a fairly exclusive science course for freshman who had already taken the Biology Regents. The AP Physics C class is known to be one of the hardest classes the school has to offer, so the students are usually fairly ambitious, but mostly just bright and passionate about the subject.Thoughtful, Geeky, SeriousLanguageThis department spans Spanish, Japanese, German, French, Latin, Italian, Chinese, and at one point Korean. Most students - if they are not native speakers - end up fluent in their respective language(s), with a handful opting to take a number of different languages. There are honor societies tied with each language, and a pretty close knit community among those members.Passionate, Carefree, Curious  Social Studies The classes offered range from Security Studies to Geopolitics and Criminal Law, so a wide variety of students are usually under this category. I tend to group most of the Speech & Debate, Model UN, JSA, and other politics-related groups under this category as well, since their advisors are almost always social studies teachers. They tend to be the most outspoken students, often stirring controversies and making petitions and campaigns. Dedicated, Outspoken, Passionate Technology These are usually the quieter students who meet on the 10th/4th/1st floor - Architecture Club, Filmmaking Club, Animation Club, Robotics, etc. among them. They don't usually identify with the CS kids, but are rather their own little group(s). They almost always create impressive projects and spend a lot of their time after school in their various workshops and labs.Creative, Dedicated, Passionate Music A few too many students take music classes (band, chorus, etc.) for credit and grades more so than for their musical education. However, the few who do dedicate themselves really make the department what it in, in my experience. Serious, dedicated, creativeArtThis is a pretty small community at Stuyvesant. I will group the dancers with the fine arts kids - they are usually very dedicated to their work, often spending hours inside/outside of school perfecting their craft and working on ongoing projects.  Fun, dedicated, creativeI feel like I could go on, but that's about the gist of it (I also made very broad assumptions about the cultures of each of the departments, so take it as you will. I will warn that this is probably not PC, but I thought it might be interesting to outside students and prospective students to get a glimpse into Stuyvesant culture.) Sure, you definitely have kids with multiple interests who are part of smaller cliques within their outside clubs, organizations, and whatnot. Sure, you definitely have kids who change interests sporadically (it is high school, after all). However, I feel like this outlines the general \"school spirit\" microcosms that exist within the larger ecosystem of the school. Competition  I feel like every teacher wants to make their students aware of the competitions within their departments. Almost every class has opportunities for competitions, whether it's olympiads, essay contests, fairs, or anything else that allows students to show off their skills/knowledge.  At the same time, because competition is so abundant among Stuyvesant students, individual achievements are often muted. I've noticed quite a few people get upset over not getting a mention in the school newspaper about their awards. This is likely due to how much space it would take up for the respective Stuyvesant publications to list every student achievement over the course of the weeks.  Opportunities For me, personally, most opportunities I received were a result of going to school in Manhattan more than it was going to Stuyvesant. Nonetheless, I did get to meet some of the most interesting and inspiring students during my time here. From immigrants to first-generation to wealthy pedigree students to rising stars, there are so many incredible minds and personalities that it's impossible not to find someone interesting to talk to every day at this school.  In Comparison I've heard of Stuyvesant being compared to a lot of other schools throughout blogs and forums. Apart from athletic rivalries (which really are specific to the individual sports and cannot be applied across the board), there are almost no rivalries against other high schools at Stuyvesant. Still, there are good comparisons that can be made to: New York City Public Schools [Hunter, Specialized Schools - Bronx Science/Brooklyn Tech] New York City Private Schools [Trinity, Dalton]Boarding Schools [Andover, Exeter, Choate, Deerfield]Magnet Schools [TJHSST]Other [NCSSM]Overall I haven't finished yet, so I can't really say, but I do know that there have been a lot of toxic elements that have fed into the entire Stuyvesant experience. While school drama and gossip is weakened by the fact that with 800 students in a grade, you can really make what you will of \"popularity\" and whatnot, the constant pressure to succeed really does break down a lot of students. Very few classes are actually bent on learning, and even those are often populated by die-hard students who care more about grades and looking good for schools than anything else. It really does cause a skewed mindset going into college, especially since education really isn't done at this point. At any rate, I still believe that the skills learned at Stuyvesant are still worth a lot of the toxic pain and bad habits you may develop. Most of these negative experiences happen quite frequently and are more part of the high school experience than anything The positive traits - independence, learning for its own sake, discipline - as well as the opportunity to meet extraordinary and passionate individuals is definitely something that does not come very often. At the very least, I think those really are some of the key defining moments of the Stuyvesant experience.  ",

            "answer_text": "Frustrating, but also very rewarding. Most of that frustration comes from the standard transition from middle school to high school; it's a big school that you have to learn to navigate, and there are a lot of new faces that you have to process and familiarize yourself with.  What's even more intimidating is that everyone is good at something. The test to get in is really just a competency test: can you read English and do math decently above grade level? If you fit that profile at age 13, chances are you're also very good at several other things, and that you've felt socially isolated in some way in elementary and middle school. Coming to Stuy, in that sense, is very much a relief because everyone has that base level of competency*.  So you've gotten in, you've figured out the base layout of the building, you begin to actually enjoy walking across that bridge over the West Side Highway, you meet some intimidating figures, and you eventually find your friends. And then you realize that taking a full 10 period schedule is physically exhausting, and that taking 8 periods is not masochistic enough. You realize that the escalator between the 5th and 7th floors is never going to be repaired, and that it's faster to take the stairs two at a time. Slowly it dawns that your daily hour of commuting is actually a decent amount of time to do some reading or an assignment.  This is the beginning of the long downward spiral.  This is also the only thing that I can think of that truly unites the spirit of every single person I know from Stuy: we optimize in the spirit of slacking off. The problem is, there isn't all that much to really slack off from while at Stuy, but we do try. We spend a non-negligible number of hours working. (And yes, there's no way to get around working several hours a day.)  But our brains are always focused on ways to optimize the problem. What almost killed me about Stuy** was the realization during senior year that so much of it is really geared towards getting students into universities. There are aspects of this that are mutually beneficial for both the school and the students, and aspects of this that are really only good for the school (and not the individuals involved, including the teachers).  On the good side, there's a lot of institutional support for getting students involved in research - especially for math, where there's a very active push to get calculus out of the way so you can focus on more interesting problems. I really loved this part of Stuy. On the not so good side, I would argue that it's difficult to find teachers who can serve as good mentors. As I understand it, all teachers have to teach 5 periods - meaning that most teachers have to assess 170 students a day.  The process involved for the \"counselor's recommendation\" for college applications is similarly stressful for both students and teachers and has the potential to be very impersonal.  Almost as if to play with our heads, the college office annually publishes a list of college admissions statistics based on last year's class that includes the highest GPA rejected and the lowest GPA accepted. \"What is it like to be a student at Stuy?\" I'd be remiss if I excluded:  - The awkwardness of drafting class (which I hear is now complemented by a required class in programming)- The cardio workout because the escalators are never repaired fast enough- The fun of SING!- The joy of little glass boxes It's hard, though, to really answer this question because at the end of the day, Stuy is a high school. All high schools contain their little rites of passage for adulthood*** and have their own awkward moments.   Maybe more importantly: would I send my children there? Yes.  I'm constantly amazed by the accomplishments of my classmates, and as a fairly recent grad, I'm looking forward to seeing what else they'll come up with.   *I would also be the first to add that I think it's ludicrous to think that the results of a 3(?) hour, multiple choice test taken at age 13 reflect overall individual competence, or that missing the cutoff implies a student is incompetent. I simply mean that making the cutoff implies a minimum level of competence of students who enroll in the school. **Besides, of course, the dust from Ground Zero while I was there - at least, I hope it's not going to kill me! - classes of '02-'05, you know what I'm talking about.  ***Although I'm pretty sure the vast majority of all classes, at the time of graduation, don't have driver's licenses.
