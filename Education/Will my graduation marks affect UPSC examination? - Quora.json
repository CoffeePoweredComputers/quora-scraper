            "answer_text": "It does not matter much. The minimum eligibility for taking up the Civil Service examination is PASS PERCENTAGE IN GRADUATION. So the message is loud and clear from UPSC's side that \"It does not matter to me who you were, what matters is only who you are and who you are going to be\". See there might be 100 reasons for anyone to be scoring low in their school and college years. It might be Economic, social or personal reasons. But i sincerely feel that this shouldn't weigh a person down in his UPSC preparation. Please understand the demographics of our society. This is the general trend. A large percentage of students who graduate from the top colleges with high percentages in this country DO NOT APPEAR FOR CSE and will be in search of opportunities in the private sector in India or abroad.(Generally) A large percentage of students who graduate with very low percentage in their school and college years do not take up the exam as they think that the exam is too tough and it is not their cup of tea. So the people in the middle i.e.., people who get average percentage and pass out from avg colleges are the ones who mainly apply for the exam every year in large chunks. These are the most aspirational of all the individuals( relatively) and the main competition is between these people. If you take a close look at the result sheet of the Successful candidates, more than half of them will be from this group. Unfortunately the ones from the premier institutes in the country who become successful are given more publicity in the media ( if they are toppers). This creates a feeling in the minds of people that only candidates from Top colleges with High Percentage can clear the CSE. This notion is utterly misleading as the maximum number of candidates clearing the exam each year is from the avg group. So please keep your worries aside as your previous academic performance is not a metric to gauge your present and future performance and study smartly to clear your exams. All the Best and Happy studies.... ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "i advise all people to give their details. now i will use imagination and hypothesis. consider the following features of upsc nature - it is pro general in nature. that is command over a subject will be helpful but it will not yield advantages in proportional to the knowledge. you will see that many aspirants with command over a subject will score only a few marks over those who have good knowledge. this is because the questions are of a generalist nature and expertise gives only a negligible advantage. infact many times other skills such as writing removes disadvantage of expertise in a subject. thus you will find numerous aspirants with general understanding of a subject outsmarting the expert ones!where command is needed - command is needed in your optional subject. now if your graduation subject is not your optional, then the advantage just evaporates. that what happens as most engineers choose social science as optional. there are many parameters of how to choose optional but that is not the matter of discussion in this answer. suffice is to say that many times you cannot choose the subject of your graduation as optional.even if you select your graduation subject as optional - less marks is no bar to excellent score in upsc. many people with degree from distant education have secured ias. point to be noted that scoring in a university exam, scoring in upsc and knowledge are no where related. i say with complete humility that even though failed two times in mains  those friends of mine who passed were more shocked than me, because of my knowledge (i am not arrogant)other factors affecting upsc results - writing, grasping, analytical thinking, on the spot performance in exam, luck etcand once you become ias all will say that genius people always have less marks in their graduation!!!!!!!! (they will get rid of their conscience by making you inborn genius, ha...ha)so cheer up and start working. always remember 'that plan is best which is put to work'. so rather than making grandiose guess and stupid (no offense intended) conclusions get your ass to work",
