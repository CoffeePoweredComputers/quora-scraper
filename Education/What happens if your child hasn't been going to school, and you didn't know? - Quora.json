            "answer_text": "Greetings, Most public schools carefully track attendance. At my school, a classified staff member call the home of every absent student around 10:00 AM to verify that they are missing classes for a legitimate reason. My colleagues are required to take attendance every period, and we receive \u201creminder calls\u201d if too much time passes without the office receiving the results of roll call. And, when a minor returns to school, each is required to have written parental notice requesting that the absence be excused. However, after several days of absence without notice, and calls to the parent\u2019s place of employment, our principal makes a home visit. I am surprised that you have not been contacted. Sincerely, AJG. ",

            "answer_text": "In my school, if you don\u2019t show up, they immediately contact your parents. Attendance is taken every period and if you aren\u2019t where you are supposed to be and weren\u2019t cleared by the attendance office, they will call your parents to see where you are. If your child doesn\u2019t go to school and they don\u2019t have excuse notes you can be fined and have to go to court. It is your responsibility to ensure your child is attending school. Even if your child leaves school as soon as you drop them off, it is your responsibility. Depending how long they haven\u2019t been going to school you can face jail time or pay a hefty fine. ",
