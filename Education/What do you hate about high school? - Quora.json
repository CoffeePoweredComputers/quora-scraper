            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a Hierarchy I know I can\u2019t speak for all high-schools everywhere but at my school it\u2019s a freaking hierarchy. It\u2019s divided into groups, or sects if you will. PopularKind of PopularNormalUnder the RadarOutcasts\u2019The thing I hate about it is that most of the \u201cPopular\u201d ones treat everyone below them (or so they think are below them) like trash. So do the Kind of Popular ones and so on and so forth and this really ticks me off. I can only speak for myself so I\u2019ll say what I am at my school. I\u2019m (a): Geek: Tech Nerd, Loves Coding (Gonna study CS in College), Loves Reading, plays instruments and speak several languages (and counting).Physically Fit: Jock - High-School Athlete. I\u2019m varsity, starting point guard (even though I shoot better than I dribble) at my school and I\u2019m a sophomore. Go to the Gym religiously. More info of Physical Fitness here: Josue Quintero's answer to What physical exercise do you do?I don\u2019t really know what else to put here, but I might edit this if I have anything else to say that I am. Oh yeah! Christian.So now that I\u2019ve set the stage I\u2019ll directly answer the Question. What do I hate about High School? (Hierarchy) People treat others as dirt, they discriminate and bully other kids and it\u2019s completely normal to them. Nothing out of the ordinary, and I abhor it. I hate it when people judge others because of their Gender, Age, Race or Religious POV. In my highschool I try, I really, really try to help others when I can. When someone bullies someone I always get between them and stare the bully down. (I guess it helps that I\u2019m a Jock). Most of the bullying at my highschool -it\u2019s a science highschool- happens to Nerds/Geeks and I\u2019m almost always the one saving my fellow Bookworms from savages. They\u2019re like family, sort of, and I dislike it that others don\u2019t treat them like family, or at least humans, too. Sadly I can\u2019t be there to help all of them because my school\u2019s huge. I remember when I was in middle school, I got to a point where I was pretty depressed because of personal stuff and my chubbiness. No one at school was there to help me and so when life got better for me I decided I was going to help others in any way I could. In Highschool it can sometimes turn from a hierarchy to a dictatorship and it\u2019s our moral obligation to help those who feel like they\u2019re alone. We can't repay our good luck with bad grace, it invites darkness. -RL Geek out. P.S: This is just the biggest thing that I hate about my high-school. Cafeteria Food isn\u2019t tasty either. ",
