            "answer_text": "Start with some Ted Talks on YouTube for some interesting Big Picture stuff,, along with Kahn Academy chalktalks on small, discrete topics that come up in your new career.  For what underlays all tech, learn about Scientific Method. The whole corpus of technology rests on that. Lastly, and this will sound a little weird, observe the faces of technologists as they describe tech they're working on. You'll see a fascination in their eyes wholly apart from the zillion interpersonal cues most people are mostly putting out. This can lead you to understanding the zeitgeist of the tech universe. Tech and science are VERY disciplined play. And if you ask whether something is useful too quickly, you'll wind up like Xerox Park, which invented the GUI (graphical user interface) and the mouse, but did nothing with them (look up the Xerox Star). Steve Jobs checked out what they were up to and made billions from it with the Macintosh. And then Bill Gates checked out what Jobs was doing and made even more billions from it. Oh, and HP rejected the Apple Computer that Woz and Jobs invented while Woz worked at HP.  They saw no commercial application for it. Conversely, though, lots of technologies have burned through billions of dollars to no benefit to the providers of those billions. Some ideas were before their time (the first tablet computers) while others never would have their time (Xerox's notion of a personal computer). ",
