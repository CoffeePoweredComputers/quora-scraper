            "answer_text": " Staying focused is always a difficult task. Although we all get distracted sometimes, these tips have helped me remain focused. Pomodoro Technique This was the number one technique that has helped me stay focused. This method is used by many successful individuals BECAUSE IT WORKS. The basic structure of the Pomodoro technique is very simple. You work for twenty-five minutes and then take a five minute break. After doing this four times, you take a longer twenty to thirty minute break. This is most effective when you use a timer. It\u2019s as simple as that. 2. STOP MULTITASKING  I can\u2019t stress how important this tip is. Multitasking DOES NOT help you work faster or more effectively. It actually slows you down and makes you LESS focused. When you multitask you give multiple things a portion of your effort and concentration. It is impossible to multitask and give everything 100% effort, let alone 110%. It just can\u2019t happen. Plus, when you switch between activities you waste time adjusting to your new task. When you constantly do this you waste even more time. 3. Have SOME Caffeine  It is scientifically proven that consuming caffeine increases focus! But, there is a catch. Caffeine increases focus when it is consumed in SMALL amounts over time. Drinking too much caffeine at once can make you anxious, which slows productivity and reduces focus. 4. Find The Right Place  The perfect spot is quiet, consistent, and made for working. A quiet workspace is the best workspace. Scientists have found that excess cortisol, a stress hormone, is released when there is too much background noise. You might think there is minimal noise around you, but even kids playing and cars driving by can cause extra stress. It\u2019s best to make your space as quiet and peaceful as possible. Your workspace should also be consistent. What this means is you should always work in the same area, and if possible, at the same time everyday. This helps you focus because you spend less energy on deciding where to work. Finding a spot, setting it up, AND getting comfortable takes away your time and energy, making you less focused. Finally, your spot should be made for working. Although everyone\u2019s preferred work environment is different, you should never work in your bedroom or places where you relax away from work. When you work in your bedroom--or even worse, your bed--you will be too comfortable to focus and might even fall asleep! This is because your brain associates that room with sleep. If you work there long enough, your brain will start to associate it with work. This will make it extremely difficult to fall asleep at night since you are so used to forcing yourself to stay awake there. Consequently, you will lose sleep, become more stressed, and have an even harder time focussing. Your workspace also shouldn\u2019t be in a place where you spend a lot of time relaxing after work. There needs to be a separation between work and play, otherwise you will start to feel stressed even when you\u2019re relaxing! Your brain needs time off after working to properly function and get you ready for the next day. A change of scenery is the perfect way to tell your brain that it is time to relax. ",

            "answer_text": "How to focus on the task at hand: Taming the monkey mind What do you think is your biggest distraction when you are in the zone, deeply focused on a task: Facebook - No Whatsapp - No Email - No It\u2019s your own brain. Has it ever happened to you that you are in the middle of a task and suddenly your brain pops an idea for a previous task which is completely unrelated to your current work? \u201cI should invest in Nifty 50.\u201d \u201cOh, I forgot to tell my husband to get vegetables.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have spoken to my colleague in the way that I did.\u201d Why does this happen? Why can't our brain focus on one thing at a time? I am not sure why exactly our brain behaves like a monkey jumping from one thought to another. Maybe this was an evolutionary advantage, but clearly, it's not anymore. Let's see how. If your current task is interrupted by an unrelated idea then there are two possible outcomes: 1. Either you suspend your current work and follow the new idea or, 2. You hold the new idea for later and continue your current task. There are cons to both these paths: Few cons related to path 1: You pause your current work and play with the new idea. 1. Future context switch: Let understand this with an example. You are writing code for a program and you are at line 50. To write the next line you need to have an idea of the context from the starting and also what the final objective is. If you paused this work and are restarting then you would have to gather all of this before you can even write a line. If you pause your current work and jump to the new idea, then you would end up paying a price when you jump back. This is known as \u201cContext switch\u201d. You would have to think again about where exactly you were in your work, gather the right prerequisites and the thoughts before continuing the work. 2. Losing the Zone: You might have been in the state of utmost focus aka \"in the zone\" when the idea would have popped and you decided to leave your zone to pursue it. Most of us would agree that getting in the Zone is a tough task. So good luck with getting the same state back. At a glance, the above might look like a small price to pay but if you have experienced and experimented with them, then you would know the difficulty associated with these. Few cons related to path 2: You instructed your brain to hold the idea and focused back at your work. By the time you are done with your task, either you don\u2019t remember the idea or you do. Both are not good. You might forget the billion dollar idea.That could have been a life-changing idea for you. You thought your brain would hold it until you finish your task but you were wrong. Now you can only be sad at your misfortune. 2. You remember the idea. Your brain did a great task at holding the idea while you focused on your current task (or were you focused?) 2a) I like to think our mind is like a computer with a fixed amount of RAM. At a given time in life, the amount of RAM a person has is constant. A highly cognitive task (Deep work that needs focus) would require almost your entire RAM just like playing a heavy game on your computer requires a lot of RAM. If while playing the game you also run a video on the side, it will need some RAM from your game and hence reduce its performance. Similarly, if you have thoughts/ideas interrupting your current work then in the metaphor of computer science, they are taking up some of your RAM, which was needed to finish your current task. So if you are holding some ideas in your head then you are not in the Zone/focused. 2b) Once an interruption, always an interruption: Once I was working on an important deadline and suddenly I remembered that my wife's birthday was due in a couple of days and I needed to plan for it. No matter how hard I tried to resist the urge to go on the tangent, my brain kept popping ideas of destinations, events, decorations etc related to the surprise party that I needed to host. There began the chain of constant interruption. If you choose to control your feelings and suppress the distraction then you are in for a ride. Turns out the brain doesn't let go of things so easily. It's as if the brain is a mother and the interrupting idea her child. The mother doesn't want her baby to be lost and hence keeps nagging our current flow. So once an interruption, always an interruption. There is a third path which is so far the best solution. Pause your current work and quickly note your distractions, in detail, in a safe location. Then continue your work. To clearly understand why the third path is better, let\u2019s talk about a piece from Psychology. Zeigarnik effect: People remember in-completed tasks better than completed tasks. A waiter remembers many orders until he serves all of it. Students who rely on rote memorization, forget the content as soon as the exam gets over. When you ask your brain to hold on to an idea, you have given it importance, your brain is going to treat it as an incomplete task and so it will assign RAM to it and like a mother, keep reminding you about it. But, once you safely note your interrupting thoughts in a notebook or some app which you know is a safe haven for such ideas and future tasks, the constant nagging of the mother brain is going to stop. She will know that her baby is in the right hands and will be addressed in some time. The task wouldn\u2019t be seen as incomplete. I use Wunderlist for this purpose. It is a note taking the app just like any other. I have it on my phone and laptop and I note all my interrupting thoughts in its inbox. This is how it looks.  This small tool is very powerful. I keep dumping all my ideas and tasks in its inbox and review at a weekly level where I organize them in various lists. Some situations where I use Wunderlist How to use Wunderlist effectively is a talk for another session but let\u2019s focus on some situations where we should use it. You are in the middle of a task and an idea comes up.Your colleague tells you about a new task that would help you but you currently don\u2019t have the bandwidth to execute it.You are meeting your manager/colleague and you get lots of insights and feedback. Having Wunderlist open for meetings is a must have.You are at a social gathering and somebody suggests a nice book that they read or a nice restaurant they went to.A colleague mailed you a doc/article that you should read but you are in the middle of something. Hurry! Note it.You suddenly remember a feedback to give to your colleague. Note it down.The boon which also is the bane. Apart from keeping your brain at peace another boon of the process is that no idea will slip through the cracks. But this is the bane too. Since you miss nothing, so your to-dos list keeps on increasing, beyond your capabilities to catch up. To deal with this you need to develop another skill, the art of leaving, i.e. how to prioritize tasks and leave the unimportant ones, something which we will talk about later. Bottom line: Mind is like a monkey that wants to jump on every vine that it sees and it is constantly on the lookout, even when you think you are deeply focused. The best thing to do when you get distracted is to quickly note your distractions, in detail, in a safe location. Reference books: 1. Thinking fast and slow 2. Art of thinking clearly 3. Getting things done 4. 7 habits of highly effective people. ",

And do a NUMBER of things that I really didn\u2019t think I wanted to do. I have three pieces of advice that are working for me. As much as possible, tie EVERYTHING into what you\u2019re motivated to do, avoid the things that you aren\u2019t motivated to do. I\u2019m even fortunate enough to be writing my thesis on role-playing games because it\u2019s one of the things I highly enjoy doing. However, since you will still inevitably have things that you aren\u2019t motivated to do that must get done\u2026Learn to use an intuitive and easy to access task management system, one that\u2019s as easy or easier than using the email on your phone or computer. I use Trello and have found it so useful that I\u2019ve upgraded to the paid version: $5/month. However, the free version works just as well for most people\u2019s needs. Trello saved my 2nd semester. Now, if you\u2019re like me, however, you\u2019ll walk the straight and narrow for awhile and start to feel like you\u2019ve got things under control and you\u2019ll slip into bad habits. The task management system will fall in disuse, and you\u2019ll find yourself slacking on tasks. Again. So on to point 3.Have someone who will uncompromisingly keep you on task even if you have to pay them. This upgrades point 2 to a level of genius because it will help you to stay on task (accountability principal). This particular item works for me because I\u2019m a social learner. Just by sitting and having a conversation with someone (who may not really be interested in what I\u2019m yakking away about), it helps stimulate me to continue on task and often generates useful ideas. BTW: it may not cost you much. You may be surprised, but you might find a college student who\u2019s willing to help for a very reasonable sum - it\u2019s great having a Virtual Assistant.",

            "answer_text": "It seems focus, concentration, discipline, distraction and such like are related. While there are links to 1000+ related answers to your question given below it may be useful to start with considering your wants and needs. Are you doing what you want? Consider the following: If you want or need something, will you be automatically committed, motivated and focussed to achieve/obtain it? If you don\u2019t want or need something will you be automatically focussed to achieving/obtaining it or will focus and motivation likely be a problem? Simply put, if you want something, even if you are faced with major challenges, you will be focused, disciplined and so on to achieve/obtain it; if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t. Having problems with focus may be trying to tell you something about what you want and need. Are you actually doing what you want to do? The mind is a complex thing and it could be what you think you want is not what you actually want. It can be useful to consider your wants and needs and where they have come from. People change in response to living their lives and their experiences. What you want now may not be what you want tomorrow, in a week, in a year and so on. Change is to be expected and accepted as is adjusting your wants and needs accordingly. People are different. This is obvious from the many different approaches to dealing with focus indicated below. Some people influenced by others take on the wants and needs of other people. If these do not align with their own wants and needs there will be no problem. If they find they do not align focus problems will occur. Focus and the like isn\u2019t static For most people, focus is not static over time but goes up and down. It does not stay at the same \u2018level\u2019 all the time. A lack of focus could be a result of you being a bit tired and the like, indicating a need to rest. At times, a lack of focus can be helping rather than a problem to overcome. Only you can work out if a lack of focus is helping or a problem as only you are living and experiencing your life. You will do things you don\u2019t like to get something you want Working towards something wanted often involves doing things you don't particularly like. If you really want the end result focus will return without much effort; even to do things you don't like. Again, if focus does not return with minimal effort this is indicating consideration of your wants, needs. It could be you need a change if you find you are not doing things towards what you want. If doing what you don\u2019t want to do\u2026 If you are set on working towards things you may not want or need, or if wants/needs are somehow imposed on you, there are plenty of views on about improving focus, reducing distraction and so on: I quickly picked up the following questions on Quora. They may be helpful in addition to the answers you receive here: How can we completely concentrate while studying? \u2013 2100+ answers How can I improve my focus? \u2013 1000+ How do you keep yourself disciplined? \u2013 600+ How can we control our mind from distraction? \u2013 380+ What are some ways to keep yourself from getting distracted while working or studying? \u2013 270+ What are some tips and tricks to increase concentration power? \u2013 450+ How do you keep yourself focused on your goals? \u2013 340+ How can we control our mind from distraction? \u2013 300+ How do I become more self-disciplined and avoid procrastinating? \u2013 200+ How do I develop razor-sharp focus? How do I improve concentration and increase my productivity? What are proven ways to improve focus? From searching Quora you will find there are quite a few similar or related questions with a varying number of answers. Additionally, an online search will give you many more possibilities. There is no single approach to focus, distraction and the like is guaranteed to work, there\u2019s no \u2018magic bullet\u2019. Many ways to deal with focus can be found because people are different as are the situations they find themselves. Looking online makes it obvious there isn\u2019t a widespread consensus or agreement on a single approach which will work for everyone. No one has the \u2018magic bullet\u2019 when it comes to maintaining focus and concentration. What works for one person may work for some other people but not everyone. As everyone who has struggled with focus has done, you will have to find what works for you. What works at one point in time may not work at another point as people change. What works may be is an approach found from answers, found online or something you come up with yourself. Everyone is searching for the elusive one easy answer for them, the way that guarantees their focus. People can\u2019t find it out there in books and online so they come up an approach that works for them. When they find what works they often let others know about it online, hence, many different views. In the end, it is up to each individual to decide if they want to continue to do things they don\u2019t want to do or take steps to find and do what they want to do, recognising that what they want may change over time. Hopefully, this will give you something to work with ",

            "answer_text": "Focus is defined as the capacity of one person to concentrate on the most urgent problem or task. Focused persons direct their attention is only directed to the task at hand rather than being distracted by anything and everything around him. It is also one of the most neglected skills among workers.\u041dere are some simple tips you can add to your routine to help improve focus at work: How To Improve Focus At Work Get enough rest - Reaching these 7\u20138 hours of sleep will bring nothing but good results to your body, and your performance at work.Exercise - It does not only make you physically healthy; it also has some positive effects on your mind. Exercising can also improve focus.Choose your work area wisely - while working from home, you have more freedom in choosing the best work-conducive area. Having a designated home office area with a proper ergonomic setup in terms of posture, lighting, and sufficient desk space will help you focus better.Play some music - Classical music is proven to calm one\u2019s mind and increase focus. Others work better when they listen to their favorites or upbeat songs.Make a to-do list - You can be fully detailed with your list, or keep it simple. Writing things down has been proven helpful in accomplishing more tasks at work. It also helps in remembering the tasks needed to be done.Prioritize - Breakdown the tasks into smaller groups so you won\u2019t get too overwhelmed with the amount of work needed to be done. It is best to start with the most difficult or urgent one as you have more energy in the morning.Eat good fats - You should consider the food that you take. Taking in a lot of good fats like avocado, eggs, nuts, and coconut oil are some examples. Intermittent fasting is also suggested to help in improving focus.Take breaks - Giving yourself breaks from time to time will give you some rest, and it refreshes your mind, which creates more room for new ideas.Due to all the recent advancements in technology, it has become even more challenging to keep the focus on a single activity before moving on to another one - both at work and in everyday life.Actually, multitasking does more harm than good. Keeping your focus on only one task per period results in an increase in productivity, and better work output. So, your attention is only directed to the task at hand rather than being distracted by anything and everything around. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of the best ways which have helped me focus are : Meditating everyday in the morning when I wake up and every night before sleeping. It really helps me focus my mind and thoughts on just breathing. Using the same techniques you can do the same in your work. Try using Headspace app it's the app I used to teach myself meditation.Set goals for yourself and compete with yourself. If you are a typist and can type say 50 pages in an hour try to compete with yourself and try to complete more than 50 pages in the next hour and keep increasing your goal.Let go of all your social media apps and your phone as a whole when working. Don't keep checking it from time to time. Brian Tracy says that it takes approximately 17 minutes to regain your focus on the task you were doing before the distraction took place. So make it a habit to not use your mobiles while working and not talking to your coworkers till your job is done.Keep the bigger picture in your mind at all times. You want to become successful and rich right ? You cannot accomplish these things if you continuously allow yourself to Be distracted because it will reduce your productivity.And most importantly work with a purpose and enjoy your work. Don't consider your job to be the worst one or a boring one. The saying is 100% true : \u201cAs a man thinks, he becomes.\u201d if you continuously think that your work is boring, your mind will accept it and will make you feel tired, exhausted and bored. Instead of thinking about it as a boring job think like its the best job and you are having fun even if you aren't pretend that you are enjoying yourself and soon it will be manifested. Keep your purpose in mind and then go to work. You are working so hard so that you can excel in your career, become rich, live a happy life and a secured life. Don't let this big picture go away from your mind. Whenever you feel you are losing focus, remind yourself of this bigger picture.Thank you for reading. I hope this helps you. If not, please message me I'll try my best to share with you some other ways also which I've learned. And, remember that it will take time to develop a habit, you cannot expect a change within a few days, so stay calm and have faith in yourself. Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "My suggestions are as under: Group related tasks together so that your mind is tuned to all related tasks and you can focus better.As far as possible try not to get to get into time pressure. The moment you are under time pressure, your focus is on avoiding failure rather than excelling.Do work in chunks. This makes it less tedious and you also get a sense of satisfaction that a part of the work is completed. Chunking work also helps avoid feeling overwhelmed by the quantum of work left and the effort required.Make lists of what needs to be done. This will lessen the mental pressure on remembering small details. Instead you can now focus on the really important tasks. Lists also help you ensure that nothing important is missed out. Ideally put a deadline against each item on the list to make you aware of how you must prioritize your work.Ensure you are well prepared for the task ahead. This could include arranging the important work in sync with your body clock. So if you are a morning person schedule important tasks to be done in the morning half. Those who feel less energetic at noon can schedule \u2018not so critical \u2018 tasks for the afternoon slot. Similarly ensure you have all the right tools, adequate lighting, a proper work space etc. before you begin the task.Take breaks to break the monotony as well as to refresh the mind.Be assertive and learn to say NO. This will ensure that you do not get disturbed by other people during your peak time.Keep all distractions at bay. The most important thing is to switch of the mobile phone / switch of access to the internet / put the landline off the hook/ put a Do NOT Disturb board outside your work place etc.The one trick that never fails is finding a compelling intrinsic motivationto do what has to be done. Remember even if you are late riser, if there is picnic scheduled you will wake up earlier. Do you ever go late for a movie or go late to catch a public transport. You have a motivation that drives you. Find such a motivation and you will always remained focused.You can click on the following links to read some of my answers related to various dimensions of motivation.

            "answer_text": "7 Ways to Stay Focused at Work by Shawn Radcliffe In a world filled with instant access to information, coworkers, and friends, finishing a solid eight hours of work seems nearly impossible. Avoiding distractions, however, is not a Herculean task. Just like getting to the gym each day, staying focused while at work is a matter of building good habits. 1. Set clear goals Instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to work a solid eight hours every day,\u201d make a list of your top priorities for the week. This helps you avoid reacting to every distraction that comes up. Review your list each morning and decide\u2014realistically\u2014what tasks you can accomplish that day. Be concrete: \u201cI\u2019m going to finish steps 1-3 of the project by noon.\u201d 2. Work in 60-90-minute blocks As we work, our alertness drops off, increasing the lure of distractions. Set a timer and take a break at the end of each cycle. Reset your focus by listening to music for a few minutes, taking a short walk, or going for lunch. 3. Turn off the world Let\u2019s face it, the world is a distracting place. Avoid temptation by severing all ties. This includes email, office phones, cell phones, and your coworkers. This might require finding a quiet place away from your office to work\u2014such as booking a conference room or hiding out in your office. If you need to, set up a system for urgent messages to reach you. This doesn\u2019t include where to go for happy hour. 4. Schedule distractions Distractions are not all bad, but you need to make them work for you. Use them as a reward for a solid chunk of work. Start out with distractions that are good for you, such as working out or calling your friends. If Facebook and Twitter are your things, block off time in your schedule to post or browse other people\u2019s updates, but stick to your schedule. Remember, you control the distractions. 5. Practice not being distracted Meditation is a great way to do this because it\u2019s just you and your thoughts. If that\u2019s not your thing, practice single-tasking throughout your day. At lunch, just eat. Don\u2019t read the newspaper or check your email at the same time. In meetings, don\u2019t doodle in your notebook or play with your phone. 6. Pay attention to yourself Start to notice when and how you get distracted. What thoughts happen just before that? Are you tired, hungry, or bored? As you learn what triggers your distractions, you can head them off before you slip into an hour-long IM chat. 7. Use technology to your advantage From blocking out distracting websites to tracking how much time you spend surfing the web, many apps can actually help you stay focused. Once you identify what your habits are, pick one that will help you meet your goals, but don\u2019t let these become distractions in themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes I think our minds are out to get us. It\u2019s easy to get distracted don\u2019t you think? What\u2019s helped me stay on course has taken some time to perfect, but it works for me. I started small, 30 minutes no more. I designated that half hour to one task and only one task. No distractions, no email, no checking my phone, no texting, facebook, no making coffee, etc. I worked with only one light on over my computer, the rest of the room was dark so that when I stopped to think I wasn\u2019t looking at any objects. Guess what, it worked. Not the first time, but by the third time I reached my goal and completed the typing I needed to do in less than thirty minutes. A week later I pushed a little further and moved it up to an hour without a break. Depending what the project is I\u2019m now comfortable sitting down and working non-stop for sixty to seventy minutes straight before a take a five minute break, but even that is regimented. It just a matter of training yourself to prioritize. Do you eat dinner every night, or go to work or school everyday? Well, this is the same thing. All you are doing is improving your work habits. If this doesn\u2019t work for you find a variation that you are comfortable with, but remember the keys to focusing is eliminating distractions and taking breaks at the end. You are in charge of you no one else. You can do it, it just takes an effort if you want to make things happen. ",

That analogy is an example of how difficult it is to focus on one task at a time today. Humans have trouble focussing and the endless streams of thoughts, notifications, alerts and distractions only make it worse. So, how does one go about putting focus back into order? Enter the Pomodoro Technique of time management. A method devised by Italians that utilises timers and breaks to help stay focussed while having fun. This is a famous productivity technique that has been used by people all around the globe (including myself). Here's how it works - You have a task at hand which should take 1 hour to complete. What do you do do?Take 25 minutes and work without any distractions. Avoid multitasking and simply focus on 1 task at a time.Done? Now take a break for 5 minutes. Do whatever interests you. Go for a walk, turn up your favorite song, light a cigarette, make a cup of coffee, whatever you like do it without worrying about the task at all.Resume Working Again. Repeat steps 2 & 3 again. For an hour, that converts to 50 minutes of work + 10 minutes of break.The point behind the Pomodoro Technique is to work with short bursts of focussed, undivided attention. Most often, our productivity goes for a toss when we are hit with distractions all around us. Multitasking ruins it even further. The Pomodoro Technique eliminates this. By setting a clear 'Work' timer and 'Play' time, you can take control of your focus and work with better mental agility. Plus, it will help your beat procrastination as you'll always have a break time to reward yourself after a session of working/studying. The key is to set a timer to 'work' and 'play' honestly and stick to it religiously.  Regaining your focus can be hard, especially when you really want to self-improve quickly. I personally have used and tried a couple of focus building hacks but nothing beats the simplicity and effect of the Pomodoro Technique. In fact, there are even apps that help you practice Pomodoro. I personally use Engross - Focus Better and it has helped me immensely in regaining the lost art of focus and productivity in the modern times. Hope this Helps! ",

            "answer_text": "We have turned into a world of highly distracted individuals, always looking for the next 'shiny ball' which usually shows itself in the form of an email, text, or Facebook notification. Like any bad habit, it will require an effort to stop yourself, but the knowledge of how multitasking negatively impacts your productivity may help. There are studies done by Professor Clifford Nass at Stanford and the University of London. These study results are cited in many articles on the subject of multi-tasking because while behavioral scientists may not agree on much, they seem to all agree that when we try to multi-task, the tasks take longer, we make more mistakes, and it causes stress. Prove it, you say? Watch this video and do the exercise. It\u2019s a great illustration of why multi-tasking (what we usually refer to as multi-tasking is actually switch-tasking) simply doesn\u2019t work. Our brain's can not process two tasks that draw on the same processing center. For example, if you are reading and listening to music, if the music has lyrics, both are drawing on the language processing part of the brain. Classical music does not draw on the same part of the brain and would be fine. They also say that music with lyrics that you are so familiar with, that you don't concentrate on the words, is also fine. Personally, if I'm talking on the phone and driving or cooking....it's a disaster. I constantly miss turns (even when I know where I'm going) and tend to omit critical ingredients. When I need to fully engage my brain, I shut off everything else and focus on just one task. It enables me to create my best work in less time. The emails, texts, and Facebook can wait.

            "answer_text": "In this new era of online learning, we are forced to, despite our distractions, concentrate on what the teacher is saying over the camera. If you\u2019re participating in this extreme-but-necessary new way of life\u2014 which about 97% of us are doing\u2014 you know the struggles that come with working from home. Whether it be actual work or school, people of all ages have better things they could be doing; and while some adults may have better methods of tuning out distractions, teenagers and young children do not have this ability down pat.  Being a high schooler myself, I get distracted easily with things I\u2019d rather be doing. In fact, just now, I went on my phone to look something up and proceeded to get distracted; I had just remembered that I didn\u2019t send my Snapchat streaks yet, so I did that, I scrolled through Instagram for a minute or two, and I checked in on the news just because I was on my phone. I\u2019m sure other teens can relate. Hell, some of us even check our phones during in-person class.  What if I told you there was a way you could cut it out? To free yourself from distraction. There\u2019s an app I found yesterday as I updated my phone to iOS 14. It wasn\u2019t made specifically for that, by the way, so you can get it for free in the App Store as long as you have iOS 11 or later. There isn\u2019t a Chrome extension or Android app yet.  This app is called Flora. It lets you plant a virtual tree for a specified duration of time to help you stay off your phone. If you exit the app, it detects that.  I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want to kill a tree\u2014 virtual or not. The same thing happens if you give up on your goal:  Ironically, I\u2019m writing this answer while I\u2019m bored on a Spanish call. No flex, but I aced Spanish II, so the review at the beginning of the year is kind of boring. I need the Chrome extension, guys!! So far, I like everything about the app. As I mentioned earlier, the thing is free. When compared to it\u2019s seemingly-better competitor, that\u2019s not bad:  Why do I say \u201cseemingly-better\u201d? Well, that\u2019s simply because there is no difference. How do I know that, since I\u2019ve never used Forest? Well, I have heard of it, for one thing. But also this thing on Reddit:  Psst, the in-depth comparison is here. As you can see here, Flora also plants trees like Forest, but it gives you the option to do so. In my case, I don\u2019t have my own means of payment, so I\u2019d rather just have an app that requires me to stay off my phone. The difference between Flora and Forest is the difference between Spotify and Apple Music: Spotify, like Flora, offers its service for free with enhanced features on a paid plan, while Apple Music, like Forest, requires you to pay for access to its service. I highly suggest Flora and I give them \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50; I believe they are underrated in the App Store\u2014 the app is #86 in Productivity! It should be ranked higher! Go download the app for free now. ",

            "answer_text": " No matter what environment humans are in, survival depends on being able to focus on what\u2019s important\u2013generally what\u2019s moving. That skill hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s just moved online,\u201d writes Alyson Gausby, consumer insights lead for Microsoft Canada. So what do you do when you need to focus on work\u2013and not what\u2019s moving around you? For most people, the first and most important step to increasing focus is to change the way you view it, says Elie Venezky \u201cFocus is a muscle, and you can build it,\u201d he says. \u201cToo many people labor under the idea that they\u2019re just not focused, and this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Once you drop this mistaken belief, you can take a much more realistic approach to building focus.\u201d With a combination of mindset and tools, it\u2019s possible to set up an environment that fosters focus. Here are eight tricks and tips for eliminating distractions and paying attention to what you need to do: 1. PREPARE YOUR BRAIN Before a task, calm your brain, says Venezky. \u201cTake a minute or two to sit in a comfortable position and breathe deeply into your stomach,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sit cross-legged or chant. Let your body calm down before you approach your work. You\u2019ll find it really helps you concentrate.\u201d 2. UNDERSTAND WHERE YOUR FOCUS NEEDS TO BE Focus also involves an understanding of what is worthy of your distraction, \u201cSuccess comes down to embedding that focus into the flow of how you work,\u201d he says. Webb suggests taking time to identify what deserves your focus for the year, for the month, for the week, and for the day. Then look at your calendar and block time dedicated to focus. Focus also involves an understanding of what is worthy of your distraction. \u201cThis keeps folks from being able to send calendar invites that are last-minute, nonemergency issues,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are focus killers.\u201d 3. UNPLUG FOR 30 MINUTES If you need to focus, log out of email and social media. \u201cEven if you live and die by email, do yourself a favor and log out for 30 minutes either in the beginning of the day or for a period in the afternoon,\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t believe how much you can get done when you\u2019re not always interrupting yourself to return emails.\u201d 4. GRAB SOME COFFEE That morning coffee doesn\u2019t just help you wake up; it helps you focus on the day. If you need an attention booster in the afternoon, a coffeeshop run might do the trick. In a study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, French physiologist Astrid Nehlig identifies a connection between caffeine and cognition. While caffeine doesn\u2019t improve learning or memory performance, Nehlig found it does increase physiological arousal, which makes you less apt to be distracted and better able to pay attention during a demanding task. 5. CHECK THE THERMOSTAT If it\u2019s too hot or too cool in your work environment, it could impact your focus. A study from Cornell University found that workers are most productive and make fewer errors in an environment that is somewhere between 68 and 77 degrees. Another study from the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland says the magic temperature is 71 degrees. If you don\u2019t control the thermostat, you can opt to bring a sweater or a fan. 6. TURN ON SOME MUSIC Too much background noise can be very distracting, but according to a study from the Wake Forest School of Medicine and the University of North Carolina published in Scientific Reports, having music playing helps you focus on your own thoughts. The catch? You had to like the song. \u201cGiven that musical preferences are uniquely individualized phenomena and that music can vary in acoustic complexity and the presence or absence of lyrics, the consistency of our results was unexpected,\u201d the researchers wrote. Whether it\u2019s Beethoven, the Beatles, or the Beastie Boys, turn it up and get to work. 7. TAKE SHORT BREAKS Instead of succumbing to distraction, build it in, suggests a study from the University of Illinois. Psychologist Alejandro Lleras found that participants who were given short breaks during a 50-minute task performed better than those who worked straight through. The study examines a phenomenon called \u201cvigilance decrement,\u201d or losing focus over time. Taking a short break in the middle of a long task reenergizes the brain. \u201cWe propose that deactivating and reactivating your goals allows you to stay focused,\u201d writes Lleras. \u201cOur research suggests that, when faced with long tasks, it is best to impose brief breaks on yourself. Brief mental breaks will actually help you stay focused on your task.\u201d 8. DOODLE If you\u2019re sitting in on a long meeting or conference, improve your focus\u2013and your artistic skills\u2013by doodling. According to a study from the University of Plymouth in England, doodling aids in cognitive performance and recollection. \u201cDoodling simply helps to stabilize arousal at an optimal level, keeping people awake or reducing the high levels of autonomic arousal often associated with boredom,\u201d writes lead researcher Jackie Andrade.

The tendency to use someone else's shoulder to fire should be avoided because ownership of one's own problems is the starting point of their resolutions. \u201cFocus or concentrate has a direct corelation with the intensity of interest in the subject matter. Therefore, it follows that the more you are interested in a subject, the more would be your capacity to focus on the same. Ultimately, interest is all about creating the State of the Mind conducive to making requisite effort to ensure success. Interest in anything can be enhanced by encouraging one's thought process to repeatedly think about the same positively. Positivity towards the subject in hand can be reinforced through the act of daring to dream(not day dream) on the positive aspects or benefits on you achieving success in your efforts to reach the desired goal. Once the thought regarding the pleasures awaiting you on reaching the said goal becomes strong enough to have entered your LTM or long term memory then it will provide you with the necessary motivation from within to go gunho after the desired goal. In such a State of the Mind, focussed efforts to achieve the desired objective is made with pleasure (literally) as it is attached with the thought of the pleasures of achieving the desired goal. Hence, fatigue at the mental level is not felt and one would be amazed by the extent of effort one is able to make in the process.\u201dTo learn single point concentration or focus one needs to master the art and the science of meditation under guidance of a guru.

That helps them know where not to go when they\u2019re working on something important. Personally, I suggest blocking time out for each task you absolutely need done right then. Flip your phone over, put it on vibrate, or just on Do Not Disturb. If you have a Mac (or if PCs have this option), turn on Do Not Disturb on your computer as well so that desktop notifications don\u2019t pop up and distract you. Keep your web activity restricted to pages relevant to your task only. It sounds harder than it is. If you catch yourself getting distracted, take a 5\u201310 minute break to check your messages, get a snack, and then get back to it. Honestly, it just takes getting into the groove of forcing yourself to be focused, then it gets much easier. ",

Attempt right now to not think about polar bears - try really really hard, with their white fur - what happens? POLAR BEARS!   Focusing on a task - and allowing your mind to be focused is similar to this.  There are always going to be subtle thoughts like an image of a polar bear, for example, passing through our active minds.  If you try to scream the thought out of your head, it comes at you with full force.  If, on the other hand, you acknowledge that yes, that polar bear image is there, but you know what I'm going to let that polar bear walk on by, then you can keep your mind at the task at hand. The next major idea is giving yourself permission to use your time.  When I am attempting to work on an art project, for example.  Often I find myself consumed by the thoughts that I am wasting my time - that I really should be doing laundry, or cleaning or studying or working.  I've found that I literally need to give myself permission to work on my art.  I have to allow myself chunks of time that are devoted to art, while acknowledging that I will attend to these other tasks (i.e. studying) at another designated point.  This cognitively allows me to focus more deeply and more peacefully on whatever task I am working on. I think if you start with learning how to mindfully meditate you could bring this practice and level of focus into all other areas of your life.  And when you become distracted, check in with your breath, yourself, and the task at hand - redirecting yourself back. Also - see the concept of flow as described through positive psychology.

Also the satisfaction with checking a box is pretty great.Also start working at issues for small amounts of time. Taking small breaks to allow your mind to wander. You can't just get out of bed and run a marathon.There are probably plenty of other ways, but I can only think of those three at the moment.

The real key to maintaining focus on a singular task is to put everything else out of your head and focus solely on that one thing\u2026 but that\u2019s easier said than done! The Kanban approach is a great method for doing this because it allows you to move your tasks along a chain of progression until completion by always only working on one task at a time (after all, even attempting to multitask has proven to create a massive drain on your productivity). If you\u2019re using an app to monitor your asks, setting Reminders ia great way to keep yourself motivated and on track. You can do this over in http://Buckets.co and apply Reminders to both Cards and individual Checklists items which will then show up in your feed when they\u2019re due (or overdue!).

This is because multi-tasking doesn't let you focus on the more important thing at hand. Also if you see, prioritizing work is very much important.A lot of times, we are doing something merely because it is expected from us to do it. We don't ask ourselves if that is what we really want to do. So, do what you love to do.Your friend is a night owl, all right, but that doesn't have to mean that you are one too. Everyone has certain peak times during the day when their concentration is better. Spot yours and get going.Training begins when you instruct yourself to persevere with a task. Let's say a task is very mechanical and doesn't interest you a bit but you have to do at any cost, try to focus on it. If you can persevere for, lets say, ten minutes, you can persevere for ten more and then ten more.If you can positively draw from others' speeds, it can help you stay focused. However, if not, it is better to tread at your own good pace.",

It doesn\u2019t need to be Sour Patch Kids - recently, they\u2019ve changed the recipe, and they\u2019re not so sour - but it could be anything. I have very good teeth, and I am very careful. I know my limits, I drink a lot of water as it helps to wash it out of your mouth, and I brush my teeth about 45 minutes after finishing the packet, as brushing too early can do more damage. My dentist is aware I have a huge love of sour things, and he taught me how to keep my mouth safe without quitting, although he always tries to convince me to quit the sour stuff altogether.

You have to re-energize by getting out of the chair and out of that room. After lunch, you will much more productive because you have the renewed energy to complete your tasks more efficiently. 2. Leave Your Work Unfinished Before Your Break This helps you to zap right back into the flow once you get back because your brain craves completion. This is actually a famous writing tip from Hemingway \u2013 he always left the last sentence unfinished, so he could pick up again easily the next session. 3. One Thing At A Time Multitasking cuts back on your productivity so instead of juggling multiple projects at once, focus on one thing at a time by scheduling out blocks of time \u2014 or even entire days \u2014 during which you only concentrate on one task or one project.

            "answer_text": "Of course, a precursor to remaining focused on a given task is having an interest/motivation in doing that task. Before beginning to work, try to write out your incentives for getting that task done and keep that list visible at all times. Think about the benefits of getting the task done early (positive reinforcement), as well as the consequences of not completing it on time (negative reinforcement). Once you have done this, there are various techniques that you can use to increase productivity and efficiency. My personal favorite is a method called the Pomodoro Technique, which has worked wonders for me. It involves the following: 1.) Rid yourself of all possible distractions, and set a timer for 25 minutes. Work for that entire 25 minutes, keeping a minor goal in mind that you\u2019d like to achieve by the end of it. 2.) Once the timer goes off, set another 5 minutes to rest. 3.) Repeat this 4 times. After this, you will have completed one \u201cPomodoro Session\u201d and have earned a 25 minute rest session. After this, repeat the process. Put simply, [(25 minutes work, 5 mins rest) x 4, 25 minutes rest] repeated however many times is necessary to complete the task at hand. This technique gives great incentive as it designates timed periods for both work and pleasure. It allows for micro-sessions that entail focused work and keep your work/rest periods ideally timed as per psychological research. Try it out; it increased productivity quite substantially for me as I hope it does for you. ",

Then start to focus on yourself physically and then mentally and then emotionally and then if you wish spiritually after that. So what this means is, focus on your breath. Then focus on what is coming into your mind because that has to be quietened. And this is where your question comes into play. Try to keep your mind clear. Any thoughts that come into your mind, ease them away don't push them away. You can do this by in the following way. Acknowledged and be aware that you have received a thought. Accept that you have received it. Tell yourself to not worry about that thought and tell the thought , it's okay,I will deal with you later . Continued to do this until you have no thoughts. If you wish to go further in your meditation, then do the same with your heart period then learn to connect your heart with your mind and then to your breath. Indeed you can connect it to your heartbeat as well. Once these three things are in unison, the physical mental and your emotional, you can then increase your spirituality by reflecting on your emotions and thoughts that are not of yourself, but of something more than yourself.

What this amounts to is making lists. I list the things I need to complete and add to the list as things come up. I keep an eye on my priorities and return to my current task over and over until its done or until a more important task comes along. Because I have all these written down, I never forget to return to whatever my last very important task was. But your question was on focus.

Maybe it was midnight and no one was tweeting. Regardless, don't look to just \"try harder.\" That rarely works. Just reverse engineer and test your assumptions.

So if it is true or maybe not , in both case you just need to keep yourself calm. First complete all the works about which your mind is thinking in doing a particular task. Try to keep your mind free from all the external forces. When you and your mind will be free from everything then only you can focus on a particular task. Most importantly you don't need to force yourself. Just try to understand the importance of that work. Good luck and I don't mind if you will upvote my answer. THANKS ",

Forcing yourself won\u2019t return much results however interest in a particualr topic or habit of making interest as per situation or requirement matters the most. We can force ourself one or two times and third time it will fail again. So better to concenrate on making interest rather forcing yourself. Things in which we have or can make interest will be enjoyable and productive to do. ",

You may also want to consider this practice: If something crosses your mind while your studying or working at home, and it continues to bug you, just make a quick note of that \"something\" and record it in a notebook, which you may want to designate as \"Distractions Notebook.\" This initiative helps to get that \"something\" out of your system.  To me, it's excellent way to do a brain dump, so that you have a de-cluttered mind to do the more important stuff. As soon as you have done this, move on with what you have been focusing on. When you are free, then only you can decide whether you want to address those \"distractions\" in your brain dump. Oftentimes, most of them will die out on their own, without your intervention at all. According to Dr Deepak Chopra, about 70,000 thoughts run through our mind in a given day. He even says about 95% of those thoughts are the same as yesterday's. [2016_Distractions Notebook] ",
