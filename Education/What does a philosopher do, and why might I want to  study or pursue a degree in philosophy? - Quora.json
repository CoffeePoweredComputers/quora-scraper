            "answer_text": "To be known as \u201ca philosopher\u201d is to have your philosophical ideas known to others, which means either speaking to audiences or recording them in written(or some other) format in order to disperse them. Anyone can write or speak about philosophical ideas, though. Just like in math, science, or many other fields, to be good you have to study the history of ideas before you. Most, if not all, of the fundamental ideas have been discussed(and maybe refuted) for millenia, there\u2019s no point reinventing the wheel. That doesn't mean all those ideas have been settled. Not by a long shot! The biggest and most fundamental questions will never reach consensus, and will reappear for the rest of humanity. Questions such as: what's more important, my right to do as I please, or the welfare of the group as a whole? What is freedom, and who's entitled to it? In the age of internet, anyone can create a blog or other type of channel to express their thoughts. There are also platforms that allow you to manage and collect income from subscribers. This is not necessarily an easy way to make a living. You must have some really great ideas or have some other reason for a lot of people to pay attention to you. A great example of this is Philosophy Tube. I and others contribute a few bucks a month because we appreciate and enjoy the content, but I\u2019m certain he's not exactly breaking the bank with that gig. If you spend enough of your life studying philosophy, you might just be able to become the teacher and make a living doing that, but I doubt if there are any guarantees on that. I\u2019ve about Silicon Valley philosophers like this one, but let's face it, if your dream is to work in Silicon Valley, you\u2019re much more likely to get there with a computer science degree. From the philosophers perspective, Silicon Valley could use some deep philosophical reflection as much or more than anyone. We live in an age where, by virtue of advanced computing power and a networked world, we have more power than every generation before us combined, and not enough regard for the ramifications of using it. Software companies are thinking less about the current and future impacts on society and humanity than about how to stay afloat in a cutthroat corporate world, where disrupt-or-be-disrupted is a way of life. If you're looking to make the world a better place, philosophy is as good a place to start as any, as long as you don't conflate getting a job that pays a cushy salary with contributing to society. One doesn't always go with the other. The people who have had the largest positive contributions and contributed the greatest ideas to society to society were certainly not the richest. ",

            "answer_text": "A genuine philosopher seeks to expand his or her understanding of truth, and follows his or her own burgeoning understanding of truth wherever it leads. Imagine that truth is river and you are standing in some small inlet high up in the mountains, seeking some wider shores but not knowing where the stream leads or if it will get you there. When philosophy is done well, it leaves the banks of your inlet littered with discarded ideas; false ideas imparted by parents, teachers, friends, professors, religious leaders, writers, even mathematicians and scientists; false ideas created by yourself, as well, concerning the meaning and nature of morality, the nature of creativity and its connection to approaching truth, and the value of logic. Presently, like everyone, you are at some point in that river of truth. Some aspects of your understanding, your place on the river, will intersect with others, but your place and your way forward is unique. First, to find your way forward you have to genuinely grasp where YOU are, coming to understand every aspect of the waters around you, the contours of the bank, even the nature of the stream\u2019s bed you are standing on; the clothes you are wearing, the strength in your arms, your legs, your heart, and your mind. As you begin to understand each of those elements all around, the river will show you a way to a slightly wider expanse with a different view, and slowly the expansion begins, but you never get to know what lies beyond the next bend until you get there. Moreover, if you tell the river what to be and where you want to be in it, you will be fighting it's natural flow and eventually you\u2019ll be another fool who has given up on expanding his own understanding of truth and instead has pulled himself out of the water, and started reading others\u2019 thoughts so as to pretend toward an understanding of that will never come from books, dogmas, religion, or science. Schopenhauer accurately noted that if you want to know who the true philosophers are stop paying anyone to teach it, and those who continue are the only one\u2019s who were ever genuinely philosophers. Having your personal understanding of truth expand within you is its own reward. When it begins to happen you will understand that and pursue it because you will also realize there is nothing more important than approaching truth. However, if you want money or the things money will buy, you are not seeking truth, you are telling truth what to be. If you want to be famous, you are telling truth what to be. If you want others\u2019 to follow or venerate you, or women to like you, you are telling truth what to be. If you have decided that logic, or science, or religion, or artistic creation, or mind altering drugs are the way to truth then you are telling truth what to be. You cannot listen when you are busy talking about what you think you already know. What philosophy offers materially is nothing; what it gives genuinely to the truth seeker is immeasurable. ",
