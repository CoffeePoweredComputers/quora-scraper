            "answer_text": "In the US salaries are negotiated been the union and the school board within each school district. There are 10000 school districts in the US. Many are unified school districts (K-12). In these districts it would be highly unlikely that an elementary school teacher would have a different salary then a high school teacher. Some contracts allow districts to offer bonuses or higher pay for in demand subjects so some math and science teachers might get a little more. I grew up and worked in the suburbs of Chicago in which the elementary schools were run by a separate school district with a separate school board and teacher contract then the high school they fed into. In most of these school districts the high school teachers had a contract that paid them often 20% then the elementary school teachers. I don\u2019t know if there are any other places that have districts like this. It seemed very inefficient to have a school district with 4 elementary schools, and two middle schools with its own school board and superintendent fees into a separate school district of one or two high schools with its own school board and superintendent.

            "answer_text": "Generally, no. In most school districts, teachers at all levels make the same. There are, however, some examples of this not being entirely true. Many districts allow teachers to \u201csell\u201d their prep time to teach additional classes. Because of scheduling, this basically never works for elementary teachers, but can be used by secondary teachers to make more money. There are also opportunities for high school teachers to take on extra duties for extra pay that are not generally available to elementary teachers (though they are on occasion). This includes things like coaching, mentoring, advising a club, chaperoning events, etc. There are probably other examples, some of them more or less obvious to outside notice, but these are two major examples I am personally aware of.

Those working in London may get an additional weighting applied, depending on location. While I accept the salaries listed, don\u2019t believe the \u201chours worked\u201d - nearly fell off my sofa laughing at the figures listed. Teachers put in somewhere between 50 and 100% extra hours above and beyond what they\u2019re paid for in marking homework, creating and updating lesson plans and continuous professional development, even during the Summer holidays. My mother worked as a supply teacher filling in for planned and unplanned absences in local Primary Schools. While she only worked a day or two a week most of the time she still put in a lot of effort outside of classroom hours. ",
