            "answer_text": "You need a reason not to teach sex ed? Man. That\u2019s a tough one. I\u2019m a big fan of sex ed. See\u2026 my parents never had \u201cthe talk\u201d with me. Ever. If it hadn\u2019t been for sex ed, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have figured out how sex worked, but I wouldn\u2019t have known some of the particulars about safety. I likely would have made some\u2026 mistakes and wound up with a lot of\u2026 responsibilities. After all, sex is like using a sword, right? The pointy end goes into the other person. Wow\u2026 that wasn\u2019t my best analogy. Moving right along. There are a lot of people in the same boat as me. Their parents aren\u2019t necessarily squeamish, they just never get around to \u201cthe talk.\u201d Not because they assume schools will cover it. But hey, that isn\u2019t a big deal, right? My buddies will tell me everything I need to know. Except\u2026 one of the guys I knew swore that you couldn\u2019t get a girl pregnant if she was still wearing her clothes (If you\u2019re curious, that isn\u2019t true). But I feel like I\u2019m trying to sell you on why we should still have sex ed. Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to be taught. After all, I think parents can always get a waiver. They can opt out. Oh\u2026 that\u2019s right. You need a reason to not have sex ed in taught in school, even though teen pregnancy\u2014 sorry. I almost did it again. Okay. I\u2019m ready. We shouldn\u2019t teach sex ed because\u2026 Teens who get their education railroaded by an unplanned pregnancy are a vital component of our manual labor workforce!Doctors need patients. Pregnant teens need doctors. By terminating sex ed, you\u2019re becoming a job creator! You\u2019ll also grow jobs in the pharmaceutical industry\u2014especially manufacturers of STD medication.You\u2019ll be saving schools a tiny bit of money in materials (of course that savings will be used up by having alternative education programs for pregnant teens).Um\u2026 that\u2019s all I have for now.

            "answer_text": "Because it's important to maximise the number of sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancies and abortions in teenagers, because these are valuable disincentives to sexual experimentation, which is a much more serious problem. Countries where sex ed is mandatory from Junior School onwards have shockingly low rates of these phenomena, so sexual experimentation is rife, and they learn to practice safe sex, which is just another word for promiscuity. They also grow up thinking that being gay is normal for some people, rather than the truth, which is that it is an abomination, and as everyone knows, just leads to boys becoming sissies, and eventually paedophiles. Is also very important to keep children ignorant of the real world they will grow up into, because the more they learn, the more they start asking impertinent questions about things which are none of their concern. Also, children are innocent, and teaching them about sex isn't appropriate, because it's filthy and disgusting, and when they get married it's important that they should be fearful and inexperienced, or they might start deciding for themselves what they enjoy, and end up doing all sorts of sinful perversions. And it's not just sex ed, it's very important to steer them away from the evils of masturbation, as is well known that this can lead to blindness and insanity. It is much better to teach them not to even wash those parts, because touching them at all is completely unnecessary, an invitation to sin, and not something any parent wants to talk about. Another real danger is vaccinating girls against the human papilloma virus. Knowing that they won't catch papilloma just encourages girls to be more promiscuous, and it's completely unnecessary, because girls who save themselves for marriage will never catch it. In short, teaching sex ed represents a real and present threat to the God-given moral values that all decent people believe in. ",
