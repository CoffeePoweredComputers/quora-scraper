            "answer_text": "A2A by Nikita Pareek CBSE used to provide scholarships for students of class 10 and class 12 earlier but as far as I know since the NDA government took over the administration in 2014, scholarships have been ceased from the next year. My elder sister got scholarship only for one year (she passed 12th in 2014) which could not be renewed. We still don\u2019t know whether it was our mistake or the scholarship got canceled. Further, there are too many restrictions on scholarships in CBSE. For class 10, the student should be a single girl child. The family income bracket should not be more than ___, which was a negligible amount. So, I would suggest that you should search for scholarships from other organizations. Maybe some NGOs working in this sector provide you with scholarship. But again, the income bracket of the family must be negligible. You can look up the site of MCD and also the local MLA\u2019s office might be providing some scholarships to students in their area.  Hope this helps! ",
