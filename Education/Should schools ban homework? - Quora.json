            "answer_text": "There must be a typo in this question. It should read, why should schools always assign homework? A rule of thumb is, 10 minutes of homework for each grade. So in the sixth grade you would have an hour of homework. That sounds about right. At the end of high school, you would have two hours of homework. First of all, if you don't have homework, kids will spend their time in totally idiotic things. Why do you prefer that? Second of all, kids going to college should expect 2 to 4 hours of homework every day. You have to get them ready for that and accustomed to it. Private schools prepare their kids to be serious students. On the other handy, one of the saddest things is that public schools often do not prepare their kids to be serious students or even serious people. It would be wonderful if we could fix this. ",
