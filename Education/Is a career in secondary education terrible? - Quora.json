            "answer_text": "I have been in teaching since the 1970s in the U.K., but as a woman who chose to put family ahead of career, I may not be the best person to ask! I could certainly have earned quite a lot more than I did, and achieved more in the way of promotion, if I had been prepared to be ruthless about parking my children with a childminder and going straight back to work full-time when they were babies, because the opportunities were certainly there, but I decided I cared more about my children than career advancement. So I chose not to be a career woman - but plenty of men and women do go all out for it. Nobody gets rich by teaching, and you work pretty long hours during term-time, but there is a lot of job satisfaction to be had, kids can be great to work with, and you do at least know you are doing something that matters. A friend of mine teaches Physics at a sixth form college (Years 12 and 13), and both he and his students have a great time; he uses all his non-teaching enthusiasms such as kayaking and climbing to teach them about the Physics principles underlying everything involved. The students love his classes, learn a lot (including their introduction to various new sports) and do well in their exams, and many of them go on to do Physics at university - or Engineering. You might be one of the world's enthusers, like Steve. He isn't getting rich, and has turned down several opportunities for more senior posts that would take him away from teaching and allow him less time with his own young children, because salary and job title aren't everything. The buzz he and his students get out of Physics is great compensation - and nobody in his family is going to starve. And he is able to go on camping and canoeing holidays with his wife (who is a primary school teacher) and the children that might not be possible if he were in engineering. You don't have to pick a career now and stick to it, in any case. You could spend some years in engineering (earning good money and getting valuable experience) and switch to something else, a few years down the line - which might be teaching, or something else entirely. None of your experience will be wasted, whatever you do; the more varied your experience, the more you will be able to see how inter-connected everything is, and the better you will be at what you are doing. I think it would probably be easier to go for a career in engineering first and then switch (e.g. to teaching) than the other way round. That way, you won't be the older guy who hasn't got any engineering experience, competing with shiny new graduates straight out of university. And being slightly older when you start can be a real advantage in teaching: you don't look like a beginner who is no older than their big brother, so they are less likely to play you up. And your real-world experience will pay off when you are teaching them, as well as in your dealings with the school management. I hope this is helpful. Best of luck, whichever way you decide to go!

            "answer_text": "Well, my eldest is an engineer and she is happy.  She makes a lot of money too.  Teachers do not, obviously. That is the bad news. The good news is that STEM teachers (science, math, engineering,) are highly sought after and even pay more in a lot of districts. I think if you like people and in particular, kids, then teaching is the most fun career anyone can have.  Seriously.  Plus, with weeks off during summer, you can still do some contract work to keep your hand in the market  if you choose. I feel like people in college put too much emphasis on what they are going to do with the rest of their life.  There are no forever choices once you have your degree.  You can try teaching for awhile, see if you like it, and if not, you will still be an engineer.  One of the best ways to do this is to do a bit of substitute teaching after you get your degree.  If you like it, and you are good at it, your degree program may be in enough demand (depending on where you are,) that your school district may actually pay for your Master\u2019s in Education.  My eldest, the engineer, plans on teaching at the college level as her slow down career prior to full retirement. Good luck! ",
