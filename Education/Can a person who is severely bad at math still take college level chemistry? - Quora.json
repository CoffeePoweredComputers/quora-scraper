            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u201cseverely bad at math\u201d? For me that means you\u2019re struggling with basic mathematical operations. Also, are you just assuming that you\u2019re really bad at math before even trying or do you mean you\u2019ve tried every possible thing and still can\u2019t figure out math? It\u2019s necessary to ask these questions because I keep seeing questions along the lines of \u201cI only got a 97% in math, is my life over?\u201d in Quora. Anyway, only you know the level of math you\u2019re capable of. I can give you a breakdown of college level chemistry classes and what type of math knowledge is required typically. Then you can decide for yourself. General chemistry - Basic algebra and some logarithmic functions. Organic chemistry - Barely any mathematics, except for few basic operations. Ability to visualize 3d structures of molecules. Analytical chemistry - Decent amount of algebra and logarithms Biochemistry - Similar to organic chemistry Thermodynamics - Calculus knowledge required. Mostly derivatives. Quantum mechanics - Extensive knowledge in calculus, especially multi variable calculus, triple integration etc. Inorganic chemistry - Sort of in the middle depending on what topics are covered. Algebra is required. Also the ability to visualize 3d structures. Group theory and molecular orbital theory may be confusing at first. Obviously the above description is just an overview. It will depend on on the syllabus and the teaching style. But it should give you a general idea of what\u2019s expected. If you have decent algebra skills, you will be fine in every chemistry class except physical chemistry (thermodynamics and quantum mechanics) at least in undergraduate level. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends how bad you are at math, and what type of college level chemistry you are taking. If you are talking about AP Chemistry, which I assume you are, most of the curriculum doesn't focus on complex math concepts. In fact, the multiple choice section of the AP test doesn't even allow the use of a calculator. Most of the math you'll be doing are unit conversions using dimensional analysis or plugging in numbers in to formulas, which is pretty much algebra. The real difficulty is deciding which equation to use. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes but you'll have to rely on memorization for everything. A strong understanding of algebra and geometry will get you through most of the most basic concepts in chemistry just by observation and relatively small amounts of memorization. ",
