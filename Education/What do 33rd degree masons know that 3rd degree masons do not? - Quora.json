            "answer_text": "For those who are unaware, the \"33rd Degree\" is part of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which is an organization that exists within Freemasonry that Master Masons may join if they choose to. The \"degrees\" of the Scottish Rite are not higher than the Third degree, despite the numerical appearance. With that out of the way, a Mason who has received the 33rd Degree of the Scottish Rite knows two things: 1. What happens during the 33rd degree. Obviously, you wouldn't know about it if you hadn't seen it, which most people haven't.1a. While the Scottish Rite is a large organization, it still only comprises a fraction of Masonry's population. Accordingly, a 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Mason knows what goes on within the Scottish Rite in general. 2. More importantly, someone with the 33rd Degree knows that Degrees do not go higher than the Third. This plays off my opening remark; many people, including Masons, really don't know the significance of the Scottish Rite relative to Craft Masonry. It's not uncommon to hear a less experienced Mason reference someone and say \"That guy is a 32nd Degree Mason\" (much more common to encounter and sounds important). It's also not unusual to hear people self-refer as \"32nd degree Masons\" earlier in their Masonic career. This happens because the numbers sound higher and people don't fully appreciate/understand the egalitarian nature of the Fraternity and that the Third degree is the heart of everything. I have several friends who been nominated for and received the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite. These men have great experience and knowledge; they fully appreciate that they are equals with everyone in Masonry, despite receiving a high honor. Two of those friends were very close with a now-deceased Member of my Lodge. This now-deceased Brother was one of the oldest \"33rd Degree\" guys around and was prominent in everything he did. When the one friend had stopped attending meetings for personal issues, this older Brother spoke with him and asked him to come back when he could. He told him that his Blue Lodge was the cornerstone of the Fraternity and that everything we did was built from that foundation. The friend knew this, of course, and hearing his old mentor say it inspired him to return and become active again. In conclusion: Third Degree Masons are taught that we are all equal; 33rd Degree Masons know it. ",

            "answer_text": "Although the gist of it is explained in other answers, there is some confusion remaining. So I would rather clarify some concepts, and have the answer become self apparent. What is a 33rd Degree Mason? One of two very similar, yet very different things. As only members of the Scottish Rite\u2019s Supreme Council of the 33rd that preside and confer the legendary 33rd\u2019, it has become a prize or a symbol of prestige. Since it cannot be pushed, or paid for, it is ultimately rewarded to individuals in recognition for their services. These are all still just Master Masons, and as the Craft only has 3x degrees - you thus cannot place anyone higher than that Sublime Degree of a Master Mason. Simply put, the rest of the \u201cdegrees\u201d that follow is additional learning. But they are not higher learning. Thus, with this in mind, you need to look at these additional bodies, or auxiliary bodies, too Freemasonry and understand how they fit in - since they are not actually part of pure ancient Freemasonry. The Scottish Rite This is actually called the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, and this body presides over the Southern 80% of the United States of America. As so often pointed out, one of the most prominent figures in the Scottish Rite was indeed Gen. Albert Pike, who worked to ratify the degrees and ensure they are more accessible. He also wrote the much discussed \u201cMorals and Dogmas of Freemasonry\u201d. Something that by title incorrectly implies that there is in fact Dogma. Which further incorrectly imply that Freemasonry is a religion. These elements dealing with religion has caused Freemasonry to be seen as, or tied to a religion. It is something the ratification actually sought to do away with (and has within the Southern Jurisdiction). It is common in the Scottish Rite for some to do their EA (1st) to MM (3rd) in the same lodge as the higher degrees. This means that the craft degrees are not confined to blue lodge, as is common elsewhere. But, it rather forms part of the whole larger journey. This is not an issue though, since it is now common in America. So much so, that you could get all your degrees partially conferred in name, part in mass working, up until the 32nd\u2019. This means in two easy weekend sessions, you can be a 32nd\u2019 degree Mason. Inline with the mass craft workings that similarly allow you to do 1st to 3rd\u2019 workings on a single Saturday. I have had much flack for mentioning this, but it is in essence the gist of how it is done in certain places in the USA. This said though, there are many who do not do the weekend thing - which is a good in my opinion, and in many cases, in my opinion only. The York Rite (and closely related English Workings) Although the York Rite (ironically quite American) varies from the way it is done in England, the gist is the same as in Britain. The main difference is that only after the minimum of a year after becoming a Master you are eligible to join the Ancient and Accepted Rite. This is under the Northern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, that serves both a part of the United States, England, and many other territories overseas. In this incarnation the degrees are conferred in separate workings, the first being the 18th\u2019 or Rose Croix. Here you have to go through and do all the workings of the Eminent Preceptor (Master) before being recommended for your 30th\u2019. This really means you need to go through the chair first, and do all the work yourself. This translates to a long time, which like the Craft Ladder, can easily take 7 years or more. The same goes for a 30th\u2019, 31st\u2019 and 32nd\u2019. These higher degrees are also known to be \u201cdead men\u2019s shoes\u201d as there are only a certain amount of spaces allocated per district or province based on the amount of Lodges in the district or area (there is a formula). This simply implies that for the higher degrees you have to do the work to be come eligible, and then you will have to wait until someone dies before you are recommended to go to the next degree. It sounds morbid, but it has always worked that way, and thus it makes succession actually mean something. Especially since it has been worked, and waited for. The Simple Answer It thus heavily depends what 33rd\u2019 degree you look at. But, I can openly say that the secrets of Freemasonry is that there are no real secrets, and will assure you that any other wrongly attributed mystical knowledge is just conspiracy fantasy, and should not be taken seriously. A 33rd\u2019 is not superior to anyone in the 3rd\u2019. The lessons learnt here helps towards patience, and hopefully humility by the time they do progress. If anything, you will learn that all good things come with time. The takeaway being that hard work and patience is ultimately rewarded, even if just with the honor of advancement. Even if it is in something that may mean nothing in the eyes of the world, nor holds any worldly sway. ",
