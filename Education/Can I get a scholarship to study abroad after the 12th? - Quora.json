Yes, as you said, scholarship options in USA are less; however, finding some $1,000- $2,000 USA is a common practice as a discount in your first year tuition fee. Moreover, the UK is the home of scholarship, you can earn up to 4,000 Pounds scholarship. There are various scholarships available with various universities: First come first serve: To attract the early international student\u2019s applications they offer some bursaries at the start of an intake.Merit based: Given to some of the meritorious students based on their academic performance.Fixed Bursaries: Sometimes, they have some fixed bursary amount for almost all of the international students - everyone applying to their UG & PG program becomes eligible for this.Canada again good to study with and cost effective, but not many scholarship options. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, Scholarships are of types. Government scholarships, Scholarships offered by Universities itself and scholarships offered by private providers. If you have a college or university where you would like to apply, you may be better off by contacting an Admissions Counselor at each college or university and asking your questions to each of them. Most college and university home web pages have links to the Admissions department from that main web page. Most of the Admissions Offices will provide an email contact, so you may send messages with your questions. One can easily get information about scholarships online. Rather than searching for each type of scholarship for which you feel qualified, they allow you to just put in your preferences and find hundreds of potential sources for free college money. From my personal experience, I found WeMakeScholars to be very useful in finding the scholarships that suit me the most, as they offer a great customized search. You can check the site here. Hope this helps, Good Luck. ",
