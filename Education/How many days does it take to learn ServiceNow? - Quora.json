            "answer_text": "It depends what do you want to do in ServiceNow (SNOW). SNOW is a very big platform with lot of different modules and each of them having their own lot of features. In general if you just want to know how to use ServiceNow. It should not take more than a day. If you want to be System Administrator, if I am not wrong, the standard training is 3 days. If you want to be a SNOW developer, then I would say 5 days to understand some intrinsics. If you want to specialize in some of the modules then it will take some more time. ",
