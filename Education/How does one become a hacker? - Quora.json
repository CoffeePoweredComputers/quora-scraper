            "answer_text": "Sounds pretty much like Baker.. Quite different.. it's \"HACKER\" The coolest way to be a hacker:1.) Buy a long, black trench coat.  2.) Get a skateboard. Preferably a large-tail one like Bart Simpson rides circa early '90s. 3.) Have a large disposable supply of Macbooks Pros, cleverly built in translucent polycarbonate containers. 4.) Transmit everything physically over 3.4 inch floppies (PRISM, obviously).  5.) Get a super legit handle like \"Z3r0C001\" or \"ThePlague.\" Everyone on /r/h4x0r will hate you if you have something frowntown like - you know - your name. 6.) Get a job at a large Fortune500 company as their head of security with absolutely no credentials, proof of expertise, or reason why you should be there. Given that it's also implicitly implied that you have a significant criminal background, do something magical to ensure that it doesn't come out in your background check. 7.) Stalk the streets of New York like you're fucking Spiderman and come out of the cuts to get sensitive information on floppy by holding onto the side door of your probably very confused Uber driver (note: you will probably not get a 5 star customer rating for this).  The less cool but actually-relevant way to get into information security:1.) Get really excited about programming. Anyone that tells you that you don't need to program (or at least have a strong background in programming) to be a security engineer either is lying to you or doesn't want you to get past the entry level. Being able to smash the stack is one thing. Understanding that you can't smash the stack in a given interpreted language because the interpreter won't let you is another. Knowing that a certain bug reported recently in the intrepreter's garbage collector could be exploited to effectively the same thing is the kind of stuff that gets you acclaim and promotions is the consequence of spending alot of time programming.  2.) Study computer science and mathematics. A good CS degree will get you some of the way there with regards to tech skills (*nix, some networking if you choose to do so, etc.) If you really want to get into security, getting into cryptography while you're in college is a must and will give you deep insight into the architecture of encryption.    A strong foundation in theory and computer science is a clutch skill for any security professional. The day Knuth decides to become a criminal hacker is the day we're all screwed. 3.) Get internships that will teach you how software engineering and programming actually works in the real world. Try to get a diverse range of companies here: startups, F500s, etc. 4.) After you intern and get exposed to the real world, try to get a feel for where you want to start your adventure. Do you want to be on the front lines as a sysadmin? Do you want to be a software engineer building security products? Do you want to be a security architect or manager? 5.) Given your choice in 4, research what you need to get an entry level position in that field. In some cases you may need to get certifications like CISSP. If you want to go government, note that you'll probably also have to get clearance. If that's the case, get ready to deal with the polygraph and stop doing illegal shit like smoking weed (this is a huge deal-breaker for most folks going for TS+) immediately.  6.) Get to know the scene. Hang out at 2600 meetings. Go to DefCon and Blackcon. Make friends. Learn a ton. Discover how blatantly wrong the media is about people who live and work in information security.   7.) Learn to be social and communicate with others regardless of their technical background. This is essential in any field of tech, and will give you flexibility to basically go anywhere and do anything.  Most important of all: Enjoy it. This is a field that requires a lot of passion to stay current in. It's also a field where things aren't usually filled with riveting excitement. When things are that exciting, it's usually because something horrible happened.  If you don't like security but you want to be come a \"1337 h4x0r\" because of great romantic comedies like Hackers, you're destined for failure. But if you're passionate about infosec, technology, and are willing to put in the wrench time you can absolutely make a difference in this field of high tech. So, it's all about your passion and dedication towards \"Hacking\" patience being one of the most important one..All the Best !! ",

            "answer_text": "Here's is my personal \"how.\"  Perhaps it will be enlightening to you.  6th grade:  I was there in the hallway, alone.  Can't remember how or why, but I was just there, idle, bored.   I see the locked doors to the classrooms and approach. Young eyes  contemplate the lock and imagine possibilities...  are there any? It's locked right?  Should not do anything.  People expect it to do nothing and ignore it, unless they have the key, but is that really true? And the hack begins. I felt the locked knob, pushed it in, pulled it out, wiggled it, and settled in on jiggling it back and forth varying speed, pressure, timing, etc...  At first, it was just all about what movement can actually happen in the locked state. Then it was about exploring the boundaries of that movement. And during that exploration, more movement was possible!  And more, and more, and it opened and I was in!  No key.   I arrived at a place where I could open most doors in that building by simply standing there and manipulating the knob!  Took maybe a minute on average, sometimes far less. No joke. Turns out, that style of lock wasn't the very best, and it's manufacturing tolerances were not sufficient to prevent opening under all conditions, or maybe better said, enough conditions to prevent manipulation as a means to get past the locking structures. At that time, I knew little about locks, but I did have a sense of the world and was always exploring the dynamics of everyday things.   For me, I sometimes frame this as, \"unexpected input\" and I'll provide it just to see if the rules are the rules in the world, or if everything is planned for, or engineered to perform exactly to spec. Often it isn't.  More interestingly, and possibly disturbingly at times, it's more often than your average person would think. Where there are gaps in our understanding, or rules, or the dynamics of  devices, people and things, there exists the potential for the hack, or that providing of input that maybe isn't typical, or expected, or planned for, or reasonable. Another one was the phone.  We had an old dial phone when I was growing up.  I was messing with it one day and got a connect by repeatedly clicking the \"hang up\" switch.  Turns out, that's how a dial phone works!  I had got the operator after a sequence of 10 clicks that fell within the timing constraints the system needed to recognize that activity as a dial as opposed to somebody just manipulating the phone, like to move the handset and straighten out the cord. Once I was aware of that, of course, what else can it do? And there is the hacking exposed.  I quickly learned to dial calls without the dial. So I dialed up a friend, and we toyed with the phones while on a call.  At  some point, we ended up in a three way call with an operator, who was very confused. Worse, none of us could end the call!  Even when all three of us hung up and waited, the call was connected!  A tech had to fix it, and I got a lecture about the phones. A few years later, I got a field trip at school and it was to the phone company.   They showed us the mechanical system that would connect calls!  It was this impressive thing with levers, terminals, connectors, etc... and  when people dialed up, it would position things so that the phones were  connected and then the call could happen. Nobody ever checked it thoroughly for the \"receiving pulses while already on a call\" case, and we had triggered the system to make a type of connection it was not designed for.  And it worked just fine otherwise, because the vast majority of people would provide expected and planned for inputs. For all I know, my friend and I were the first to expose that functionality in the system.  \"call locking\"  heh So there are a couple examples. I must say something else here too. There is benign hacking.  One learns about the world by providing inputs to it, or doing stuff.  Learn by doing, and or playing. And that little kid spark, that sense of \"play\" stays with people who are  inclined to hack.  It never, ever goes away.  It's in me, and even though I've been here a while, I still will encounter something novel to me, and that kicks in.  \"let's play with it!\"   What does it do?  What is is supposed to do? Those are two entirely different questions! IMHO,  this kind of hacking is an ordinary human thing.  Curious humans will attempt to learn by doing.  And in a way, it's a little like the scientific method applied in life.  One wonders, makes a guess and tries things to see if the result can be reproduced or predicted.  That's basically science to gain understanding. Or, one does stuff to watch and learn.  Less scientific, but often revealing.  Maybe something is discovered in this play, and that leads to deep and potent understanding. It's intrinsic to me.  Always has been.  Standard feature.  I have to pay attention to not do it in some contexts.   Where a person goes with all of that that could end up nefarious too.   With understanding comes responsibility.  I never pay for locksmiths, for example.  Nor does anyone who knows me.   But you also will never find me on the wrong side of the intent of a lock either, not without cause. Damn good cause. And I think this makes some people uneasy.  It's on the honor system mostly.   Of course, we can and do catch people on the poor side of honor and there is a process for all of that as our awesome friend Adri\u00e1n Lamo has shared with us, for example.  (Adrian knows I wrote this and why and that it's with the best of intent.  He suggested this be an answer and so it is.) And you know what?  He's still on the honor system, and is demonstrating  honor in his frank and very entertaining sharing of his experiences.  I think very highly of that and anytime we can share \"the hack\" or the nature of it, good things happen way more than bad things do.   So I'm a fan, and I worry sometimes over our reaction and the sometimes painful pressure to suppress that spark in people.  Sometimes it goes in ways we would rather not have had it go, but man!  Most of the time it's just empowering and good things happen. I'm about the good things.  The more the merrier.   And I worry that they, and I mean society overall, fails to see the  empowerment as the net gain it is.  Sometimes I worry a lot.  I've been  shunned in my life for people just knowing I had that inclination.   It's that inclination to hack and understand that nets us so much!  And for  me, growing up in poverty, it was the difference between a depressing,  crappy life, and an awesome one learning all sorts of stuff! When things are good, hacks can seem frivolous.  And maybe they are,  entertainment and enlightenment aside.  One can say the same of a trickster or clown too.  The trickster is a sort of hacker in how they come to toy with people to gain understanding of their perceptions. Ask Penn and Teller, one of whom is published scientifically and peer  reviewed [1] on the topic of human perception.  There is value in all of  that, and for them, money.  Plenty of it.   [1] turning tricks into research : Article : Nature Reviews Neuroscience But, when things are bad? This is when you want to know somebody inclined to hacking, or develop it in your own self. As a little kid, I remember the day I realized there are the official possible things to do.  And that's often a subset of human extreme limits.   And that set of things is a subset of the actual possibilities our world will permit.   Physics, basically.  Every last one of the great physicists are hackers.  They  want to pry reality open and look at the pieces inside to understand. Think of how all of it can work like a safety factor.  Most people stay in the safety factor and they may not understand there is some safety built in too.  Some do have that understanding and will operate outside that safety factor, but still within their own personal limits as a human. And then there comes a time and place where one must do what it takes.   Sometimes limits aren't there, but for our own understanding!   Realizing this changes a person just a little.  And it can happen in all kinds of ways.   Many, who are inclined to hacking of various kinds, understand \"do what it  takes\" in a more absolute sense than we may find a more typical person  does. Finally, a girl I knew growing up wanted to hack.  She could see it and would play with me regularly.  And by play, I mean with tech, the world, people, etc...  One day I picked up a pen and asked her what she saw.  \"A pen, of course silly!\" I told her I saw a device, and it has parts, and they have properties, and all of that is setup to perform the task of writing, but one does not technically have to write with the pen. \"But how do you know?\" \"Take it apart.  See?  Look at all this stuff!\" ... and so the conversation went. Most of the time, a pen is just a pen.  When one needs or is bored, a pen is a resource, or tool, or toy, weapon, etc... And she and I spent many hours taking stuff apart or doing novel things.   I think the hacker \"spark\" can be shared.  It's latent in many people.   And in a way, I think it's a lot like inhibition in general.  One can crack that by having experiences.  This is part of why we make people speak in public as kids a time or two.  We want to stimulate them to see what comes of it. Most people experience an ordinary outcome:  \"OK, I can do this.\"  But some people find out they love it, or are great somehow!  We lose out, if we don't give everybody a go.   The hacker simply does that same kind of thing with the world they live in and the people and or stuff they find in it. Hope that helps convey what \"hacking\" actually is.   Really, \"hacking\" has nothing at all to do with computers and networks.  Those things are just very compelling targets for hacking, and because of  that, there is a lot of hacking going on. But the nature of the hacker is distinct apart from all of that.  Anything that can do something, or that has complex dynamics, or functions, can be hacked on and the products of that hack are understanding of that thing that goes deeper than the obvious, or official, or expected types of understanding.

            "answer_text": "Ahhh, so you want to enter into the wonderful world of pen testing. Note, I said pen testing and not \u201chacking\u201d. One reason I did this is because I believe that simply breaking into something you don\u2019t own is a recipe for a dead end job. It\u2019s like saying \u201cI want to learn to lock pick so I can go steal a bunch of stuff out of peoples houses\u201d. Eventually you will get caught. On the other hand, you could have someone pay you much more to test the security of their business. But once you get a record, very few places will hire you. A record is not \u201cstreet cred\u201d and doesn\u2019t represent someone who is better at the craft. It\u2019s a liability. On to the meat of the subject. To enter the world of being a pen tester, there is some foundational knowledge required like networking, linux, window administration, and optionally learn how to code (IMHO coding helps with the journey as it forces an understanding of computer architecture). Next pick up a copy of Penetration Testing by Georgia Weidman. It\u2019s a bit dated but the content is still very relevant. That\u2019ll take you through a lot of the fundamentals around using kali linux, getting your lab set up, etc. After tearing through the book, you have enough knowledge to be dangerous and more than enough to get 5\u20137 in federal. Pull down a bunch of images on vulnhub and go to town. Keep your lab network isolated. Some of these VMs are the equivalent of setting a dumpster fire inside your house. After that, if you are not burnt out, go through the OSCP certification. Plan on spending at least 3 months in the labs and realize there will not be a whole lot of hand holding. It\u2019s designed to be frustrating. At the end of the day, pen testing is about being persistent, having a curious mind, an understanding of the underlying technology, with some social engineering mixed in. There are of course, more facets than just that but being a pen tester really represents a neat intersection of psychology and engineering. Another part of that is often not mentioned is to network, network, network. Start attending OWASP meetups. You may find that the breaker track (AKA Pen Tester) is not what you want to do. The builder and defender side is also a lot of fun. Personally I tend to hang out on the builder side of the spectrum. To repeat my earlier caveat, and what I tell everyone that I demonstrate a bit of the \u201cdark arts\u201d to, if you don\u2019t own it, don\u2019t break into it. There is no such thing as a \u201cgrey hat\u201d. You are a black hat if you break into something you don\u2019t own and do not have permission to break into. If someone does give you permission to break into their stuff, make sure you have a written contract saying it\u2019s ok (AKA get out of jail free card). Eventually you will get to know law enforcement in this field, you want to know them as peers and not as someone who is stuffing you into the back of a cruiser :) Good luck! ",

Start off by doing the following. * NEVER ask anyone how to be a hacker. That just shows that you are not ready for this and probably won\u2019t make it very far. If you REALLY want to learn, then you need to dedicate yourself towards it and set goals for what you want to learn. Start by doing, not by asking. You\u2019ll learn more and more on the way and eventually, you\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s writing answers to questions like these. If you really want to become a \u201chacker\u201d, you\u2019ll need to specify what type you want to be. White hat? Black hat? Grey hat? Here are some definitions. Grey Hat: The term \"grey hat\" refers to a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker. White Hat: A white hat hacker is a computer security specialist who breaks into protected systems and networks to test and asses their security. White hat hackers use their skills to improve security by exposing vulnerabilities before malicious hackers (known as black hat hackers) can detect and exploit them. And a black hat hacker is one that maliciously perpetrates and exploits Let\u2019s say you wanted to learn how to break into websites. The first thing you would need to do is figure out how websites work. Start by teaching yourself some mark up & programming languages. I\u2019d recommend starting in the following order:* HTML* CSS* PHP* JavaScript *Python * #C* VB.NET* Ruby * Perl Python would be one of the best languages to learn for scripting, automating things and learning to use exploits by coding them. The rest are just good to know and will help you be better at this, instead of being a script kiddy who uses tools found online for everything. I guess you\u2019d also have to learn a language like SQL, as SQL injection is one of the main forms of attacking a website. Look into reading about the exploits available online, here are a few to start you off. (Go read the OWASP TOP 10) * SQL Injection * XSS (Cross site scripting)* LFI (Local file inclusion)Figuring out how to use an API to exploit a website is one of the more intermediate steps. Depending on the website, sometimes they\u2019ll have a lot of exploits available within their API. Find these and report them if you want. Don\u2019t be a blackhat and abuse them as that won\u2019t get you far. For example, there was one in Uber a short while ago that allowed you to change the password of any other user using their API. rt/passwordless-signup or something like that. Start simple.

            "answer_text": "If I understand your question, you want to know about to find security related issues in any system(may be software, networks, servers or anything else) and then exploit the system. First realise that there is no any software that can fully automate the whole process. There are bunch of Linux distros(Like Backtrack, Kali Linux, BlackBuntu, Blackbox, etc) that can help you to make things easier, but if you want to really learn the things I would recommend you to install a basic OS like Ubuntu and install all the software by your own. Here are some rules to follow if you really want to learn hacking:1. Never GiveUp(Because no software ever made which don't have any bugs, if software is good then there may be some platform vulnerability)2. There is no any software that can fully automate the process of hacking anything, So first you will have to learn and the execute.3. Follow OpenSource as much as possible, because buying all software cause you lot of money and cracks will first spy on you.4. Never try to run any program blindly in your main machine, First try to find if the software is from trusted source then it OK but if is not then install it in Virtual machine.5. Learn to test not to exploit, if you found anything report it to developers.6. Avoid fishing and keylogging because they are not hacking they are a chip form of cheating. Hacking is the process you can start anywhere, first you have to know about what defect any system poses and then you can exploit as you want. If you want to follow some formal stepsStep 1: Install Ubuntu and some most basic tools you can start with. I would recommend the following: (i) Armitage with Metasploit{Penetration Testing Software, Pen Testing Security | Metasploit}: Metasploit contains thousands of exploits for almost all types of systems. You can use those exploits to execute on the system you want. You can find bunch of resources on youtube, Official website and (Page on securitytube.net) Security tube. Apart from this you can search on google blogs for more diverse list.(ii) Nmap{Free Security Scanner For Network Exploration & Security Audits.}: Best tool for scanning Networks or servers.You can search on youtube and google blogs for resources. (iii) Wireshark{Wireshark \u00b7 Go Deep.}: Best tool for analysing data packets in the same networks. Security-Tube(Page on securitytube.net) Has a whole mega-primer on WLAN security and network related issues, I think this video lacture is enough for anyone to learn about wireshark, WLAN Security, etc.(iv) SET(Social Engineering toolkit){trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit}: Best social engineering toolkit which uses Vulnerabilities in windows softwares to perform Man-in-the-middle attack on the system. (v) Air-crack{Aircrack-ng}: For wi-fi and related things.(vi) TCPDump{TCPDUMP/LIBPCAP public repository}: Very good command line data packet analyser. (vii) Nikto{Nikto2 | CIRT.net}: Web server scanner. (viii) THC Hydra: Good for brute force type attacks. Apart from this you can find very good list at VulnerabilityAssessment.co.uk. You can also install Kali linux, Backtrack, BlackBuntu or Blackbox all of them contains the tools given above.Step 2: Dig deep and gather as much as information you can. This will help you to understand better about the system and the defects present in the system.Step 3: Always try to have latest tools and latest global vulnerabilities exposed in the systems.Step 4: Try every possible attack on system you want to hack. Some of the most recommended websites:1. VulnerabilityAssessment.co.uk2. The Hacker News \u2014 Hacking, Cyber and Internet Security3. Exploits Database by Offensive Security4. CERN Computer Security information5. Page on owasp.org6. Welcome to SecurityTube.net P.S.: Please do all the things for learning and testing purpose and in virtual machine as much as possible because some scripts may cause very harm for your computer.108.1k Views \u00b7 View UpvotersUpvote \u00b7 357 Comment...RecommendedAllPromoted by Blinkist A smarter you is only 15 minutes away.

What should I do first?First, you need to decide what kind of a hacker you want to be. Depending on your area of interest there are several choices you could make.. You may be one who specialises inWeb Application HackingDesktop Application HackingHardware HackingMobile Application HackingAnd these are just some common options, and it's really a much larger set of options than these few...The term hacking is a much larger word that describes a person who does something so brilliantly that he gets that thing done much faster than what others would take. In the context of this question, however, you probably meant a computer hacker who does it with certain ethics.Assuming that you want to be a web hacker(those are the ones that are popular today--Julian Assange, Mark Zuckerberg, Kevin Mitnick, etc.) this is my idea of probably the best pathway..Learn the basic languages that make the web--this ranges from the plain 'ol HTML that gives structure to pages, to CSS that causes styles and JS that gives logic to the pages. Once your armed with the knowledge of these, you move to server side scripting languages like PHP, Node.JS, etc. and start build web applications of your own. It would be a good idea to extend over these as well.. For exampleHTML --> HTML5, etc.CSS --> LESS, SASS, etc.JS --> JQuery, AngularJS, etc.You would begin to understand how most web apps today (like Facebook, Twitter or even Quora) work and how you can exploit the vulnerabilities that are not taken care of properly. You will be forced to learn a bit of Unix as the most web servers that run web apps will run this OS. You then learn to use tools that automate manual testing and make it easier to identify problems -- tools like SQLNinja, Havij, Nessus etc. to automate SQL injection, XSS and other tests. for pen testing frameworks like metasploit, w3af, etc. which would give you a greater control to perform tests, deploy malware payloads and even write your own exploits. This way you eventually learn about cross-side scripting, javascript exploits, how cookies works, how browsers work, how to write good web apps, how to identify bad web apps and so on..You would eventually learn loads of new attack vectors everyday and get into the loop. You will start finding holes in web apps that already exist and report it to them to get money from their bounty programs that they offer or if you turn black hat you would probably sell those exploits as zero days in the dark web for bigger cash to other malware writers (but this is out of context as it isn't ethical hacking).I'd like to share even the desktop application pathway i.e. to become desktop app hacker, just incase you had expected that. Mobile app pathway is an extension over this so you can go there after following this pathway. It basically the same, except for a more specific set of languages and using more specific set of tools.You'd have to start out by learning how computers work. Learn the basic language like C and maybe even low level languages. I have recommended a good book (See reference #1 at end of the post) for taking up this pathway. That will not only teach you the working of computers but also how to write low level codes like assembly codes or shell codes, etc. You can take up malware writing as a pathway and transgress the ethics to become a full time malware writer but then if you want to stick with desktop hacking then you'd have to learn how debuggers work and how you can re-assemble, reverse engineered binaries and see where it cracks. Here too, you can go astray and become a full time reverse engineer who cracks softwares/games and programs to put them in p2p networks or sell it in the dark web (this is a good business these days and chances of getting hired or jailed by corporates are also high). Or, you could stick to the original pathway and build robust desktop apps and learn how to hack these apps. Make obfuscated code to protect these apps and learn to develop obfuscation tools and other useful tools that may help you hack away.! You can design key loggers, RAT (remote administration tools), TSRs and even crypters. These are of high value in the market as well as useful for your own needs. Companies look out for security experts to make audits and assessments of their own products and services and it's good money for less work. You'll basically be using pre-existing tools to make these assessments and pinning developers for the flaws in the code.Either pathway you choose, at that one point you are likely to understand that you've learnt a lot, more than just hacking. You would realise that the whole process was for you to become a better person. That's what I've learnt so far--that as a hacker you are inclined to push yourself to see it things can be done differently. It may sound silly that I tell you now but this is the crux of hacking--that we make our own life better as well as others lives by introducing tricks to do things more efficiently. So there you go.. that's my two cents for those wish to travel this less travelled path. And remember, this isn't easy because the only hackers that we know are the greatest hackers alive--Julian Assange, Steve Wozniak, etc. It's a field with high demand and competition and everybody wants to do it. Only few end up in the books, some end up in jail and some in both. Hope you make the right choices!Tips1. Follow videos on youtube like Defcon, Notacon, Blackhat, etc. (read reference #4 for more on this)2. Read news about new exploits or security holes or even patches made to existing apps so that you can attack those who do not update to those patches (if your a BlackHat). This is quite popular among hackers--Microsoft came up with a term Patch Tuesday to release security updates. Among hackers, we call the very next day as Exploit Wednesday as hackers can just RE those patches and see how to attack those users that have not applied these patches.3. Google! There are other search engines as well (true). Learn to use google well -- google about google dorking and learn how you can effectively use it to get the best results of what your looking for.4. Use your intelligence and common sense. This applies to everything you do. Lets take the scenario of tip #3. Common sense dictates that to find the latest hacks and patches you'd have to use the search tools in google to find the recently updated news (past week, past hour, etc.). If you're a decent hacker at that time, you'd probably make an app to automatically drag these as updates and post it to you as SMS texts, RSS entries or some sort of desktop / mobile alerts!5. Complete one pathway till you're satisfied. Do not decide you want to be a master of all hacking pathways and end up going absolutely nowhere. You want to be the jack of all trades and master of some.6. Tip #5 applies to languages as well (and in extension, to almost any task you do in life). If you start with say; PHP; then stick with it until your recognised as a good PHP developer or until your satisfied by making several apps before your shift to another language.7. Don't ever give up. Focus is everything. This may sound very absurd as a tip but truth is that many hackers give up because \"the grapes are sour\". I've noticed so many who say stuff like \"Facebook is unhackable\", etc. but believe me--it is. They have a nice whitehat program and you can read about past hacks (search for the hall of fame entries and their works) to get an idea, and you too will be able to come up with exploits once you get in the loop. But by then, hopefully you'd learn not to use the knowledge for all the wrong reasons! So always stay focussed!!References1. The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson (This defines programming and teaches hacking in a good view point).2. Network Security by Jan Harrington (To learn the basics of networking).3. Head First Series (Select the language you want to learn and use these books to learn the basics, you can use the online reference or documentation to learn the language further).4. Youtube videos--use VDO Downloader or youtube-dl to download entire playlists related to any topic your looking for and watch it! Youtube does have advanced search to selectively search channels/playlists.By the time you finish these books you'd have learned quite a lot and realize that hacking is actually changing the question \"How do I get started Ethical Hacking from scratch? What should I do first?\" to \"Hey check out this cool attack vector that I just discovered\". Now that's truly the essence of hacking.!Happy Hacking! ",

            "answer_text": "A good question to ask, since most people think you can just jump straight into hacking with no knowledge whatsoever. Like \u2018life\u2019, hacking is not that simple either - anybody that says differently does not know what is involved. Hardware or Software?Initially, you need to know the difference between hardware and software, some would say that\u2019s simple, but break it down further to component level or interface type and you soon see many people with blank faces. Equipment IDA good understanding of hardware is essential, not just with computers but many I/O devices, routers, switches, operating speeds of various interfaces (are they backward compatible? etc). Electronics is a bonus!The ability of the understanding of electronics to component level and know how to read their values is also a step in the right direction. I had a good knowledge of electronics and electricity when I was only 12 years old, back when I was developing prototype projects for people (custom projects). Programming in the 80\u2019sIn the early 80\u2019s I started working with computers, nothing like today\u2019s standards, but we even hacked back then, mostly pranks or phreaking techniques. Public phones were everywhere back then, and using a special black box we used to build we could make free calls to anywhere in the world - now that sounds easy, I can assure you unless you knew telephony exchanges functioned you would have no idea how we did such things. Hunting the hackesrsWe were called \u2018Geeks\u2019 back then, and still called it even now, if we show new people how to track hackers or catch them and find their \u2018real\u2019 locations - it\u2019s called \u201cHunting the Hunted\u201d these days. Stay away from MSM - edited and never trueOne thing you should not believe in is movies and TV, it\u2019s all just MSM (MainStream Media) all edited so you never see the \u2018real\u2019 news. An example of Professional Social Engineering:OBJECTIVE: Obtain Banking details and Bank or credit cards.To get the targets we use Facebook because so many people do not know how advanced what hackers can do.We need to go on webcam, we also need to change our gender and voice. Yes, I will become a woman just for this example.There is software available to change our webcam display, hence we can completely change our background or even blank it out completely. Our voice we can also change - it\u2019s all done using AI software which is so far advanced these days you cannot tell the difference. People used to say you can hide behind a keyboard, well these days you can hide behind a webcam and no one will know the difference.Imagine you have been chatting to a woman for 6 months, only to find out in reality, it was a guy and was for malicious purposes. It is better to never trust anyone on the internet whatsoever. Social Engineering these days is so far advanced, that anyone can be caught in trap, and the person that has done it all is thousands of miles away. To become a hacker on a professional level takes years, I have decades of experience behind me, as well as reverse-engineering in digital electronics. With both combined, I could basically design anything I want. Yet, I still learn new things every week - it\u2019s the only way to keep ahead of the times. Reconnaissance is the top part of hacking anythingHowever, initially, you must learn reconnaissance using every tool you have to hand. Building to high standards in this area will get you far, the more you learn the better. There is a good reason for this, reconnaissance can lead to finding exploits without any hacking involved. Obviously, you would need to create a report on what you did to find such material. One thing I have learned over the years is you can report unsafe webservers, yet companies will ignore you unless you actually change some data! Why are there so many breaches worldwide?I get asked many times in a week why so many websites get hacked, with huge breaches. The simple answer is they have useless security or not patched.To get a report on how many web servers were exploitable from just one piece of malware, I ran a check on the CVE reference, after 1hr 30 mins+ I got the answer I did not expect - A virus released over 5 years ago was still present on over 100,000 servers, and that's just one virus! Facebook, is becoming worse in security termsTake Facebook as an example, 4 breaches in one year - I would close down any account with that lax security. We look at websites in different ways, as an ethnic hacker I look at websites from an indirect approach, meaning instead of me loading up Facebook, I use various websites that will give me the same information. The last time I checked Facebook I noticed a possible exploit, but that is because I know UNIX and many other programming languages. Let\u2019s look at just one very simple exploit that many web servers even now are not configured correctly, thus allowing hacking it very easily.First we need a website that is capable of allowing us to use indirect calls to any server.Secondly, check the Serial Number (this is usually a 10-digit number set). To make this easier you need to use the CMD to display the SOA of the server. *Service-Oriented ArchitectureNow you are probably thinking what am I going to do with a serial number of a server?To a hacker a 10 digit number means more than just a serial number. The number is in a UNIX format, and in some servers the serial is not just a serial number whatsoever.In UNIX we also use a 10 digit number for the time, hence 1547003509 would be the exact time now. Some server admins leave a misconfigured server with the serial left as a UNIX clock.This next part is a quote showing you why it is dangerous. Quote:Known as the \u201cBash Bug\u201d or \u201cShellShock,\u201d the GNU Bash Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) could allow an attacker to gain control over a targeted computer if exploited successfully. The vulnerability affects Bash, a common component known as a shell that appears in many versions of Linux and Unix. That is just one hack, I will not say how it is done but it can still be done today if the SOA is using the UNIX clock. Now, Opi Meru this is just touching the tip of the \u2018iceberg\u2019 - and is just one hack that I just rolled off the top of my head. But there are millions of new malicious malware appearing everyday. I hope this helps you, it is showing show you two types of the hacking area, Social Engineering and the old SOA UNIX time clock.

            "answer_text": "Here are a few tips to avoid detection if you have too much time on your hands re: computers: Get an untraceable hard drive\u2026 buy one with cash from a store with no security cameras\u2026or have someone else buy it for you wearing a disguise and hope they stay loyal, dont drive to the store with your own license plate.The same with a laptop.. get a used one with cash and have it be that serial # is traceable to someone who does not know you personally or hasn't met you that way the FBI can break down someone elses door randomly and put an innocent person in cuffs.The same with a cell phone for mobile verification, get one without your name attached to it that can receive voice or text verificationAvoid conducting personal business thats identifiable on this laptop, just it for hacking or whatever illicit activities you are trying to do.Connect via public wifi without security cameras or in a place thats crowded and make sure to wear a disguise and act normally drink coffee and pay with cash, be friendly towards the staff and other customers.Wack the MAC address with a scrambler using some common utilities that you downloaded over public wifiUse a VPN free VPNUse the TOR browser and hope that it allows you to connect to whatever sites you are trying to access the free network you are on doesn't block you.Next time you sign on go to some other free wifi place and do not spend a lot of time in the exact place you were at before so they cant come by the store and ask what the customers are doing on their computers.When you are done with illicit activities on this laptop disconnect the hard drive and bust it up with a sledge hammer or blowtorch then throw the pieces into New York harbor so it cant be analyzed.Get some other laptop that you can have to use for your personal business and claim that was the laptop you were using before\u2026 just in case a special friend stops by your house to question what you were doing with said laptop and you can tell him nothing special just checking facebook\u2026 you did not really do anything bad on your said laptop at least now not that they can prove cause the laptop is a boat anchor.",

            "answer_text": "Hacking is just one of activities you can do with computers and devices. You don\u2019t break these machines (to break means crashing the machine, render it unusable or useless) but rather, make them do things that are not expected by humans. It is simply beating the opposing force (human or machine) using the rules that machines understand. The rules are basically streams of ones and zeroes from the viewpoint of these machines. To understand the machine, you have to know at least the following topics: Number systems - conversions and implementations (binary, hexadecimal, and octal). You don\u2019t have to be good at this one, just a basic know-how since we can always use calculators to do the work for us.Computer Architecture and Organization. Understand various computer models and their implementations. Understand CPU internals, how memory and its hierarchy, buses, and I/O subsystems work together. Understand what a program is and how it is processed by the machine. Understand why programs that work in one system don\u2019t work in another (e.g., why Windows executables don\u2019t run in a Linux environment without special help). Understand that everything we know about the machine are mere abstractions because machines only understand ones and zeroes (digital signals).Operating Systems (OS). Understand the purpose of this software and its internals. Understand how processes and threads work. How it loads programs and make them run. Understand how it protects itself and the resources it must protect. Understand the various OS limitations, weaknesses, design, and their complexity. Understand how it implements networking. Learn how it can hide itself, its services, and applications from other devices.Programming. Understand at least two programming languages, their features, the build process, the tools or technologies you need to use at each stage or phase, the various methodologies available (there\u2019s more than one way to build software) and the IT roles associated with them. Understand how a program is made and how it transforms into something that is valid and acceptable to the OS. Understand various programming models and their implementations. Understand how to debug and reverse engineer your own code.Networking. Understand various network communication models and their implementations. Understand TCP/IP suite(the whole stack) and its alternatives. Understand different network devices that work at different layers. Understand IP addressing and how devices use them. Understand Ethernet and its wireless version. Understand how TCP/IP is implemented by different OS. Understand your LAN adapter. Understand how network devices work and how they can be protected. Know their limitations and weaknesses. Understand HTTP and HTTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, and File Transfer protocols because they\u2019re staple in most organization.Databases. Understand various database models and their implementations. Understand RDBMS and SQL Standards. Understand NoSQL. Understand how databases are designed and implemented, how they are used and how they can be protected and abused.Hardware. If you understand a lot of technical information on how computer hardware works, you are ahead of the pack.I think that\u2019s the basics. Start from number one and then finish number six. If you have these basic skills then you can basically do what you want. You will realize later that you cannot learn everything. You\u2019ll have to specialize. You must also understand that anything you do outside your home laboratory has legal, political, economic, and social consequences. Do not let curiosity rob you of your freedom. Your knowledge is useless in prison. Don\u2019t be stupid. Learn everything in an isolated environment (home laboratory set up). Remember, do not think you are special or look down on others. You are not unique. There are millions of people in this world who can do what you do. Keep the know-how to yourself because nobody cares what you know. Use your abilities to help people, your company and/or your government. ",

This may seem like a joke answer, but in all seriousness, if you can't do proper research on the fundamentals of a subject (such as on a question like this, which is asked multiple times a day on quora), you're probably not ready to tackle the bigger aspects of the subject. It's like trying to learn how to race a formula 1 car before learning how to drive. I would suggest purchasing books such as \u201call-in-one networking for dummies\u201d, \u201cbeginning programming for dummies\u201d, \u201cresearch methods in psychology for dummies\u201d, and anything else that relates to these subjects. The last one may seem like a joke, but it incorporates both aspects of social engineering into a single book. If you're too lazy to read everything or don't have the time, look for classes on the subject - but be very careful of online classes, as many, especially on YouTube, are made by non professionals/beginners that simply copy shit from someone else's books\u2026 and usually not in the best quality either - or bullshit their way through everything. Look for live, in - class courses for best quality. This can get expensive, especially for the \u201chacking\u201d courses. A good option for the basics would be \u201ccontinuing education\u201d courses offered by various community colleges. Low cost and good for the aforementioned basics. ",

            "answer_text": "so .. you want to be hacker??\u2026 A perfect hacker ! , but keep in mind nothing is perfect in the world\u2026\u2026.. If you are reading this , you too probably aspire to become a hacker. That's good. let's take a moment to look at what makes a good hacker. The Route to Become a Hacker The route to becoming a hacker is not an easy one. Some newbies to this field think that all need is some magic \"hacking tool\" and you can simply hack into any computer. That's far from the truth. Unlike other IT professions, a great hacker needs to understand most of the information technology disciplines including networking, databases, operating systems, web serving, scripting, cryptography, etc. In addition, the hacker needs to have functional knowledge of multiple operating systems including Linux, Mac OS and Windows. This may take years of experience and/or study. Then, after learning how these various information technology systems WORK, you then need to focus on how to BREAK them. This may require additional training and experience. Think Outside the Box Hacking is NOT like other areas of IT. In most IT disciplines, you learn that if you do this... and then that... and then that, the system does what you want. That is NOT usually the case with hacking! Good hackers have to think outside the box or tablet.You have to think about how you can make a system work in ways it was NOT designed to work. We need to understand intimately how systems work, so that we can make them operate in ways that their developers never intended! Persistence It also important to note that not every hack works every time. Depending upon the circumstances, a hack might work now and then not work a short time later. We need to then figure what changed and then re-attempt the hack in a different way. In addition, a hack might work once and then never work again. For instance, if you are trying to remote code execution, this usually requires a buffer overflow. When the buffer is overflowed, it sometimes can become damaged and will not work properly again. In that case, you only get one shot to hack the system. Creative Hackers must be also be creative. SKILLS THAT YOU WILL NEED Programming: This is the most important. Learn how to solve problems and automate tasks.- Operating Systems: Learn not (only) how to use them, but how they work, how and where it stores (important) information, how to access it's APIs.- Networking: Know how networks works, not only the concepts, but the inner workings too, how each type of packet is formed and the tricks you can do manipulating its bits. And learn how to use this knowledge with some programming language.- Website Hacking: There are lots of techniques to do this, just google OWASP. This 4 are the main in my opinion, you can be an average to good hacker with this. To be a ninja you'll need more: - Cryptography: Deep knowledge, how to use, how to implement common cyphers and how to break them. (By common cyphers I mean cyphers used today, like RSA, not caesar's cypthers and others like this) . - Reverse Engineering (and debugging): How to debug or disassemble and analyse software to see what and how a software process its information and how to extract this information from memory at run time.- (Anti-) Forensics: Where incriminating information is stored and how to safely erase them.- Exploit writing: You need to know debugging and computer memory to do this. I think this is all. Sorry for english errors. i hope u got the all point \u2026all the best ",

            "answer_text": "At it's core hacking is the ability to trick a system into doing something it wasn't intended to do. For Computers this almost always means getting the target computer to execute code or commands that it shouldn't. I'll assume that you already know some programming language.If not, start there. More than understanding the language, you need to understand how a computer understands a language.Is it compiled or interpreted? What are threads? What are interfaces? How does a program at run-time interact with other programs? (the OS, the web-server, browser with plugins...) How do programs on different systems interact? (web-server with browser, web-server with interpreter, interpreter web server with database...) Everything that runs on a computer relies on something else running first. The bios loads the OS, the OS loads and links the application or loads the interpreter. The interpreter loads the script...Everything that runs on the computer takes input and produces output (from/to users or other systems). Clients with servers, nodes with other nodes on a network, processes with other processes... Understanding how and why these things work will reveal avenues for tricking a computer into executing something it shouldn't. That is, getting the processor to execute a set of instructions that you provide. Once these concepts are firmly understood, you can start learning some of the exploits. I won't get into them here, but you can find readily discover some of the more common ones, and go to conferences to stay updated on the newly discovered ones.To learn them and truly understand them you have to practice them. Write a program that's vulnerable. Try your attack. Did it work? why? Now secure your program? Did your fix work? don't stop there. Can you get around the fix you just coded? Can you harden it further? Is your fix reusable in other applications? No? then how would you generalize your solution? Infosec is a mindset. In many ways it's like doing QA. You need to think about every possible way to misuse a system. Not just maliciously, but every possible input, platform, setting that the designer didn't think about taking into account when they designed the system. Then stop thinking about it and break someone's code. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Stan Hanks that hackers are born, not made. And they are popularly viewed as a kind of Prestige Class of geek, mysterious and exciting, and as such are the object of many a fantasy. But you can be perfectly good at security without being a \"hacker\".  (Note: It's typically not as exciting as portrayed in media, though it can have exciting moments. See my answer to \"What is it like to be a hacker / member of a cybercrime organization?\" for more info.)   It's good to feel wanted But the hallmark of a hacker is the intense passion about their area of interest that drives them to learn and excel. They don't ask people \"teach me to [x]\" because learning about [x] is so fascinating for them that they wouldn't want someone else to infringe on the fun. They might accept tips now and then, but not roadmaps.  If you want to hack, but you're not interested enough to make your own way, to learn and discover and spend the countless hours reading and exploring and experimenting without someone else to hold your hand, you're not a hacker. I'm sorry to be blunt about it, but it's better to just tell you that now.  You can still work in security. You can still be a penetration tester. Hell, other people may still consider you a hacker. Don't consider it a step down in life. Everyone learns differently. Not everyone gets to grow up to be an astronaut, and not everyone gets to be a hacker.  This discussion is as old as the 'net. Here's a rant that was published during my early learning days. Some of the references (Red box) are kind of dated, but the message holds true today:   Take a little quiz for me today. Tell me if you fit this description. You got your net account several months ago. You have been surfing the net, and you laugh at those media reports of the information superhighway. You have a red box, you don't have to pay for phone calls. You have crackerjack, and you have run it on the password file at a unix you got an account on. Everyone at your school is impressed by your computer knowledge, you are the one the teachers ask for help.  Does this sound like you? You are not a hacker. There are thousands of you out there. You buy 2600 and you ask questions. You read phrack and you ask questions. You join #hack and you ask questions. You ask all of these questions, and you ask what is wrong with that? After all, to be a hacker is to question things, is it not?  But, you do not want knowledge. You want answers. You do not want to learn how things work. You want answers. You do not want to explore. All you want to know is the answer to your damn questions.  You are not a hacker. Hacking is not about answers. Hacking is about the path you take to find the answers. If you want help, don't ask for answers, ask for a pointer to the path you need to take to find out those answers for yourself.  Because it is not the people with the answers that are the hackers, it is the people that are travelling along the path. via Are You A Hacker? by ReDragon - original via Internet Relay Chat  Related: Adri\u00e1n Lamo's answer to How did Adrian Lamo learn hacking?Adri\u00e1n Lamo's answer to Can you be a hacker if you can't code?Kevin Poulsen's answer to How does one become a hacker?Stan Hanks' answer to How does one become a hacker?",

            "answer_text": "Being a hacker is a cool one to do. nowadays people self proclaim themselves as hackers after bombing OTP's in other\u2019s phones. But a true hacker is one who can penetrate other\u2019s systems and breach their firewalls to get something out of it. If you want to learn ethical hacking or pen testing you can use the link given below here you get all free courses to learn ethical hacking please do try to enroll for the Eduonix ethical hacking course where they teach you and give you a certificate also. free courses to learn ethical hacking Let me tell you how I became a hacker don\u2019t worry I am just a beginner and that too I just wanna be a grey hat hacker. Okay before that let me explain the different types of hackers: 1. White hat hacker: these are the persons who don\u2019t harm anyone they just practice hacking only if someone hires them. 2. Grey hat hacker: These are the persons who are in between both the black and the white they are also more or less as the white hat hacker but they may harm you if they get what they want. 3. Black hat hacker: These people are the ones who do hacking to earn money and sometimes to get some entertainment out of it. In a way, these people are a little vulnerable. 4. Script kiddie: These people are the most dangerous hackers who are ready to do anything can breach any type of firewalls and can do whatever they wish to like. This is how hackers are classified as so choose which you want to become. The requirements of being a hacker are \u00b7 Any old computer or even if you are rich you can use a new computer where you can install a termux terminal in blue stacks which is the best after Kali Linux. \u00b7 If you don\u2019t have a new computer or an old one but only have one pc then you can set up a virtual workstation using Vmware or something like that. \u00b7 You can install termux on android phones the termux is not available in windows as software so we have to use an android emulator like bluestacks. \u00b7 Once all this is setup then use the termux installation guide with all the inbuilt commands which I am pinning at the end of this answer where you can use them to start working with termux. \u00b7 For Kali Linux download the kali Linux using a tor browser for safety purpose or you can just use a VPN. \u00b7 For using tor browser you can just download it directly in tor webpage or just install the brave browser where if you click alt+shift+n you can access tor browser with duckduckgo privacy. \u00b7 In Kali Linux, you can just use the maltego software for various information gathering purposes. \u00b7 This is how I started to learn to hack. the code for installation guide in Termux: #!/bin/bash echo $Green echo \"\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"\" echo \" This Script is written by Stephin now start\" echo \"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\" echo \"007\" echo \"007\" echo \"007\" echo \".\" \"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\" echo echo \" we are Hacker's \" echo \" we are Anonymous Tim3 \" echo \"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\" echo \"007\" echo \"007\" echo \"007\" echo \".\" apt-get update -y #update in progress apt install python -y #installation...... apt install python2 -y apt install ruby -y apt install git -y apt install screenfetch -y apt install cowsay -y apt install toilet -y apt install figlet -y echo \"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\" echo \" u can now hack anything \" echo \" completing wait 3 2 1 \" echo \"####################################\" apt install php -y apt install perl -y apt install nmap -y pkg install openssh -y echo \"#####################################\" echo \"anynomous \" echo \" join us on facebook Anonymous Tim3 \" echo \"####################################\" apt install bash -y apt install clang -y apt install jq -y apt install macchanger -y echo \" \" echo \"####################################\" apt install nano -y apt install curl -y apt install tar -y apt install zip -y apt install fish -y echo \" \" apt install unzip -y apt install tor -y apt install sudo -y apt install wget -y apt install tor -y apt install w3m -y apt install cmatrix -y echo \"#####################################\" echo \" we are hackers \" echo \"####################################\" apt install wcalc -y apt install openssl apt install bmon -y echo \"#####################################\" echo \" processing wait...... \" echo \"####################################\" echo \" If You Connected To Internet Then u downloaded success fully subscribe us Anonymous Tim3...we are Hacker's dont underestimate us \" echo \"Now your terminal is ready to use\" exit copy this code and save this as .SH file in desktop and use it. I hope you have learned something out of my answer!! All the best for your hacking ventures friends. If you find this answer useful please follow me and upvote this answer guys. ",

            "answer_text": "My general advice is based on my own journey out of college many years ago, but with how I\u2019d go about it today: Start reading articles and papers on ethical hacking. If you\u2019re ok at self-studying, free online courses might be your thing. Focus on one area that you feel most comfortable to learn: networks, operating systems, native apps, web apps, mobile devices/IoT\u2026 there\u2019s a vast space out there, and you\u2019ll get overwhelmed if you aren\u2019t focused at first.Sidenote; Definitely spend time learning to code if you aren\u2019t already studying this.Look for \u201chackme\u201d and \u201ccrackme\u201d communities. I\u2019m not sure which are the best, but some searching around you can find sites like Hack This Site or Hack.me \u00b7 The house of rising sandbox. These communities give you a safe/sanctioned way to practice. The key is you are either being given consent to practice on someone else\u2019s infrastructure, or you host it privately (i.e. run services on a Raspberry Pi at home). These communities tend to have people like you (and more experienced folks) who can help point you in the right direction.Whatever you do, don\u2019t practice on real world systems / computers. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but accessing the systems of another company or entity without authorization will get you in a lot of trouble.Think of attending actual hacker conferences and get a feel for the overall scene. I \u201cthink\u201d Defcon is still relevant these days, and is attended by professionals, academics and hobbyists alike.Once you build up your skills, start looking for companies that hire security professionals, or even the government. If you come to the table with the basics, you\u2019re bound to find an internship / entry level position quickly.Lastly, remember that it\u2019s easy to destroy and harder to protect/create. At some point, you don\u2019t just want to be a \u2018breaker\u2019\u2026 also spend time thinking and learning how to stop someone like you, and you\u2019re on your way to making our tech world a better place.

There is a community and shared culture of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture were the first \"hackers.\" Breaking into computers and breaking phone systems have come to symbolize hacking in popular culture, but hacking culture is much more complex and moralistic than most people know. To become a hacker, learn basic hacking techniques, how to think like a hacker, and how to gain respect within the ethical hacking community. FundamentalsA) Run a UNIX-like OS, such as Linux. UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems are the operating systems of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing UNIX, you can't be an Internet hacker without understanding UNIX. For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly UNIX-centered. There are many types of UNIX-like operating systems, the most popular being Linux, which you can run alongside Microsoft Windows on the same machine. Download Linux online or find a local Linux user group to help you with installation.A good way to dip your toes in the water is to boot up what Linux fans call a live CD or USB, a distribution that runs entirely off a CD or USB without modifying your hard disk. This is a way to get a look at the possibilities without having to do anything drastic.There are other UNIX-like operating systems besides Linux, such as the *BSD systems. The most popular *BSD systems are FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD. All are open source just like Linux, however it's important to remember that they are BSD and not Linux. macOS is based on Darwin, a UNIX operating system that's based on FreeBSD. Darwin is fully free and open source and is available fromhttp://opensource.apple.com. Because the core of the system is UNIX, and macOS is very popular, many people have ported over Linux applications to macOS. You can get those programs with a package manager like homebrew, fink or macports. Alternatively, you can just run Linux on a Mac alongside macOS.If you want to get super niche, you can even run an operating system like OpenIndiana, which is based on the open source release of the Solaris operating system before it was acquired by Oracle and made closed source. OpenIndiana and Solaris are based on UNIX System V, and, as such, are not compatible with Linux applications. That said, there are many ports of Linux applications. You're probably better off just using macOS, BSD or Linux because they are much more popular and have many more programs available for them. B) Learn HTML If you don't know how to program, learning basic Hyper Text Mark-Up Language (HTML) and gradually building proficiency is essential. What you see when you look at a website of pictures, images, and design components is all coded using HTML. For a project, set out to learn how to make a basic home page and work your way up from There.in your browser, open the page source information to examine the HTML to see an example. Go to Web Developer > Page Source in Firefox and spend time looking at the code.You can write HTML in a basic word processing program like Notepad or Simple text and save your files as \"text only,\" so you can upload them to a browser and see your work translated.You'll need to learn to format tags and learn to think visually using them. \"<\" is used to open a tag and \"/> is used to close it. \"\" is the opening for a line of paragraph code. You'll use tags to signal anything visual: italics, formatting, color, etc. Learning HTML will help you to understand better how the Internet works. C) Learn the language of programming Before you start writing poems you have to learn basic grammar. Before you break the rules you have to learn the rules. But if your ultimate goal is to become a hacker, you're going to need more than basic English to write your masterpiece. Python is a good \"language\" to start off with because it's cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners. Despite being a good first language, it is not just a toy; it is very powerful, flexible, and well-suited for large projects.Java is an alternative, but its value as a first programming language has been questioned. If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core language of Unix. C++ is very closely related to C; if you know one, learning the other will not be difficult. C is very efficient with your machine's resources, but will soak up huge amounts of your time on debugging and is often avoided for that reason, unless the efficiency of your computer is especially important. It is probably a good idea to use a good starting platform such as Backtrack 5 R3, Kali or Ubuntu 12.04LTS. Hacking attitudesA) Think creatively. Now that you've got the basic skills in place, you can start thinking artistically. Hackers are like artists, philosophers, and engineers all rolled up into one. They believe in freedom and mutual responsibility. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Hackers take a special delight in solving problems, sharpening their skills, and exercising their intelligence.Hackers have a diversity of interests culturally and intellectually, outside of hacking. Work as intensely as you play, and play as intensely as you work. For true hackers, the boundaries between \"play,\" \"work,\" \"science,\" and \"art\" all tend to disappear, or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness.Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions, which is a great way to meet hackers and proto-hackers. Consider training in a martial art. The kind of mental discipline required for martial arts seems to be similar in important ways to what hackers do. The most hacker-ly martial arts are those which emphasize mental discipline, relaxed awareness, and control, rather than raw strength, athleticism, or physical toughness. Tai Chi is a good martial art for hackers. B) Learn to love solving problems. No problem should ever have to be solved twice. Think of it as a community in which the time of everyone is hackers is precious. Hackers believe sharing information is a moral responsibility. When you solve problems, make the information public to help everyone solve the same issue. You don't have to believe that you're obligated to give all your creative product away, though the hackers that do are the ones that get most respect from other hackers. It's consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you in food and rent and computers. Read older pieces, such as the \"Jargon File\" or \"Hacker Manifesto\" by The Mentor. They may be out of date in terms of technical issues, but the attitude and spirit are just as timely. C) Learn to recognize and fight authority. The enemy of the hacker is boredom, drudgery, and authoritarian figures who use censorship and secrecy to strangle the freedom of information. Monotonous work keeps the hacker from hacking.Embracing hacking as a way of life is to reject so-called \"normal\" concepts of work and property, choosing instead to fight for equality and common knowledge. D) Be competent. So, anyone who spends time on Reddit can write up a ridiculous cyberpunk user name and pose as a hacker. But the Internet is a great equalizer, and values competence over ego and posture. Spend time working on your craft and not your image and you'll more quickly gain respect than modeling yourself on the superficial things we think of \"hacking\" in popular culture. Hacking WellA) Write open-source software. Write programs that other hackers think are fun or useful, and give the program sources away to the whole hacker culture to use. Hackerdom's most revered demigods are people who have written large, capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away, so that now everyone uses them. B) Help test and debug open-source software. Any open-source author who's thinking will tell you that good beta-testers (who know how to describe symptoms clearly, localize problems well, can tolerate bugs in a quickie release, and are willing to apply a few simple diagnostic routines) are worth their weight in rubies. Try to find a program under development that you're interested in and be a good beta-tester. There's a natural progression from helping test programs to helping debug them to helping modify them. You'll learn a lot this way, and generate goodwill with people who will help you later on. C) Publish useful information. Another good thing is to collect and filter useful and interesting information into web pages or documents like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists, and make those generally available. Maintainers of major technical FAQs get almost as much respect as open-source authors. D) Help keep the infrastructure working. The hacker culture (and the engineering development of the Internet, for that matter) is run by volunteers. There's a lot of necessary but unglamorous work that needs done to keep it going \u2014 administering mailing lists, moderating newsgroups, maintaining large software archive sites, developing RFCs and other technical standards. People who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect, because everybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun as playing with code. Doing them shows dedication. E) Serve the hacker culture itself. This is not something you'll be positioned to do until you've been around for a while and become well-known for one of the four previous items. The hacker culture doesn't have leaders, exactly, but it does have culture heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople. When you've been in the trenches long enough, you may grow into one of these. Hackers distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders, so visibly reaching for this kind of fame is dangerous. Rather than striving for it, you have to sort of position yourself so it drops in your lap, and then be modest and gracious about your status. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Most important thing about hacking is knowing inside and out of whatever you are hacking. If you try to hack a website you will probably need to know PHP, SQL and general networking at a high level. If you want to hack games, you will need to learn how to decompile code, and how to read that decompiled code. Whatever you want to hack, you will need intimate knowledge of how it works and how it\u2019s made. So aside from learning about technologies that make your target, you will need to learn how to think like hacker. What to look for and how to fool the system do do something it shouldn\u2019t do. If you are serious about this (hopefully White Hat), I would suggest reading \u201cCertified Ethical Hacker\u201d study guide by \u201cWiley\u201d. It is good place to start your carrier as a hacker. Better yet, if you finish it you can probably also pass the CEH exam. Though it is pricey ($600) it would open a lot of doors. White hat hackers are one of best paid IT profession out there. Though you should keep in mind CEH study guide will serve more as a road map. If you are just starting out you will need to learn a lot of additional information. However, if you just want to mess around (Gray Hat), you might like to read \u201cGame Hacking\u201d by \u201cNo Starch Press\u201d or \u201cThe Web Application Hacker\u2019s Handbook\u201d by \u201cWiley\u201d. These are more specialised and will let you \u201cget down and dirty\u201d faster. Forums. Hacking is very dynamic area of IT. Newest methods and vulnerabilities can get patched in matter of hours so outdated information is useless in most cases. That\u2019s why many hackers discuss what they learn on forums. Though don\u2019t expect everyone to reveal all their secrets or that there will be step-by-step guides. Forums is a great place to find information that isn\u2019t available (yet) in books but you will need to do a lot of \u201csifting\u201d as not all information is reliable and I wouldn\u2019t suggest downloading any tools on forums until you are more familiar with what is going on the forum (who is trusted, etc.) Personally, I haven\u2019t had good experience with YouTube. You might find some \u201cHow to hack WPA2 router\u201d guides but generally you will learn faster by reading and playing around. ",

Learn about computers, how they work and how to really use them.It\u2019s a self-learning adventure though. It\u2019s already so time consuming for someone to learn and acquire hacking knowledge and skills than that person don\u2019t have time to teach for free what has been acquired with really hard work.You can pay for professional training by recognized computer security practitioners, but these won\u2019t be replacement for hard work. The first and really best friend of a hacker is Google and the internet.You can learn anything from it if you\u2019re willing to put the effort.There are many resources out there. If you\u2019re not willing to put in the effort, you won\u2019t be a hacker.It\u2019s really hard work.Instead of doing some stuffs, you write code \u2026 A lot of people will depends only on hacking tools \u2026 while hacking tools don\u2019t do everything. They\u2019re only part of the equation. Writing and understanding code are an important aspect of hacking into computers even though it\u2019s not always necessary.If you\u2019re able to think past the tools and more about what you know and exploit your knowledge to go further or learn what\u2019s needed, you\u2019ll be farther apart from others.Your tools are what makes hacking possible, but if you can\u2019t write your own tools and need to wait for someone to write them for you or depend so much on tools that you\u2019d be stuck without them \u2026 well, in my humble opinion you\u2019re not really a hacker.You use the right tools for the right work, or write one or find another solution. There is always another way in. A hacker won\u2019t depend on one technique or one tool, but it will have an arsenal of tools or techniques that are public or privately written and be able to juggle between many of them.It has more to do with thinking about solutions to break something or an assumption.The more you\u2019ll hack, the more you\u2019ll know how to hack. I did OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional), and the people who were the most efficient was because they tweaked their way of thinking, using tools, analyzing data and writing custom code if needed.They didn\u2019t only depend on premade tools to tell them where the vulnerabilities are.If you can\u2019t hack manually without tools, and get stuck and give up at any roadblock, you are and won\u2019t be a computer hacker. Hacking is not as easy as people say it is but it\u2019s not as hard as people think it is too.Depends how deep you want to go into the rabbit hole. If you want to use exploits, it\u2019s pretty easy.If you want to write them, it\u2019s a whole other story. You want to write exploits?Writing exploits for a web-app is a whole lot different than writing an exploit for native applications.If you didn\u2019t understand that paragraph, be curious and go get a look around. Some of characteristics of hackers : curious, motivated, autonomous, creative, etc.If you expect to be spoonfed or have a lot of hand-holding, then you are not and won\u2019t be a hacker.A true and real hacker do ask help when needed, but don\u2019t expect to be spoonfed. And to finish, the best hackers out there don\u2019t all have certifications. ",

One must be a very passionate, curious and hard worker. Learn to use Linux or Unix using Command-line Interface only (no GUI as there is no learning in GUI, if need GUI then use windows) and then after doing a lots of practice, learn Linux system administration.Learn shell and python scripting language (useful in developing security tools and automating tasks)Learn computer networking, Linux Networking Concepts which includes Wireless networking, protocols, OS/TCP-IP stack, IPTABLES, IDS/IPS, etc.Learn NMAP Scripting Engine & Pentesting Tools (NMAP, Wireshark, aircrack suite etc.) and security framework 'Metasploit' and do lots of practice.Try to get your hands dirty in Kali Linux but please, don\u2019t limit yourself to only Kali Linux (because you can also do that with every distro of Linux family)Learn server security hardening or learn to protect your servers, in other words, *nix security administration.Must learn Programming languages like C/C++, ARM/x86/x64 assembly language, which helps in development (code and memory optimization), shellcode development, reversing malware, software and also in software exploitation).Learn about socket programming in Python and C, both. It would be helpful in the development of backdoors and shellcodes.Learn about operating system concepts, about Linux and BSDs and their security implementation on OS to make them secure.Learn kernel programming which includes driver development from both, theoretical and practical point of view.It would be little difficult to learn kernel programming as it requires one to be proficient in C, *nix system engineering (user-space development), some assembly language and all other operating system concepts. In kernel programming one will learn more about the internals of os and kernel like how everything inside the kernel works. Note: Whatever stuff I have written here is more focussed on System and Network Security.Please don't take it so easy,it requires a lot of hard work to be an independent security expert.Do lots of research (or re-search on google) and learn by own. Don\u2019t depend or wait for someone to teach or spoon-feed. Everyone is busy and struggling with their own problems in life.Do a lot of practice on each and every point that mentioned above by setting up the virtual labs or in dockers or some sort of hardware, whatever suits.Learn and read a lot of security technical books and also practice them a lot because technical books are not novels.This post doesn\u2019t cover mobile pentesting (user-space) and web pentesting. I am not the right person for web or on mobile pentesting yet but still mentioning some; like learning web development languages, learn about OWASP and also web-based attacks and try HackerOne or Bugcrowd to practice etc.) For mobile pentesting like app reversing etc. one can proceed after learning the points mentioned above. Requirements: Google.Curious Mind.Patience .Eagerness to Learn.Constant and continous learning.Never Stop Learning!! ",

Consider what Bill Gates, a high school student turned Harvard drop out, did: he wrote a BASIC interpreter for (some of his critics forget this) a microprocessor microcomputer which was thought not possible at that time, which he parlayed into a business. He had insight, timing, talented skill, business acumen, and throw in whatever other positive and negative adjectives you want, to become the richest man in the world to the annoyance and admiration of the old, the less talented, envious, (throw in adjectives) and the rest of us. Great hacker? Monetarily and some notoriety. So how about a hacker without wealth and some notoriety. How about Stallman? He's doing GNU. He's skilled; his accomplishments earned him a MacArthur Fellowship. Hacking is poorly understood. Some people think it's about cracking into computers. Hardily. As one start, it helps to read Levy's book. His account starts with physical systems (model rail roads). In computers, it involved hardware and machine language not higher level languages (which had to fight for the rights to compete with the lower-level languages guys). It's not about languages. It's about problem solving (eeeee, some say outside the box).  So the questions are: what are you going to do? And how are you going to do it? Context: I've been given a card which states that I'm a card carrying Unix hacker. I'm not fully certain how I deserve that (well, ... yes, I do to a small degree, but I can't believe to the degree of some of my friends). And I am continually reaffirmed by colleagues that I should attend hacker gatherings despite the fact that I'm retired and have no where near the skills of some of them (they say I'm a life hacker (I don't buy that)). I think they want me as a foil on calling them foils. (Manish, you and Mark upvoted (I got his note but don't see the tally) way too early. I had not finished this.)

Media are another game-changers to promote so-called hackers and such hackers become an idol for newcomers and thus cyber security training industry exploits them. In mid 80s & 90s, hacking was termed as programming subculture of the developers\u2019 community. But later it was disguised by the moron media people who little understand hacking, and technology behind the security. Media falsely related hacking to cyber crime. Some moron then started using a much pretty word \u2014 ethical to precede hacking and it\u2019s become Ethical Hacking. Simply ridiculous. There\u2019s a mushroom growth of cyber security training since couple of years. Most of them are just fake. And innocent young people who think cyber security is a demanding field of computer science, are aspiring to become a hacker. No one can become hacker by such street courses like CEH. Nor one can become a so-called successful hacker by two or three year nonsense graduate or diploma courses. To become a successful security expert requires lots of sweating hours to study and many sleepless nights to become well-versed with many systems. People who cannot cope-up with CLI should simply get away from information security field. Also system scripting languages like bash, csh, sh, perl, python are required to write your own code to deal with systems and to talk with the network. By using mere tool available in Kali Linux or using Metasploit etc., not means you are a good security expert or so-called hacker. Cyber security is a matter of own experience to deal with vulnerabilities & threats. I witnessed many students who successfully completed hacking courses like CEH and still struggle to escape if stuck in simple Linux problem. So-called Ethical Hacking is a nonsense thing in cyber security. Do you really think you would really be wanted to be a sheeple?  (Source of Image: All we like sheeple have gone astray) ",

            "answer_text": "As the hacker is among the most skilled information technology disciplines, it requires a wide knowledge of IT technologies and techniques. To truly be a great hacker, one must master many skills. Don't be discouraged if you don't have all the skills I list here, but rather use this list as a starting ground for what you need to study and master in the near future. The Fundamental Skills These are the basics that every hacker should know before even trying to hack. Once you have a good grasp on everything in this section, you can move into the intermediary level. Basic Computer Skills It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking parameters. Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+. Networking Skills You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following. DHCPNATSubnettingIPv4IPv6Public v Private IPDNSRouters and switchesVLANsOSI modelMAC addressingARPLinux Skills It is extremely critical to developing Linux skills to become a hacker. Nearly all the tools we use as a hacker are developed for Linux and Linux gives us capabilities that we don't have using Windows. If you need to improve your Linux skills, or you're just getting started with Linux, check out my Linux series for beginners below. Virtualization You need to become proficient in using one of the virtualization software packages such as VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation. Ideally, you need a safe environment to practice your hacks before you take them out in the real world. A virtual environment provides you with a safe environment to test and refine your hacks before going live with them. Cryptography Although one doesn't need to be a cryptographer to be a good hacker, the more you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each cryptographic algorithm, the better the chances of defeating it. In addition, cryptography can be used by the hacker to hide their activities and evade detection. Reverse Engineering Reverse engineering enables you to open a piece of malware and re-build it with additional features and capabilities. Just like in software engineering, no one builds a new application from scratch. Nearly every new exploit or malware uses components from other existing malware. In addition, reverse engineering enables the hacker to take an existing exploit and change its signature so that it can fly past IDS and AV detection. Think Creatively There is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack. Persistence A hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with a persistence that you will be able to hack the most secure systems. ",

            "answer_text": "This is for educational purposes only: That depends on what you are trying to accomplish with your hack. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re targeting websites: I would suggest starting by doing a bit of recon work on your target. By recon, I mean, sniff for open ports, determine what software and versions are being utilized in your target server. Let\u2019s assume you want to attack from the admin login page. You can do several things to make yourself more successful; Check the source code, search for scripts that collect input from the user, and determine how the website will respond to unusual input. In the case of an admin login page, input: ADMIN\u2019 OR 1=1# for Website/admin/login pages. However, you can also include SQL statements with your input, try to execute a command specific to the OS the server is running. Try to determine the filters for input the site has in place and what ways you can bypass them. One could also try SQLi or SQL(Simple Query Language) injection. What this means is attacking a data-driven app by inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field and executing them. Many sites are vulnerable to this attack and a simple google search for php?id=1 will show you which ones. To delve much further, I\u2019d basically be hacking the site for you. Try out some different techniques; Preferrably in a website you own or have been given permission to penetration test. Reminder: This is for educational purposes only. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me start by telling you the story of the first hacker ever. Once, there was a king who was looking for a hacker but he knew nothing about the procedure to hire one. So, he came up with a strategy. He placed a large boulder in the middle of the main road, completely blocking entry into the city. Then, he hid nearby to see how people react to it. To the king's disappointment there came people after people but they cursed the king and moved on. No one did anything to move that rock. King was really disappointed. After many weeks, there came a villager, lone peasant. He did not turn away, instead he strained and strained trying to push it out of his way. Then he had his \"Eureka\" moment. He started looking for something to use as lever. Finally, he found a long branch that he used to dislodge the massive rock. Beneath the rock was a pot of gold. And, the king found his hacker.  Hackers are people like that peasant, they look through the problems, it is nothing more than how you use resources to move forward. And there is no one way that fits all, different hackers use different tools to perform same action. Now, if you want to be a hacker - find a challenge and sweat your brains to find a way!

            "answer_text": "To be a good hacker, i.e. one who has a lot of skill, you must specialize in one or several topics, and also know the basics of the others. For example, you could specialize in exploit research and development for Windows, Linux and/or OS X, but still be able to conduct penetration tests professionally against web apps, web services, external networks, internal networks, etc. That is only part of the equation though. As a professional hacker (i.e. penetration tester / security consultant) working full-time, you must also be able to follow a decent methodology so your testing results are consistent and of high quality. If you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re really doing bug bounties, and not penetration testing. Another key factor to becoming or being a good hacker, and this is probably the most important; you must understand how your attack works, why it works, and in most cases when it\u2019s within your area of expertise, how to patch it yourself. As a professional penetration tester, you must also be able to explain the same type of issue in various formats from technical to another pentester, to a beginner pentester, to an infosec manager, to a developer, and perhaps to a non-technical user. Within this particular skill set, your report writing skills should also be good. This is something that most people learn when they get their first job in pentesting, even though I have seen some firms produce reports that look like someone with one day of experience wrote it. While reporting is not always funny (especially if there are lots of bugs as that means more work) and you still have the same deadline to meet in most cases (at least in mine), the report is after all the final product the client pays for and receives. You might have a debriefing after the report has been issued, maybe even two in case they don\u2019t understand the report. So, if you want to be a good professional hacker, it\u2019s not just about learning a few tricks, it\u2019s also how you work, how you deliver the results, and how you communicate with the client for example. Having very good English skills is probably one of the best things you can do for yourself, as it will open up job opportunities world wide, and you will also be able to pick up information much faster and communicate effectively with other hackers.

If you know more, dig deeper, and try harder than they do, you can compromise technology systems.

Too many organizations throw security technology as bandaids at the problems instead of trying to understand and close the vulnerabilities. ",

            "answer_text": "Being a hacker has nothing to do with a particular technology. It is a way of thinking. One of the best ways to describe it is to quote one of my favourite films:  \"What you must learn is that these rules are no different than the rules of a computer system. Some of them can be bent, others can be broken.\" - Morpheus, The Matrix. Hackers are great cheaters. Information Security expert Bruce Schneier talks more about this mindset here (http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/06/teaching_the_se.html). Hackers are patient. They are willing to take their time to achieve their outcome. They are the digital version of a master sniper, waiting for two days without food or water and sleeping in their own filth for the one moment when the set of circumstances they require are present. Then they carefully and calmly go for the kill shot. The best hackers - unlike most \"technology people\" - have an excellent understanding of human behavior and how to manipulate it. They know that the weakest link in any security system is the people involved. Finally, great hackers have great memories - for details, and yes, lots of technology information. They are often \"jack-of-all-trades and master of nearly all of them\" people. So, how can you become a hacker? 1. Learn to cheat at everything.2. Learn to be patient and how to change tactics quickly in the face of adversity until you succeed.3. Learn to understand people, their motivations, and how to manipulate them.4. Learn how to remember vast quantities of information, particularly about technology. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all start learning to define hacking. Though majority of starters only imply network penetration, getting access to somebody's online account and private data by the term 'hacking' but 'hacking' word is much broader.  Among professionals, the word hacking is usually used to create some stuff or add a wonderful patch to some existing code. Say there is a software and you found a bug out there in the software that could lead to leaking users' personal information. You go through the source code of the software and fixed it. This is called hacking in more broader compute science world. I am assuming in this question that by term 'hacking' you mean only network penetration.  In that case, you need to have strong fundamentals in the field of computer science. Being good in various fields helps you apply the broader knowledge to find new hacks in the system and beat existing systems. You don't need to be expert in all the concepts but you need to at least know them.  Remember this : \"Learn a lot about little and a little about lot\" Following above principle will help you alot. If you know how to start you can always google the stuff to find more details about that and gradually reach a stage where you are hacking a system, but if you don't know where or how to start then you will most probably keep yourself disappointed and keep asking others to make you learn hacking.  So grab some stuff, keep learning about stuff inside that stuff and then recursively learn everything. Google and increase your knowledge about various fields. Start learning a lot about little (say some specific language or field) and keep learning little about a lot of stuff here and there. ",

            "answer_text": "You didn't define who a hacker is to you. If you want to break into computers and commit fraud/vandalism, I'm one of the good guys and I've been studying how to make computers do what I want (including security) since a was a kid in the 1980s.  You'll have to be skilled enough and lucky enough to catch me making a serious mistake in order to break in to my systems.  I think you will find this to be an exercise in futility, and I won't help you make unnecessary work for me. If, on the other hand, hacking means \"building circuits and making your own computers\" I can and will help you! What you want is a Raspberry Pi.  It runs Linux (which is something you need to know in order to understand computers), and the community behind it is really enthusiastic about teaching engineering to anyone who wants to learn.  Also, while it's not the fastest computer, it's one of the cheapest and most flexible computers you can buy. I recommend the Raspberry Pi route.  Hacking with them is more likely to land you in engineering school than in jail, and you'll be a far more knowledgeable hacker in the end. P.S. The stories about what hackers can do come from the 1960s and 1970s.  One of the things that has changed in the half century since those stories were forged is that the pros take computer security seriously enough that it has become own highly skilled specialty in the IT world, and in law enforcement.  I've worked with and taken classes from a few of those guys over the years, and they're very serious professionals. ",

            "answer_text": "It largely depends on what you mean by hacker. Classically, if you're talking about developing an ability to pull off criminal activities using a computer, that is generally called cracking (at least it used to be). Hacker always kind of meant computer enthusiast (back when not everybody had computers), and is adopted by outfits like Facebook more recently to mean hardcore programmers. There are hardware hackers, people modding everything from boards onward to create performance or tools not intended by original manufacturers. But if you mean the idea of hacker as technical security expert, than the answer is to learn. Learn a Unix based OS, learn a programming language from the standpoint of understanding the basics of all languages (C, Python, etc.), learn basic networking protocols. Start hanging out in forums dealing with technical security, reading blogs on the same, and attend the right conferences (ShmooCon is coming up). And when you're done with all that, start original research and contribute back to the security community via blogs, small gatherings, presentations, and so forth. Most certifications (I have a few) won't put you within a light year of being \"a hacker\", the way to earn that role is via respect from the community based on contributions. Or...if you want the media to call you a hacker, do something criminal even if it's basic, make sure it gets a lot of attention, and then get caught/do time.  ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Well if you want to become a hacker, I mean if your aim is to be called as a hacker, then sorry to say you can only become a security expert. I am not demotivating you, I just want to say that it's your interest in learning new concepts, exploring things, modifying the features of a system, in order to accomplish a goal outside of the creator's original purpose, experimenting, that makes you a hacker. It simply means that you should be interested more in the process of becoming a hacker than just telling yourself every time that I have to become a hacker.  Secondly it should be clear to you that hacking is not just like hacking someone's Facebook of Gmail password (as lots of people ask this question regularly how to hack Facebook or Gmail password). This is just like opening random pages of a unknown book and start reading. May be you will understand what is given on the page, but you'll not come to know the main motive of the book.  Hacking is something you can't just \"do\". You have to have a passion for it and really want to learn it. Field of Hacking is very fascinating. That's why lots of teenagers want to learn Hacking. But when they enter this field , they didn't know how to start , which books are better and whom did they consult. You are not the only one with this  problem. So don't get worried. But before I start telling you how to start I must tell you a truth - \"If you want to hack, but you're not interested enough to make your own way, to learn and discover and spend the countless hours reading and exploring and experimenting without someone else to hold your hand, you're not a hacker. \" First realize that there is no any software that can fully automate the whole process. Kali will only help you up to a limit, but if you really want to become a hacker you should know how things really work. For this I recommend install a basic OS like Ubuntu and install all the softwares by your own as per the need. You should start with learning how to program, it's the main skill you'll use while hacking.  If you don't know any computer language , I recommend starting with Python. It is cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners. You can also start with languages like C  or  C++. But don't get misguided that learning any one language is the end. It's just a start. You have to learn more.  But don't worry , when you will be confident in any one language , you will easily learn other.  Secondly you should learn networking. Most importantly OSI model, TCP/IP model, ARP, IP (v4,v6), TCP, UDP, NetBios, SOCKS and pretty much everything in the Application layer. This will let you know how we all are connected to each other , how web servers work, and will certainly help you in information gathering (finding details of the machine, you want to hack). If you can gain enough information and holds the necessary computing skills , then only you can move further . Then you should be familiar with Operating systems like UNIX based system. If not start learning it. You can also start with understanding WINDOWS, simply because it is more familiar. Spend time on reading books. For suggestion see my answer on: What are the books for ethical hacking? Try to be updated. You should know what is happening in the world. Visit sites like thehackernews.com and many others (you should find it by yourself) to get latest news. Most important of all you need - \"Brains\" to apply what you have learnt at the very right moment. Good Luck and Have Fun ! ",

            "answer_text": "Businesses and government-related organizations that are serious about their network security hire ethical hackers and penetration testers to help probe and improve their networks, applications, and other computer systems with the ultimate goal of preventing data theft and fraud. You may not get the same adrenaline rush that you might with underground hacking, but you can earn a good and honest living--and not end up facing prison time, as some illegal \"black hat\" hackers do. How does the job market look like for ethical hackers? Extremely good! The IT market overall continues to grow despite the current economic turmoil. Research firm Gartner estimates that worldwide enterprise IT spending grew by 5.9 percent between 2009 and 2010, to a total of $2.7 trillion. At the same time, security is becoming a more pressing concern. Gartner expects to see an increase of nearly 40 percent in spending on worldwide security services during the five-year period from 2011 to 2015, eventually surpassing $49.1 billion. In your first years as an ethical hacker, you'll be in a position to earn anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 per year, depending on the company that hires you, and on your IT experience and education. With several years of professional experience, you could command $120,000 or more per year, especially if you do your own independent consulting. You can't just dive into an ethical hacker position, however. Without IT security experience, you won't get very far, even with degrees and certifications. As is true for other IT jobs, employers typically want candidates who have college degrees, but related experience is king. And experience with certifications can typically take the place of some degree requirements. ",

            "answer_text": "Programming knowledge is necessary, although not mandatory to become a hacker. Some of the world's best hackers started out as programmers. If you know programming, you will be able to dissect code and analyze it. You will be able to write your own scripts or your own hacking tools. So, which programming language should you learn then? HTML and JavaScript are languages of the internet. So make sure you learn them first. they are also incredibly easy to grasp and learn. If your are enrolled in an undergraduate computer science degree, you will most probably be learning C,C++ and Java. These three major languages are good and you should keep learning them, but for a hacker, Python is the best language. \"Why?\" You ask. Because python is an extremely powerful language and it easy to learn at the same time. With Python you can achieve your results with minimal coding, and it does not need to be compiled. That means, just as you finish writing a script, you can immediately run it without having to compile it. And later on in life, if you decide to become a programmer instead of a hacker, Python can develop GUI applications also. In fact, a large part of YouTube is written in Python. Another language you should learn is PHP. PHP is also free and open source. It is a server side scripting language, meaning, login pages and other web based forms are handled by PHP. Knowledge of ASP. NET will also be helpful. You should also know MySQL commands and syntax. This knowledge will be vital later when you perform SQL injection attacks against websites. Download XAMPP package and start practicing PHP and MySQLAnother important thing to note is that most colleges will not teach you advanced programming concepts. File handling and Network socket programming are two very important concepts you should familiarize yourself with, regardless of the language. Source:google ",

            "answer_text": "I think you're born with it, or not. There's this deep curiosity, an intense desire to know \"how does this work\" or \"what's in there\" or \"what would happen if I did X...\". It just doesn't go away. You can suppress it in polite company, but sooner or later, the tools come out and you dive in... It usually manifests when you're very young, and you start asking adults questions about how stuff works, and they either ignore you or give you patently wrong information. So you set off to figure it out for yourself.  And nothing breeds excess like success, so the first time you score a win, and successfully disassemble and dissect and reassemble (and improve!) something that's not supposed to come apart in the first place,  that's a powerful motivation to rinse and repeat. In the day before computers were commonplace, that lead to a infinity of mechanical inventions. Edison, Tesla, Ford , Watt, Newton, Galileo, da Vinci - those guys and countless hundreds more were \"ur Hackers\".  My son got an iPad when he was what, three? Four? He's been asking questions about how stuff works for a long time, and is starting to get to the taking things apart to see what makes them tick stage. I keep heading him off at the pass when it gets to consumer electronics, where you really do need to have special tools to make any sense of it, but readily give him dead boards and parts to examine. It's just a matter of time before that turns to software. I'm in favor, in case that wasn't obvious. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, let's understand.. What is a hacker? There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term \u2018hacker\u2019. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. A Hacker's Attitude: the following modern Zen poem has it: To follow the path: look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master. So, if you want to be a hacker, repeat the following things until you believe them. Now I have a list of facts that you must realise in order to be a hacker! The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.No problem should ever have to be solved twice.Boredom and drudgery are evil.Freedom is good.Attitude is no substitute for competence.Basic Hacking Skills that you must develop in order to step in the Hacking World! Learn How To ProgramThis, of course, is the fundamental hacking skill. If you don't know any computer languages, I recommend starting with Python. It is cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners. Get one of the open-source Unixes and learn to use and run it.I'll assume you have a personal computer or can get access to one. (Take a moment to appreciate how much that means. The hacker culture originally evolved back when computers were so expensive that individuals could not own them.) Unix is the operating system of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing Unix, you can't be an Internet hacker without understanding Unix. Learn how to use the World Wide Web and write HTML.Most of the things the hacker culture has built do their work out of sight, helping run factories and offices and universities without any obvious impact on how non-hackers live. The Web is the one big exception, the huge shiny hacker toy that even politicians admit has changed the world. If you don't have functional English, learn it.However, being a native English-speaker does not guarantee that you have language skills good enough to function as a hacker. If your writing is semi-literate, ungrammatical, and riddled with misspellings, many hackers (including myself) will tend to ignore you. The Hacker/Nerd Connection Contrary to popular myth, you don't have to be a nerd to be a hacker. It does help, however, and many hackers are in fact nerds. Being something of a social outcast helps you stay concentrated on the really important things, like thinking and hacking. Also, if you're partially through all this then the question you should be asking yourself is that, How do I tell if I am already a hacker? \ud83d\ude42 Happy Hacking! ",

            "answer_text": "Hackers come from a variety of different educational backgrounds. Some have four-year computer science degrees, while others are self-taught. In the past few years, hacker training programs have become another viable option for those interested in entering the field. There are now several hacker \u201cboot camps\u201d across the country that train people who have little to no programming experience. Becoming a successful hacker depends on building a base of knowledge and computer programming skills. One of the most important areas of knowledge for hackers is computer networking. Hackers must know how computers communicate with each other through the Internet and internal networks, so they should be very familiar with the protocols on which these networks are built. Hackers should also be very familiar with the security measures used to protect computer networks. Programming plays an important role in hacking, and hackers should know how to read and write code written in different programming languages. They should also work in different operating systems, like Windows, Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X. Many hackers work extensively on Unix and Linux operating systems because many servers are Unix or Linux-based, and because these operating systems give end users a great deal of freedom to explore and manipulate. Computer systems are maintained and operated by humans, so many hackers also develop skills in what is called \u201csocial engineering.\u201d Social engineering involves gaining the trust of the users and guardians of a computer network and manipulating that trust to gain access to it. A hacker may gain physical access to a server room, for example, by misrepresenting himself to employees in the building, or gain access to a network by convincing a user to give him their password. No matter their training, hackers gain experience and credibility through practice and collaboration with the hacker community. Hackers can contribute to the knowledge in their field by writing and sharing software tools, testing software written by others, and writing documentation. Are there any certification or licensure requirements? There are no licensure requirements to become a hacker, but there are many voluntary certifications that could enhance your chances of finding a job in the field. There are many general IT certifications you can pursue to show your expertise in areas of knowledge like hardware maintenance (CompTIA\u2019s A+ certification), networking (CompTIA\u2019s Network+ certification and the Cisco Certified Network Professional certification), and computer security (CompTIA\u2019s Security+ certification and the CISSP certification). Earning one of these certifications typically involves self-study, though many organizations offer training courses, and passing an exam. You can also become a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). The International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council) developed the Certified Ethical Hacker program, which is now recognized by the Department of Defense as an approved training program and certification for its computer network defenders. To become a CEH, you should already have some experience in computer security. The CEH course lasts five days and includes hands-on training in topics like network scanning, intrusion, intrusion detection, social engineering, and various types of cyber attacks, such as viruses, buffer overflows, and DDoS attacks. At the end of the course, you can take an exam to earn your certification ",

            "answer_text": " Hacking is to get the information or data of person without permission. But hacking is not only to break security. If you will have a close look at it then you can persue it as a career become Ethical Hacker and have six figure salary.But it is not so easy as it looks.There are some basic rules that you have to follow to become ethical hacker.If you are beginner then please read all the points.Ways for a beginner to get started in ethical hacking. Get friendly with any LINUX operating system . I recommend to use Kali Linux as it has 1000 of the tools preloaded in it. It is the mostly used OS used by the hackers for P*netration testing.The best thing about Kali Linux is it is free of cost open source and user-friendly. 2. Good Source for Learning Hacking is not a small topic it is a vast topic so you have to find a good books which can solve your doubts.If you are a newbie, the book \u201cHacking Secrets Exposed\u201d is a perfect source for learning. 3. Learn programming languages. If you really want to start hacking like an Elite hacker then programming languages are important to know. If you have the knowledge about programming language then you can make your own tools and find out the bugs in any program. It is better to have some basic understanding of programming languages like Python,HTML PHP,JavaScript. It is good to start with HTML. 4. CEH [Certified Ethical Hacker] Certificate Prepare for CEH certificate it is very valuable. For becoming a certified ethical hacker appropriate certification from International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (the EC-Council) is required. Certification requires that you have to pass a 4-hour exam, which contains 125 multiple-choice questions and the exam costs $500. 5. Conclusion I will say you that for becoming a good ethical hacker you need to know your goals. Finding bugs and flaws is a difficult task. Try to track a single goal till accomplished before you move to next one. And in last don't waste your knowledge and become a Black hat hacker. Always work legally within the laws and use your knowledge to help others. All the best! Start hacking Cheers! Image: Google ",

There is a community and shared culture of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture were the first \"hackers.\" Breaking into computers and breaking phone systems have come to symbolize hacking in popular culture, but hacking culture is much more complex and moralistic than most people know. To become a hacker, learn basic hacking techniques, how to think like a hacker, and how to gain respect within the ethical hacking community.Part One of Three:FundamentalsRun Unix. Unix is the operating system of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing Unix, you can't be an Internet hacker without understanding Unix. For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly Unix-centered. A Unix like Linux can run alongside Microsoft Windows on the same machine. Download Linux online or find a local Linux user group to help you with installation.[1]A good way to dip your toes in the water is to boot up what Linux fans call a live CD, a distribution that runs entirely off a CD without having to modify your hard disk. This is a way to get a look at the possibilities without having to do anything drastic.There are other operating systems besides Unix, but they're distributed in binary \u2014 you can't read the code, and you can't modify it. Trying to learn to hack on a Microsoft Windows machine or under any other closed-source system is like trying to learn to dance while wearing a body cast.Under Mac OS X it's possible to run Linux, but only part of the system is open source \u2014 you're likely to hit a lot of walls, and you have to be careful not to develop the bad habit of depending on Apple's proprietary code.Write HTML. If you don't know how to program, learning basic HyperText Mark-Up Language (HTML) and gradually building proficiency is essential. What you see when you look at a website of pictures, images, and design components is all coded using HTML. For a project, set out to learn how to make a basic home page and work your way up from There.in your browser, open the page source information to examine the HTML to see an example. Go to Web Developer > Page Source in Firefox and spend time looking at the code.You can write HTML in a basic word processing program like Notepad or Simple text and save your files as \"text only,\" so you can upload them to a browser and see your work translated.[2]You'll need to learn to format tags and learn to think visually using them.[3] \"<\" is used to open a tag and \"/> is used to close it. \"\" is the opening for a line of paragraph code. You'll use tags to signal anything visual: italics, formatting, color, etc. Learning HTML will help you to understand better how the Internet works.Learn the language of programing.Before you start writing poems you have to learn basic grammar. Before you break the rules you have to learn the rules. But if your ultimate goal is to become a hacker, you're going to need more than basic English to write your masterpiece.Python is a good \"language\" to start off with because it's cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners. Despite being a good first language, it is not just a toy; it is very powerful, flexible, and well-suited for large projects. Java is an alternative, but its value as a first programming language has been questioned.[4]If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core language of Unix. C++ is very closely related to C; if you know one, learning the other will not be difficult. C is very efficient with your machine's resources, but will soak up huge amounts of your time on debugging and is often avoided for that reason, unless the efficiency of your computer is especially Sito in costruzione is probably a good idea to use a good starting platform such as Backtrack 5 R3, Kali or Ubuntu 12.04LTS.and the way u should b\u2026\u2026like\u2026.Think creatively. Now that you've got the basic skills in place, you can start thinking artistically. Hackers are like artists, philosophers, and engineers all rolled up into one. They believe in freedom and mutual responsibility. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Hackers take a special delight in solving problems, sharpening their skills, and exercising their intelligence.Hackers have a diversity of interests culturally and intellectually, outside of hacking. Work as intensely as you play, and play as intensely as you work. For true hackers, the boundaries between \"play,\" \"work,\" \"science,\" and \"art\" all tend to disappear, or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness.Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions, which is a great way to meet hackers and proto-hackers. Consider training in a martial art. The kind of mental discipline required for martial arts seems to be similar in important ways to what hackers do. The most hacker-ly martial arts are those which emphasize mental discipline, relaxed awareness, and control, rather than raw strength, athleticism, or physical toughness. Tai Chi is a good martial art for hackers.Learn to love solving problems. No problem should ever have to be solved twice. Think of it as a community in which the time of everyone is hackers is precious. Hackers believe sharing information is a moral responsibility. When you solve problems, make the information public to help everyone solve the same issue.You don't have to believe that you're obligated to give all your creative product away, though the hackers that do are the ones that get most respect from other hackers. It's consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you in food and rent and computers.Read older pieces, such as the \"Jargon File\" or \"Hacker Manifesto\" by The Mentor. They may be out of date in terms of technical issues, but the attitude and spirit are just as timely.[5]Learn to recognize and fight authority.The enemy of the hacker is boredom, drudgery, and authoritarian figures who use censorship and secrecy to strangle the freedom of information. Monotonous work keeps the hacker from hacking.Embracing hacking as a way of life is to reject so-called \"normal\" concepts of work and property, choosing instead to fight for equality and common knowledge.Be competent. So, anyone who spends time on Reddit can write up a ridiculous cyberpunk user name and pose as a hacker. But the Internet is a great equalizer, and values competence over ego and posture. Spend time working on your craft and not your image and you'll more quickly gain respect than modeling yourself on the superficial things we think of \"hacking\" in popular culture.

            "answer_text": "Hacking generally require skills. It depends on the type of hack. Learn these programming languages and you will automatically get ideas for hacking and you'll be a hacker. 1# For Web App / Pentesting / Hacking: HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the basics for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. So if you don\u2019t know HTML you should first learn it. JavaScript: Learning JavaScript. It will help you to understand the basics of Cross Site Scripting. PHP / SQL: The majority of web applications are written using PHP and MySQL. So it is a must to learn PHP. 2# For Writing/Understanding Exploits, Shell Codes, Rootkits etc: C & C++: More than 60 % of the exploits you will find on the web are written in C & C ++. Learning C & C++ will help you to understand about Buffer overflows, Stack overflow etc \u2013 so learning C and C ++ is a must for every Hacker/Pentester. Assembly: Learning assembly will help you in Writing/understanding Shell code, it will also help you in Reverse Engineering applications and software\u2019s. 3# For Building Tools And Scripts: Python: Python is a very powerful high-level language, it\u2019s easy to learn and code, most of the tools and scripts for automation are written in Python. Knowing Python socket programming will help you a lot in Exploit writing. Ruby: Ruby is an another language which is used to write scripts, tools. Metasploit Framework is written in Ruby. Learning ruby will help you understand the in and outs of MSF. Bash: Learning Bash is very useful in writing small scripts for automation. Hope this answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "I think first you need to separate between what you mean by hacking and then what you mean by ethical hacking. If you are saying \"can I be an ethical hacker, I know C++\" you might be talking about the traditional definition of hacking, which is someone who likes to program and explore technology for the sheer joy of it. A homebrew computer hobbyist or a budding amateur engineer. The trend in computing in the popular imagination lately is that people who like to explore technology are in someways \"unethical\" because they do it for their own edification. For example, if you are \"hacking\" a new program to control your home automation system because you don't like the software they supply with the devices, that's somehow unethical because the company whose products you bought didn't give you permission to play with the technology you rightfully own.  I my book, the current trend towards this \"mother may I?\" approach to technology just kills interest in STEM and suppresses the natural curiosity of people disposed to become engineers because of a vague, ill-defined notion of \"intellectual property.\" If this is what you mean by hacking, you are an ethical hacker by definition, ignore anybody who tells you otherwise. If you are talking about information security and being an \"ethical hacker,\" you are like many people, responding to marketing from people who sell certifications. That's good for them because the commercial purpose for that marketing is to make everyone have that insecurity. If you aren't an ethical hacker, you must by definiton live in some grey area, right? It's so lucky that a large, plodding certification body can wave a magic wand and make you ethical because you passed their multiple-choice test. See the problem? Now, don't get me wrong, those certifications have their place. The do provide a low level of assurance that a person is familiar with a defined body of knowledge that is acceptable by the industry as the lowest common denominator. They are helpful when you need to get past the HR department to get a job. However, what that industry means by ethical hacking is that you use tools to help defend people's information assets, either by testing for vulnerabilities, doing forensics, or performing root cause analysis to help avoid future breaches. Unfortunately, threats evolve so quickly that there's a good chance that many of the tools people certify on will be obsolete by the time they complete the certification. As my grandfather used to say \"use the right tool for the job,\" and if you don't know any better because there's a tool you are certified on that you are supposed to be using because \"it's the ethical thing,\" then you might be need a more evolved sense of professional ethics overall. In short, don't believe the hype about ethical hacking. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok. You did not give us enough information in the description. Therefor I will have to provide basic beginner stuff. In order to become a hacker, you would need to understand computer programming since you have to understand the vulnerabilities that can happen. An example of this is that in HTML5, there is a vulnerability known as Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) where if the webpage does not encode the words you insert in an insert box, you could inject code into it making the page think that it\u2019s part of the code and run it. This would mean that you understand the code and what\u2019s going behind the scenes to you can make your malicious code and insert it. It\u2019s all about understanding vulnerabilities or a flaw in the code. I would recommend to setup your own vulnerable project and start from there because if you try to hack someone else\u2019s stuff, you might be caught and have charges pressed. Once you understand most of that, you can move on into installing linux and learn command lines. Think about the top part as if you were learning what 3+3. Then understanding what Linux can do and the programs you install is like using a calculator for tough equations because no one wants to write down a huge lists of numbers to find the answer. Linux is just a helpful tool to use. If you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on and how it works, you\u2019ll just be considered a \u201cscript kiddie\u201c In short, learn code and understand vulnerabilities. Once you know how most of them work, you can install Linux and move on into more advanced ways to exploit the vulnerabilities. ",

            "answer_text": "Answering this Question without understanding the Question will be almost bullshit. So, first let me introduce you to Hacking as such you understand the Question really in a better manner. So.. who is a hacker? This question is actually meaningless the actual question should be \u201cWhat is Hacking ?\u201d The secret lives of hackers:This Video actually define\u2019s its very correctly. Hacking is actually creative problem solving by taking the advantages of the default features and System functioning. Have you heard of brain hacks? Using some of the default features of our brain to make it do what we want\u2019s to is hacking. That\u2019s why Things which can be hacked are: Brain, body, computer\u2019s and every other system which have some function\u2019s and protocol\u2019s to be followed to work. Just like computer\u2019s our Body also have some specific way to work and taking advantage of that way\u2019s and solving a problem with that or making it do what you want is hacking. Now getting into the Question. How to become a hacker? It\u2019s really simple you should be having a deep knowledge of that System and creative enough to take the advantages of that system. That system can be computer's, human body, your school protocol\u2019s even your timetable. So ? what\u2019s next and what will actually make you a Good hacker. I have been wondering and discovering out a lot of resources and thinking and research on what are the thing\u2019s which can be hacked. After few years of research, i can say these 4\u20135 topics will be always at the top in terms of hacking. Computer system hackingHuman brain hack\u2019sBody hack\u2019sDay to day hack\u2019s (it really makes you feel smart enough)Human relationship\u2019s hacking (Dating and other\u2019s)Economical hacks.Now let me expand those up but before that One should make a clear mindset that you will not become a hacker in 1 or 2 day\u2019s or weeks or even year\u2019s it takes\u2019s a Lot\u2019s of efforts and time to be a hacker. Computer System hacking: this filed itself is so huge that it will take you year\u2019s and year\u2019s to understand and learn a lot of things. It can take you 4\u20135, or maybe 10\u201312 year\u2019s to be an expert cybersecurity hacker.For this, you first need to start with the history of computers.(Not interested in history ??? well then you are not interested in this field at all) So one should learn how the computer actually works I will recommend you for the MIT Computer science and Electrical engineering course first should be completed in 4 years. That will make you a lot with advanced systems network\u2019s and programming and Linux basic but they will not have a Lot of practical knowledge for that you should go to sites like Udemy, coursera, edx and CBT nuggets. They can really help you a lot with that and one should practice and practice a lot. The thing to be in mind: It\u2019s Not just limited to Website\u2019s, software and hardware it\u2019s even bigger than your imagination.Human brain hacking is also an in research now a day\u2019s and people are just trying to learn how one can really use the brain as a Tool. This is not too vast as Computer science but yet it's covered biology and computer and chemistry. Really a lot to study. For learning thing, you need to be a good self-observer which can make you understand your own brain but ya you even need to have a good knowledge in this and I will recommend The brain games ( popular NAT GEO SHOW) one can watch over the internet. which can give you a lot of understanding of the functioning of the brain and can help you to be a brain hacker.Body hack\u2019s other then brain-body is also an important and same as brain hacking. Things like: How one can survive in less water or no water for month\u2019s or how to avoid pain. so basically for that, i will recommend you to watch You can\u2019t lick your elbow This is also an awesome show talking about how one can take advantage of body functioning.Day to day hack\u2019s include really basics problem\u2019s of real life which can be solved with a little bit of creativity and understanding of the functioning of that system. One can be Good at this with the presence of mind and being good at understanding.Human relationship hacking this actually includes topic like psychology (This is simpler to brain hacking but is actually a lot different than that) In this you will study about over and observing other behavior\u2019s and make them do what you want\u2019s to. For this, they are a lot of Good books and some courses on coursera for that like social psychology and all.I have no right\u2019s to say something on this till now but ya I am working on that but ya one can go with cryptocurrency for some profit with labor.So that\u2019s all on my side this is my first Answer Quora based on my research on Hacking. one can ask for resources link on message inbox for learning about these topic\u2019s mostly Computer\u2019s. This Is not the end this is the beginning of learning. To be frank enough with you this will take a lot and lot of time\u2019s and effort otherwise they are many CEH out there treated as shit. you will pay 500$ for a fucking certificate. Sunil Thakare's answer to Which is the best site to learn hacking? : read this out you will understand if you try\u2019s to. |Abhishek Kumar|: Ask him anything about learning especially on computer filed\u2019s in security kinds of stuff.

Basic Computer Skills It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+. 2. Networking Skills You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following. DHCP NAT Subnetting Difference between IPv4 or IPv6 Public v Private IP DNS Routers and switches VLANs OSI model MAC addressing ARP Many Skill can be acquired in these certificate course like CCIE: Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert & CompTIA Network+ . 3. Linux Skills Nearly all the tools we use as a hacker are developed for Linux and Linux gives us capabilities that we don't have using Windows. Here is the eBook that help you to learn more about Linux: Click Here 4. Wireshark or Tcpdump Wireshark is the most widely used sniffer/protocol analyzer, while tcpdump is a command line sniffer/protocol analyzer. Both are useful in analyzing TCP/IP traffic and attacks. 5. Virtualization You need to become proficient in using one of the virtualization software packages such as VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation. Ideally, you need a safe environment to practice your hacks before you take them out in real world. 6. Security Concepts & Technologies A good hacker understands security concepts and technologies. The hacker must understand such things as PKI (public key infrastructure), SSL (secure sockets layer), IDS (intrusion detection system), firewalls, etc. The beginner hacker can acquire many of these skills in a basic security course such as Security+. 7. Wireless Technologies In order to be able to hack wireless, you must first understand how it works. Things like the encryption algorithms (WEP, WPA, WPA2), the four-way handshake, and WPS. In addition, understanding such as things as the protocol for connection and authentication and the legal constraints on wireless technologies. To get started, check out my guide below on getting started with wireless terms and technologies, then read our collection of Wi-Fi hacking guides for further information on each kind of encryption algorithms and for examples of how each hack works.

            "answer_text": "How To Become A Hacker :- ( For Beginners )  Every person who is attached to the technology and technical websites are aware with the term Hacker. The term applied to the person who uses his computer and laptop to access the unauthorized data. Learn about hacking and trying it is not a crime unless you are doing it in order to get unauthorized access to any data. You can use it for your security as well so that others can\u2019t hack you. If you think hackers only hacks into networks and steal data, then you are wrong in that part. The main motive behind providing hacking courses and its learning to the people, who are interested to become hackers and are ready to tackle with other hackers who are not using their skills nicely. So today I will tell you about 5 hacking skills which will show you how to become hacker. Because if you want to become a pro hacker you need to beat one. So check out these skills below. 5 Skills Required To Become A Pro Hacker 1. Basic Computer and Networking Skills  asic knowledge is the base of any knowledge. If you know about the basic functions of your computer and if you can easily register and set your own networking parameters on your windows, it will definitely help you while you are learning hacking. Every person who wishes to become a hacker will have to understand these networking skills: IPv4, IPv6, DHCP, NAT, Subnetting, DNS, Routers and switches, VLANs, OSI model, Public v Private IP, MAC addressing, ARP. These skills will definitely help them to grow their hacking capability. 2. Linux Skill and Wireshark  Hackers love Linux OS. We can say that Linux is the favourite operating system of hackers. The hacking tools we used on the Linux are specially made and developed for hackers. Linux provides an open source platform and free operating systems for hackers which windows doesn't provide. That\u2019s why hackers use Linux. To know more about Linux, Click on the link below. On the other hand, Wireshark is free software used for educational purpose, network troubleshooting, software and communications protocol development as well as for the analysis. It is actually an open source packet analyzer. 3. Virtualization And Security Concepts  The meaning of virtualization is that you need to make a virtual version to test your hacking skills before go live. You can do this by making a virtual version of the operating system, storage device and server or network resources. If you want to become a pro hacker you have to learn these security concept skills like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Firewalls and so many more. Your strong hold on security will let you control barriers set by security Admin. 4. Wireless Technologies and Scripting  The most popular thing on the hacking is how to hack a wifi. People who wish to hack a wireless network or devices must have to understand all of their functions. For that they need to learn professional encryption algorithm like WPA, WEP, WPA2, WPS and the 4 way handshake. On the other hand Scripting is the most important skill if you need to become a pro hacker. Sometimes hackers use other hackers\u2019 tools to hack something. By doing that, they got dis- rated for using those tools. So you need to make a new tool which you can use to cope with hackers. Security Admin does that when any hacking attempt happens on their server. 5. Database and Web Applications  With the help of big DBMS like Oracle and My SQL. You will able to access or hack databases on the other computers. The Database is the collection of data present on the computer and can accessible with so many ways. Whereas Web Applications is the software which you can use on the internet with your web browser. You will be able to do anything if you will find out the functioning of all the web applications and the database backing them.

            "answer_text": "You don't. Bro, trust me I have experienced both good and shit as a hacker. And the best advice that I can give you, is don't go for shortcuts. I know there are plenty of people out there, some of whom are pro hackers and often more experienced than me, who will say, \u201cfollow these simple steps and become a hacker\u201d or maybe, \u201cthe 10 most important steps to become a hacker\u201d, but I feel by following those you will only achieve a certain amount of success and be limited to that only. It is as they say, \u201cThere is no stairway to heaven\u201d. So I don't think following steps is in the best interest of a novice hacker. Here's what I did as a novice and what I suggest you do. Firstly, LEARN. Always Learn. Learn from your mistakes. Learn from others' mistakes. If you hack into something, learn why that worked or why it didn't work. Learn how to fix it. Learn how to break into it. Absorb as much as you possibly can from the Cyberspace. Secondly, PRACTICE. Keep Practicing. The worst thing you can do is learn a lot then practice none. Sharpening of skills is very important. If you aren't doing that, signs of rust will show in your skills. And that's bad. So practicing is important. Lastly, Be TENACIOUS. In this line of work, you will experience more failure than success. Inevitably so. So take your failures sportingly. Learn from them. And that will make you a better hacker. And so that is all\u2026\u2026If you manage to do these 3 simple but effective steps, you will be a better hacker someday. And also, stop looking for shortcuts. They won't get you anywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning how to code sounds or feel sometime difficult but it's actually fairly very simple, and guess what! the best part is You want to learn, and that is the very basic requirement. Most of the people have a misconception that they have learn a big body before they can do anything, but if you can do some maths, if you can read something well then you are eligible for learn programming. So it's as simple as our daily learning process. Now moving to some important points, What language should I chose?  Doesn't really matter. Choose anything you find interesting. Go for couple language review and start learning. Most of all have quit nice documentation, just go through them. If you already have done some coding on any language then stick to it until you really don't feel or need to move into any other language. If you are a beginner then I would suggest go for Python.  Where to learn? The best part of learning programming is, you'll find a big body of resources over the Internet. So, you can learn it from any where. I would suggest you can start solving competitive program in http://www.codechef.com or http://www.spoj.pl. That is the best way to learn fast. What if I don't find interest in competitive programming? Well, that's not really I big deal, in-fact I don't really know it is or not, :P I never found that much interest in competitive programming either. You can go for application development. Again Internet is the source and you teacher. What just you have to do, you have to stick to the problem you face and you have solve it by anyhow. Never let it go. Few more resources you can practice and learn from : http://www.topcoder.comhttp://www.hackerearth.comhttp://www.hackerrank.comhttp://www.code.orghttp://www.codeproject.comhttp://www.codecademy.comAlso make a good practice to ask question onhttp://www.stackoverflow.com Most important thing is, you have to learn how to learn things by yourself, then only you can be some good programmer.  If I missed out any question that comes up in your mind, please comment me, I'll be replying you.. Happy Coding.. :) ",

However, you can get down to a hacking course and get hacking but it\u2019ll be kind of hard to understand. First, play around with different operating systems (Windows, ios, linux, etc.). Get to know the environments. Play around and learn how the UI works. Then with the help of google (a.k.a the holy grail of everything) get to know the architecture of these operating systems. Hint : linux will be the hardest as it is the most advanced. Turn to the help of online documentations and books. Then, choose where to start. This will be the most crucial step of all. It\u2019ll determine whether you\u2019ll be an elite hacker or a script kiddie. A script kiddie is someone who uses exploitation tools that others have developed and have little, if not any, knowledge about what\u2019s happpening on the inside while the cute, little GUI displays on tye screen.

            "answer_text": "\"Hacking\" is a very broad term. You have to figure out what you like. I'll tell you what I was told when I was starting out. Hacking, at its core, is making things work in ways they weren't intended to function. Before you can do that, you need to learn how things work. Get a Raspberry Pi, learn how to navigate the Linux command line. Spin up a web server. Build a Web application. Connect it to a database. Fuzz it, see what breaks. Fix it so it doesn't break again. Then try to break it a different way. Repeat. Learn a programming language. Learn ALL the programming languages you can. Play with sockets. Learn how applications connect to each other. Learn networking. You'll start to understand how the Internet works. Design your own protocol. Build a client/server application around it. Use a network analyzer to see your protocol over the wire. It's really cool. Throw data at your server. See how it breaks. Fix it so it doesn't break again. Repeat. Learn about cryptography. Implement an algorithm in your program.

Think by yourself, try, try again, try harder, try longer, then try another time. If you fall, stand up and try again. But remember to learn every time you fall. It\u2019s ok to fail, it\u2019s not ok if you give up. Read books/docs/ watch videos about how things works, then go practice what you\u2019v learned and hack those things down. If you don\u2019t understand something, search for information about this particular thing. If you don\u2019t know something, it\u2019s ok, go dig and find what you don\u2019t know. (The more you know, the more you see you don\u2019t know) Don\u2019t fear to break things if it\u2019s for learning. Don\u2019t follow rules and way as they put you in tracks. Tracks make you feel safe, but tracks is blinker when you want to hack something. BTW, if you have difficulties to find something to \u201chack\u201d, usual, first thing you learn in Cyber Security is cracking Wifi or trivial SQL injection, forks bomb and network sniffing (wire-shark). Book you should read : The Hacker Ethic: A Radical Approach to the Philosophy of Business: Pekka Himanen, Manuel Castells, Linus Torvalds: 9780375758782: Amazon.com: Books TLDR: Be free little pony, break thing then fix them. Start by what is under your hands. Think by yourself and ask you questions and try to answers them by yourself. But remember you\u2019r responsible of your choices and acts. If you go black hate, you will have to face your choice and take responsibility for your behaviour. ",

It's a skill that includes the knowledge of reverse engineering the things. And that skill is only attained by practise when you gain enough basic knowledge of how things work. But for starting :- 1.) Learn Programming language - You should know how things you are going to hack are build. So start with C(mother of all languages) then get continue with C++ and then you can choose python as many payloads and exploits are built in python. 2.) Learn Networking : The most important part that teaches you real world hacking. Learn how networks are made and how networking really works. What does HTTP and HTTPS mean ? What is IP address ? 3.) Learn some Computer architecture : This us optional. If you wanna go deep you should have some knowledge of inside CPU world. 4.) Learn Linux : You should learn other OS than windows and specifically Linux because this is the platform where you will end up getting your hands dirty. You must have heard about Kali Linux After you are done with these you can try some tutorials and then you will know what every command means and how things are working behind the scenes. You will be able to modify things and Clear obstacles when stuck somewhere. So go and start from the basics and be the Ghost ! ;) ",

You need to learn python-python3, ruby, perl, HTML, c++, GitHub repository protocol, computer science, Linux and SQL injection. Yup\u2026.it's a big ask. However, dedication is the main quality a hacker must have. Because between learning new languages, understanding concepts and comprehending methodology on how to evade capture while poking around in power plant security interfaces\u2026\u2026..(allegedly!). You're gonna have to dig down and find that dedication! Still wanna learn the basics? Or intermediate? Or advanced even? Use ENKI, it teaches all you need to know ,for free and in an excellent way.

First one needs to realise that there is a market out there for these sorts of jobs. The earlier hackers were academics intent on knowing how a computer and its networks work. So by knowing this one follows the masters, just like above mentioned jobs. Learn how networks work. Learn about your computer and what's happening in the background. Get educated in all of these things. This in turn leads you to get acquinted with the know how. Then you might want to consider either going ethical or criminal. Either way you'll do the same thing. The criminal side just doesn't have to dock up money to get a certificate and most likely will get you arrested.

Its not bypassing the login screen, or gaining unauthorized access to a remote system using some script you found on the internet. It is understanding the in and out the working of a system and then modifying it according to your needs. This is one awesome guide, that helps you understand the basic hacker attitude: How To Become A Hacker. Moreover, to get started, you should start understanding technology in general and how things works, especially if you are into software/web hacking, you should understand what is a server, how does a server works, what were the  vulnerabilities in old servers and how they overcame them. To exploit a new server you must understand vulnerabilities found in old system. How does XSS work etc. Its useless if you just copy paste SQL Injection from the internet, if you don't understand what SQL queries are and how they work. And yes, programming, learn programming/scripting and become expert in one of them. Hope this helps. Happy hacking. ",

So,u should better go to eccouncil website first which I think you have done already first if you not had do it now first get a basic degree of any computer prefer bachler then side by side work on CEH,then every year a new version is available to study (may be Cehv9 is updated right now, I really don't know because I am a hosteler in senior secondary school in India, often get to touch this stuff ) it is also recommend  hacking, taking permission from your authority premises first (for experience only) bcoz \"u should have great skill first before attending great knowledge. \"I hope you would enjoy this creepy hacking world. If you found in one of the IT cyber security hub (I have join for a while it's good in here in Delhi try searching in hyderabad, Google it) it is better to start with them  if anyone found any err then plz reply me in message not in comments section (no one want mess around what other people read) Thank you    ",

You will hack because of 3 reasons:1. You enjoy it2. Money3. Someone forced you To be a hacker , you must have to be too much passionate about it. And you must have the knowledge about the security bug . Beside being , if you develop some sort of it products at this stage , you can said yourself hacker . Learn about new technology and mythology . So, how can you become a hacker? 1. Learn to cheat at everything.2.

            "answer_text": "Hey, Firstly Yes, anyone can become a hacker, they do often come in all types and disciplines. Hacking is first and foremost about understanding how things work. In the hacking game, knowledge and understanding is power and you have a choice, use it for good or malicious purposes (the latter will likely end up behind bars). In the realm of IT Security, you have many favours however most hackers who are gainfully employed, are usually penetration testers or security consultants. All have an advanced background knowledge in technology and are usually the person who becomes the local tech guy. Once you have the basics of how technology works at a detailed level, you can then start looking at ways to make the technology do what is unintended (this is the basis of hacking). My advice is to work upto hacking after you have mastered the basics in networking/programming/pc support. As if you try and jump into the field too quickly you\u2019ll miss the skills that will serve you later on in your infosec career. Certifications like OSCP can help you get a job, but typically outside the US, the CEH certification is not held in high regard by most of the industry. HTH ",

            "answer_text": "This should sound funny but my first attempt of hacking was in a Nintendo Game, I think some Megaman version, in that time I needed to write a hash and later type it on the game, since there was no way to record your game in a memory card, of course there was no encryption so was easy to see the pattern if you are bloody stuck and at the point of freak out with the game.  The thing that I did, was save 3 games just after creating minimal change and see what it's changing in the hash, after few hours I was able to create a hash to have more lives, power ups and etc. That is exactly the same that I do when I want to hack into something, you don't need to know so much but experience help a lot. in few words hacking is the act of find the exceptions to the rules of a system and enjoying playing with it ;) ",

Script kiddes have little or no comprehension of what tools they run, and thus fail most the time. To learn it you have to decide what you want to do and then blaze a path. It takes practice and time and practice and research and time and learning. I find most who seek a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d have no idea what they are asking for and do not really want to learn anything, just have enough to become dangerous (to themselves or others). I would say if you have to ask, you already expressed a laziness that will not help you. There are plenty of resources and finding and using them is your first task. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, be a passionate programmer of any language, build your own set of programs that will replace similar professionally build version you use. For example, develop your own password manager to replace one that you use previously. Compare both versions, find dissimilarities and improve your own program. This way you will learn the basics of programming without stressing much. Participate in \u03b2 program on a regular basis. Find and report errors and try to debug them if you have source code. Try to find loopholes of various softwares. You will enjoy doing that. Then learn another programming language, create a code find dissimilarities between the two languages. After that, have some knowledge of SQL and database to its roots. Its extremely important. Lastly, have the knowledge of networking to its depth. For example - Try knowing the basis of multiplayer networking games that work over internet. You should learn the basics of network architecture. At the time you start enjoying programming and troubleshooting you will become a pro-hacker. The person who loves programming and is interested in finding vulnerabilities but cannot tell when he acquired this knowledge is a hacker. ",

            "answer_text": "While I was watching Mr. Robot, whenever Eliot used to perform an attack I used to pause and carefully note down the methods he was using. This wasn't much difficult  to figure out as I've been in security field for a while now. On seeing this question I decided to google again about 'Hacks made by Eliot in Mr.Robot' and realized a lot has already been written about them. So, here are the details:  DeepSoundIf you\u2019re wondering why someone who\u2019d fry his computer\u2019s memory chip in the microwave would be careless enough to store evidence of people he\u2019s hacked on CD-ROMs disguised as CDs, then Elliot\u2019s one step ahead of you. He usedDeepSound, an audio converter tool, to hide all of the files on everyone he\u2019s hacked\u2014as well as his own old family photos\u2014within WAV and FLAC audio files. And yes, the real files are encrypted and password protected, as we saw in episode 9. DeepSound is a modern example of steganography, the art of concealing information within plain sight. ProtonMailIf you assumed Elliot would run his own server or be an early adopter of Pond , episode 8\u2019s revelation that he has aProtonMail account may have come as a surprise. ProtonMail is a browser-based email service incorporated in Switzerland created by researchers who met at a CERN research facility. (Yes, that CERN: the one where the World Wide Web was born.) \u201cOne of the benefits of ProtonMail is that it\u2019s end-to-end encryption, and it\u2019s in a way that even the owners of ProtonMail can\u2019t see your content, and there\u2019s no IP logging,\u201d says Michael Bazzell, one of the technical advisers on the show. It even lets you set expiration dates for your emails, after which they\u2019ll self-destruct (provided the recipient hasn\u2019t made a copy of them, that is). ProtonMail is free, though there\u2019s a wait list for invitations to create an account. Beta versions of iOS and Android mobile apps were just announced, and it\u2019s possible to jump the queue with a $29 donation. The next batch will be released Thursday. Raspberry PiARaspberry Pi is that tiny and delightfully inexpensive computer that helps you learn programming and build your own digital toys. Turns out, it can also be used to gain remote access to HVAC systems. On the show, Elliot\u2019s plot was to gain access using the Pi and then raise the temperature in Evil Corp\u2019s storage room where tape backups are stored, thus destroying the records of much of the consumer debt in the world. Tastic RFID ThiefFsociety wouldn\u2019t even think of trying to penetrate the most secure facility in the country without a plan for stealing badge information from employees. Luckily, when visiting Steel Mountain, fSociety member Mobley was armed with Bishop Fox\u2019sTastic RFID Thief, a long-range radio frequency identification (RFID) reader that saves your score on a microSD card as a text file so you can clone the badge later. It\u2019s completely portable and fits neatly into a messenger bag or a briefcase. RSA SecurIDTwo-factor authentication can definitely foil your average fraudster\u2019s plans. Like 25,000 actual organizations worldwide, Allsafe, the cybersecurity firm where Elliot works, usesRSA SecurID. RSA SecurID\u2019s two-factor authentication adds a layer of security to a company\u2019s protected resources by requiring users to not only enter their RSA SecurID pin, but a one-time password generated within the app\u2014which lasts only 60 seconds. This is why Elliot needed a multi-faceted plan to get ahold of Gideon\u2019s phone in episode 8. First he texted him large MMS files to try to drain some of his boss\u2019 battery, then he snagged the phone to enter that temporary authentication code at the end of the password with nary a second to spare. He certainly raised suspicion from Gideon with the clever ruse, but at least he got the job done. Kali LinuxKali Linux, BackTrack\u2019s Linux\u2019s successor, is a Debian-based version of Linux that\u2019s specifically built for penetration testing and security auditing and is used in multiple episodes of Mr. Robot. It\u2019s free, open source, and pre-installed with hundreds of pen testing programs, so it\u2019s perfect for cracking Wi-Fi passwords, bypassing anti-virus software, and testing security vulnerabilities on your network. Many of the tools used in Mr. Robot are utilized within Kali. \u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of Kali is that all the tools are built in,\u201d says Bazzell. \u201cIt\u2019s got a distribution system with everything you need.\u201d John the RipperJohn the Ripperis a tool that Elliot used in the second episode of the show to crack Tyrell\u2019s password. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords, but it can crack weak passwords with several thousand (or even several million) attempts per second. John the Ripper is available within the Kali Linux platform. Metasploit and MeterpreterEpisode 6 features Rapid7\u2019s Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is an exploit development and delivery system that allows users to create and execute exploits, typically for penetration testing. It saves hackers time because they don\u2019t have to learn a new tool each time they want to run an exploit. Meterpreteris just one of several hundred payloads that can be used within Metasploit. It resides entirely in memory and writes nothing to disk, but can give an attacker control of their target\u2019s system and parts of the network. It\u2019s often used within Kali Linux on a virtual machine in Windows, or on Windows itself. Social-Engineer ToolkitTrustedSec\u2019s Social-Engineer Toolkit is an open-source pen testing framework designed specifically for simulating social engineering attacks, such as phishing, spear phishing, credential harvesting, and more. Elliot used SMS spoofing from within SET, a module that\u2019s unavailable on the newer versions, but Mr. Robot tech adviser Michael Bazzell said that it\u2019s possible for users to add that package back in within the new version. FlexiSPYThis list would be remiss without the inclusion of a tool used by one of the show\u2019s less sympathetic characters. In the third episode of Mr. Robot, Tyrell Wellick secretly installs mobile monitoring software on a lover\u2019s Android phone. After gaining root privilege by using SuperSU, he installsFlexiSPY, a tool that lets you monitor other people\u2019s device activities with an online portal. FlexiSPY doesn\u2019t recover past data, but can show you anything still stored on their phone\u2019s memory or SIM card, as well as any future. It also hides SuperSU as part of its installation. Sneaky sneaky. Source: This amazing article at Wired. Apart from the above mention methods, Eliot is a master at Social Engineering. The way his social engineering skills are portrayed remind me of Kevin Mitnick. The best hacking being hacking of people!

If you really are into it, then you'll realize that you want to understand penetration. Most people really want to know how to do stuff and then be all up in systems like magic. What you really want to want is to understand what you want to know. (dammit! I lost myself here, what the hell am I saying?!!) In that particular situation I would tell you to go understand networks and get as much practice as possible. that stuff can be quite boring sometimes. then putting into consideration that there is an imminent possibility however minute, that you'll back off from this quest, am lost in a maze. And like that am lost again. I'll just say, you don't want to be like Mr Robot. It's like getting a tattoo when you're drunk, it might seem like a good idea then but not in the morning. Sit on it. ",

            "answer_text": "A common misconception a lot of students take is that hacking is a profession they can just step right into. If you think about this in terms of logic the art of hacking is to break a network, break computer programs and to locate vulnerabilities, however the question is this: How do you expect to break computer programs, computer networks and vulnerabilities efficiently without specializing in the specific technology you choose to break? You can\u2019t, and if you do then I assure you, there\u2019ll be some gaps in your understanding which in turn can cause a weaker outcome. I am not at all saying don\u2019t approach hacking at all. My point is that it is a field which has a lot of pre-requisite requirements. Meaning you need to know the fundamentals of networks, programming and overall exploits before you really decide to go beyond the surface. My advice: Study networks and adapt computer programming on top of this. Ensure you are fully skilled in at least one skill-set of the two and from that point you can choose to delve into the overall security of either of the topics. Overall you will inter-connect between the two. Computer networks and programming are coming closer than ever which again is going to invoke a change in the approach of attack in terms of a hacking perspective and also change the point of networking fundamentals for engineers. The real way of becoming a hacker is to start from the ground up and becoming an expert in your chosen field before deciding to specialize in the aspect of security. This way you will have a much more concrete understanding of your security practices and you will also be able to work a lot more efficiently. This is just my opinion and not at all an industry fact document. There are a lot more people who think differently to my approach, take the one which you see best and stick to it. No one person is the same in technology, we all have our natural areas of expertise and areas we wish to develop. Good luck to you! ",

On top of that, I think they have this need to solve puzzles and I think they also have a need to think outside the box (I hate to use that clich\u00e9 but it\u2019s really true). They will say, \u201cOkay, great, on my TV in my hotel room I can order food or a TV show.\u201d Well that\u2019s a networked computer. So then they ask, \u201cWhat else can I do with it? How does it work?\u201d Anybody who likes to see how things tick, like your little nephew or niece taking apart electronics, that\u2019s the mindset of a hacker.  The main character in Blackhat, Nicholas Hathaway, has a backstory that is very analogous to this. You follow the character throughout the movie and tell that he\u2019s engaged by the pursuit and the game. The game is what gives him his energy and is his reason for being. ",

Just keep on learning different hacking tools (BEEF , packet tracer , social engineering tools and may more ) After knowing how to use these tools , now you need live experiences , hacking down a website , and slowly you will mould yourself into an exceptionally good hacker .

            "answer_text": "All of it. OK being facetious. The term hacker means a person who is an enthusiast of technology. So being an enthusiast doesn\u2019t take any time. Just pick up magazines or read articles on the stuff you like. If you mean something like being an \u201cethical hacker\u201d or security specialist, or penetration specialist, then those would take some specific skills. The best start is a good base and that would be an associates in CIS (Computer Information Systems) or CS (Computer Science). Take on jobs with increasing responsibility until you are managing networks. Then there are multiple paths a person can go down. One would be becoming a CISSP, but this requires a lot of work and the credentials take a while to get. Other jobs would be working on firewalls like a Network engineer. Getting a security + certification would get a person down the security road and getting to know penetration testing software like nessus and also understanding a lot of different software on a computer and how it interacts with a network. Get to know the Well Known Ports (1\u20131024) If you want to become a \u201chacker\u201d in the sense of breaking the law, that would be outside of the scope here and I\u2019m not going to lead anyone down that road.

Learn how to be flexiable with your technology. Here are a few things to do to help you: Google \"computer science basics\" or \"computer science beginners\". Read some articles. Take this online course https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101 it's a great start and also it's from Stanford so you can show off ;)Learn a programming language. Well to be honest hackers don't really need to know how to program but it's a great thing to know. Learn about basic vulnerabilities. Read about Web site code injection, XSS, SQL injection... Learn about software exploits. Literially just google \"software exploits\", it should pop up with some stuff. Do what you want to do now. You either continue digging into the topic or you leave it as you realize it's hard and programming is more fun. :D  Hope that helps. ",

Curiosity drives a hacker to get better and better at what s/he does, playing and experimenting with the information that is provided, finding out new ways to deal with the problem, thereby, creating new puzzles to be looked into; curiosity and 'learning by doing' are the essentials to becoming a hacker in whichever field you wish to choose.

So, let\u2019s first assume software development and hacking are different mindsets, and have different drives, which is better strategy to understand the differences in details. when i jumped into my first couple of hacks, i just want to know how games work, why they work this way, what the creators fear, and how to let my character has hidden skills and bosses abilities, so i can share to my grammar school mates, tho nobody really cares that much. the drives in hacking are about curiosity. when hackers build tools or debug, they just want to solve some missions and forfill their curiosity, tho sometimes we made money, credit, or game resources from that. the mindsets of hackers tend to be details and strategy oriented. (myself and some friends) on the other hand, software development requires drives of success demanding, and users clustering. the joy comes from the feelign when they learn so many users of their masterpieces. they have users on their minds when they write codes, tho sometimes the scope of users only include themselves and few friends, or the girl they love secretly. they do debug but usually they are not fans of debugging. they don\u2019t like the feeling of so-called digging for nothing, but they enjoy their masterpieces. the mindsets of developers tend to be goal driven and big picture oriented.

A person who is curious and likes to improve things. Thinks about ways to connect, build and make things better.  With that said you can already see if you have what it takes to become a hacker. Now you just need to choose what do you want to hack. Once you have that figured out, go out there and learn everything you can about that.  So for example if you wanted to become a mobile network hacker, you'd first have to learn everything about mobile networks. Ideally you want to understand the way hardware and software interacts, and you want to be comfortable in programming languages used in this field. In no less than a couple of years you can start hacking.  Needless to say, it takes a long time, a lot of determination and hard work. You can't hack things you don't understand and you have no other way about it but to learn it. You are looking at countless hours of reading, exercise and trial and error.  The good news is that nowadays you can learn many things by yourself and for free online. ",

Instead of trying to find someone who will give you a path that looks like this;ask the question --> follow the advice --> become a hackerSpend your time taking code apart. All a hacker is, is someone who can dissemble code, understand its behaviour and alter that behaviour to a given end.Do remember though that any attempt to alter someone's code without their permission or access data without the right to do so is highly illegal, just don't do it. Even the greatest hackers get caught, a novice has virtually no hope of escaping detection.This creates an interesting dichotomy, you can study abondonware (for example) or open source code (check the license, yes open source can have caveats too) then what you are learning is old hat, not very good, not very secure (by its nature) and so on. But to be great you need to understand the very code it is illegal to access.The answer? Become an ethical hacker or work for the government or work for Kaspersky (or similar). Good luck, it's a minefield (which is why I am a programmer and not a hacker). ",

In the title of this article, I mention hacking like a pro. This can not be accomplished after reading one article and visiting a few of these sites \u2013 the phrase is used to imply that in time and with lots of practice, you can in fact learn to hack like a pro.For our many readers that are already at that expert-hacker level, a few of these sites may not be for you. They may feel to simple and basic \u2013 for \u201cscript-kiddies\u201d as some might say. The truth is, we all had to start somewhere, and these websites are offered as a starting point for those people just embarking down the wrote toward hackerdom.Your intention for learning how to hack is completely your own. I do not judge. However, it should be noted that there are two forms of hacking \u2013 \u201cwhite hat\u201d and \u201cblack hat\u201d. White hat hackers call themselves \u201cethical hackers\u201d, in that they find vulnerabilities simply to make systems and applications more secure for everyone. However, there\u2019s a whole other community of hackers \u2013 the black hats \u2013 who find vulnerabilities only to exploit them as much as possible. Now that you know what sort of community you may be entering, let\u2019s get on with the list of top sites where you can learn to hack.

(Whats Hacking?, Different Types of Hacking, etc) 2) Go to Google and Type \u201cHackforums\u201d , Click the First Results. (100+ guides are there for Begginers , Both Basic and Advanced) 3) Dont go for Certified Courses Unless You want a Job in that Field. The Best Hackers are Self Taught. They dont Take Courses. These Courses are Not Updated and The Lessons there are 80% From Basic Hacking Guides. 4) Make Friends, Join a Hacking Group (Many Beginner Groups are there in Forums ). They Help Each Other and Learn Stuff. (Dont Ever Pay For Anything ) 5) When you are deep Enough , You will get access to some forums, websites, chat rooms which cant be accessed via Normal Means. Kinda Dark-Web Content (Always Use Proxies When Accessing Those) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- So, Yea.

On the other hand most people who are considered \u201chackers\u201d nowadays just use methods like social engineering and phishing techniques to steal people\u2019s information. So I guess it depends on if your ultimate goal is to pursue knowledge in the field of computer science and do things like penetration testing, or if you just want to learn enough to be able to carry out cybercrimes.

Make a full backup and recovery disc before hand in case you get stuck. Once you've gotten through that, set up some virtual machines and try to exploit or run code from one virtual machine to another that doesn't have the proper credentials to access the prior. Put all your virtual machines on a private virtual network switch so you don't accidentally hack your physical machine (or worse the network it's on.) A different type of hacking you can try out is to create a password protected rar file and crack it with John the ripper. Get really good with one or two tools first, then when you hit the limit of what they can do for you, add one or two more to your bag of tricks. Happy hunting! ",

EVER .Proceed with caution. and reasearch a book just a bit prior, especially where matters of privacy are concerned. Well, it long story.

Preferably more than one(Python, c etc..), you can learn a lot by comparing two languages and look for similarities and differences in the way they handle a situation. But programming is more than writing code.Learn to run an operating system. The Hacker community is much Unix/Linux oriented these days. There are several reasons, an important one being that with open-source. Unixes you get the code as well. You can actually read how the operating system is written, you can get to know it well enough to modify if you want to.Unix / Linux is also very network/internet oriented, learning to understand Unix / Linux will help for the next skill you\u2019ll need to acquire. And it comes with free programming tools.Learn about data communication and networks",

It is not enough to have isolated computers systems; they need to be networked to facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to the outside world and hacking. Hacking means using computers to commit fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy invasion, stealing corporate/personal data, etc. Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of dollars every year.

Networks security (defending servers, domains, and network attacks)3. Database Security (Defending databases against attacks, database attacks) They teach you how to defend by teaching you how to hack. Once you complete these classes you should also receive two security certifications from the NSA identifying you as an expert in 1 and 2 above.  I'm sure other schools have similar opportunities.

It will take you 6 months - 3 years depending on your IQ and dedication)After this read about linux kernel from a book by robert love.After this read about computer architecture, it will give you an idea and understanding about the basic hardware design of computers, it will come very handy incase you need to guess what sort of code or algorithm one might use for a particular configuration.Finally, read about computer networking, it will tell you how computers communicate with each others.The better you understand all the concepts in the books above, the you will get at hacking.Happy Hacking.",

To be considered a pretty good hacker one must dedicate 7\u201310 years of study in a variety of technologies like OS command lines, networking, scripting, security concepts and much more. Programming is one thing, but to make a system act in a way it wasn\u2019t meant to is a whole other level. You need to understand how it all works and then some. Even with all this you won\u2019t be perfect, you can never be. But you can get to a point where most things are easy to hack for you but again that\u2019ll take just short of a decade at least. ",

Gone are those good days of low security, when servers, WiFi routers and other network equipment has no password by default and people responsible for them were happy to use them as such. What most of the so called hackers do is take advantage of other people's carelessness. Some more advanced forms make use of social engineering, phishing, vishing or simply guessing passwords. Still it's not hacking. You can definitely learn this kind of puesdo hacking. If you want to take it a notch higher, you can use readymade tools written by experts. You would still be called a \u201cscript kiddie\u201d in hacker community. Now a days default level of security is very high and real hacking is a serious business. It takes deep knowledge of operating systems, networking protocols, networking equipment and a high level of ingenuity to find expoits in a system. In short it's not easy. Now coming to your question, whether you can learn hacking, That depends on your knowledge and dedication (and hacker mindset, ability to take risks and above all, average intelligence level if you want to get into serous hacking) ",

Unless you have an IQ of 200+ and can read 500 pages of dense text books in under 5 minutes (because you'll need several dozen of them just for a semblance of the nececssary knowledge), I don't see even an inkling of a possibility of what you're asking for. Don't get me wrong.  Becoming a hacker is attainable, but you should think of it like getting a PhD.  If you want to be good, it's going to take a lot of work and a long time. There are rarely shortcuts to being awesome at anything, and this is no exception. ",

Taking this as a career is good but it won't be successful if you don't enjoy it.  The very first step will be experimenting and exploring more about network. As you will be working with networks most of the time. O you need to know the networking and how the networks work.  Then the next step will be having knowledge about at least one programming language just to understand the meaning of the codes not to write the codes. If you plan to develop tools then you need strength in coding. Next go for various concepts like brute forcing, forging, DDOS, etc. Get the proper knowledge about these. Then try implementing these concepts one by one by using pre developed tools. Get some hands on experience and then join good institute to learn more about hacking and getting certified. ",

When i say basics , start with computer networks, network ports, firewalls, common network protocols like IP address, HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP etc. along with how each of those stuffs work.Learn about the different networking available -LAN, WAN etc. The stronger grip you have in theses the better understand you will have in how data is transmitter in terms of packets and bits etc. Then start learning about different operating systems(Linux etc.) , how they functions on a network, how each operating system responds to same operating system/different operating system. Then learn about the various programming languages. Start using Linux and software programs about hacking , such as penetration tools , slowly start writing codes and study various codes for better understanding. ",

Try  to learn about linux its most important as you go more deeper into it you will find the use of linux . KALI Linux is made for hacking ,its loaded with all kinds of hacking stuff. And while searching on google try to be more specific like :- If you want to know about Wifi hacking , search for wifi hacking through aircrack -ng(these are the tools in kali linux). And lastly try to learn or know about the stuff you dealing with , dont just try everything you see in the \"youtube tutorials\".DO a thorough research over it . Thats all , I hope you understand this is not  everything about hacking , this will just help you start .  ",

Look up recent vulnerabilities, build the demonstration exploits, and try them on your own computers before and after patching them. Set up a LAMP system and write an SQL injection and XSS attack - play both sides, do the attacks, examine the logs, see if you can figure out what happened and how to prevent it. Look for the shellshock attempts in your webserver logs, look for the dictionary attacks, try some yourself. ",

Therefore, one could simply learn some basic SQL or JavaScript and exploit numerous unprotected websites with common methods. If one would like to target a more significant objective, good luck. First learn common website languages, at least to a basic extent. Then, research how people protect against hackers. Look for gaps in these methods (hint: old browsers do not abide by security rules that may be defined in their code). The last thing I would like to say is that hacking scam sites is fine, but attacking something made from hard work (even if it lacks quality) for a good purpose is simply cruel. I would hate to have my work ruined because of a browser\u2019s issues or an unpatchable security bug. Don\u2019t do that. ",

If you have all these things with you then you can start in this field. Now Ethical hacking/Cyber security/Information Security is mainly have these major parts. 1-Web Application Penetration Testing and Security. 2-Network Penetration Testing and Security. 3-Android Penetration Testing and Security . A lot of another fields are also there but these are the major domain for Startup. As per my experience if you want to go with Web Application Penetration Testing and Security then start learning HTML/Javascript/PHP or any other scripting language.Apart from this start learning OWASP and start Bug Hunting. From this you will get an experience about working on live projects and to earn money and Fame also. Source :   How to learn hacking from scratch ?

And then comes the black hat hackers, who try to steal your personal infomation and data, and ask for money in exchange for not using them to harm you. If someone wants to hack, he will probably read a book or join an online forum. He should learn how do systems work, the different types of systems, and most of all, how to write the code that enters the security systems. For the first few times, a hacker will find the code and copy-paste it. However, if he keeps on trying and training, he will automatically find gaps and exploit them. This is called experience by training. ",

For example, you need to have an understanding about Computer Networks, Database Management to actually understand what is happening and how you are trying to get into a system. There are a lot of good websites and courses available, but self reading and a lot of practice are the best ways to learn about hacking. So, I'd suggest you to look into the subjects that are needed to implement your hack. For example : to understand SQLinjection (which is almost obsolete), you'd need to have some knowledge in database querying.

Silently breaking into computers and phone systems with the assistance of devious tricks have come back to symbolize hacking in fashionable cultures and communities. But, these popular cultures are way more difficult and moralistic than most people recognize. Here are some things you should know : 1. Run on OS which is similar to UNIX, like Linux 2. Learn HTML 3. Gain the knowledge of Programming 4. Be a Creative Thinker 5. Make a habit of Solving Problems 6. Absorb Fight Authority 7. Be Competent 8. Start Writing Open Source Software 9. Promote Valuable Information 10. Helps in keeping the Organization Working If you want to become Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH) then i can suggest that you can join ISOEH (Indian School Of Ethical Hacking) training program because they are one of the trusted ethical hacking program in the industry. ISOEH trains around 1200 students per year, ranging from college freshers to law enforcement (police, CID, lawyers, Commercial Tax dept, CRPF, etc); to MNC (pwc, CTS, TCS, Google, Intel, Apple, etc).

It about finding answers where other can see none. It's about making your own answers sometimes. So, if you cannot find the answer for this question, I don't think you can become a hacker. ",

Take things apart, modify them, find out how they work, put them back together and all the things you mentioned in the question. Lots of practice makes experts.

But to be a real hacker: First you can learn the languages properly. That will be much helpful in later stages.Try to learn the concepts of how protocols works such as tcp, http, ftp and also the architecture of systems. That will give you greater understanding of where the flaw might be there in the system.  If you do all this and with lot of perseverance and patience to learn new concepts, you will be one of the ethical hacker soon. This is my first answer in quora,so kindly bear with me for any mistakes. ",

But before going for that I would recommend to get basics or master yourself in basics of networking and network security. For that you have many online websites and you-tube channels who provide this information. e.g. #TheHackerzWorld (youtube channel). There are few of the key points to focus if you are going to enter in the hacking field: 1. Basic understanding of Network 2. What is OS and how it works (different kind of OS). 3. OSI Model 4. Social Engineering (most effective tool). 5. Kali Linux (OS used for Hacking). After you excel youself in these areas, you can be part of Hacking world to initiate with. There are lots of thing which is required to focus on and which i cant explain over here. Hence recommend to go to youtube channel and subscribe. Stay in touch to get more information about it.

Download some simple code, look at what functionality is not available in that piece of code and try to hack it out. Hacking is about making software programs do exactly what you want (by usually setting up a \"back door\"). It can take any form! Once you are comfortable with these things, you can move on to bigger and more complicated things. ",

Then, move on to an operating system named as Kali Linux. I am currently using it, and can say that in the field of hacking, it is the best, I literally mean the best operating system ever. It has loads of tools pre-installed, to help you out. For example\u2192 metasploit. Now, if you are used to it, then you must try learning programming languages. Start with C or C++, as they are comparatively easy, then move on to Java. And finally to Python, which is the most advanced, and awesome language, but extremely tough on the other hand.

Then I just became curious about computer security and I got sucked into this hobby known as \u201chacking\u201d. I went on forums and learned about exploiting vulnerabilites, I watched tutorials, read articles but the best way to learn how it works is to take a look at the source code. I always do that and when I don\u2019t get something I search it on duckduckgo. I prefer to use duckduckgo as it is anonymous but there are somethings (Google DORKS) that only google can do. ",

It has to be your passion and self motivating force driving you to constantly study the newest and oldest technology principles because they change every day and stuff from 10 years ago is still relevant in certain context.. So you need to know it all, plus the stuff that's being developed tomorrow, and better than the guy who developed it. Now do you really think someone else can tell you how to know these things? ",

But if you do have it - if you\u2019re for example doing white hat hacking, then you should ideally know something about how the computer works, programming, ideally some low level language, how the CPU works, etc. But again that then depends, because you can also just be a script kiddie.

You should have knowledge of database management system like MySQL, Oracle, mariadb, mongodb etc.You should be good at programing.It's upto you whether you want to use existing tools or make your own. I find python good for making tools. You can learn network programing using python. There are modules in python namely scapy and twisted by which you can make your own powerful tools. You have to learn a lot on your own by hit and trial method.The most important thing for learning hacking is dedication. ",
