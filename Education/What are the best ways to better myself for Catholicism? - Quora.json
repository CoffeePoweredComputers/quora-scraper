            "answer_text": "If you grew up as a Catholic all your life, then you probably were just going with the flow but never had a true conversion process. It is about time you consider if the Catholic faith is for you or not. You see, nominal Catholicism does not work. I was one myself before I discovered my new life in Jesus. I was born a Catholic and raised as a Catholic, but my life was very self-centred and selfish - it was all about me. I was just flowing along because I was brought up as a Catholic but when I was 17, I had a genuine conversion process. I heard Jesus knocking at the door of my heart and I said yes. I repented of my sins and asked Jesus to be my Lord. Then, I understood better why I go to church and pray. I used to read the Bible but it did not make sense; but once I said my yes to Jesus, the Bible became a personal love letter from God to me. The sacraments became real and richer. It was no longer a chore to do, but a life-giving source of strength for daily living. My desire and ultimate goal in life now are to follow Jesus with all of my life for the rest of my life. If you are a Catholic by \u201cinertia\u201d all your life, you can do better. Repent and seek God with all your heart. Be truly sorry for your sins. Accept Jesus as your true Lord and Saviour, not just by your mouth but in your heart. Live in the power of the Holy Spirit. Start reading the Bible. Pray daily. Join a group that can help you grow in your faith better, like prayer groups or Bible Study groups or something similar. Look for friends who will support your new faith in God. Don\u2019t just be a Sunday Catholic; be a 24/7 Catholic whether you are at school, at work, at play, or at church. Some people think that being a good Catholic means going to mass on Sundays, praying the rosary, doing pious works, receiving sacraments, and all the rest of the things Catholics do. But I think all of these, while good by themselves, are missing the vital point. They are not the main points of Catholicism. The challenge I see with many Catholics is that they live out their faith externally or intellectually but there is a lack of genuine conversion. It does not involve one\u2019s heart. They do things out of duty or routine but their hearts are far from God. As a Catholic, I think that a relationship with Jesus is the heart of true Catholicism [and also the wider Christianity]. Everything else we do should revolve around that relationship. We need more Catholics not just to accept the religion they grew up with, but embrace the call of Jesus to follow Him. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to the library and research the issue of \u201cSalvation by Faith Alone\u201d. The Catholic church teaches that in addition to Christ\u2019s sacrifice on Calvary each person must earn his way to salvation by good works, penance and historically, time spent in purgatory. Luther discovered that this teaching contradicts what the bible teaches in many places. The bible tells us that nothing we do or suffer could ever remove the slightest iota of the burden of our sin before God. The only thing that can remove sin before God, is Christ\u2019s sacrifice on Calvary, and we can receive the benefit of that from Christ, if on the day of our judgement He concludes that we bore Him true faith in this life. Our good works are according to scripture, the fruit of our faith, not the purchase price of our salvation. If we have true faith we will want to do, the things which God has commanded us to do, and through God\u2019s free grace we will find salvation, by Faith Alone. ",
