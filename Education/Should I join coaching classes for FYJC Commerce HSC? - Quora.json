            "answer_text": "It depends upon various factors. Distance between your house and your collegeFarther you live, more difficult it gets to manage timeThe college you are inIf you are in a college where teachers teach like they taught you in school without rushing through the portion, coaching classes for FYJC can be ignored.Your previous study patternDid you score 85.2% on your own or after joining coaching classes? If you studied on your own, you can continue doing so at least for FYJC.Teachers are going to rush through the portion because colleges are going to begin in August. They'll just have a few months to complete the entire syllabus because of the numerous holidays. Also, if you join classes where there are 75\u2013100 students in a batch, it is not going to be any different from college, so you might as well not join a coaching class like this. Personally, I feel you can join classes for Accounts and Mathematics as what you learn in FYJC will be essential for HSC and you should join a class where there are at max. 20\u201330 students in a batch.

As per my experience do not take classes for Economics (if you're weak then take classes)Organisation of commerce and Management (OC)Also it depends upon your interests in these subjects.Don't just run after coaching classes even if they make you feel that you know nothing (not all do that ). Select classes wisely. All the best. ",
