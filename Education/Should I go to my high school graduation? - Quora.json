            "answer_text": "It depends mostly on your opinion and your circumstance at home. In my case, I didn\u2019t go mostly because it wasn\u2019t important to me and when I left that school on the last day I was required to be there, I didn\u2019t want to go back. I think its all overhyped anyways, you sit for a maximum of 4 hours and hear all the administrators boast about how proud and great they are and hear all the Academically inclined (valedictorians) speak about how great school was for them and how connected they felt with the administrators and worked like a team. Went to my brothers graduation in 2016 was the biggest snooze fest of my life and I actually fell asleep, the only highlight was me and him getting trashed together that night. Also In my family graduating High school isn\u2019t such an amazing feat, its what you do afterwards and make a name for yourself that deserves praise. My family wanted me to go but after seeing how boring a graduation ceremony was, I wasn\u2019t going to make my family sit through that crap and I didn\u2019t want to sit through it either. Some say Its an opportunity to say your last goodbyes and that\u2019s true, do i regret that? a little bit. Some say you should do it for your family, and that depends on how high of a regard you have for them and how important it is for them. Its really just subjective on how you view the matter. If you don\u2019t want to go then don\u2019t, if you feel compelled to do so, then do it. whatever your reasons are for going or not, just make sure whatever reason you do go or don\u2019t go, That the reason is a pretty meaningful one and something you won\u2019t regret spending your time on.

            "answer_text": "There are really two questions here, so I will answer both of them. The first is: Will my school require me to go to my graduation. The answer to this is a resounding \u201cNo\u201d. No school I have ever attended or taught at required student attendance. Graduation is generally considered to be \u201cextracurricular\u201d or outside of school hours. Schools understand that you may already be in university, on a trip, moving, or working during graduation. It is no more a required activity than prom is. Which leads us to the second question: Am I, personally, required to go. The answer to that one is\u2026 \u201cmaybe\u201d? We never go to graduations for ourselves, we generally do it for our parents and family. If you are the first person to graduate high school in your family, they will absolutely insist on your attendance. If your parents have been walking around humming \u201cpomp and circumstance\u201d for the past month, suck it up you are going! Graduation is one of those things we do for others, not for ourselves. It is the opportunity for your family to celebrate your success and transition to adulthood. Graduation is not for you. If it were, no one would attend their graduations. Discuss with your family if you can skip your graduation. I tried to skip my high school graduation, but I was not allowed. You graduation ceremony will generally only take 4 hours, and it is usually followed by a party or dinner with your family. If your family wants this, give it to them. It will be a wonderful memory in the future and it will demonstrate you are capable of doing things for others as an adult. Good luck, and enjoy your graduation in whatever form it takes. ",
