            "answer_text": "It's not cheap and it can encourage people to study more for pleasure rather than for something society needs and will therefore provide a large income, something that they would take into account of they had to pay off student loans.  On the other hand though it allows huge portions of society to become highly productive members of society that might otherwise have amounted to little. My mother and her sisters became psychologists and doctors for free here in Australia, indeed the Commonwealth paid them a student stipend to support then while they studied. They all became tax payers and payed of their cost to society many times over not to mention their non financial contribution to society.  Today there are uni fees but you get a government loan for it and you only have to pay it back in instalments of you earn more than 50k a year and you can get 400 a fortnight student Allowance if your parents aren't too wealthy (plus you can earn 10k at a job before they start cutting it). It's not an ideal system but it means that no matter the situation you start from if your willing to work hard and live poor you can go as far as your talent will take you. I attend a top University and I know that in many countries I could never do that given my family financial situation and many who ate much worse off have similar stories. I think they should offer a third of University places for free to top students who have to maintain some level of performance.   There is so much talent that goes to waste when you make education so expensive. There is a whole generation of lawyers, doctors, engineers and scientists who got their education free in Australia and they have been the most productive and prosperous generation in our history. ",

            "answer_text": "The problems if you can call them problems started in the 60\"s  The US got the shit scared out of its educational system with Sputnik in 57.  Land grant colleges like Cal were cheap to free if you poor and bright.  A Community college building boom was started we needed to catch up with the Russian. Education creates Liberals or a least that's what they called the free speech movement and this county was turning conservative. ",
