            "answer_text": "This is a fine-tuning consideration here, but I assume that this is what you\u2019re asking for. Here are the differences as they appear to me \u2014 I\u2019m not saying this is definitive for all English speakers universally. \u201cI am an English teacher\u201d = This is a more typical phrasing and one that an average person might expect if they ask a person who teaches English what it is they do for a living. For example, a conversation might go like this:Bob: So, I\u2019m a programmer at Intel. What is it that you do?English teacher: I\u2019m an English teacher at a local high school.\u201cI am a teacher of English.\u201d This sounds a little foreign or stilted to my ears and somewhat wordy. There\u2019s a distance that\u2019s created between you and your job that doesn\u2019t exist in sentence #1, and if I heard that, I might assume that the speaker either speaks English as a foreign language, teaches English at a department of defense school overseas, or teaches English as a second language. In the second sentence, at least to me, the focus or stress is more on the language itself rather than on the literature or genres within English letters.Hope that helps.",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI am an English teacher\u201d can have two meanings: \u201cI teach subjects related to the English language\u2014English literature, English grammar, and so on.\u201d This is the most common interpretation.\u201cI am a teacher from England. I may teach any subject; \u2018English teacher\u2019 refers to my origin.\u201d This is a far less common interpretation, but that\u2019s what it could mean.\u201cI am a teacher of English\u201d would unambiguously mean that the person teaches subjects related to the English language. However, as others have noted, that\u2019s a very formal, unnatural way to express the thought. A much better way would be to say: \u201cI teach English.\u201d ",
