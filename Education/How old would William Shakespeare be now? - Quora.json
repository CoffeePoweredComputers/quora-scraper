            "answer_text": "Well, since he was born sometime in late April of 1564, he will be 455 years old in early May of 2019. Huh? How? Simple. In his day, England was on the Julian calendar. They didn't switch to Gregorian until the 18th century. What was his April 23 would be our May 3. So he'll be 455 in May. Happy birthday, Will. ",

            "answer_text": "The earl of Oxford was officially born about 1552. But that was proved to be a forgery in the parish books. But he was most likely the child of the 14 year old Elizabeth who was raped by her Stepfather (the former Queen Katherin Parr\u2019s husband) in 1550 while living in the Queen dowagers household. The child was given to the 16th Earl of Oxford who was in danger of treason\u2026so he took the child to hush up the scandal\u2026and his wife never accepted the child\u2026.because of this\u2026and both were eventually poisoned by the Earl of leister. And it gets more complicated even after this. Its all recorded in the Epic poem of Venus and Adonis\u2026.also under the pen name \u201cShake-spear\u201d. Yep with a hyphen\u2026on purpose\u20265 times\u2026because it was a fake name And the story of the dark lady (the Queen his mother) is recorded in the Sonnets also. ",
