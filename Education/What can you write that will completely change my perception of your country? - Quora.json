Here\u2019s a better representative of us: 1.- I AM AN AMERICAN I am a Christian and I am a Jew,I am a Baptist, a Muslim and even a Hindu.I'm from Atlanta, San Diego, New York and Maine,Along with any other State in America that you can name I'm White, Black, Yellow, Red and sometimes even Tan,I'm a toddler, a child, a woman and also a man.I have relatives all over Europe, Africa, China and Japan,As well as in Russia, Vietnam, Australia and Pakistan When they raise the flag, fly the red, white and blue,I stand up proudly\u2014just exactly like you. On 9-11, in 2001, a disaster befell us all,And when the President made his patriotic callI answered him just like any other man,Because I realized that only united can we stand. Realizing that not everyone in this world is like you and me,Because even with government we sometimes may not agreeWe still have the constitutional rightTo take to the streets and protest with numbers, power and might. I am gay or straight and even though you may not agree ,You must agree that I have the right to be.In America we have the right to protest and raise our voicesWe don't accept the status quo when there are better choices We are tired of Wall Street and being ruled by the BanksWe are ready for change and human rights for the workers, thanksNow I see you know me, you know who I am,Yes, that's right, I am you and you are me, I am an American.
