            "answer_text": "The best way to help your kids in school is to help them have a taste of success. And, well, they\u2019ll want more. It\u2019s a bit of a con job, but it works. Here\u2019s how . . . Eventually, every kid will learn to multiply. It usually happens late in second grade. They will also learn about \u201copposites.\u201d That\u2019s basic kindergarten curriculum. In fourth grade, most school districts teach centrifugal force. In middle school, kids will learn how to bisect an angle with a compass and a straight edge. Your school district should be able to tell you exactly what they teach and when. So here\u2019s what you do. Not the week before. Not the semester before. But YEARS before, go ahead and teach a few of these concepts to your kids. Make it a game! Do you know a three year old? Ask them \u201cWhat\u2019s the opposite of up?\u201d They won\u2019t know. Tell them with great sincerity, \u201cThe opposite of up is down!\u201d Then ask them, \u201cWhat is the opposite of cold?\u201d They won\u2019t know. Tell them the \u201cThe opposite of cold is hot!\u201d Do the same with big/little, loud/quiet, slow/fast, closed/open, nice/mean, clean/dirty, yes/no, off/on, etc. Use your best vocal expressiveness, use your hands, look in their face, mime the answer as you say it. After four or five examples, suddenly their little face lights up and they understand! It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s a rush for them and for you. In a couple years, when the kindergarten teacher starts teaching \u201copposites,\u201d your kid is going to be top of the class. Suddenly, they will be earmarked as a bright student worthy of special attention the rest of their school career. This is strategic parenting. Going into kindergarten all the moms have already made sure their kids know colors, ABCs, and two plus two. But only your kid will know \u201copposites.\u201d The best part is that you taught them! Do the same with multiplication when your kid is in first grade. But don\u2019t ask, \u201cWhat is five times two?\u201d That sounds confusing. That\u2019s work. Instead, ask \u201cWhat is five, two times?\u201d Use your hands as demonstration. Then ask, \u201cWhat is four, two times?\u201d Then ask, \u201cWhat is four, three times!\u201d A sharp first grader (your kid) will get it. Be warned, you\u2019ve turned learning into a game and they may never want to stop. That\u2019s when you know you have put them way ahead of the curve. One more example. On the next nice day, invite your second grader out to your driveway to wash your car. Ask them if they think you can hold the bucket of water upside down over your head without spilling it. They will laugh and say \u201cNo way, daddy!\u201d Then spin that bucket over your head without losing a drop. They\u2019ll be amazed, and you will have demonstrated centrifugal and centripetal force. (Look it up, if you don\u2019t remember.) You can see how this concept is a bit sneaky. Your kid may or may not actually be any smarter than the other kids. Still, everyone in that classroom \u2014 including the teachers \u2014 has new heightened expectations for your child\u2019s performance. Funny thing about expectations. They tend to come true.

            "answer_text": "Depending on their age, read to them. My father used to read parts of \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d to me even when I was a young teen. He used to read a bedtime story that HE enjoyed, usually classics. Let your children see you reading all sorts of things from the newspaper to non-fiction magazines such as Time of Scientific American. If your family sees or does something interesting, help them look it up and learn more about it, BUT don\u2019t make it a forced march. I used to have friends whose parents just about killed learning joy by forcing it too much. Go to the library and borrow a book or two that is just resting in the family room for all to see/read bit of. Do this before/and after a trip to the beach. Get a do-it-yourself book and follow it through a task. Always have a book on the go and read it when waiting for an appointment. Depending on the age, ask for help when balancing a check book or checking a credit card. Get them to help you with the math. Watch Animal Planet type shows and talk about it. Discuss what was your most or least favorite and why. The main idea is to make sure your children have a good model in you. Talk to them about feelings and emotions. Try to not be judgmental. ",

Tell him if something ever bothers him st school he must tell you the same day, aswell as the teacher. Some kids keep it bottled in which is allways a sad case. You can keep him happy and healthy. Allways talk with your mouth and not your hands. Read to him. It's allso good for children/adults to listen to some music sometimes, if not each day. I prefear music to television. It's more relaxing. It keeps your mind calm. I like reggae and my daughter likes it too. I've played it each day since i had her. She's 25 years old this month. I'd play it before i had her aswell. Musics good for your soul. No need to play it loud. You could keep the volume medium or less.\u2714 At home you could improve his maths by giving him a few sums, could be once a week. You could allso improve his literature by asking him to write a bout his day at school, or if he goes on a school trip. Boost his memory.\u2714 Like i said once a week. No need to each day. All The Best. \ud83d\ude01 ",

I don't have to help my kids in school, and maybe it's because I read books with them and fight over who gets to first read the newest books we get from Amazon. My husband shows them the stars and they watch ant documentaries together. They all get good grades and if they need help, they know we are here. ",
