            "answer_text": "Originally Answered: What university should I go to in the UK? That\u2019s a pretty broad question. Most people who go to the university in the UK reach their decision by some combination of the following three factors: What subject do you want to study at university?What universities are you able to gain admission to?What type of university experience are you looking for?For better or worse, most university conversations in the UK seem to start with Oxford and Cambridge. And the orthodox view is that if they teach the course you want, and you are able to get in, then that is where you should go. They cost the same as any other university, but you benefit from a high calibre environment and their unique one-on-one teaching. But, it should be added, some people don\u2019t flourish in the high pressure Oxbridge environment, or hate the Brideshead revisited architecture and traditions. Next people usually consider the wider Russell group. Although they don\u2019t bill themselves as such, this is broadly a group of the \u2018better\u2019 universities in the UK. There is quite a lot of them, and between them they teach pretty much any course you could want. So it really then depends upon what kind of university experience you would like - in particular (i)London or not-London, (ii) urban or more rural, and (iii) on a related note, a tighter \u2018campus-style\u2019 university (usually found in more rural settings) or spread about (normally in cities). Outside of the Russell group, there are other excellent universities (St Andrews being an obvious example). And there are also other universities which are not as strong overall, but have excellent courses. It really comes down to what it is that you want to study, and is there a university that can teach that subject well. Remember that in the UK you have to commit to your course of study during the application process. Very best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing to realise is that the most reliable tables to look at for this, as in virtually any other country, are the domestic tables rather than the global tables. Domestic tables have a much greater range of metrics to draw upon. The second thing is to look at performance across multiple tables, not a single table. The UK has three domestic rankings of universities, the Times, the Guardian and the Complete University Guide. The third thing is that you want to look at sustained performance over time, not just a single-year snapshot. So, over the past ten years, the universities with the highest average position across the three domestic rankings are: Cambridge (1.2)Oxford (1.8)St Andrews (4.0)Imperial (5.3)Durham (6.1)LSE (6.5)Warwick (7.7)UCL (8.8)Lancaster (9.6)Bath (9.8)There aren't any particular surprises there \u2013 as you'd expect from the way I put this together, these are all universities that have had sustained success across a variety of measures. A major change from what people identified as \u201ctop universities\u201d in the late 20th century, however, is that the redbrick civic universities have been replaced by 1960s plate-glass universities. This is reflected in only 7 of the top ten here being members of the Russell Group of large research universities (St Andrews, Lancaster and Bath being the non-members). ",

It might also be worth looking for _russell group universities_. But here's a story.   When one of my sons left school one of his friends went to a university I'd never heard of and my first thought was to ask we he would go to such a low graded place.   It may have been low graded overall but they offered the best course in the subject he wanted to study and was recognised for that fact.   So, if you're looking to study something specific it's worth finding all the places that offer your subject and looking in to all of them.   You might be surprised. ",

I was surprised to find that the style and scope of the courses differed a lot and the best University to go to would be the one which fitted your style of learning and scope of the course. They both did Music Degrees and went to Universities offering very different courses. They chose well and are both working in music as a result. One is working for a music publisher and plays and writes music and the other teaches piano and woodwind and also conducts and plays woodwind too. I imagine the same advice, namely choose your course wisely, would be appropriate whatever subject you are going for. Also, and I understand it is not PC to comment on spelling and punctuation but since we are all friends here I feel comfortable adding that the question should have universities in it rather than university since you are referring to a plural.
