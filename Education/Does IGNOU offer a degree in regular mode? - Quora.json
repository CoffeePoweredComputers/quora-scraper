            "answer_text": "Yes, it did in the past, I had done my masters from there on regular campus. But almost six years before, university discontinued their regular campus. We had three joint courses with madras school of economics during that time and many more than 200 courses. But you can still do other courses through distance learning. Ignou also provides some coaching for the distance courses but their syllabus and referenced books are absolutely different what they had for regular campus. Regular one was like Delhi University Or any other central university of India. ",
