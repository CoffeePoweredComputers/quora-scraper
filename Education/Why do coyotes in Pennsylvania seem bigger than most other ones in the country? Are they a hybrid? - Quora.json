            "answer_text": "Not specifically Pennsylvania, but yes coyotes in the eastern US and southeastern Canada are bigger than those in western North America because they are a hybrid with another animal, namely wolves. The coyote (Canis latrans) was originally an animal of the western plains and mountainous open country, and didn\u2019t move into eastern North America until agricultural development (after European settlement) broke up the dense forest into a mixed landscape more appropriate for an open-country predator like the coyote. Why they hybridized with wolves when they got to eastern North America, and hadn\u2019t been doing so in the west, is a matter of debate among biologists. One school of thought, associated with Linda K. Rutledge, is that besides coyotes, there were always at least two other species of wolf in North America: the grey wolf (Canis lupus), which lived in the west and in northern Canada, the same species found in Eurasia; the smaller red wolf (Canis rufus), found in the forests of the eastern United States; and the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), found in the Great Lakes region, which was possibly the same species as the red wolf but genetically separated for some time. As this theory goes, the red/eastern wolf (though not the grey wolf) is genetically similar enough to coyotes to hybridize and produce fertile offspring with them, and the only thing keeping them apart over the centuries was geography. Once coyotes colonized the eastern parts of North America where red/eastern wolves live, hybridization became widespread, such that all coyotes in eastern North America have some amount of red/eastern wolf DNA. This makes them bigger than western coyotes. By this theory, the only \u201cpure bred\u201d eastern wolves are those that live in large areas of in-tact forest, where coyotes wouldn\u2019t find good habitat.  An eastern wolf in Algonquin Provincial Park, which the Rutledge team would consider a relatively pure strain since it\u2019s a large forested landscape without much good coyote habitat. Image credit Wesley Liikane (@cowboy_with_a_camera) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos The other school of thought, associated with Robert K. Wayne, is that there was only ever the grey wolf and the coyote in North America, and that what we call \u201ceastern wolves\u201d, \u201cred wolves\u201d and \u201ceastern coyotes\u201d are just slightly different products of hybridization between coyotes and grey wolves. This theory is gaining steam in terms of genetic evidence, but it doesn\u2019t explain why coyotes only hybridized with wolves once they colonized the east, in spite of having shared range with wolves in the west for millennia. For more on this, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_wolf#Taxonomic_debate Either way, everyone agrees that the eastern coyote is a hybrid between coyotes outside of their original native range and some sort of wolf, making them larger than the \u201cpure\u201d coyotes of the western states/provinces/Mexico.

            "answer_text": "Western Coyotes are the originals - small (usually under 30 lbs) solitary animals filling a niche close to that of jackals in other parts of the world. Selective pressures from wolves kept them that way - they couldn\u2019t compete with wolves in the niche of larger, packing predators. When Europeans showed up they were stridently anti-wolf and began a centuries-long crusade to kill as many wolves as possible. This left a \u201cpower vacuum\u201d as it were on the edges of the Coyotes\u2019 historical range, and also removed the selective pressure to stay small and solitary. Coyotes outside of the Great Plains/desert Southeast are recent arrivals filling the void left by the removal of wolves - this means that they are fulfilling the role and being naturally selected for wolf-like traits like larger size, and larger packs. In addition, DNA studies have shown that Eastern Coyotes are, on average, up to a quarter wolf and 10% dog! This has further increased their move toward wolf-like sizes and behaviors. Your Eastern Coyote is up to 50% larger than the little Western, Jackal-like Coyotes, forms larger packs, and, yes, is sort of a hybrid (though not first generation, the DNA admixtures are pretty old and dispersed at this point).
