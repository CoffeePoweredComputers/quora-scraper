            "answer_text": "To function efficiently in everyday life.  There\u2019s no getting around math. Of the two certainties in life, death may not use math but taxes certainly does. If you use cash, you\u2019d better know how to make change. If you have friends over for dinner, you\u2019d better have many, many cookbooks covering many party sizes or else know the math to scale a recipe. What products provide better value, whether $/lb, GB/$, m.p.g, or pretty much any other comparison? Better know math to figure it out. It\u2019s going to be 25C when you get off the plane. Or going the other direction, 50F. Should you have worn a jacket? Where elementary math is used is endless. You can not only survive but also have a good life without most college math. In most developed countries that can\u2019t be said without some understanding of high school math. Yes, a knowledge of the four basic functions will provide some survival skills but other than making change, the examples in the first paragraph could easily go over your head. And then we get to what is probably the biggest reason. To get pretty much any job with potential growth, you need to know some level of math. Certainly there are jobs where a knowledge of math isn\u2019t required but how many can get you into or at least close to middle class? Can you imagine a contractor or electrician who isn\u2019t comfortable with the basic math of their trades? How about a real estate agent who can\u2019t sit down with a client and go through and explain a contract because the math is over their head? If you can\u2019t do math you\u2019ve pretty much eliminated being in business for yourself so, as they say, expect to be working for the Man. Warehouse or storage supervisors without the ability to understand and maintain inventory? It\u2019s not going to happen.  Many jobs require math, many every day activities require math, and your kids are going to ask you questions about it. So bite the bullet and have a better life - learn math. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t think of a single reason NOT to learn math! We use math each and every day, whether we are aware of it or not. If I had to think of the \u201cbest reason\u201d, I would say have to say that it is my understanding that pushing your mind to learn problem solving skills has been proven to enhance mental fitness and prevent age-related memory decline. Agreeably other health factors like good nutrition and rest apply, however stimulating your mind to think analytically is excellent brain aerobics. Other good reasons are perhaps developing work career skills, being able to grow in your field. Most every career requires the use of math in some form. Just think about it, is there a career from a tile contractor to pharmacist technician that does not rely on a skill at counting or calculating of some sort? Even a musician has to be aware of counting rhythms. As a famous mathematician, Pythagoras, has been quoted as saying, \u201c There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.\u201d And if you don\u2019t know who Pythagoras is , that should be your first assignment. Mathematicians are phenomenally enjoyable people to converse with\u2026. I am not a mathematician still I appreciate math. Here are a few good books if you are thinking of wanting to see math differently. Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality, by Edward Frenkel The Joy of x: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity by Steven Strogatz Math and Magic in Wonderland by Lilac Mohr ",
