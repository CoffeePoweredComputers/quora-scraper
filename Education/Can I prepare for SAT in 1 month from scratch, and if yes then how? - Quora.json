            "answer_text": "Yes, you can certainly learn a lot in a month. Set up a schedule that approaches this as you would a part time job which is 20 hours per week. Since it is summer, ask yourself to work on this job each day before doing other things. You will begin at 8am. Work for two hours on your first practice test. Take a 30 minute break. Work the third hour on the practice test. During the fourth hour, have someone help you check your answers without telling you what the correct answers were. Calculate the \u201cpercent you got correct\u201d in each section, in other words, the number you got correct, divided by the total number of problems, in the Reading Comprehension section. Write down your \u201cpercent correct\" at the top of that section. Each time you work a practice test section, you will be competing with yourself to improve your \"percent correct\u201d score on that section. Ask your friend to only tell you which problems you missed, not what the correct answers were. Just mark the problems you missed. Then rework those problems \u201ccold\" (without already knowing the answer), to see if you can determine what you did wrong and select the correct answer on this \u201ccold rework.\u201d Then, check yourself to see if you reworked them successfully. For those you still did not get, you should read the answer explanations from Khan Academy and then work those problems again one more time, keeping the answer explanations in mind. Make yourself consistently use a good Process of Elimination system in considering each potential answer. I've written more here on Quora about a good Process of Elimination system and how to use it. You can search for that. Once a week, you will need to time yourself taking an entire practice test under conditions identical to a real SAT. You want to learn the ways, and the extent to which, you need to adjust your pacing. ",

It's really easy for an average student to prepare for SAT maths section in a month , but verbal section would make you back off . Judge yourself by taking a mock test which you can download from Free SAT practice tests and new SAT exam study guide_CrackSAT.net and score yourself , if you are getting a score of 1200+ , yes you can easily prepare in a month , otherwise it's a no . For maths stick to maths Barron's work book And for English Erica meltzer. ",
