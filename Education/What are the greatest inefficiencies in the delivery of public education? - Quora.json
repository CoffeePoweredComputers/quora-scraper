            "answer_text": "On the macro level public schools are funded inefficiently and very unjustly. Since school funding is based predominately on property taxes the students whose parents are wealthy enough to live in the best areas get the best schools. This creates an educational caste system. My buddy who grew up in a nice part of Long Island told me about his high school radio stations and golf team.  Meanwhile the students I teach in manhattan public school get nothing like that...our school doesn't have the resources for AP classes.  Money doesn't guarantee a great education but I am pretty confident that if schools had equal funding it would go pretty far in closing the educational gap that continues to grow in our country between the poor and the well off.

            "answer_text": "This is something I write about all the time. The public schools have embraced an array of inefficient (some would say bogus) theories and methods. Each of these things is the equivalent of a normal person trying to walk fast on a crutch. Sight-words to teach reading. Reform Math to teach arithmetic. Constructivism to teach basic knowledge. Etc. There is arguably not one first-rate method used in our public schools.  So I would say the greatest inefficiencies are in the intellectual and theoretical underpinnings. GIGO. If you ask me, I would say that some very smart people sat around a table and said, \"How can we make everything level?\"  This perspective is explained in a short video:   ",
