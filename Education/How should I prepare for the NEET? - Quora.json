            "answer_text": "There are already so many answer to this questions , it's really overwhelming. Everyone has a unique preparation strategy. So I'm going for a bit different route with this answer and provide a basic set of tools that worked for me. But first understand the situation here. You have decided to appear for the NEET and want to be a doctor. What is unique about you? Nothing! You are doing what already lakhs of students of our country doing. Roughly assume 99% of students won't get a good rank. So you have to be the 1%. So here's a general layout, Intelligence+Strategy+Motivation+Persistence+Endurance= Success Intelligence You have to ask yourself relevant questions and reach correct conclusions. This is nowhere related to academic performance but choices you make with your life.Understand the competetion. Realise which part is going to give you edge in the exam.Ditching unnecessary parts to focus on more important parts. You can not waste your time on a part which gives you 1\u20132 questions and take very long time to prepare. Identify those parts. But remember not to avoid topics which are conceptually important.Stop fooling yourself. You are wasting time on social networks and games, performing poorly in the exam and you are only good for excuses. Who are you cheating? If you lack such basic seriousness you shouldn't persue a career which deals with human lives.Give yourself enough time for sleep and exercise. It's better fot your memory and health.Use you time intelligently. Give more time to weaker topics and vice versa.Don't waste your time on such topics which is hard to understand and irreverlent for the exam. Do not make a fool out of yourself like that.Avoid settings unrealistic goals and study schedule. Develop one according to your capabilities. Strategy Everyone sholud have a unique strategy which focuses on their strengths and weaknesses. But some basics must be followed by everyone. Generally, whatever topic you are preparing. You should master the theory first. Then build accuracy. If you see that you are attempting mcq and more that 90% are correct, focus on building speed. Speed can be improve by time based mcq practice but don't lose accuracy in the process. Talking about strategies, let me throwaway some tips- Focus on previous year papers, specially on Chemistry. Each year there is almost 70%-80% question in chemistry is inspired from previous papers.While preparing for bio, focus on Ncert. Sometime a single line from Ncert can hide a whole story of its own. Try to unravel it.Revision is the key. make revision plans in the series ( after 1 day, 2 day, 4 day, 8 day\u2026\u2026..)Try to develop a habit of giving full mock test. Here's an interesting approach that I did. Find out what is going to be your duration of exam. Let's assume it's going to be 2\u20135 pm. Try to build a habit of giving a mock test from 2\u20135 pm in home in an exam like condition. It'll acclimatize your mind and body for the final exam.Do the previous method for 2 weeeks straight before the exam to set the stage. It's highly effective.Always develop exam oriented strategies. Remember, everything depends on how you'll perform in those 3 hours. so work on some plans like how you are going to attend the paper, marking methods etc.Do your own research and develop original strategies. I am feeling too lazy to write everything xDMotivation/Mindset  Mindset and motivation is something that makes the difference between a mere ranker and topper. Remember you are bound to get depressed. You'll soon start to procastinate , get distracted easily and avoid daily tasks. Eat healthy, stay fit and have enough rest- do these to keep your motivation level intact. While the motivation is temporary, the mindset isn't. Take a deep breath, take a piece of paper and write down 5 points on why being a doctor will satisfy you. Understand and learn more about the profession you are chasing. Why being a doctor requires discipline? What are the qualities that will make you a better human and aid you on your goal? Also try to develop a Growth Mindset. Focus and enjoy the journey rather than the goal. If your mind is strong enough, you can cross even the steepest mountain with ease. Persistence A part of mindset, deserves mentioning because of the sheer amount of it you will need. Be persistant. Even tough the syllabus seems huge, you have to start and keep grinding. Never lose the momentum, you can't afford to waste energy to build momentum again and again. Practice each and every day without fail. Revise daily.  Your mind will start to start to opress you sooner than you think. It'll try to convince you not to leave the comfort zone in a sub consious level. Just catch those signal and remember what is more important to you, your comfort zone or your goal. Endurance  There will be challenges in your path Sometimes you'll fall ill. Your family and friends may not support you. You will start to doubt your abilities. Your result won't be satisfactory. Inspite of these challenges, make your heart and mind strong enough to fight with them. The more you endure your obstacles, the better you grow out of it. On a final note NEET is not a easy exam. I've seen many of my friends start with full enthusiasm, get discouraged midway and ultimately ditch their goal altogether. It's not that they failed, they probably made the right decision for themselves. Preparing for neet should not be influenced by your parent's ambition or your stubbornness. Start researching about it on the internet, follow the guide of various rankers and your teachers, build effecive plans and never hesitate to do hard work. Some online resources I used during my preparation- Biomentors classes online (mainly biology)NV sir lectures (altough higher level than neet)Various motivation sessions and self development videos in youtube(trust me,they helped me more than I imagined)Best of luck for all future aspirants. You have the potential, just go for it. (all images are lazily taken from Google) ",

            "answer_text": "Thank for the question! Well as we all know NEET is very important to get admission into medical college. If we want good rank then we've to study hard.  Okay let's talk about preparation. This is NEET syllabus..  This answer is going to be long. So sorry in advanced. First, gather all the study materials, notes or books from which you are going to prepare for NEET examination. Make a study schedule and a plan- In a study schedule, make time slots and decide that for how long you will study and how long breaks will you take.In a study plan, make a strategy of preparation of the exam.You can make a plan to first take up a chapter then read it first from NCERT.Then read from any other reference book.After clearing of concepts you can then practice questions and mock papers.When reading the books, make sure that you keep making notes as you keep going forward. This way on the day of the exam you can revise from the notes.Pay attention to all subjects- Don\u2019t ignore subjects you are weak in. This is important because sometimes paper is so structured that your easy subject might have difficult questions. In that case, you can have a headstart if you have studied all the subjects.Revise old topics- It\u2019s super easy to forget the topics you spent time studying if you don\u2019t revise. So while covering new topics, remember to revise old topics as well.Solve question papers- Set your timer for 3 hours. While in the examination hall there are many pressure situations which cannot be created otherwise. The only way you can prepare yourself to handle some of the pressure is by limiting your time while solving question papers.Be confident- Don\u2019t let yourself believe that if you are unable to master a topic or subject you won\u2019t be able to make it.Once you have marked, easy, moderate, difficult, important topics in your syllabus, you must prepare a strategy based on smart work and not just hard work. \" It's not all about how you work hard but it's about how you manage your time, resources, mind to work together for a better output.\u201d   \u2714\ufe0fSome important points to be kept in mind while preparing a study plan are given below. Your study plan should revolve around three aspects i.e learn, revise and practiceDifficult topics must be studied thoroughly and wisely.Break lengthy chapters into topics and sub-topics to make learning easy.Make comparative charts for two or more relatable topics, terms or processes.Create a list of important definitions, important formulas, important derivations in chemistry and physics and important diagrams in biology etc. and brush them up weekly.Prepare mind maps, flow charts and ray diagrams for memory based topics while studying the chapters.Set daily, weekly and monthly goals for yourself and try to accomplish them in the fixed time.Take care of your health: You can\u2019t afford to lose any time. So eat healthily and sleep well. Now let's talk about individual subject.. Physics: Make a note of important points and formulae of every chapter in a separate book. Solve as many questions from mock papers and keep the revision book handy. Some of the important topics areDimensional Analysis,Current ElectricityHeat Transfer and Kinetic Theory of GasesThermodynamicsRotational DynamicsGeometrical OpticsWaves and SoundElectromagnetic Induction.Chemistry: For Chemistry, the NCERT textbook is perfect, as it is well framed for a detailed understanding of all the topics. Aim to attempt all questions in the textbook and then move on to reference books for additional preparation. Physical Chemistry is about clearing concepts and implementing these concepts and procedures by solving maximum MCQs. Inorganic chemistry is more about facts and little about concepts. This section involves a lot of learning the concepts from their end. Organic chemistry is very demanding and you must clear their concepts. Important topics in Chemistry areThermodynamicsEquilibriumHydrocarbonsCarbonyl CompoundsChemical bondingMole ConceptElectrochemistryCoordination Compounds.Biology: NCERT textbooks are again everything for the Biology section to crack NEET. Further, Biology is given 50% weightage in NEET question paper as compared to Chemistry and Physics. Hence, you need to be very clear with different questions to attempt questions in the exam. And this can be possible with a regular revision of the subject with practice tests. Use mnemonics to memories things in Biology. Important topics in Biology can beDiversity in Living WorldStructural Organization in Animals and PlantsCell Structure and FunctionsPlant Physiology and Human PhysiologyReproductionGenetics and EvolutionHuman WelfareBiotechnology and its ApplicationsEcology and Environment.Animalia and Plantae topic needs to be prepared more carefully. The main emphasis must be on the characters of Phylum in Non-Chordates and the classes of Chordates. All examples given in the NCERT along with the common name (wherever given) should also be memorized.  \u2714\ufe0fHere are some common mistakes that we should avoid during their NEET preparation. Not following the time table- You should strictly follow the timetable they have prepared for the exam.Hectic schedule- You should not follow a hectic schedule or study for a long period of time as it can affect their retention and develop fatigue.Ignoring NCERT- 70\u201375% of the questions come from NCERT textbooks, so you should not ignore NCERT books.Following too many books- You should avoid studying from many books at a time as they can get confused and mess up your preparation.Ignoring subjects- When it comes to competitive entrance exam like NEET you should not leave a single page of any subject from the syllabus. Read this one too.. Bhakti Jondhalekar's answer to How can I prepare for NEET 2020 now? I think I've mentioned all the details related to NEET preparation. If you still have any doubts then feel free to ask. PS- Well due to some time problem I'm not able to reply every text message quickly. Please don't feel bad about it. I'm sorry for that. I'll try to reply everyone as soon as possible. Hope it helps:-) ",

            "answer_text": "I copied this from a Facebook post by me, please go through this: Okay, so Rajiv Sir asked me to throw some light on my preparation experience last year(2015-16). I passed class 12th in 2015 with regular school and coaching from Aakash Pitampura(Delhi) and appeared for both AIPMT and RE-AIPMT in the same year(2015) and scored 490 and 498 marks respectively in them with AIR 5955 in RE-AIPMT 2015. Since I belong to the general category and have only Delhi domicile, I couldn't secure a seat in any govt college in 2015 through AIQ, also missed AFMC by a slight margin. My AIIMS and JIPMER scores and rank were also not good enough to get me a seat in there. Then I started preparation for AIPMT/NEET 2016 and for that I joined Allen Kota classroom programme (Achiever Batch MAZH5). I mainly used class notes and Allen modules for my preparation. Physics- Any coaching module+notes NCERT if you are focusing for AIIMS (I personally never read NCERT). Questions from any question bank will suffice. I aimed for around 120+ marks, 80 marks are average. Chemistry- NCERT should be read specially for inorganic and organic. Practice questions extensively for physical and organic too. Don't neglect inorganic as it is scoring. I aimed for 150+ marks, 110-120 marks are average Biology- NCERT is the Bible for biology, both NEET & AIIMS. If you are thorough with NCERT, you can easily score 300+ which is a good score. NCERT reading for biology shouldn't be just plain reading, it should be exhaustive as in you should know every single line rather I would say read in between the lines for biology, beneath the diagrams, summary, even introduction and author info. WHY ->In cell cycle chapter, the phase of organelle duplication is only given in the summary. ->In morphology anatomy unit, the author(Katherine Esau) introduction lists a wonderful fact about some virus which infects via the phloem tissue. These are some examples i remember though many other such hidden questions are there. Also practice a lot of questions for biology. 270 is considered average for biology. I aimed for 320-330+ as bio was my forte. I didn't use much extra books and I won't recommend them either if you are already studying and practicing your coaching stuff correctly. Also please start attempting previous year question papers (everyday) from February end or March beginning to assess your performance on a daily basis. Mark your mistakes and learn them or the underlying concept. My score rose from around 510 in September to 550s in December-January to 570-580s in March and I was hoping for 600 in the final exam. My final score(NEET-1)was 615/720: P: 118 C: 167 B: 330 My AIR was 134. I performed well but nothing exceptional with AIR 327 and 590 in AIIMS and JIPMER respectively. I got Maulana Azad Medical College in the first Delhi state counselling with Delhi rank 24. If you need any other information then please feel free to comment in the comment section or message me. Thanks. ",

So, Spaced Repetition is the only solution to this. Spaced Learning is a learning method in which learning content is repeated after an interval.(say weekly) This forgetting curve is the main enemy for a pre medical aspirant. So deduce your own forgetting curve and revise and revise. Take strategy of 3R- Recap, Review, ReinforceDivide a topic to be revised into parts, get organized, set goals and prioritize topics to be reviewedstop procrastinatingYou may find study load to be dauntingly heavy, intimidating and disorganized, so Incorporate all your class note in preliminary reading note ( include book, lecture handouts)use abbreviations, Mnemonics (visual and verbal). Make mnemonics using dirty language, vernacular language, emotional connection( be aware of the similarities and don't confuse yourself)Start revising with your strong areas first. Make these topics to best from good.Be brutal about your weak points.Study in short bursts, not long marathons.While revising a topic always prioritize key areas, set time goalLastly some tips to study smart not hard : Don't fall prey to Information Anxiety (especially in biology)Read NCERT as mother book and one or two reference books.Read-only relevant topics which are in ncert there is no need for extra learning in NEET because most students make mistakes in common questions quoted from NCERT.Take 5\u201310 years of question Bank and solve mcqs after you revise every topicAppear in every test whatever be your preparation and compare yourselfThere is no place of rote learning in entrance exams so don't cram formulasDeconstruct a numerical, sketch the scene ( meaningful organization and mental visualization), verify units, Use the formula and verify your answerSome general tips: Take power napsexercise regularly to reduce stressDon't overrate or underestimate your friendsAim high and believe in yourselfPlease upvote me and follow me for more answers regarding NEET PREPARATION.

            "answer_text": "Well I started preparing for NEET as soon as my 10 board got over. I expect you are also at the similar stage. So, here are some tips from my side which can help you do well in your NEET exam. Develop a proper time-table Yes, this a very common advice that must have received from almost every other person. It is because this step is very important. This time table should have proper break time apart from studies. Try to devote time to all the three subjects- Physics, Chemistry & Biology. Follow the time table rigorously during your preparation Rely on own hand-written notes Less in more...This is so true in case of NEET preparation. Many medical aspirants try to study from many books(I have done the same mistake during the initial stage of preparation). This waste your precious time that you would otherwise have utilized for NEET Preparation. Count on quality study material - it can be a book from certain publication or your coaching modules. In my case it was my own hand-written notes. And I believe it works best for everyone. And when you talk about books, NCERT are just the best. For biology and chemistry..they are just the best. For physics, apart from NCERT, I studies from my coaching modules too. Start Appearing in Test Series This is the most crucial aspect of your NEET preparation. Many NEET aspirants realize the importance of test series very late. But till then, its too late. Don't repeat this mistake in your case. Start appearing in test series right from day one. Choose a test series wisely. It has to include all the diverse type of MCQs and analytics should be strong. In my case I wasn't much satisfied from the test series of my coaching so after a friend's suggestion I went for test series by Darwin. Appearing in daily mock test is only half work done. After every test, make sure you thoroughly analyse weak areas and work on them. Analyse your strike rate and work to improve the same. Test Series or Daily Mock test will help you fight with exam fear and will boost your confidence to a whole another level. Practice MCQs from all topics And this is apart from test series!! I used to practice at least 100 MCQs daily from Darwin. 40 from biology(sometimes 50), 30 from physics, 30 from chemistry. I used to practice MCQs from diverse topics. Used to give extra attention to topics like ecology, equilibrium, genetics and evolution as from my initial mock tests, I realized that I am lagging behind in ranks because of them. Also, during your preparation make sure you have not ignore image-based MCQs. Revise thoroughly Make sure you have ample amount of time left for Revision. At least two months. Revise entire syllabus and give more time to the topics which were your weaklinks. Keep appearing in test. In my revision phase, apart from test series and going through my hand-written notes, I also practiced 200 MCQs on daily basis. This develop my familiarity with questions from all topics. Even though the NEET paper was lengthy this time, I answered 169 questions and still had half an hour left to go through all of the questions one more time. By god's grace I cored 668 in NEET( 650 was my dream score) and managed to get into my dream college. I hope my tricks would help you too to get admission in your favorite college. If you need any further help regarding your NEET preparation, let me know. I am more than happy to help any serious aspirant who is willing to crack NEET. Apart from following these tricks, stay motivated..stay positive..stay focused. ",

There are some instructions for every type of student (11th, 12th, dropper or repeater) Quit Social media. Even don't use Quora more than 10\u201320 minutes. Utilise your time how much you can.Don't get into relationship, friendship goals and all that distractions. Don't interact with distractive people who aren't serious for their aim. They'll distract you. Choose your company wisely.Don't pass your works on tomorrow. Because after some time it will be a burden on you which will be harder for you to complete. And you'll have to drop some topics and you can't afford that. Mark my points, Tomorrow never come.Read NCERT, NCERT and NCERT properly. As every one has told you that it's your Bible and I guess you know the importance of NCERT.Solve previous year question papers but before that you have to complete your syllabus. If you're a class 11th student then you've a lot of time but it doesn't mean you'll waste this. Make a schedule and follow that for two years. Join a coaching or online classes. Do mock tests. Also join a test series. If you're a 12th class student, then you'll have to focus on your boards also but don't neglect NEET. cause you only have to score 60+% , So that you'll be eligible for NEET. Manage your time.  If you're a dropper then please don't even waste a single second of yours. Don't read hundred of books. Choose your books carefully and do them like 4\u20135 times. Don't waste your time over an useless study material which includes tons of books. Trust me you won't be able to complete them. Make NCERT your Bible. Study this 4\u20135 times at least. Join a coaching or DLP. Read their notes and modules properly. NCERT, Notes and modules are quite enough, if you have joined a coaching or DLP. But but but, if you're dependent on self study then here we go, Join a test series and don't miss a single test of that. Attempting the test isn't quite enough. Test analysis is more important. Do that carefully. (It requires for everyone).NCERT, Finger tips, and previous year questions for every subject (PCB)PHYSICS - HCV and DC Pandey (only if your concepts are clear). Go for Aashish Arora sir's YouTube channel, Physics Galaxy.CHEMISTRY -PHYSICAL - Narendra Awasthi Sir.ORGANIC - MS Chauhan sir.INORGANIC - VK Jaiswal sir.\u2022 BIOLOGY - NCERT, Finger Tips And previous year are quite enough.  Make a suitable time table. Don't study every subject daily. Make a combo. Study two subjects a day. I'll prefer you to study, Physics and Botany and Chemistry and Zoology. If you haven't started yet, then start this now. Don't waste your precious time over asking this question. And don't be depressed. Cause Jab jago, tabhi savera! Better late than never! Note - (Sarvarth Gupta preferred me these Books and you tube channels).  Prachi :) ",

The previous years were a waste of time which i regret even now . Coming to your question here's what i did make a timetable for everyday and follow that regularly (needless to say all three subjects and set realistic goals)Practise as many questions as you can because that is how you'll get a grip on your conceptsFor biology , read ncert word by word , again and again till the moment you appear for neet because believe me when i tell you this , i always found something important everytime i read each chapter . Do not forget the diagrams because thereare high chances to have a question based on a diagram .For chemistry , study inorganic every weekend and revise that regularly . Organic is what will help you throughout (they say treat organic like you girlfriend/boyfriend and it will never betray you) . If needed write down the names of reactions and practise to write them on your own .For physics practise numerous questions as and when you get through with a chapterApply for online/offline test series (personally i was a classroom student at aakash as well as took online test series from allen) . The more exposure you get on the type of questions, the better .Solve past 20 years papers because 20% questions are repeated with little or no changes at all . (In 2017 almost 11\u201312 questions in physics , 3 questions in chem out of which one was from 2003 from the electrochemistry chapter in which they did not even bother to change the values of the question and in biology 6 question were repeated)Track your progress (believe me this helps a lot) . Track you weeknesses , write down you weak points snd work efficiently on them .Do not let your doubts breed because regret is the last thing you wanna do .Try solve the questions as a challenge , as in think like this , how can a simple question beat me ? i'm way more than this - you get me ?Sleep well (i know this sounds clich\u00e9 but this is very much needed for your brain to function properly)Surround yourself with winners , who share the same passion , the same mindset as you . People who want to achieve something in life and not those who are comfortable in the position that they are in . Try to get a head start , be hungry for success , let people know that you've arrived , let you scores speak for themselves , try to beat yourself , hit a new goal every time . Ultimately my point is , company also matters .Do not stress because this is just another exam that you're meant to ace at . all the best",

            "answer_text": "Just know that NEET can be cracked very easily. Here we go. First of all, for all the pcb subjects, be absolutely thorough with the NCERT textbooks. The questions which are given after each chapter are to be taken very seriously and solved. Also solve the other NCERT question bank books. Biology: Study NCERT textbooks thoroughly. Know each line's meaning and since lines are directly take from the context, make sure your able to recall as clearly as possible. The other references I suggest are Akash and Allen modules, Akash preferably. Previously solved questions which you may refer in NCERT at your fingertips. Write each point the teacher tells you in the class and in the coaching hours. In leisure, refer other textbooks in your library or you could Google and download pdfs, if in hostel, you might go to a library or just stick to your coaching notes. In the end, make sure you have a deep knowledge because the questions may rise out of NCERT syllabus. Chemistry: Study NCERT thoroughly and make sure you understand each concept well. You should be able to explain. And be absolutely well practiced with the questions that appear after each chapter in the textbook. The units and conversions should be very clear. Solve as many questions as possible. Do do do solve numericals continuously. Refer cengage, Allen modules. NCERT at your fingertips for questions and make sure you keep solving the questions from different textbooks continuously. Listen to the lecture. Organic chemistry: understand the steps and remember. Separately write the reagents. Remember what each reagent does to the reacting substances. Conditions for each reaction to be remembered perfectly. Learn organic completely on your own understanding. Solve questions, remember them. Remember abnormalities. Make notes. Keep revising on alternate days. Google for division of marks and work accordingly on each chapter by making a timetable. Physics: This is the subject I personally like a lot. Make sure you completely listen to class with all ears and open to each word literally. But make sure you think. And keep it light. Remember most of the problems are solved using a formula. Open the chapter, study from what your teacher has thought you, open DC PANDEY study the same from there, the theory context of this book should be revised often. Solve all levels of problems. Keep on solving previous solved papers which would help you a lot especially if you are an Expert college student. The best advise is to borrow physics study material from your seniors from expert, or you can buy from Expert store but make sure you have one. Again, it is very necessary in this subject to Google the weightage of questions from each chapter so that you can work on it. Be confident. Don't at all listen to the explanation of a student who you doubt. In the exam make sure you remember to say to yourself that you know all the questions. So, bio-360, phy and chem-180 marks Minimum 460. Since the margin is rising, 530 above would be absolutely safe. When you start your paper, start with bio: in the first round go on answering all the questions with absolute clear reading and thoughtful mentality. Next shift to chemistry and solve the theory based questions and few numericals which consume less time. Get back to bio and solve the left out ones, this time taking more time and patience. You'll be left with around 10 questions now. Shift to physics, make sure you have minimum of one hour right now. Start solving with maximum speed. You will get struck in the first question, think hardest and solve. Continue with the same pace and solve rest of it. Do not worry at all. Finish complete thinking for all the questions, you might get only 20 correct it's okay. Get back to chemistry and finish it. It's youe score booster. Now finish bio after your done with the previous. Come to physics section, try and finish maximum. If you get all right, BMC Bengaluru, Karnataka is your next hault. AND YOUR OMR SHEET MARKING SHOULD NOT HAVE A SINGLE ERROR. AND REGISTRATION NUMBER MARKING SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. ALL THE VERY BEST. WORK HARD. Wish you good endeavors ahead.

This answer is aimed at budding a basic thought process in your mind based on my experience. STRATEGY The paper level of NEET can be categorized as:  If you are aiming at getting a seat in a decent government medical college, 80% marks will be more than sufficient. Make sure you focus on bettering yourselves in the 80% zone rather than running behind the 20%. The syllabus for NEET is categorized below-  We have a total of 105 topics to be done. A basic plan of how this can be done is present in the word NEET itself! :-) N-New topic in hand E- Expertise in it E- Evaluate yourself T- Take up another topic This basically means: Step1- New Topic In Hand Whenever you begin with a topic, keep the following things in mind. Well begun is half done! 1) Assemble all the resources you have at a single place. 2) Caution- Try to keep this minimum and stick to a single source to avoid confusion and save time. 3) My recommendations Allen/Akash notes of all the three subjects.Physics & Chemistry : Arihant, MTG, ErrorlessBiology : NCERT will help you sail till 320-330.(This will be more than enough)4) Once you are done with this, decide on the time you'll need to complete the chapter. Time makes the difference in who wins the race. Once you've done this, the grind begins. Step 2- Expertise in it This step will give you the basic blueprint of how a topic should be done. Once you have assembled the resources, try studying a topic in 3 parts. You'll thank me for this later ; (A)Read the theory from a textbookThis forms your basic understanding of the chapter. My recommendations: Chemistry & Biology- NCERT Physics- Your class notes because NCERT is a bit time consuming and the gains are relatively same! (B) Read the synopsis of the topic from a review bookThis will give the necessary MCQ angle to your study. Refer step 1, point 3 for this. (C) Solve MCQs sincerelyOnce you are done with reading the theory and the synopsis, which will not take more than 2-4 hours, then comes the most important step. Since NEET is essentially an MCQ exam, this is the core.Solve MCQs as much as possible. This will improve both you solving skills and speed.Following this grind will give you some advantages- If you do all the three steps in a go, your brain will be reading the same concepts again and again and it will stored in your long term memory.You will not require frequent revisions for the topic.A lookback once every month/ two months will be sufficient!You will gain much confidence and your scores will start improving.Step 3- EVALUATE YOURSELF Once you are done with a topic, evaluate yourself as to which areas of the topic you find yourself lagging behind.Keep 1 hour every Saturday and Sunday reserved to lookback into these topics.Also, evaluate YOURSELF not by marks in your tests but by the amount of perfection you have gained!Step 4- TAKE UP THE NEXT TOPIC Repeat the grind again! ;-) REVISION-When you read a chapter, prepare notes if comfortable or mark in the important points. Also mark 2 types of MCQs: 1) Silly mistakes 2) The ones you did not know the concepts about. This will ensure a complete topic revision at the end. This was a basic blueprint of how you can prepare for the NEET and clear it in first attempt. There will be hard times, there will be good times! Consistency will be the key!\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb One Day Or Day One, You decide!\ud83d\udca5 ",

So focus more on learning concepts , it will help you in solving questions, rather than mugging up the material provided by your coaching institutes, Try to solve questions without taking help ,if you don't get ask your friends who are good with you ,as they can explain you in a better way,even then if you don't get answer then ask your teacher,still you are not satisfied then leave it What ever told above might seem you lengthy , so try it most of the questions you have doubt will be solved by your friends and teachers , who are good with concepts,this will help you to know the methods they use and will also help you to build confidence. Don\u2019t ever feel shy to ask doubts ,but that doesn't mean ask silly doubts which will be clarified by yourself if you think.what I want tell is try everything , every question by yourself ,then take help from good friends and then teacher So don't go to people who are egoistic and have pride , instead of solving your doubts they will troll you for not getting answer ,this will make you sad , you might loose your confidence To succeed a exam just having knowledge is not health and peace of mind is important so sleep well and protect your health, which I didn't do during my preparation ,which affected my rank in neet Don't try to study every thing ,that will be your biggest mistake focus on ncert text book for biology , inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry more apart from your material,anyhow these books little bit tougher as they don't explain everything and they are not in structured pattern When you attend coaching classes they will teach you concepts , so learn them ,write notes, and study ncert text books , figure out important For physics and physical chemistry whatever material you have been provided is enough Some the books which I have used other than my material provided by coaching institute Biology- 1)Ncert at fingertips for solving questions 2)arihant series ncert McQs (I don't remember book name properly) Organic chemistry -1)MS Chauhan -2)ncert at fingertips Physics 1)DC pandey for neet students Well theory and questions are available in books but concepts have to learnt by you and problems have to be solved by you , so don't waste your time solving many books ,or being confused in choosing books ,if you feel time is less material is sufficient for you .if you have time then spend time on solving questions and discuss as much questions as possible Solving questions help you to build concepts and boost up your confidence levels Hope so this might have helped you, Lazy but talented never wins , whatever it matters is smartwork, manage your time , don't just stick up to question in exam if you don't get answer learn to move on to other questions in exam but stick to the questions while solving while learning and focus on important while preparing for exam in last days, Try to revise everything what you learnt before the exam , don't waste your time Learning new\ud83d\ude42 Sorry for mistakes, we make mistakes but we should not repeat them, that is a lesson that everyone of us must understand.

            "answer_text": "Now that I have passed the exam and I am successfully admitted for MBBS course , I would like to share a few points to clear the exam . Clearing the NEET needs hard work, dedication and strategy. Chemistry -Physical chemistry - Go through each and every line of NCERT ; try to relate concepts with diagrams ,solve as many numericals as possible .Remember the examples mentioned in NCERT .Inorganic chemistry - Though there are some concepts to be understood, yet this requires a lot of memorisation.If you are targeting NEET only, focus totally on NCERT ; read between the lines .No need to hanker after any other book ( believe me, no question is out of NCERT. I missed some lines and suffered a bit.)Organic chemistry- This is an important section. Be concentrated from the very beginning ; try to practice as much as possible.For 12th syllabus , master all the reactions mentioned in NCERT.Physics - Sorry ! But no shortcuts here. You may make up for chemistry and biology, but not in physics. Keep track with teachers ,surf the book and go on solving numericals. Once syllabus is covered, try to solve 45questions in least time possible( I.e., NEET type practice).Solving diverse MCQ s clears the concepts.Biology - Remember a word here - NCERT ; maximum questions are from NCERT .Remember each and every line, diagram and all the related data. Once you master NCERT, go for a standard reference like Truman ,if you wish .Remember that text books alone won't help, minimise textbooks and maximise MCQ practice.The more you solve ,the more you learn .Also, focus correctly on NCERT .Give timed tests.Then NEET is not tough enough . And for reference books, surf the ones you feel comfortable with; suggestions will not be that much effective. You will know about standard books on bookstores or from concerned teachers. If you have any other query regarding NEET , feel free to drop a message . ",
