            "answer_text": "Most Universities pre-covid19 policies would still be in effect. However, post covid19, policy, changes would certainly override any changes prior to their inception. so, if a University decides, that to graduate or obtain credit for a class, the student must attend 75% of lecture, take 6 exams, and obtain a passing grade of 70% on final. Then call it what you want, that's what is required to pass. Which, was typical 10 years ago. I would add, it would have been extremely difficult to pass the exams without nearly 100 % participation in the lectures. ",
