            "answer_text": " Old Myanmar Handwriting Dear Charles, To a biometric graphologist your cursive handwriting in English indicates a person with a creative, logical, lucid, methodical, interestingly abstract mind who at this point may be feeling a bit cramped in life. The writer, who may be you, trusts to his \u201cgut\u201d (intuition) which speeds up the step-by-step logical thinking and gives you a quick read on people and situations. There are also signs of good organization skills, loyalty, and a lot more. However, at 16 you are still growing and experimenting in your life, as well as with your handwriting. A little of what shows in the handwriting may still be left-overs of whoever taught you the skill. (And you may even borrow a bit from old Myanmar scripts.) Ordinarily, our company does not analyze or evaluate people under age 18 because handwriting matures as the writers do and results are often misleading if examined too early. Our best advice is to find somebody (in person or via the web) whose character and accomplishments you vastly admire, and for a while avidly copy their handwriting (if you like it). That\u2019s what Ben Franklin did. He absorbed his heroes\u2019 best character and personality traits by counterfeiting their script. I\u2019d suggest you Google and locate the English handwriting of Franklin, Queen Victoria, President Obama, and also find a person who writes as they do in Myanmar. You will learn a lot if you put your mind and effort to it, and your script will gain richness, depth, and beauty as your mind expands and refines. Good luck. ",

The cursive adds loops and \u201cdangerous\u201d joinings (that will become illegible under speed). My only suggestion about your normal script is to change the r (so it looks like this typeface) and never connect the following letter. That will allow a clear letter form. For a more beautiful cursive, consider learning italic (Chancery cursive from the Italic Renaissance), a beautiful script designed to retain its clarity and elegance even when written rapidly. Here\u2019s an example (don\u2019t worry about the flourishes on the ascenders; they\u2019re for an edged pen. Just use a single downstroke.) Good luck to you!  ",
