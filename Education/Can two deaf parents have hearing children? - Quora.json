            "answer_text": "\u201cIs the offspring of two deaf persons also deaf?\u201d It depends entirely on why the parents are deaf. If at least one parent carries a gene for deafness, then there\u2019s a good chance of them having a deaf child. Of course, whether the gene is dominant or recessive makes a difference, too. There are many logical possibilities. Here\u2019s a grossly oversimplified description of how it works. We will pretend for the moment that only two genes for deafness exist. (In reality, there are more than 400.) \u201cD\u201d is a dominant gene for deafness. \u201cR\u201d is a recessive gene for deafness. (1) Parent A and Parent B both have D-type deafness. Parent A is probably Dd.Parent B is probably Dd.The logical possibilities for the offspring are DD, Dd, Dd, and dd.So we expect 3/4 of their children to be deaf.(2) Parent A has D-type deafness and Parent B has R-type deafness. Parent A is probably Dd.Parent B is dd. (We ignore the R-type deafness because the child won\u2019t inherit an R-gene from Parent A.)The logical possibilities for the offspring are Dd, Dd, dd, and dd.So we expect 1/2 of their children to be deaf.(3) Parent A has D-type deafness and Parent B is not a carrier. Parent A is probably Dd.Parent B is dd.The logical possibilities for the offspring are Dd, Dd, dd, and dd.So we expect 1/2 of their children to be deaf.(4) Parent A and Parent B both have R-type deafness. Parent A is rr.Parent B is rr.All of the children will be rr.So we expect all of their children to be deaf.(5) Parent A has R-type deafness and Parent B is not a carrier. Parent A is rr.Parent B is RR.All of the children will be Rr.So we expect all of their children to be hearing.(6) Neither parent has genetic deafness. Parent A is dd.Parent B is dd.All of the children will be dd.So we expect all of their children to be hearing.As I said, that\u2019s a grossly oversimplified analysis. I intentionally ignored all sorts of complications that might come up in the real world, in the interest of keeping my response to a reasonable length. Of course there are other ways for a deaf couple to wind up with deaf children, too. The child might be deaf for non-genetic reasons.The parents might have intentionally adopted a deaf child. (This is more common than you might think.)",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they can. Deafness comes from many causes, and not all of them are genetic. If the two parents are deaf for different genetic reasons, even a genetic cause won\u2019t pass on to the children unless it\u2019s a dominant gene. The only time you\u2019re guaranteed deaf children is if the two parents both have the same recessive genes for the same condition that causes deafness 100% of the time. (Parents who are deaf because of a disorder that\u2019s caused by a dominant gene can pass on the recessive, typical gene, and thus still produce a hearing child.) Deaf parents can raise hearing children with no more trouble than the typical parent has raising a child. Their language development will be just fine. Like any child raised in a household that speaks a language different from the people around them, they will learn their parents\u2019 language and the dominant language simultaneously. Young kids are amazing at learning languages; they won\u2019t even have to work at it, and will most likely be fluent in both signed and spoken language by three or four years old. A Deaf couple who badly wants to raise a Deaf child may be able to adopt one. I\u2019m not sure how long the waiting list is; adoption is always chancy. But if I were an adoption agency and had a child with a hearing impairment to place, I\u2019d preferentially put them with Deaf parents\u2014it\u2019s just so much easier for a child to grow up when their parents know the ins and outs of living in a world that\u2019s designed for hearing people.

            "answer_text": "Easy. Hearing people can be carriers of recessive genes for deafness. That means both parents must have the gene to pass on the trait, but with recessive genes, the trait will manifest only about 25% of the time. I know of an orthodox Jewish couple who had previously been married to other partners, and had had Hearing children in those marriages. But when they remarried to each other, they ended up with 4 Deaf boys. Recessive genes at work. And people don\u2019t always become Deaf from genetics. Two Hearing parents could have a child who got sick from certain diseases \u2014 meningitis, scarlet fever, some others, which can cause a person to become Deaf. Sometimes when a person gets severely sick, doctors give them medicines which can save their lives, but have the side effect of being ototoxic\u2014 causing deafness. Better Deaf than dead, I always say. And the child doesn\u2019t have to get sick either. The mother can. If she\u2019s pregnant with a child and gets sick with certain diseases \u2014 Rubella, CMV, toxoplasmosis, at the right time in the fetus\u2019 development, the child can be born Deaf, like me. And of course, the kid could always have some sort of freak accident making them Deaf. And FYI \u2014 90 % of Deaf people are born to Hearing parents. So, if you really want to eradicate deafness, start by outlawing marriages between (or at least childbirth resulting from) Hearing couplings. BWAAAAHHHAAAAHAAAAAA! ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes due to genetics, yes. Sometimes due to absolutely random acts of nature. I once knew a guy who got spinal meningitis when he was 2 yo and became deaf. His older brother by 2 yrs grew up with him and knew sign language. That older brother got spinal meningitis when he was 16 and, you guessed it, became deaf too. Sad thing, the mother never learned how to sign and would often communicate to younger brother via older brother. The irony, but it gets even more interesting. That older brother went on to marry a deaf woman who got sick with measles when she was 4 and became deaf. Their firstborn son was born straight out of the womb deaf, not sick or afflicted with anything. He went to NIH for answers but they couldn\u2019t find any known dna that causes deafness in his sample. My sample revealed I had the classic Anglo changed connexin26 sequence, the most common genetic deafness in white Northern European descendants. Funny, the younger brother married a deaf woman too and ended up having 4 children all with typical hearing. So, it can go either way. ",

So, for an example, my parents were both born Hearing, but when each was three years old, they contracted an illness that left them profoundly deaf. They grew up, met and married eachother, and had five Hearing children. next door to us was a couple with a different story. The husband was Hearing, the wife was deaf with a family history of genetic deafness. Of their five children, three were Hearing and two were Deaf. Their Hearing children went on to have all Hearing children. One Deaf child had no children that I know of, and the other Deaf child grew up to have two children, one Hearing, one Deaf. ",
