            "answer_text": "I always taught students 9\u201312; before that, I also sub all levels of instruction. My favorite grades were 11th and 12th, and my least favorites are 9th graders. But, of course, it all depends on the kind of population that attends the school in which you teach. I retired eight years ago, so we are talking about a very different kind of students, since then. I heard from ex colleagues, and other school personnel, that kids are so busy with extracurricular activities, and school clubs, athletics, fund-raising, and other matters, that they don\u2019t sleep enough and therefore, they are getting alienated and sick. In grade 9, students are very immature and don\u2019t look at the \u201clong picture\u201d for the most part. Or, if they do the picture they see is too naive and rosy. At the first school that I worked, with Blue Ribbon Awards and high academics, many freshman envision themselves at Stanford, Harvard and most of the Ivy League Universities. They felt entitled to As and A+s and complained when it didn\u2019t happen. Parents were too much involved, mostly making excuses for their kids who could not match their expectations. At the next and last school, it was the opposite, more than 60% were first or second generation of immigrants, and their panorama was narrower and darker. Parents didn\u2019t have time to come to our school and to presentations that would have helped them navigate the system. Of course we had some exceptions, students of different backgrounds from USA, Asian countries, India, Pakistan, etc. that made their way to the East coast schools, and then at our West coast, to Berkeley, and Stanford, UCLA, among others. Juniors and seniors are my favorites, because although they look so young, they mostly have adult problems that make them unable to fully concentrate on school graduation requirements. Many felt lonely, having their families across the border; a significant number of girls were pregnant or had babies, or boys who had already a pregnant girlfriend, or kids of their own. I am proud to say that I was a good ear for them, and seeing me as a mother figure, they trusted me by telling me their stories and life circumstances. Learning Spanish Literature was a great open door to learn and dream about feelings and a better life. They loved this class and so did I. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, the best grade to teach is the grade where you understand and enjoy the age level and the worst is where you feel frustrated and dislike the age level. I teach high school seniors, and I enjoy their camaraderie, their desire to be adults, and their passion for fairness and justice. At the same time, I teach freshmen who in so many ways are still middle school students, who have to work to stay on task, who are impulsive, and have the best time being together. Teaching well is not about what you know, it\u2019s about how you know your students and how you respond them as people. I have taught all levels, from Kindergarten through high school, and each level demanded different ways of understanding my students. While I find my skills as a teacher most specifically addresses seniors, I\u2019m sure that each good teacher has a different best grade to teach, but I\u2019m not sure a good teacher would use the word worst.

But sometimes twelves quit the year early and float, basking in the glory of graduating, when they haven\u2019t. They tend to be either over stressed, over tired, lackadaisical, or apathetic. And sometimes argumentative. But generally even they rock pretty good. Best? Hmmm. All. But perhaps ten. Mature enough, trainable, still very eager, and so much to learn and thus mentor and teach, about how to be a successful student and a good citizen. They are still thinking deeply and forming adult identity. Fun. Serious. And I can still be a bit of a tool and that grade seems most forgiving. Ha! ",

My wife enjoyed teaching preschool and elementary grades, our friend just enjoyed teaching middle school kids and I enjoyed teaching 11 and 12th graders. Neither one of the three of us would have enjoyed teaching the other\u2019s students. Personally, I don\u2019t know how anyone can deal with middle schoolers but then that\u2019s just me.
