            "answer_text": "A lot of the skepticism with online degrees comes from the unlimited resources of the internet. The thing that determines whether a degree is worth it or not is the legitimacy of the degree. Always look for accreditation. What is accreditation? Basically, accreditation is a status which indicates a school has met and is maintaining a high level of standards set by an accrediting agency. Why is accreditation important? If you go to an unaccredited program, you won\u2019t be able to request federal financial aid, you won\u2019t be able to transfer credits to another school, or obtain appropriate professional licenses to begin a career. *Important note: There are different accrediting agencies around the world. You may find a full list here. What are some examples? University of the People is an American-accredited, 100% online, which offers 9 degrees across 4 areas of study. Not only that, it is also tuition-free! It remains operational through the minimal processing fee you pay at the end of each course. A bachelor\u2019s degree will cost you around $1,000 a year. Columbus University is an unaccredited, 100% online institution that offers a large range of majors. Their website does not provide much detail regarding the cost of education or the school itself, so it is hard for me to provide more detail than that, but feel free to check out their website. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you are wrong. If an online programme is delivered by an accredited university, it is a legit degree in just the same way as any other degree. Why would whether you learn online or learn face to face affect whether it is valid? The content and the assessment are what dictate that. ",
