            "answer_text": "Yes, (here I am in school not paying attention). YES! It really is. To learn what you need is a good instructor, it doesn\u2019t have to be someone that you like, that will teach the material themselves. What I mean is that they will go over the material and show you the textbook, ask YOU questions(!) and give you time to go over it yourself. This is just you saying I don\u2019t like school and it isn\u2019t the best way to learn. No it is not, but it is VERY effective, all you need to do is apply yourself and pay attention. Learn from it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, School is an effective place for learning. Everyone learns differently, some individuals learn visually, by reading, auditory, hands on and etc. The key is finding out how an individual learns which makes great difference as they are in school. Individuals who excel in school are able to apply the way they learn best to retain information and apply it. For example: if you learn best by reading than you should always read the material( prior to class) , so when your teacher or instructor is teaching you will be able to retain the information better and ask questions on what you may not understand. Some individuals learn best through experience, so for them they should try to do what is taught in order retain best. Everyone is capable of learning, you just have to apply the strategy that works best for you. ",
