            "answer_text": "The way you asked the question is vague, so I\u2019m going to answer it a couple of ways. While you are in college: absolutely. If you want to earn merit based financial aid (or are already on it), want to pursue certain extra-curriculars, want the flexibility to get into certain majors, and want decent recommendations and/or help finding internships and such, your grades are important. That doesn\u2019t mean you need a 4.0; few students do that. But if you get straight Cs, you will graduate, but you\u2019ll close off a number of options for yourself unless you are just an amazing go-getter outside of the classroom. If you drop below C level, you might not graduate. Not doing well in your classes telegraphs to people that you aren\u2019t trying hard, and unless you go to a tiny college, there will be numerous people who are trying hard and doing well who are ahead of you in line for opportunities. I see this all the time at my job. Of course if you\u2019re trying hard and still getting bad grades, that\u2019s different, but that\u2019s also surprisingly rare. In that case, I\u2019d argue your college is failing you and not the opposite.If you want to go to grad school or a professional school (med school, law school): oh yeah, your grades matter. They\u2019ll be one of the major things that those places look at to judge your merit (along with test scores and the other things you did with your time).If you just want to get a degree and get a job: not so much. After college, if you aren\u2019t going on to grad school, people will rarely if ever look at your grades and generally won\u2019t care even if they do. In some rare instances companies will look at fresh-from-college applicant grades to see if the person did well or struggled in college, but for the most part your college grades don\u2019t come up. I get reference calls regularly, and no one ever asks me what grades a student received. The questions are always about effort, ability to work in a team, etc.That said, I\u2019ll share two stories to give this more context. The first is my own\u2014 I had a 3.9 GPA in high school, a 3.9 GPA in undergrad, and 4.0 in my masters and PhD programs. Each of those helped me (a bit) to secure the spot at the next level, but no one has ever asked me since receiving my PhD what any of my grades were. I needed them at each step because lesser grades would have meant less opportunities (and I had scholarships that I\u2019d have lost if I dropped below a certain mark), but otherwise, they didn\u2019t mean that much. I think this is actually the first time since PhD applications that I\u2019ve listed them all in one space. And no one is ever impressed by it or shows any sort of interest. All anyone cares about is that I finished my terminal degree. A second story\u2014 I am an academic advisor as part of my job now. I had a student who didn\u2019t take some of their classes very seriously a couple of years ago. Overall, the student was averaging right around 2.5 \u2014 between a C and a B. But in that student\u2019s minor, the average was 1.8. In order to receive the minor, which was also a requirement to graduate with the major, the student needed a 2.0 average in the classes that made up the minor. So that student, though they had otherwise done decent (2.5 isn\u2019t fantastic\u2014 but it\u2019ll get a degree), couldn\u2019t graduate. They had to take another semester with classes just within the minor (and get higher than their usual grade) in order to fulfill the requirement. It actually took over a year the way the math worked out. So in that case, grades were critical. Low marks cost that student over a year of tuition and a year-and-a-half of time in the workforce. It\u2019s all relative, really. It doesn\u2019t matter to get all As unless you have charted a path in your life where you\u2019d need to illustrate that you were that kind of student so you could continue on. At the same time, doing poorly can stop you from succeeding. I\u2019d suggest that effort is what matters and not the actual grades. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is an answer I just wrote for the question \"Are people justified in stressing over grades?\". The Point: The justification is subjective to the individual. One person's justification won't be enough for another. And one persons' non-justification isn't true for another. Case Study #1 Jim is  a 17 year old student. He is in his 2nd to last year of high school and this is the year where students his age take the SAT's . Jim want's to be a neurosurgeon. He knows that to become a doctor he has to ultimately complete a residency at a hospital. Before that, he has to earn his license.Before that, he has to complete 4 years of medical school.Preferably high MCAT scores.Preferably high undergrad GPA.Preferably a 4.0 in required classes such as Organic Chemistry, Chemistry, Biology etc.Before that, he has to take the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test).Before that he has to get a Bachelor's degree.Before that he has apply to college.Preferably high cumulative GPA.Preferably high GPA in AP / advanced classes.Preferably high SAT scores.Before that he has to take the SAT.As you can see, Jim is choosing a job that relies heavily on academic performance. It's not like Jim can self-study, take a test, get his medical license, and start performing brain operations on patients at the nearest hospital. To do so, he must jump through the many and strictly regulated hoops set forth by the government and medical associations. For Jim, it's either straight-A's, high test scores, or do something else. In this scenario, it's very easy to see why Jim would say, \"Grades are my life, I NEED to stress over them. Case Study #2 John is Jim's twin brother (Yes, they are identical). John likes technology. Specifically computers. He want's to be a developer. He knows that he ultimately wants to build apps for the Web and app stores.  Before that, he has to learn some coding languages. Let's say...HTMLCSSJavaScriptRubyRuby on Rails...and that's it.He now can start building his own apps and put them on the Web or submit them to app stores. And / or, if he wants, he can create an online portfolio showcasing his projects, and apply for a job as a developer/ software engineer for a tech company, or any other company with an opening in that position. Yes, some people who end up working for Google, Amazon, etc. get a 4-year degree in Computer Science, but it's not at all necessary to coding. In the tech field, what matters most is your skills and a portfolio showing what you can do. Bottom Line What do you want to do? What do you need to know or do to do it? Are grades necessary to get there / to start doing it? Do employers / customers in this field care whether you got A's in college or high school? If the answer to the last question is \"Yes\", then grades are probably important. But to what extent? If the answer is \"NO\", then why are you stressing? Your time & energy would be better used on doing what you know you want to do. In the end, it's a simple case of taking a step back and examining what you want to do. Hope this helps! :) ",
