            "answer_text": "Sorry man. It will sound little bit harsh. But If anyone knows this thing (hypothetically) why would he tell you? Why would just pass his wisdom to stranger? Think about it. But you are not convince my opinion that you can do one thing, start your TV. Go to business channel and blindly follow the person coming on TV show who calls themselves as a \u201cexpert\u201d. They surely have companies which will give you much more money than your expectation in short time. (Caution: if they are true in one company out of 10 company, in India there will be no middle class. All would have Audi and BMW cars outside their lavish houses.) Reality is that no one knows about it.(Based on today's price people tell that if they would have bought Apple or Amazon company's share in the past, they would be millionaire. But the truth is that there are also companies which are bankrupt now and if they invested in it, they would also have in same condition.) It is true that for long term investment, stocks are good return on investment(ROI). You have to be patient while investing. Stock market is closes to speculation. In which based on today's performance, investors are speculating on company's future and invest money hoping to get good return which turns sometimes good decision and sometimes bad decision. But in reality most of investor(read as people) who even don't what is company's product or how company is generating revenue, invest in company and feel miserable after losing money. Now come on your point. In this speculation game, you can turns odd on your side and reduce the risk by analyzing company( there is always part of uncertainty. No one can nullify uncertainty completely.) . For that you have to know how to read reading financial statements,how company \u2018s competitors are performing in product market etc. I can suggest you some books which are very good to learn how to analyze stocks. Beating the Street by Peter lynchOne Up On Wall Street by peter lynchOne who does not know about Peter Lynch Peter Lynch - Wikipedia Peter lynch is a fund manager at Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments in 80 and 90\u2019s . He was managing more than 12 Billion Dollar fund and successfully outperforming S&P 500 at that time. Both these books have very simple language for those who are not familiar with financial terms. As the book are of 1990s , you can\u2019t get the recommendation stocks from it but you get a glimpse how they analyze stocks. Following books are some higher level of knowledge. You need both patience and curiosity to get knowledge. The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin GrahamSecurity Analysis by Benjamin GrahamThe Essays of Warren Buffett by wareen buffett.The Snowball biography of warren buffett.Charlie Munger - Wikipedia Charlie munger , the man who have been financial partner to every move of Warren Buffet for more than 50 years told that people want to become rich but more quicker than they became. I hope that my answer will give you some insights ",

            "answer_text": "I have answered these types of questions earlier and I will continue to do the same. Investment: 1 lakh rupees;                      Return expected: 5 lakh rupees % return expected: 400%;                      Time horizon: 1 year With the time horizon being 1 year any good investment advisory will say, it is difficult to get returns higher than 7.5%. Also, you cannot invest in risky assets since the time horizon is too short. The best way to do investment without any capital loss is: Liquid Mutual funds - JM High liquidity or ICICI Pru Money market fund, who are offering around 6.5 - 7% post tax, choose the monthly dividend option. Fixed deposit is another option - but the interest rates are very low at 7.25% pre tax. Other than these options, Equity mutual funds, direct investing in stock markets are risky for capital protection point of view and rest of the options have a horizon of more than 3 years. If you are really lucky then you might buy a stock which can zoom 400% in one year. There are examples like Uniply Industries (low of Rs. 5 and High of Rs. 204) or GM Breweries (low of Rs. 100 and high of Rs. 1170). Incase you get to know of such a stock for 2016, please do let me know, so that I can also benefit from it.  ",
