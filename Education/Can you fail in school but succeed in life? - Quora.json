            "answer_text": " Picture via Instagram: School taught me how to flip a cup. Life taught me how to balance my relationships, what actions to take to make my aspirations come true and what I needed to make myself happy. Let\u2019s flip it. You can succeed in school and fail in life. School doesn\u2019t teach you emotional intelligence. Classes don\u2019t teach you how to balance your career and relationships. Phys-ed didn\u2019t teach you the difference between carbs and protein. When I graduate college I came face to face with the hard fact that I hadn\u2019t learned anything. I didn\u2019t know what my passion was. I had no clue how to make myself happy. I knew nothing about food and how to use it to fuel my body. You can succeed in life by deciding who you want to be and taking actionable steps to get there. Here\u2019s an excerpt from my answer: What can I do to make my life a success? \u201cGet out a pen and paper. Think to yourself, \u201cWho is the person that I want to embody/change into?\u201d Write down the top five qualities that they have that you want. Like this: The person I want to be is: An expert in their industryGenerousHardworkingA loving partner/significant other/spouse/etc.Great son/daughterNow create another list involving one action you can take today to embody these characteristics. Today I can: Read five articles on trending topics in my industryTip my barista or cab driver an extra few dollars, donate $5 to hurricane relief/charity of my choice, etc.Shut my phone off for two hours during work hours to maintain focusText my partner and tell them how much I appreciate them, bring them home dinner, do an errand for them, etc.Text my Mom and/or Dad and ask how their day is goingNotice that none of these actions are labor intensive or time consuming. Making this list didn\u2019t take you an hour and it didn\u2019t fry your brain. You can create this list everyday and change out the qualities that you want to embody.\u201d To see the full answer, click here. Don\u2019t think, \u201cI am failing at school, how will I succeed in life?\u201d Think instead, How do I focus on making sure that I am successful in my life?.  I went all in on my dreams of travel and just finished up backpacking Central America over the summer. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to be clear on what \u201cschool\u201d is. School is a body of study the school board believes is valuable for your integration into your society. Different societies teach different things. These courses have nothing to do with \u201clife\u201d. They have everything to do with surviving in your society. Sure you can succeed in life if you don\u2019t go to school. Humans are around 100,000 years old. Schools are probably a few thousand. Humans were successful long before schools and many societies, successful societies, exist today without the need for \u201cschool\u201d. They do need to pass on techniques for survival, which is a form of school, but failure there often means death. Check out the San in Africa. They are considered the possible start of mankind and they don\u2019t have schools. ",

Spending the whole day having a teacher attempt to ram a certain currriculum into my brain. If I spent time pursuing knowledge I prefered to learn, I seemed to do well. I really think we have a long way to go as humans, getting it right. We really lead awful lives for the most part. John Lennon said it best in his song \u201cWorking Class Hero\u201d. I do not believe success cannot be measured in dollars. ",

I started my first professional job. Let me label right/wrong in black and white color. In 2 weeks of my first job, I learned this world is all gray in color, only different shades of gray. I am a father. You cannot go to a college to learn how to be a father. I am an investor. Again, no college will teach you that. ",
