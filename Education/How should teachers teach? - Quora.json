            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s see, I guess I\u2019m not a teacher, but I can tell you what teachers have done to make learning a pleasant surprise, and what\u2019s boring and inneffective. Here are some ideas: Create Research-Oriented Projects: Whether it was a paper, poster, presentation or all three, I always seem to have more interest with the freedom to research without limits, without given reading material. It always makes topics easier to learn about.Focus on the Causes and Effects : It might seem easy to merely teach dates, and battles, and math equations to allow for practice and studying and to embed these into the students\u2026 don\u2019t do that, ever, and let me explain why: (in the case of a history class) teaching about losses, dates, battles, and leaders is all well and good, but what use is learning about history if students can\u2019t learn from history. History is full of small mistakes that grown in magnitude and rage on even now. Teach the least about when and who, and the most upon how and why. (In the case of a math class) Math is a logic puzzle with stepping stones into each problem/equation. Explain how the stepping stones are connected to simple, basic equations instead of teaching the equations themselves. Doing it this way allows for deeper understanding of the contents and makes it easier to connect. Truly, what use is the act of an Algebra 2 student solving rational equations if a student doesn\u2019t remember that all they sometimes look at are Pre-Algebra proportions?Use the Internet Liberally: I understand this is a slippery slope, but just read this through. I go to a school under the New Tech Program. We do a ton of projects, papers, speeches, etc. Also, we students have computers our school has given us, we have internet access and permission to use our computers in school. Guess what? They\u2019re a distraction. They\u2019re also an extremely useful tool. I admit fully that almost every student in my school has flaked off in class to play a random puzzle game from the Google Store, I also guarantee that having internet access has allowed them to understand any topic a teacher gives in less than a quarter of the time it takes a teacher to teach it. Students shouldn\u2019t be limited to textbooks or books on specific research when they have a near-limitless supply of information at their fingertips. I\u2019m going to assume that as a teacher, it would also be easier to allow the internet in a classroom because using a website to teach is more accurate and interesting (sometimes) than creating a lesson plan and teaching it themselves. It does more good than harm.Comedy, Drama, Shocking Facts, and Good speech tactics: Well, remember those Godforsaken speech projects you had in high school and college? Guess what you signed up to do for the rest of your life? <Look at that introduction to the section here. It feels conversational, kind of comedic. It\u2019s a hook. I was going to start the section like this> \u201cThese four pieces make things memorable\u2026\u201d but that is boring. That is how students get lost to the waves of the internet or conversation. Teachers should learn the audience and play to the strengths in a way that keeps the attention of the audience.Be willing to make mistakes, Be Gracious: The students are humans, and although the teacher holds authority that means they should be working for the students and should be willing to accept mistakes. Otherwise the class is disliked and no one want to learn because the teacher is hated. (If the teacher is a good actor, he/she could intentionally make mistakes to see if someone points out a mistake they\u2019ve made. Seeing a misstep taken by the teacher is bound to make a subject more interesting and memorable.Give Freedom: (More than one meaning to this:)Teachers shouldn\u2019t constrain students. Period. I love languages and I was excited to go into Spanish until I realized how much my teacher could ruin it. Instead of allowing me to use the class to attempt learning a language to the point of fluency, she pulled me backward and into her twisted curriculum. That is not effective, and although I still love Spanish, I always feel pulled backward in the class.A teacher should allow students to use different forms of research and find their own methods. There is a second way to solve any problem 90% of the time and if the student finds it, then the student should have their work appreciated, not demeaned. Forging ahead on a new path creates better solutions, and leads to more treasure than riding on a well-beaten road of normalcy.Create Change: Anything out of the ordinary, anything new, anything different will be a welcome addition for students. Create that state of panic and excitement that students get when they realize they\u2019re going outside to study whether they\u2019re going to make measurements of trees (Math), use words to describe something in complete detail without naming it (English/other languages), or learn about the countryside being involved in a long-forgotten battle(Social Studies/History), it\u2019s always better to catch students off guard with something more than a pop-quiz.Anyways, those are just some things I have both seen and experienced in a school environment. I hope they help to clear some things up. If anyone has edit requests, please tell me in the comments below! ",

            "answer_text": "However they want to. There are no recipes or formulae for good teaching. Different schools, and different classes, and different students each need different types of instruction and different types of help or leadership or motivation. There is no best way to teach. The only thing I can say is what you shouldn't do. Don't employ methods or approaches that research has demonstrated to be unhelpful or meaningless. Aside from that warning, if you have an idea, go ahead and try it. There is no reason not to. Just because it's different doesn't mean it won't work. And just because it's conventional doesn't mean it won't work either. But don't cling to anything that isn't working. Teaching is a lot of trial and error. There is a challenge in all this beyond it's essential difficulty. There are a number of educational theories that remain popular among administrators and the public despite the fact that research has proven them ineffective. The most noteworthy of these is Learning Styles. I have no good advice about what you should do when asked to utilize something proven ineffective. I usually pretend to utilize it. But I can't tell you if you should try to appease authority figures or not. Objectively speaking, it would be best if we could get people to abandon disproved theories. But it isn't always worth it in every situation. ",
