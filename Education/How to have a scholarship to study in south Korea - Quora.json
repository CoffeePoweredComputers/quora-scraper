            "answer_text": "The answer to this question varies greatly. There are some highly specific scholarships that only provide funding for the descendants of soldiers who fought on the site of the ROK during the Korean War (yes, you\u2019ll need to prove your grandfather came to fight in Korea). There are other scholarships that are offered to help people originating in one community (for example some large Korean churches help parishioners to study in Korea). The Korea Foundation and the Academy of Korean Studies offer scholarships for graduate students (if you can get into AKS as a grad student your entire education is free). The Korean government offers scholarships (and even dormitory housing). And of course each university seeks to attract highly qualified foreign students through specific scholarship packages. If you could go to Cambridge or Yale, but you\u2019ve chosen SNU, then SNU will find you a nice package. But if you\u2019re just another average fan of Korean popular culture, but didn\u2019t excel in high school, there aren\u2019t many scholarships available for you at the start (almost all Korean universities offer scholarships for the students with the highest GPA, although this doesn\u2019t cover all your tuition). Keep in mind that for undergraduate study most scholarships just help with tuition. The cost of transportation (flight to Korea), food, housing, your phone plan, and so on is going to be on you, and unless your Korean is pretty good, and especially if you can blend in (you look plausibly Korean), you cannot easily find part-time work. (Except tutoring, but building up tutoring clients takes some time and you\u2019ll need the right skills and qualifications). ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few different scholarships available. Luckily, many of them also aren\u2019t too hard to get! If you really want to study in Korea but don't know how you will afford it, there are many chances. However, it can take time and a lot of effort to get a scholarship. If you are really interested in studying in South Korea I highly recommend learning everything you can before coming.  As has already been stated by a few other answers, there are three main types of scholarships. Government ScholarshipUniversity ScholarshipPrivate ScholarshipI am unsure about the situation in other universities, but I will speak about Korea University as I have experience there. I am sure that at least the other SKY universities offer similar opportunities - possibly other universities also. Korea University Scholarships: GPA based scholarship (Graduate) | Undergraduate:100% of tuition costs \u2013 GPA above 4.0/4.560% of tuition costs \u2013 GPA above 3.5/4.5 (for humanities and social sciences)65% of tuition costs \u2013 GPA above 3.5/4.5 (for natural sciences and engineering)Need-Based Scholarship:50% of tuition costs \u2013 students who need financial supportAcademic Improvement Scholarship:50% of tuition costs \u2013 students who show a significantly improved GPAAs I mentioned above, these scholarships differ based on the university in question. However, I have found that most foreign students in Korea are actually on scholarships. On top of the government scholarships and university scholarships, there are also private scholarships which can be found. However, these really depend on your background, nationality, and more. Hence, I can\u2019t really list them all here! However, this site is a fantastic resource to see what scholarships are available and at what universities. I hope this answer helps and that you can come and study in South Korea if that is your dream! If you are interested in learning more about studying in South Korea, please feel free to refer to this article that I wrote last year! Thank you! ",

If its for a masters degree I recommend Korean Government Scholarship KGSP. They also have undergraduate scholarships but they are longer and harder to get. It\u2019s sponsored by the Korean government and it includes living expenses and tuition. The only down side is that you have to learn Korean and pass the TOPIK test which is the TOEFL(no speaking though) of Korean in one year. This is their website niied|Korean Government Scholarship Program. Depending on your country of origin, there are different amount of quotas. For instance, in my country it was only 3. You have to have good scores, keep track of the deadlines, submit a good application and be very motivated to study. And I mean it. There are other scholarships where you apply directly to the university but they seldom offer living expenses just the tuition. That means that you have to pay rent+food +everything else. Assuming you\u2019d want to come to Seoul, things tend to be a bit pricey here. If you venture to other cities, unless you are studying international relations or tourism (and in some cities not all of them) you need to understand Korean. University level Korean. Most Koreans struggle with English so finding an all English study program is pretty hard. But as I mentioned, it all depends on your major and city. It\u2019s totally doable though.

It\u2019s a very good opportunity if you intend to live for a long for a long time in Korea, and even if you don\u2019t still it\u2019s good as you will study Korean language for one year before starting your regular studies. You can find more information here niied|Korean Government Scholarship Program Second option is that you keep an eye on major scholarship posting websites and blogs and apply for GRA, Graduate research assistant. In this category, generally professor will recruit you as a researcher and you need to work under him during the study tenure. He will pay your fees and also will pay monthly stipend (the amount varies, depending on professor to professor). You can also go to major universities website and go to specific department sites. Majority of professors have their own website and link can be found from their profile on specific departments website. There you can see some listings of openings also and can apply directly. Even if there is no listings but you can see few foreigners and also research field matches your interest, then try luck and send an email directly to professor and inquire about an opening, attach your CV also. Important dates to remember, for spring semester starting in march, admission mostly starts from September of following year and for Fall semester, admission mostly started from May. ",
