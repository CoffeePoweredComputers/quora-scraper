            "answer_text": "In some respects, yes, I think so. It\u2019s been a common theme over the last hundred years ago, particularly following WW2 and the fall of the last major Empires, for the United States to declare itself \u2018The Greatest Nation in the World\u2019, and it has done so largely because it has military power far greater than any other nation, but also because it remained largely untouched by the wars that devastated the other major world powers. Yes, the US fought, but not on their own soil. And, yes, the US economically backed the Allies, but at a cost, one which has taken decades to pay back - and this is something the US has benefited from greatly. What we\u2019re left with, then, is an interesting problem. As an international power, the United States is unrivaled - no other nation can match it for military force, and therefore influence in geopolitical terms. However, this doesn\u2019t make it utterly without vulnerability - it is a nation dependent on foreign trade and alliances, as most large powers are. Domestically, however\u2026well, there\u2019s a whole slew of problems there. In terms of living conditions, I\u2019ll be blunt: the average American lives well below the standards of living you\u2019ll find in the rest of the civilised world. Land and large houses, certainly (though most build from cheap materials), but there\u2019s an absence of universal healthcare provision (which leaves many Americans having to choose between health and their wallets). Now, moreso than at any other time in history, Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, and find themselves frequently exploited by corporate interests that are left largely unchecked by the federal government - which is also why the US has some of the weakest labour protections in the world. Paid sick leave, paid maternity/paternity leave, paid vacations\u2026there are an awful lot of workers who lack these, and yet they\u2019re largely considered standard in many places in the world. And that\u2019s honestly just scratching the surface of where the problems lie. American Exceptionalism is a barrier to improvement in this regard: some will believe that the US is (falsely) greater than any other nation, and therefore assume that their poor standard of living is still better than the other civilised powers. Even when issues are recognised\u2026why would you borrow ideas and methodologies from countries that aren\u2019t as great as yours? You see the inherent problem in that: it\u2019s pure complacency, the assumption that being great doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be better, or that other countries can\u2019t find solutions to issue you\u2019ve yet to resolve. That observed, the exceptionalism that many Americans believe in is a false veneer, if I\u2019m blunt. There\u2019s a reason much of the patriotism witnessed in the US is a) overt and b) not practiced elsewhere in the world, except largely in authoritarian dictatorships, ones which survive on the predication that their nations are great (even when they\u2019re not!). The US needs to believe that it is great, if only to blind the population to the fact that, in reality, it isn\u2019t. Yes, it\u2019s a powerful nation, but not one capable of standing alone, contrary to what the isolationists will advocate. The projection of your military forces requires the consent of your allies (to access airspace, territorial waters, and to access our ports and place bases on our lands), and your economy simply doesn\u2019t generate enough to keep up with the vast levels of spending, which is why the US is perpetually in debt, and requires a significant amount of foreign loans and investments to stay afloat. It\u2019s utterly dependent on foreign trade, often regulated by carefully-crafted trade agreements (which the current President seems happy to tear to shreds, oblivious to the consequences). The funny thing, though? America could be exceptional, if only it would stop imagining that it already is. There\u2019s no aspiration to be better when you think you\u2019re already on top. And there\u2019s no sense of humility in examining what the rest of the world are doing and thinking \u201cYou know what? We could try that here. It might work for us\u201d. Things like adopting Universal Healthcare - common sense to the rest of the world - are nonetheless significantly opposed by the Republican Party. And don\u2019t even get me started on the crazy arguments over abortion, women\u2019s rights, racial equality, gun control - issues largely marginalised in much of the First World, but stacking up front-and-centre in the United States. There are days I honestly feel that the great promise of America has now failed. It shouldn\u2019t have done: the US had the potential to be truly great, but it\u2019s allowed itself to be bogged down by childish social policies, partisan bickering and an adherence to ultra-capitalism which initially generated wealth, but is now dragging everyone down, with citizens no longer resources to be cultivated and protected, but rather simply there to be exploited. Don\u2019t worry: there\u2019s always more where what came from. America may once have been great, but now? It\u2019s a third-world country with a first-world economy, and even then, one with such significant levels of debt that it\u2019ll take generations to wipe out - assuming that the spending doesn\u2019t just carry on, and raise that ceiling even higher. The assumption that the United States is exceptional, honestly, is part of what\u2019s holding it back from becoming exceptional. Put bluntly: you declared victory before you\u2019d achieved anything. And now the crown is claimed, but the head upon which it sits is ever-so-fragile. Someone has to wake up and fix that soon, that\u2019s for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "I think two different concepts are confused here: \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d and \u201cAmerican supremacy/hegemony.\u201d The first concept has its origins in the left and historical academia. It was used to explain why American class politics were uniquely different from European class politics and how solutions to American problems with class will have to take a unique character that doesn\u2019t quite fit in the international socialist puzzle of that period (1920s \u2014 forward.) The exact term \"American exceptionalism\" was occasionally used in the 19th century. In his The Yale Book of Quotations, Fred Shapiro notes \"exceptionalism\" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image by The Times of London on August 20, 1861. Its common use dates from Communist usage in the late 1920s. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin chastised members of the Jay Lovestone-led faction of the American Communist Party for its claim the U.S. was independent of the Marxist laws of history \"thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions\". Stalin may have been told of the usage \"American exceptionalism\" by Broder & Zack in Daily Worker (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. American Communists started using the English term \"American exceptionalism\" in factional fights. It then moved into general use among intellectuals. In 1989, Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted most American historians endorse exceptionalism. He suggests these historians reason as follows: America marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa. However, postnationalist scholars have rejected American exceptionalism, arguing the U.S. did not break from European history, and accordingly, the U.S. has retained class-based and race-based differences, as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war. In recent years scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask: Why has the myth of American exceptionalism, characterized by a belief in America's highly distinctive features or unusual trajectory based on the abundance of its natural resources, its revolutionary origins and its Protestant religious culture that anticipated God's blessing of the nation, held such tremendous staying power, from its influence in popular culture to its critical role in foreign policy? Some historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology, thereby avoid entangling themselves in rhetorical debates. Bernard Bailyn, a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, is a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, uses the phrase \"American exceptionalism,\" he insists upon the \"distinctive characteristics of British North American life.\" He has argued the process of social and cultural transmission result in peculiarly American patterns of education (in the broadest sense of the word); and he believes in the unique character of the American Revolution So as you can see, it is only recently that people (mostly non-Americans) use American Exceptionalism as a euphemism for \u201cAmerican Supremacy.\u201d In the past, American Exceptionalism was mostly used by the Left and the Academy to explain certain historical developments that were unique to the country controlled by the United States of America. I think the problem is that many people in non-American developed countries think there is some single route to history, some unified progress that the globe will pursue. Ironically, this ideology (and yes it is an ideology) is rooted in American progressivism of Wilson and Roosevelt, and was exported worldwide after the Second World War. It is an ideology which supports and protects American hegemony by stating that there need be one world order, one concept of \u201cprogress\u201d and all who dissent are reactionaries (rather than dissenters with a different idea of progress.) It is the basis for what the conservatives and reactionaries call \u201cGlobalism\u201d, but which the left calls \u201cGlobal neo-liberalism.\u201d A healthy American exceptionalism (which I think most common Americans have) recognizes that each geographical country as it interfaces with its various political institutions has a different history, the peoples in these countries have slightly different goals and wants, and that in this way every country and in fact regions within countries are exceptional and unique. Consequently, while it is useful to look at what other regions and countries might have progress toward, it doesn\u2019t help with solving the more fine-grained problems in the given locality. The urge to summarize history into one grand story is strongly being questioned in a post-modern America. This includes grand stories of \u201cAmerican superiority\u201d but also the \u201cprogressive\u201d grand story of \u201cone moral arc\u201d and their particularly progressive liberal idea that the globe has reached some kind of social-capitalist End of history. It is this rejection of Wilsonianism that high-brow European liberals have not yet recognized that the American populations have changed to be against. That the country controlled by the United States is unique, has a unique history, has unique social structures, and unique cultural trends isn\u2019t something that can be ignored, and in fact is something the American left (and right) recognizes quite a bit. You can\u2019t solve American social problems without recognizing the uniqueness of certain American institutions, cultures, and its history. ",
