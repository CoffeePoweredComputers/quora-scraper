            "answer_text": "For admission, yes. Although they require a very high percentage ( 95%+). The requirements may vary according to your degree. NUS & NTU also ask for your class 10th results but it is unspecified whether they base their admission decisions over them or require them for verification. However, Singapore is really expensive and if you are from a middle class household(just like me), you might need a scholarship. For that matter, class 12th result IS NOT ENOUGH. You need to have some achievement other than that. A good SAT score, leadership positions or extracurriculars. You also have to perform well in the interview, i.e. persuading them that you will stay for 3\u20136 years after your graduation in Singapore or work in a Singapore-based company abroad and that you cannot pursue your education without the scholarship ( In case you are not getting a clue of what I am saying, look up the scholarship portal of their website and look for MOE Tuition Grant). Hope this helps. ",
