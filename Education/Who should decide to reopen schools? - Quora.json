            "answer_text": "Until the last few decades, The Federal Government pretty much kept its hands off schooling. The word \u201ceducation\u201d does not appear in the Constitution. Traditionally, public schools have been the province of local school districts overseen, now, by state departments of education, which provide some funding and larger oversight. Some states, like Texas, prescribe what textbooks districts can adopt. Since most teachers are not well-trained in distance teaching, this year has been very difficult, as they try to learn new skills. They\u2019ve been at a real disadvantage. Furthermore, the media have been underestimating, even ignoring, the custodial nature of schools. Particularly in grades pre-K through 9, if both parents are to be able to earn a decent family income, they must have a place to send their children for supervision. In order for business to begin to hum again, kids need to be under supervision in school. That makes the decision especially difficult to make. President Trump\u2019s refusal to recognize the danger of Covid-19 and to lead a coordinated Federal effort to combat it has made a situation which might have been manageable into a real crisis. In the end, I think parents will decide who will take the risk of going to school. Until we practice simple mitigation strategies to get on top of the further spread of the disease and can rely on a vaccine, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re in for more difficulty. ",

            "answer_text": "This decision should be taken by whoever governs schools in the area in conjunction with the individual schools themselves. These would be school boards/committees, county officials or whatever group is responsible for the running of the schools at the local level. This should not be determined on an all or none basis, or by a vote of all the schools in the district. Conditions will vary, even across very small areas. Each school needs to demonstrate to the authority and public health officials that its risk assessments are robust and that the provisions are in place. Schools should only open if the \u201cR\u201d (reproduction/infection) rate is below 1. Some schools may not be able to operate with the prescribed social distancing, in which case, they probably should not open. Ditto those who cannot offer provision in bubbles and monitor them effectively. My schools have over 100 pages of policies and processes as part of their risk assessments. Many examples may be found on line, but this is not a one size fits all solution. Some schools in the same town may open while others do not. This is not a state decision nor is it in any way a Federal one. ",
