            "answer_text": "GIVING MY EVERYTHING NEET 2021 is just 7 months far, so basically we are about to reach the endgame for it. Before 13 Sept, I was solving the previous year JEE mains and advanced questions, HCV and coaching material etc etc, but this year\u2019s paper gave me a shock. I could solve any level problem but my speed was just too slow. I understood I am not going to make it in this way. I have completely changed my ways of studying and these days I'm feeling too motivated, exactly the same way I used to feel when I started. MAKING SHORT NOTES- seeing this year\u2019s paper I realized, it doesn't matter in what depth one has studied, if u haven't covered each and every topic even if it is superficial, u won't make it. So in short notes, I have started inculcating even small points and also theoretical parts in physics.For physics  Organic  For inorganic  BIO NCERT- right from the start, my prime focus was ncert only, reading and remembering extra stuff isn't my cup of tea. I have a short term memory. I used to feel very low after attempting allen tests as they include a lot of extra questions but after 13 sept paper, I'm quite motivated about reading ncert only and I have started reading it again, maybe its 4th or 5th time, I didn't count.STOPPED WATCHING USELESS YT CHANNELS- Now this is quite interesting, I used to waste my time watching *specific channels which are of no use. They have earned the rank by their hard work and dedication. Aspirants need to realize they arent there u help uh but to just build up an audience so that they can be entrepreneurs or sell up the course in the future or get associated with a platform. They arent doing bad, actually its good for them but not for aspirants. For guidance, use quora.STARTED SOLVING QUE WITH TIMER AND OMR- If there would be a competition for wrong bubbling, I'm sure i will win that. Im really bad at it but I never bothered much as I was busy solving questions and enjoying after getting the correct answer, not realizing the time i took for it. Recently, I started with time-bound questions. In bio for 90 que I took 50 mins with bubbling, guess what I bubbled 4 answers wrong, next time I will try doing it in 45 and reduce bubbling mistakes. Soon I am going to do the same with physics and chemistry.So That's all I am doing these days for NEET 2021, I am expecting 2021 to be the same as 2020 as there are no changes to be implemented soon. Like 2018 paper was of a similar level as that of 2017 but then NTA came into action so 2019 paper was a surprise and then AIIMS JIPMER merged so 2020 was a secret too. Going by these trends 2021 might be the same as that of 2020. All the best, fellow aspirants. P.S.- I won't like it if u would judge my handwriting after all I am preparing to become a doctor lol. EDIT 1- Thank you for 100+ upvotes. Felt more motivated. EDIT2- I am a fresher and a self study student. ",
