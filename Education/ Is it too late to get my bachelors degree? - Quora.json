            "answer_text": "You are 24 ...and what makes you think you are too late for college. I had some immigrants who were in their 50's attending school because their medical degrees were not honored immediately. My friend's father in law migrated from poland , he was a doctor back home. He came to US at age 42 with three kids , he started to work as a painter , house repairs once his daughters were older and married , he went for his boards , passed all three exams and completed a residency program and became a US certified doctor at the age of 56 .He did not shy away from what he wanted to do , he was focused and prioritized his plans. You are never too old to do anything provided you have health. Free your mind , open your thoughts, who is telling you \"you are too old\"...break the STEREOTYPES  , be the person who you want to be , have goals , find a mentor ....change your life , be an inspiration to others....another uncle of my friend who failed in his classes in India. Family shipped him to states because they thought he was a failure in India. He came to states , after a while he thought he could be a doctor because he saw someone driving a fancy car...he retired as the Chief Anesthesiologist of Johns Hopkins , had a life better than any of his sibling who were thought of as successful ones.

            "answer_text": "It is never too late. I'm a professor and program chair at a medium sized university. The average age of our continuing students is 37, and we have had many graduates in their 70\u2019s. I attend many information sessions for potential students. Many ask, \u201cam I too old to start a new career? I'm \u2014 (insert age here). It is never too late. You are only limited by your self-efficacy, motivation and work ethic. I got a degree in information systems, and entered the field at 41, with no prior experience. I became a successful consultant a few years later. I finished a PhD when I was over 50 and became a professor well into my 50\u2019s. I see people much younger then me say they wish they had gone to school and completed their degree. My response is, \u201cwhat is holding you back?\u201d It is easy to make excuses and rationalize. It is harder to have a dream and make it happen. Do it. Now. You won't regret it! ",
