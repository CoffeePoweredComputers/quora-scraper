            "answer_text": "Typically you would need to get a job as a scaffolders labourer. They will teach the ropes, and then if you stick it out long enough (it\u2019s tough) you can be offered the chance to undertake your scaffolders ticket which is required in the UK to be able to erect scaffolding and certify it safe without relying on another scaffolder to be present. As far as I am aware there is no such thing as scaffolder school or courses. As with many \u2018unskilled\u2019 trades, it will start with a labouring job and working up to the required skill level for a certificate of competence/safety. I know many scaffolders who have worked their whole career without the ticket as they always work with someone who does have a ticket. You need to be fit and strong, willing to work in all weathers, good with heights, and dangerous working environments. It\u2019s not for everyone, but I know many who love it, however be prepared to prove yourself to a tough bunch. ",

            "answer_text": "Setting up a scaffolding is a task that only professionals can do. So if you are someone who needs this structure for a construction project, I suggest that you work with scaffolding specialists such as Royston Scaffolding. Doing this will save you from the hassle of handling such complicated task and reduce the chances of accidents. Furthermore, if you work with experts, you can be sure that your scaffolding will be properly installed and has no complications. ",
