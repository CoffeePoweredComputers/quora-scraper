I\u2019m not an education professional, but it seems to me that the purpose of school is to train young people to be productive members of society. \u201cFun\u201d is more of an afterthought to keep those young people engaged and active in spite of the compulsion that they attend. This compulsion is important for society which needs future obedient workers with at least some minimum combination of skills and capability, but it is not nearly as important for the young person. I think any argument that traditional schools meet the needs (as defined by any major school of psychology) of a young person would be specious at best, if not downright laughable. From a biological and human development point of view (not societal development, but actual individual development), school as it operates in the United States might just be the worst possible thing we could subject young people to. Just walking up from the base of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy, factors that play into this would include: the denial of physical movement when desiredcompulsory - instead of needs and interest based - exploration of topicscompulsory exposure to unsafe environments (in cases of bullying especially) that directly violates our biological and psychological drive to remain in safe environmentsdenial of the love & belonging that is (hopefully) inherent in the home and by no means guaranteed or even likely for a large number of students.esteem of your peers denied unless you conform to the values of the most popular tribe (and tribes is what I\u2019d call most groups of children). Even if you have it, it\u2019s fickle and fleeting, unlike the esteem you\u2019d find closer to home.self-actualization denial thanks to the limits of state-proscribed tracks which likely do not fit the needs of even a tenth of any student body. You excelled at math? So what. You could excel at any number of things that you might care more about if left to your own devices, but you have to get to history class instead.In this way, and with more than a few minutes time, I could probably show ways that modern education in the US denies more students of their base physiological needs than it supports. School exists to serve society, not the students that fill it. For this reason, school is not a place to grow freely, it is a mediocre place to learn, and - if it ever is fun - that\u2019s only by a combination of chance and the concerted efforts of people who want you to stay engaged so that you may serve them better later on.

            "answer_text": "I always loved school, so I\u2019m not speaking about myself. However, I think one needs to examine the individual student and where/what they are studying, their motivations for it and their age. Is your question about K-8? High school or university? In K-12 students must attend so even if they are not academically inclined (i.e. hate to study) they are forced to. Nobody likes doing something that they don\u2019t want to do and that someone else makes them do. As children they have little choice. Even if they are at the most innovative in teaching, wealthy school in the country, they still are not going to like it because they don\u2019t want to be there. That said there are many students who are in K-12 in schools that have boring teachers and classes and even if they are motivated to learn, some become discouraged or lose the motivation because of the teaching style or the environment. Obviously in a school that is falling apart or where the students don\u2019t have enough materials (books and lab supplies) that is going to impact their motivation, engagement and learning. Even the most enthusiastic and intelligent student would have to work hard to succeed in such an environment. If you mean college, it used to be that students attended because they LIKED academics and were prepared to go in K-16, or they had a particular career in mind, (like MD), that requires the college degree and perhaps graduate study. Nowadays, students feel like they MUST attend college just to get a decent job in anything, and even the students who did not like to study as children now are attending college. Just like with K-12 students, if you don\u2019t want to be there, and you feel you have no choice, you are going to HATE IT. ",
