            "answer_text": "Without using technology? Do you fully grasp the original intended meaning of the word? Our technology was simply different. If mum wanted to track our wearabouts she could phone several people in different directions to see if we had been spotted nearby. Whether we were down the woods, or skateboarding a nearby hilly road, playing hom pom or bulldogs out front of all of our houses, or all the way up Leggats swimming, we would tell our mums where we were going or where we were likely to be and there were neighbours, grand parents, other people's aunts and cousins who could be asked for updates on what we were up to for a 3 mile radius in a quiet village. We had pay phones, bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, and trains and buses. At home we had the first home computers and VCRs and microwaves and dishwashers and some of us even had dial up modems before 1989. I didn't. But I did have a digital sound recording gadget on my Spectrum + 48K for sampling and playing sounds like a synthesiser. That was marginally less fun than finding an abandoned scooter and dirt biking around a building site, but never mind. This is the thing. We had computer games. We had consoles. We had VCRs and later on we had CDs and then DVDs, but even people born 18 years after I was remember playing outside a lot more. We made rope swings. We climbed trees We played outdoor chase and tag games of many varieties. We built tree houses and top secret camps deep in the woods We made pillow forts in our rooms complete with lego lights and old blankets. And we were trusted to not get ourselves killed because of course we had to be treated like independent grown ups some time. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, not sure if you count flashlights as technology, but when my best friend and I would have sleepovers in the summer we loved to play flashlight tag outside, lol\u2026 In all seriousness, as the other answer says we did have technology like Atari, TVs and VCRs, home computers, but I don\u2019t think we spent anywhere near as much time on them as today\u2019s young generations spend with smartphones and video games (well, maybe some of us did, but my friends and I were outside having fun more than sitting glued to the TV or video games).
