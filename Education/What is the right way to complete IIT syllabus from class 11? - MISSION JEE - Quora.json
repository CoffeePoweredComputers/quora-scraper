            "answer_text": "There is no right or wrong way as such.. It depends on how you want to do it\u2026. What will be the most comfortable way for you to do it. Complete a certain no. of hours of study per day. Or complete a certain number of topics, certain number of questions and certain amount of revision part per day. Are you more comfortable in timetable or tasktable?  This is one question you need to answer yourself. Find your comfortability. After you find out what you are more comfortable with. Act accordingly For timetable  You need to fix the no. of hours you want to study. Count the no. of months you have for 11th (excluding 1 month for practicals and exams) and divide with the no. Of chapters of each subject. Say for eg. Your 11th started from April. So, you have 10 months to complete the syllabus of 11th. 11th physics has a total of 15 chapters. So you need to cover 1.5 chapter of physics per month to be completed by your syllabus by time. And likewise for 12th. For task table You need to fix your daily targets.  Like I need to complete 1 topic of physics, 1 topic of chemistry and 1 topic of maths today. Along with this I will practicing 20\u201320 problems of each subject. In the starting your targets needs to be small and after that you can increase it with tym. This was all about timetable and task tables. Now, the do's and don'ts Make your own notes.. while you're reading a particular chapter, keep two copies with you. One for short notes and another for writing all the formulas related to that particular chapter. Your own notes will help you a lot while revising.Don't ignore NCERT - you need to read NCERT line by line and understand it thoroughly.Do revise regularly - If you won't revise you will forget everything you studied. Keep your weekend only and only for revision.All the formula should be at your fingertips.Conceptual part should be crystal clear to you. Otherwise you won't understand what to apply to which questions specially in physics.Don't compare yourself with yourself friends. Compare yourself with yourself only.Never never keep backlog\u2026 it only piles up thingsAfter completion of each chapter, practice all the objective questions you find, it will make the chapter more clear and will also build confidence.Divide your syllabus in such a way that you will complete it by November. You will be left with one & half month for revision only. When you start your 12th syllabus, revise 11th side by side.  All the best!! Hope it helps!! ",
