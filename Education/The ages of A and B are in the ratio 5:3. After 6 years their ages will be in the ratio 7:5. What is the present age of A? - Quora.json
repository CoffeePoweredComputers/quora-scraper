            "answer_text": "A:B = 5:3This can also be expressed as a fraction, when the given values are reduced (for example, 21/15):A/B = 5/3 You can solve for either A or B here, but let\u2019s solve for AFirst, multiply both sides by B:A = (5b)/3 In the second equation, A and B both increase by 6:(A+6)/(B+6) = 7:5 recall that A = 5b/3 So substitute for A in the first equation:((5b/3)+6)/(B+6) = 7:5Multiply both sides by (b+6) to get rid of the denominator((5b/3)+6) = (7(B+6)/5 Now, expand the parentheses on the right side:((5b/3)+6)=(7b+42)/5 Drop the parentheses on the left side (5b/3)+6 = (7b+42)/5 Multiply both sides by 15 to get rid of both denominators 15(5b/3)+15*6 = 15(7b+42)/5(75b/3)+15*6 = 3(7b+42)Use FOIL on the right side:(75b/3)+15*6 = 21b+12625b + 90 = 21b + 126 Subtract 21b from both sides, then subtract 90 from both sides:4b = 36Divide by 4:b = 9 Now go back to the very first equation and pop in 9 for b:A:B = 5:3b = 9A/9 = 5/3Multiply both sides by 9:A = 45/3A = 15 Now go back to the second equation from the question and substitute and see if it fits: (A+6)/(B+6) = 7/5(15+6)/(9+6)=7/521/15 = 7/57/5 = 7/5 So the ages are 15 and 9.

            "answer_text": "Let the rationale between ages of A and B be x The ages of A and B are in the ratio 5 : 3. Hence their age, A's present age 5x and B's present age 3x After 6 years their ages will be in the ratio 7:5 After 6 years their ages will be A's age 5x + 6 and Bs age 3x + 6. The ratio of ages will be 5x + 6 / 3x + 6 = 7 / 5 Cross multiplication 5 ( 5x + 6) = 7 ( 3x + 6 ) 25x + 30 = 21x + 42 25x - 21x = 42 - 30 4x = 12 x = 12/4 x = 3 The rationale is 3. Hence the ages A's present age = 5x = 5 \u00d7 3= 15 years B's present age = 3x = 3 \u00d7 3= 9 years Answer A's present age is 15 years ",
