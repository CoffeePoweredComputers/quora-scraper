            "answer_text": "It depends largely on security level and at times the specific prison. But if you\u2019re in a Camp, Low or even Medium security prison and just follow basic rules and prison etiquette it\u2019s really not that bad. I did most of my time at a low and sucked because it was prison but it wasn\u2019t awful. The only thing really bad about the prison I was at was that it didn\u2019t have any AC in the housing units and this was Virginia. So during the Summer you felt like you were going to die. The units were like ovens inside. You had to shower with cold water right before you went to sleep just to be able to go to sleep and you\u2019d still wake up drenched in sweat. Other than that, it was mostly boring and you miss freedom. I had some good news there, believe it or not and I made good friends too. I laughed. I had deep, intellectual conversations. I learned a lot about myself, others and humanity. It wasn\u2019t all bad. It was an experience, I\u2019ll say that much. My best advice is do the time, don\u2019t let the time do you. An old head told me that very early on. Make the most of it. Don\u2019t let it just be wasted. Learn that skill, write that book, get spiritual, help people, get in shape\u2026 just do something to make it so it\u2019s not just wasted time from your life. Because the hardest part of doing time is the fact that you\u2019re stuck in limbo and the world on the outside is still moving right along without you. ",

            "answer_text": "It is relative to where you are designated and the level custody you are in. Over a 5 year period I was housed in Atlanta Pen, Yazoo City and Coleman. Yazoo was about as nasty and unbearable as it got. Back in 2002\u201306 it was very violent. It was a punitive prison housing inmates kicked out of other prisons. It was a closed compound and the staff was about the most uneducated people who could fill out an application in Central MS. Seriously these were the dumbest individuals all the way up to unit managers. I was transferred during my last year in prison to the Fed prison at Colman FL. While it was the same security level as Yazoo it was completely different. Only saw one fight the entire year at Coleman vs Yazoo being a weekly ordeal. ",
