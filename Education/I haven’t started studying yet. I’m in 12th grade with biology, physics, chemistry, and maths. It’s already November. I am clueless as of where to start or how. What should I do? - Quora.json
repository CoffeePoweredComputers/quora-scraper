Physics : Do concept based study ,read NCERT multiple times and solve PYQ multiple times don't skip making formula sheet of every chapter side by side so that you can revise that on the exam.day well All the best\ud83d\udc4d That's it Stay home stay safe \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 ",

It's when u are relaxed that your brain functions well. Observe it and u can realize that. When your brain works well,u can study well. Meditation is the ultimate relaxation. If u meditate for just a few minutes daily, u can study a lot in less time. Yes. Do it and see. I recommend that u attend the Online meditation and breath workshop(Happiness program) of Art of Living as soon as u can. I also recommend regularly practicing the guided meditations by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in YouTube. ",

As cliche as it may sound, but these are bibles for boards. Doing these are very important, what you do ahead of them is your choice. NCERT for chem is more than enough for boards. In chemistry, do ALL the back exercise questions atleast thrice before boards..you've ample of time. Do not miss out on past year board papers and sample papers..they help a lot more than one thinks. And start right away! Don't get stressed, you'll get through with a good score. goodluck! ",
