By chance, the circumstances were in our favor, we got an invigilator who was very easy to handle, although I had to be much cautious all the time as my mother was a teacher in the same school and I had to take utmost care of her respect. I somehow managed to exchange the answer sheet through the aisle near the benches. Twist : I got the highest in Chemistry But that was the first and last time, I cheated in some exam. ",
