            "answer_text": "A nice timetable must look like this. Quantitative aptitude \u2014 1:30-2 hrs. Reasoning ability \u2014 2-2:30 hrs. More time because topics like seating arrangement, puzzles, machine input are time consuming. English \u2014 1-1:30 hrs. Give 30 mins to newspaper reading and rest of the time in practicing quizzes of exam oriented topics. General awareness \u2014 30-45 mins. Daily news and some static gk on day wise basis. Computer is not there in every exam so, it can be started 15-20 days before the exam as the questions asked are not of very high level. This is a general division of time. One can extend or reduce it for any section according to the strength. All the best !! ",
