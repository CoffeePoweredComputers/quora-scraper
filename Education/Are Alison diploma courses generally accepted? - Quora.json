            "answer_text": "Absolutely NOT. At least not in North America. Generally speaking, a 100% online school is NOT consider equivalent to a physical college, and being \u201cfree\u201d it has even less standing. You may get some unofficial credit for having taken \u2018self-improvement\u201d courses at Alison, and the courses *might* be useful to help someone catch up to the education levels in the US and Canada. Specifically with regard to Alison: No certified college or university can or would accept an Alison course for credit towards a degree, and I am almost certain that an employer would view an \u201cAlison Diploma\u201d as a joke. ALISON IS NOT \u201cACCREDITED\u201d BY ANY SCHOLASTIC AUTHORITY ANYWHERE. That means the courses CAN NOT be counted towards any degree program by an accredited college or university. ",
