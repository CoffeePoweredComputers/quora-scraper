            "answer_text": "I graduated from a hospital affiliated nursing school. 3 years of hands on patient care and theory and received a diploma. An Associats Degree is still available but most employers want BSN entry level nurses. If you are an Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurse you can find programs that will allow you tor transition LVN to BSN/MSN program. I have worked with nurses of all levels and the LVN to RN, AD and Diploma program nurses were not afraid to get their hands dirty and do the hard work along with all the paper work necessary to complete their job. No matter what degree you receive you can not work as an RN unless you pass your state boards! You can not be licensed and again no matter what degree you receive all the way up to doctorate if you do not pass the board you are not a Nurse. As nurses we need to get away from, \u201cI have a BSN, MSN, DNP/PHD because RN is the most important\u201d. Knowing why we do things and evidence based practice is wonderful and the nurses who choose research are wonderful. We need you all. Choose the course that makes you happy. The difficulty is that the more letters after your name sometimes their farther away from patient care you get. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say the BSc course is better, however. Obtaining a BSN will allow you to further your education and open certain doors that may have not been/be available with a Associates of Science in Nursing (ASN) degree. The BSN allows you to go after your Masters and then some. Personally, I had a Bachelor\u2019s degree prior to going back to Nursing school. I ultimately felt that since many of the Hospital systems in our area require a BSN or to obtain a BSN without 2\u20133 years of employment at that facility. I didn\u2019t want to keep going back to school, especially for a ASN-to-BSN Bridge program. ",
