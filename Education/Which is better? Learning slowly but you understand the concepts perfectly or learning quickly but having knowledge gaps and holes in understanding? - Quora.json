            "answer_text": "Everyone will give you a different answer depending on what works for their particular situation.  You will be better off deciding this on an individual basis for each learning project. Generally you should be more slow and methodical when learning a subject that has a high lifetime value, meaning learning that info or skill will pay off big over the next however many decades of your life. When the stakes are lower you can afford to have more holes in your knowledge and that will be optimal.  Also factor in your motivation. If slow and methodical kills your drive then don't do it. Most people are unsuccessful because their motivation is weak, not because they are slow learners or low iq.  Being able to learn fast only matters if you are motivated well first.  From iPhone  ",
