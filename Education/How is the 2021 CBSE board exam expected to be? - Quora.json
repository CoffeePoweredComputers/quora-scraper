            "answer_text": "Hi, The curiosity is obvious. Though due to this COVID-19 outbreak, the situation after this will not be the same now, many things and system are gonna be changed in our day to day life and in the world, many technological advancements will take place and also many existing systems and processes will be discontinued. Now coming to the point, CBSE is a totally independent body within itself. It can implement and discontinue its own decision at any time. Like for example : CCE pattern was discontinued.CBSE class 10th exam 2020 was supposed to be held after this lock down but it has been cancelled nationwide.For class 12th exam 2020 only the examination for major subjects will be taken.Delhi students will only be giving the exams and not whole India.etc. are many things which are declared at a sudden. Though there are lot of factors discussed before announcing any rule & regarding welfare of the students. So it will be totally a useless thing to predict that what will CBSE do in 2021. Yes, its true that some changes in the pattern and system might be introduced but there is still time. And no matter, whatever will be the decision one will have to abide by those. So, lets not worry about this better focus on the target\u2026.and one should always be mentally prepared to deal with any type of situation/challenges that\u2019s how you develop a self esteem within yourself. Edit 1: Looking at the present situation CBSE has already decreased the syllabus and classes are also being conducted online. Also even after all the chaos nationwide govt. still conducted NEET (pen & paper based) and JEE as well taking all the possible measures and arrangements. So better keep preparing, in whatever way the board exams will be conducted you will anyway have to appear for it. Hope this helps\u2026 \u201cLive life king size\u201d Thank you!!! Good Luck & All the Best :) Feel free to connect\u2026 ",

You are asking something which no one can answer. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 CBSE is tough to predict they have a habit to surprise students with their variations in conduct of examination. Let me tell you the previous year analysis. 2015 : Mathematics was a nightmare to the students. In 2016 mathematics was expected to be the easiest paper but it was even more tougher than 2015. So in 2016 cbse again gave shock to all the students. In 2017 when everyone was expecting mathematics to be the toughest, It tourned out to be the easiest. Every Question was from NCERT not even a single Question was outside NCERT. Again CBSE left the students in Surprise. Then comes 2020 physics paper it was expected that physics exam will be easier than earlier since there was a change in paper pattern. Everyone was expecting easy paper but it's old habit of CBSE to show\ud83d\udd95to the students expectations and again 2020 physics exam tourned out to be a nightmare for the students. \ud83d\ude02 I won't give you false hope but don't keep any expectations from CBSE. Cbse might surprise you too so its better to be prepared for the worst case scenario.\ud83d\ude42 One last suggestion at the end : Practice like you never won And Perform like you never lost. \ud83d\ude42 ",

Now coming to the point, CBSE is a totally independent body within itself. It can implement and discontinue its own decision at any time. Like for example : CCE pattern was discontinued. CBSE class 10th exam 2020 was supposed to be held after this lock down but it has been cancelled nationwide. For class 12th exam 2020 only the examination for major subjects will be taken. Delhi students will only be giving the exams and not whole India. etc. are many things which are declared at a sudden. Though there are lot of factors discussed before announcing any rule & regarding welfare of the students. So it will be totally a useless thing to predict that what will CBSE do in 2021. Yes, its true that some changes in the pattern and system might be introduced but there is still time. And no matter, whatever will be the decision one will have to abide by those.
