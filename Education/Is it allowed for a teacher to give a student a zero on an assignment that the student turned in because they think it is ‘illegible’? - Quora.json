            "answer_text": "Whenever I give my students an examination, one of the standard instructions I include on the cover sheet is: \u201cIf I can\u2019t read it, it doesn\u2019t get credit.\u201d I do not take points off for bad handwriting. I do make an honest, good-faith effort to read my students\u2019 responses. But if I can\u2019t figure out what you said, I\u2019m not going to track you down and ask you to decipher it for me. Although it probably doesn\u2019t feel like this to you at the moment, your teacher has done you a huge favor. Part of your teacher\u2019s job is to help you develop good habits that will enable you to succeed in the working world as an adult. And one of the habits you need to get into is the habit of turning in neat, legible work. When you hit the \u201creal\u201d world of adulthood, turning in sloppy work is a good way to get fired from your job. Employers don\u2019t tolerate illegible work product. By giving you a zero on the assignment, your teacher gave you an inexpensive lesson in the principle that you can\u2019t get away with producing shoddy work. You\u2019re far better off learning this lesson early in your life, when the stakes are still low, than waiting to learn it later in life, when the stakes are higher. The wisest thing you can do with this zero is to take the grade your teacher assigned you to heart, and not make the same mistake a second time. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the reason. Here are a few examples and conclusions for each one. The teacher has the same policy for all students. Your classmates either turned in assignments which were easier to read, or received the same grade. Conclusion: You need to fix your handwriting. Either learn to write more neatly, or if there\u2019s a reason you can\u2019t, type your assignments. If there\u2019s a reason you can\u2019t do either one, have a mature conversation with your teacher in which you acknowledge their right to receive readable work from you, and work with them to find a solution. Involve your parents as necessary, and any specialists (e.g. doctors) if you have a physical limitation that prevents you from turning in legible assignments like the other kids.You believe that your teacher has a different policy for you, compared with the other students. You\u2019ve seen other kids\u2019 homework and it\u2019s as difficult to read as yours is, but this punishment is enforced for you, but not for them. Or, other people say your handwriting is very neat, and you believe the teacher is using this as an excuse to give you bad grades. There are other issues where the teacher is harsher with you than with others. For instance, other people talk in class and they don\u2019t punish them, but if you talk, you get sent to the principal. Conclusion: talk with your parents. The teacher may be bullying you which isn\u2019t acceptable. You and your parents might ask for you to be transferred to a different class so you can avoid that teacher. Warning: Don\u2019t use this as a strategy if it isn\u2019t true. Ask a teacher you know likes you to give you an honest assessment of your handwriting before concluding the teacher is biased. Be honest with yourself. Making excuses tends to follow you around and weaken you, not to mention being immoral.You know you\u2019re in the wrong and your paper wasn\u2019t legible, but it\u2019s the first time and what you really want is a break. Conclusion: Go to the teacher, sheepishly apologize, and ask if you can rewrite it and turn it in again. Don\u2019t complain that it isn\u2019t allowed for them to grade you. If you\u2019re honestly contrite, your teacher is more likely to give you a break. Think about how annoying it is for the teacher to have to read through 30 assignments if they have to puzzle out what each word says because students didn\u2019t take the trouble to write neatly. Then think about whether your boss one day will want to do that. Go to your teacher in that state of mind.",
