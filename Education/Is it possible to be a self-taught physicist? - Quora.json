            "answer_text": "For the most part, I would say no. Physics is a field that is very difficult to get into, and requires years of advanced training that would be almost impossible to attain on one\u2019s own. There are a few exceptions, but they are not the rule. For some fields, I would out and out say no, as I explained here:Pete Peterson's answer to Is it possible to be an entirely self-taught theoretical physicist? However, I would like to say that I have known many self taught astronomers, especially in observational astronomy, where the knowledge barriers to entry into the are significantly lower. Very few who are self taught have been able to make this their career, though. On the other hand, I did have one professor that taught astronomy at the university I attended for my undergraduate work who had successfully made the transition from amateur astronomer to professional. He had been an engineer for his entire working life, but had always had a passion for astronomy. He learned about it on his own, made friends at the local observatory, and got involved. He ended up publishing a few papers, and was able to parlay this into an adjunct teaching job. From there, he was able to get a PhD from an accredited foreign university by writing a thesis on instructional methods in astronomy. He was then hired to teach all of the astronomy courses, and given a semi-permanent job. He wasn\u2019t tenure-track, but he was able to become a full time professor in astronomy. So, I suppose that my answer would have to be yes, but I would caution you to remember that it\u2019s very unlikely and carries some very serious caveats. That is, I wouldn\u2019t bet on it, but there are ways to do it if you really want to. ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on how you look at it. You see people learn how to catch a fly ball in baseball all the time. Most people can stand on a curb, look at an oncoming car or truck, and have a good idea if they can safely step off the curb and walk across the street before the car hits them. Seems like some self-taught physics to me. Perhaps not the underlying academic formulas, but certainly an understanding of the principles (of motion, in those cases). As for formally self-teaching physics, how can the answer be a universal \u201cno\u201d? In general I\u2019d say that most people can\u2019t self-learn physics, but how about Isaac Newton? He did a pretty good job. ",
