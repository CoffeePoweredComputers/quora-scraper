            "answer_text": "Which books are best depends entirely on your level of sophistication. I\u2019ll start at the calculus level and work my way up. Michael Spivak\u2019s Calculus is a classic. A good text after that is Kenneth Ross\u2019s Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus. At that same level is Walter Rudin\u2019s Principles of Mathematical Analysis (sometimes known as \u201cbaby\u201d Rudin). At the next level, there are the standards - Rudin\u2019s Real and Complex Analysis, H. L. Royden\u2019s Real Analysis, Tom Apostol\u2019s Mathematical Analysis, P. Halmos Measure Theory. For a different take, you might look at J. Dieudonne\u2019s Foundations of Modern Analysis followed by his five-volume treatise Treatise on Analysis. I hope those suggestions help. ",
