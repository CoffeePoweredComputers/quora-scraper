            "answer_text": "This is a question many of the JEE-aspirants seek answer to at some point of their preparation or maybe even after the journey of preparation. To be honest, I too often ask myself such questions. Let\u2019s strategically come to a conclusion. Starting with the players of the game, the students. Many of the students preparing for JEE seriously have an inner thirst for knowledge and science. A good number of them think critically and analytically when it comes to solving mysteries or regular doubts based on day-to-day life. Like, during my days of JEE, I had always wondered how Rolle\u2019s theorem and Lagrange\u2019s theorem were derived rather than simply rote-learning the formulae and applying them in solving numerical problems. Many a times, the student wonders, am I the guy made for solving JEE problems or were I made to solve unsolved mysteries of nature or were I made to derive proofs of several tricky and not-so-easy theorems all by myself (not referring any book for the derivation). Why am I wasting 2 years of my life mugging up crazy formulae and theorem and then solving random 5 minute questions?Sometimes, out of fatigue, students start losing hope of clearing the test and automatically such questions begin filling up their minds.Now, what should we do? What is the solution to such questions? The JEE sets up questions which tests your analytic skills and IQ as well. So, if you prepare for it for some duration of time, surely, your brain will be sharpened and you will gain the ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical world. This is what sets apart IITians from most other people. They have an extraordinary skill of critically analyzing a given situation. Most of them are very smart and are quite good at multi-tasking. By the time you enter IIT, you would have probably forgotten 50% of the theorems and formulae that you memorized during those days. However, the basic concepts and the skills you\u2019ve acquired will however be with you forever throughout your life.Anyhow, whether you prepare for JEE or not, if you\u2019re admitted in a school, you would have to prepare for boards and spend some quality time mugging up formulae. Then, why not spend some extra time doing the same stuff and guarantee yourself a seat at an IIT to gain a lot of respect and provide yourself more exposure to the World around you?Now, answering your question briefly, Starting with your first question. It's quite difficult to give justice to its solution.Students take JEE seriously because of many reasons including family pressure, competitive environment or maybe simply because the son of the next door neighbour Sharma Uncle, became famous after he joined an IIT.Well,honestly, even most students who have cleared JEE won't be able to answer your first question.Now, coming to your second question. Worth the effort!!! Even this question is really debatable. Whether or not you\u2019ve cleared JEE, you may consider your effort to be worth, as you\u2019ve made many friends, interacted with them, and honed your mental abilities during this time. Also, you may actually consider it not to be worthy of your efforts, reminding yourself of the hard-work you went through, the sacrifices you made, and the repercussions(if unfortunate) you had to face on the result day. Well, your outlook of events almost entirely depends on you and there is no way one can make a horse drink water when it\u2019s not thirsty.However people can only advise, whatever will be the outcome, face it in an optimistic manner and carry on your life with a fresh new positivity. Realize that JEE is not the end of life, in fact a lot of life begins once you complete those two/four years of preparation.Thanking you, Yours faithfully, Abhijay Mitra 1st Year Under-Graduate Student B.Tech.(Hons.)

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Its not the students, Its the parents. Out of the 20 lakh students that appear for jee every year, there are at max a total of 2000\u20135000 who themselves want to get a good college and know about the various colleges you can get into via JEE. You see? Most of the students see JEE as a gateway to IIT. You ask them why IIT? They will answer : we will get 1 crore packages. Why IIT has such an impression? Media and coaching classes have spread such stories about IIT placements that they highlight 2\u20135 of 5000, 100\u20131000 of lakhs. Why they appeal so much ? because they dont show the back stories, the millions of failure stories, the hundreds of suicide stories from IIT go amiss. You remember I talked about 5000 students who truly want those colleges? They will get it irrespective of what others do. They will get it because their total focus concentration and their body and soul become one in reaching there. Thats why they get there. They take IIT seriously, not JEE. They reap the rewards there too as long as they are dedicated. For the rest , not knowing what IIT is or doing JEE just because of parental pressure or because someone glorifies it ? JEE I tell you, is not the worth. Esp for those who top in their school or their area , JEE is totally not it unless you get what it means. People set a lot of expectations by JEE. They waste a lot of money in coaching, these tests,and thats why on reading success stories they end up expecting a lot from the exam that is meant for 3hrs and can be disrupted by just a bad luck even. They end up staking so much by it that , sure they make the effort but cant accept that at the end of the day it is just one exam. People end up sacrificing a lot for that one exam. Most who set store by these exams dont understand it. They dont put in the work in the smart direction , dont put in hard work, and yet the expect the results that others get by pure dedication, forgetting everything else for the past atleast 30 months and working dilligently for that time. So yes, JEE is worth the effort if you know what you are working for and how you are working towards your goal. If you lack one or both of these qualities, dont set any store by JEE. JEE is not worth the effort then. When you realise both of these and their importance ? Thats when any college is going to make worth your stay in colllege. Only then will college life be worth it, any college. ",
