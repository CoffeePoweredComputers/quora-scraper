            "answer_text": "I think you may need to step back and find out why you are interested in Chemistry and Math and why you are not interested in Physics and Chem. What is your WHY (I suggest you watch this video by Eric Thomas: I A M - WHAT'S YOUR WHY (TGIM S5 E4) :  When you see yourself waking up in the future; WHY, why will you wake up? To earn money? To help people? To get famous? To be your own boss one day? I used to love the STEM subjects during school (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). Mostly focusing on all the sciences (Phys, Bio and Chem however I also loved health). I am now doing Accounting! Reason: I want to work for a Health, Technology or Science Company as an Accountant. I won\u2019t need help researching trends and learning about my industry because I find it interesting however my job is different enough that I find keeping up with emerging trends in my industry without losing interest! Short Answer: Take a step back and see what part of Chemistry and Maths you like and bombard yourself with questions! Will technology assist that profession or replace it?Are you Talented or do you put in EFFORT? Have you failed or at least found Chem or Maths Difficult, because someday it WILL get hard! Do you dislike Bio and Physics as it is difficult?Will you like repetitive learning in that area (professional development)?Why do you want to join that profession?What is you ideal lifestyle: What do you want to drive? Live in? Where do you want to Live? Do you want to help people? How? (I will volunteer my accounting skills as that is expensive and difficult to locate for Volunteer Groups compared to general volunteers!).Hope this Helps Singh, Yashveer (Yash) ",

            "answer_text": "Yashveer has beautifully elaborated that you need to find true reason why you love chemistry and maths while hating biology and physics. This is important because many fields overlap in future and it happens quite an often in academia that people, when properly exposed to the subjects they hate, fall in love with them. When you express chemistry mathematically, you end up with physics! However, branches of chemistry that employ huge amount of Maths, Physics, and Computer science (algorithms etc for fast computation) are > Computational Chemistry > Computational Materials Science > Materials Informatics > Spectroscopy, (Group theory is highly involved) > Quantum Chemistry > Molecular Modelling > Cheminformatics > Combinatorial chemistry >Chemical Graph Theory Read about them, Read about physics in chemistry, Chemistry in biology. One Fascinating Example: Oscillatory Turing Reactions: \u201cStationary patterns, e.g., the stripes or spots on the skins of animals, are ubiquitous in biology. Quite similar structures, however, can be found in non-living systems as well. Intricate patterns reminiscent of those on tropical fish can also emerge in homogeneous autocatalytic reaction-diffusion media when the difference between diffusion rates of certain chemical species is sufficiently large, just as it was predicted by the British mathematician, Alan Turing, in 1952\u201d From Below http://hopf.chem.brandeis.edu/subpages/main.html So here you get Physics, Biology, Maths and Chemistry all in one! But its mainly chemistry and Math! ",
