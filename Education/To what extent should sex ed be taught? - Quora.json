            "answer_text": "To a much greater extent than it is, as a quick glance on Quora will show. Look around here on Quora. You will find questions like: Can I get pregnant the first time I have sex?Can my boyfriend and I give each other STDs if we don\u2019t have any?Can I give myself an STD by masturbating?If my boyfriend and I have sex a week before my period, might I be pregnant?Can I get pregnant if I give my boyfriend a blowjob?Does gay sex cause STDs?Clearly, sexual education is failing. Clearly, parents are not stepping up to the job. Clearly, people are ending up with confused and in some cases dangerous misinformation about sex and health. Your child needs sex education. Yes, even parents who have only a sixth-grade science education and freak out about the idea that there might be more than two genders. ",
