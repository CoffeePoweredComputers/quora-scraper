            "answer_text": "There are many opportunities out there to generate additional income on top of your 9-5 job. These work from home jobs and side hustles are easy to start and have the potential to provide you with a significant stream of passive income. Not only that, they can even help you retire much earlier from your day job so that you can work on your own time and at your own pace. While I\u2019m not planning on quitting my day job right now, earning passive income from some of these legitimate online hustles and side businesses have improved my finances significantly. ADVANTAGES OF WORKING FROM HOME A few years ago, I would never have thought that just working from home could pay your bills, help you save/invest for retirement, provide multiple streams of passive income, help you stop living from paycheck to paycheck, and help you reach financial freedom! Today, I see working from home as a realistic way to achieve all these goals and more! Some of the work from home jobs in this article can easily make you up to $100,000 per year (or, even every month!). If you put in the effort to learn from those who are already making it big, these gigs can set you up for great financial success. So, what are some of the benefits of working from home? 1. You are in Control: How much you make on a monthly basis is directly up to you. You can choose to put in just enough effort to make an extra $2,000/month, or up to $100,000+/month. There is no ceiling on how much you can earn. 2. Greater Comfort: You can choose your work schedule and when you want to sleep and wake up. Some of these gigs can be done from the comfort of your couch, in a home office, at the beach, on your bed while in your pyjamas, etc. 3. More Time With Family: When you work from the comfort of your home office, you have time to interact with family and friends. 4. Save Money: Working from home means you do not need to commute to a work location, thereby saving money on transportation costs. And, there\u2019s no need to spend on expensive suits and work clothes. 5. Pay Off Debt: When you can earn extra income from working from home, you can pay off debt, do that home renovation, save more for retirement, splurge on yourself (all those guilty pleasures), take the vacations you have always wanted, and more. 6. Increased Productivity: You can be more productive in running your own business and seeing results. The drive for success is high since this is your business and you take credit for all outcomes. REAL WORK FROM HOME JOBS THAT PAY GOOD MONEY Here are some of the easy-to-start legitimate work from home jobs and side hustles you can start today to start making real money! 1. START A BLOG As simple as this sounds, starting a blog can make you lots of money and does not cost a lot to set up. In fact, you can set one up right now for as low as $3.95/month.

Want to get started and start earning right now, I have made it easy for you to do so with this full guide on how to start your blog today. 2. COMPLETE SURVEYS FROM YOUR COUCH Online paid surveys can pay you up to $300 per month if you register for the right ones and are active on them. While you will likely not hit the jackpot with paid surveys and earn thousands of dollars, the extra money can go towards paying down debt or your monthly bills. The ones I recommend are FREE to join, provide multiple ways to earn, and most importantly, they will pay. Some of my favourite ones include: i. Swagbucks: You earn when you answer surveys, shop online, search the web, watch videos, and more. When it is time to redeem your earnings, you can choose either cash or free gift cards e.g. from Amazon, Starbucks, and Walmart. Swagbucks is legit and has paid members over $360 million to date! ii.

Even better, you leave most of the logistics to Amazon to deal with, in what is popularly known as FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon). They do the packing and shipping for you! If you are a deal finder, this gig is perfect for you! Jessica from The Selling Family is just one of many others who routinely make six-figure incomes selling on Amazon 6.

Some of these cash-back sites will pay you as much as 40% of your purchase amount back and no work is required from you \u2013 NO clipping of coupons!! My favourite cash back sites include: i. Checkout 51: This is one of the best apps to earn cash back when you purchase groceries. I have received cash-back offers as high as 35%. Withdrawing your cash reward is easy once your balance reaches $20. Checkout 51 is available in the U.S. and Canada. ii. Paymi: This is a cash back app similar to Drop, however, it\u2019s only available in Canada. The app automatically credits your account with cash back when you shop at participating stores. YOu can easily redeem your cash back using Interac e-Transfer. iii. Drop: The Drop app pays you whenever you shop at five of your chosen retailers and restaurants.

Websites, blogs, and businesses need people to write for them and they are willing to pay. How much can a freelance writer earn? Beginner freelance writers earn anywhere from $25 to $100 per article (500 to 1,000 words). As you become more experienced and land bigger writing jobs, your earnings soar through the roof.
