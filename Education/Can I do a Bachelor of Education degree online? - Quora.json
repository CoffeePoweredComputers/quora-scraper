            "answer_text": "Yes, you CAN. I have been teaching online for 23 years. Here are some questions you need to answer before you go that route. Is the university reputable? Most state universities and their spinoffs (e.g., Excelsior) have reputable online programs. For-profits do not. Some private, not-for-profits act too much like for-profits.Does your major fit online delivery? Sociology, history, business and English do. Bio, chem, math, engineering, nursing less so.Are you an online learner? This is actually a trick question because there are different kinds of online instruction (synchronous vs. asynchronous, interactive vs. MOOC, self-paced vs. lockstep). Does your learning style match the delivery style of the program?",

Many have a higher rate of student attrition and students get stuck in debt and no degree! Just go to the best university that will accept you. Get on work study or a part time job if you need help financing your education. It\u2019s possible that you could qualify for a scholarship or fellowship if you need specific requirements. Just go the traditional route. ",
