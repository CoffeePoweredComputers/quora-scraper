You would not be applying for food stamps, or other welfare benefits. Do you realize how many bureaucrats administering those programs would be thrown out of work because of people like you? The government has,a vested interest in keeping you \u201cDumbed Down\u201d so you will always be dependent on it. There are plenty of legal ways to get rich SLOWLY so you can have a seven figure at retirement, but you\u2019ll have to learn them outside the public school system! ",
