            "answer_text": "Medicos have a very rich tradition and strict protocols in place to minimise human judgement errors (As far as India is concerned). There are numerous watchdogs breathing over their neck, hence they have to pull up their socks 24x7x365. Their medicine quality is supreme at most regards as their quality is often checked periodically. As far as Veterinarians are concerned, they are more relaxed, professionalism is questionable at best, and a stigma of inferior doctor plagues this community. Many of the doctors (vets) are as professional as the medicos but they often face of many constraints in many sectors such as quality of medicine, oversolicitous or callous attitude of the owners of the patients, less attention from the government point of view etc. An extremely important fact regarding the relevance of two professions is that, medical sector or health sector, receives a major chunk of union budget, still they are bleeding money (medicine at subsidised rates) and their contribution to GDP is meagre compared to the livestock sector in any economy of the world. Meat industry is the world's second largest industry after steel and still veterinarians in India are eons behind the professional quality of medicos. Humans are more important to the whole world even though, that might be last nail to the coffin of human race unless concrete measures are taken, this definitely spells doom for the mankind because we are selfish and most importantly self centred. Life of animals comes in news only to play politics and to express vanity among aristocrats. Nobody cares whether animal sector plays a major role in human survival or not, they continue to be belittled and ignored in this \u201ccivilised world\u201d. (P. S.:- every body is entitled to their opinion, if the answer is not up to the mark for the taste of many, please browse below for better answers,thank you) ",

            "answer_text": "First of all the question should be like MBBS or BVSc It really depends upon the interest of student , if interested in treating animals then should go for BVSc or DVM and if interested to treat humans then go for MBBS. Both the degrees have equal importance internationally but in India priority is given to Human health more than animal health. I can see many stray animals wandering on the streets small as well as large animals. That itself reflects how much we are lagging in the field of Veterinary sciences. But on the other hand health sciences have become so stressful to the doctors , as population of India is very high and increase very fast. So , if you want a peaceful profession with less respect in society if want to work under Indian conditions then go for BVSc. If you want stressful life with good respect in society then go for MBBS. If you have a mindset to go abroad and work there then both the options are equally good. All the best. ",
