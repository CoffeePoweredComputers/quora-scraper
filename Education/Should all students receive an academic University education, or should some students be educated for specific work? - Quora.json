            "answer_text": "Should all students receive an academic University education, or should some students be educated for specific work? In my experience, and based on research I\u2019ve read, perhaps 60 to 80 percent of workers could benefit from four-year university degrees, in an advanced economy like the US. (Today about half have degrees.) Most of the remaining workers would benefit from some post-high school training in a specific area, so a one-year certificate or two-year technical degree. (So auto mechanic, electrician, IT specialist, and so on.) Back in the day, so of these jobs were learned by formal or informal apprentice arrangement, but those are much less likely today. ",
