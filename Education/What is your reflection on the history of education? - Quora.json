            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no expert, but I\u2019ve had a long and lasting enthusiasm for history for the longest time, going back to when I was just in third grade. I\u2019ve read books, watched documentaries and asked many questions on Quora about the subject. However, the teaching of history in school never got me excited, and the same can be said for million of students in our country. One major misconception among Vietnamese teachers and educators, in my opinion, is the \u2018Memorization over Understanding\u2019 bias, which is part of the reasons why so many students find the subject so boring and repetitive. Most of the time, we were made to memorize pages after pages of the guts and glory of the soldiers in the Revolutionary War, without much explanation as to why, or how they matter. In case when explanation was given, it was just another patriotic clich\u00e9 you had to memorize, otherwise you\u2019d get bad grades. Another reason as to why history was so boring in school is the lack of discovery and critical thinking students get from it. In my middle school days, this is how a typical class is like: Teacher would introduce the topic, typically something about a famous battle, and asked if anybody already knew about this.Then, the teacher asked a student to read out loud from the textbook, or she would read it herself.Sometimes, the teacher would stop the class to ask a random student to repeat what she just said. Dude is doomed if he didn\u2019t pay attention.Repeat until class ends.This leads to situation when half of the class is sleepy trying to understand what the teacher is saying, while other half busy themselves with whatever is on the Internet, or save time by doing homework on other subjects. Discussion was very limited, and unpopular opinion on historical figures can get you in trouble. This was my experience with history back in school. It was boring, narrowly narrated and a waste of time. But it doesn\u2019t have to be so for all students, if teachers can just stand back, take a long hard look at the way history has been taught and find new and innovative way to get students interested in the subject.
