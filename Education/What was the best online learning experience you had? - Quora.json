            "answer_text": "I love online learning! Some years ago I interested myself more and more for online marketing. In order to get first some basic knowledge and later on more specific skills I book a bunch of onle courses at Udemy. Udemy is the leading marketplace for online courses of all kind of topics. It was great! Because I could watching the courses and learning whenever it was suitable for me. Really flexible.  Building up my websites I continued with tutorials and webinars for different subjects, e.g. Chatbot building with Mary Kathryn Johnson Again, a great experience! High quality content with a perfect match between theory and practical lessons.  Inspired by these motivating experiences I subscribed last year at a German online education istitution and made successfully my degree as \u201cOnline Marketing Manager\u201d. It took me less time and was even more intense than an on-campus degree.  Finally, in order to share my personnel experiences with online learning, I am setting up my distance education website to tell more people about the opportunities to improve skills and earn accredited degrees online. The Distance Education Guide Africa - improve your skills or earn your degree! describes in details the pros and cons of available concepts, there are background articles and recommendations what you can do.
