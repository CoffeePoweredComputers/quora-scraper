            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to actually go a slightly different tact and point you towards a standing debate in academia that has your question at the heart of its\u2019 thesis. On the 21st of January, 1955, Michael Roberts delivered a lecture outlining what he called the \u2018Military Revolution\u2019. A core component of this concept was that in the 16th century, the armies of Europe by and large moved towards large, standardised, \u2018professional\u2019 armies. This was due to the prevalence of firearms, the centralisation of power in places like France, Sweden, and Austria, aswell as the developing trade routes from the New World. Michael Roberts always had a love of Sweden, so his first lectures focused on the innovations brought in under the Vasas. Later scholarship, such as the work of Geoffrey Black, Clifford J. Rogers, Kelly DeVries, and Anne Curry, has largely made this clear cut theory into a far more murky one. Knights declined for a hundred different factors. But mainly, they simply adapted. A modern army officer is just a knight with some training. A tangent; the other answers are great, short bursts of info; I\u2019m just really adding nuance here because I had to study it for 4 bloody years of my life. Might aswell put it to use. The 13th and 14th centuries saw a sharp decline in the military effectiveness of heavy cavalry, as various methods were introduced to counter them. In brief, these ranged from large pike formations, to field fortifications, even into mercenary contracts to provide high quality infantry. But the military nobility of Europe was still the best provider of reliable combat effectiveness. Yet, large, long-term conflicts such as the Hundred Years War, the French-Italian Wars, and the Franco-Imperial Wars saw the rise of a \u2018military class\u2019 in Europe. These were not knights; they were a mixture of burghers, upper peasantry, and lower gentry who provided large proportions of English armies as early as the Agincourt campaign. So if you\u2019re talking about the noble \u2018class\u2019 of knights? That declined when it was too bloody expensive to keep up appearances. A \u2018distraint\u2019 of knighthood in England meant men with over a certain income HAD to become a \u2018knight\u2019 and take on the responsibilities, or face a fine. Some took it, others didn\u2019t. I suspect you\u2019re talking about the military elite of the Middle Ages: the Man-at-Arms. Which is fair enough. But let\u2019s make it clear; in the 15th century English military, a very high proportion of this type of combatant held little to no land, and were often semi-professional soldiers. In France, they were often not \u2018officially\u2019 knights, but the retainers and high-ranking commoners of the land. The idea of a \u2018knight\u2019 being a full-time soldier had passed; the Man-at-Arms, however, could very well be a lifelong combatant. Why was he no longer useful? I despise saying this, but it\u2019s fucking complicated. I feel the most reliable reasons come down to economics; full plate harness and a warhorse is bloody expensive, while hiring ten men with pikes and breastplates for a month just makes more sense. More reliable taxation systems were developed in France and Spain, leading directly to the ability to finance and retain large \u2018mercenary armies\u2019, who morphed into standing armies in a process that would take a fairly hefty book to recount. Standing armies were quite uncommon beyond a small scale in Europe, with only Spain and Sweden fielding them on a grand scale before the 17th century.Farming technology and mining techniques meant that the nobility no longer saw warfare as a lucrative business; so they stopped investing heavily in their own training and equipment. Mercenary companies became far more effective ways of making warfare in the 16th century; the Gallowglass, Landsknecht, and Swiss companies all gained great prominence in this period. Firearms supported by pikes rendered heavy cavalry charges suicidal at worst and situational at best, and the ability of these weapons to multiply their strength when used as part of a significant formation meant that the more trained men you had, the better. Fortunately for some, the governments of the time simply did not have the cash necessary to fund their own armies. Spain was the exception that proved the rule; their military expenditure throughout the 16th century is immense, barely offset by the tides of silver coming in from their colonies. Ok, I\u2019ll end the answer with a point to illustrate what I feel is at the heart of this issue: why aren\u2019t you out there serving your country in plate harness right now? Because it\u2019s outdated, and you\u2019ll get shot? Because you won\u2019t make any money? Because there are people out there far better at it than you? Because you can\u2019t afford any of that kit? Because you just would rather read shit online instead of getting shot? Well, those were the same issues many potential men-at-arms were looking at in the 16th century. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the rise of standing and disciplined armies and rise of regulations and professionalism. Warfare became a science instead of an art. Knights - elite professional soldiers who had trained combat and leadership since their childhood - simply were more valuable as officers for the commoners than privates in elite units. The modern day officer corps are the direct descendant of the knights. as a reserve officer I am a spiritual successor of the knights. Although my family is not noble, there are an awful lot of soldiers in my family. So the answer is surprising: the knights were simply recruited and transferred into officer corps, leading the infantry, cavalry and artillery. Oh, and how about the mounted armoured heavy cavalry lancer? The man-at-arms or gendarme? The answer is again surprising: the firearms, but not against the knights but by used by them. A gun can be used just as well on horseback as it can be used on foot. Petronels - primitive handguns used with one hand - saw the first light in the 1450s, and by 1500 the petronel had evolved into a single-shot pistol. Pistol has certain advantages over the lance. It has longer reach, and you could reload them. You do not need to charge immediately home to use pistol, but you can use the Cantabrian circle or Parthian shot to wear the enemy down. You can have two pistols, one for each hand. And once the enemy is worn down, you can then charge home with swords. Pistols replaced lance by 1550. The mounted men-at-arms, known as gendarmes, not knights, finally adopted pistol as their main arm and relinquished lances. Pistol became now \u201cthe\u201d knightly weapon, and is common in many later era coats-of-arms (such as that of Armfelt).  Arms of family Armfelt: Or, an armoured arm holding a pistol issuant sinister, all Proper. The forefather of the family, yeoman Lars Eriksson, had his right (pistol) arm hacked off in the battle of Leipzig 1642 when fighting as a gendarme for Swedish queen Christina. He was ennobled 1648 and nominated as knight. Pistol is even today the symbol of the officer class. My own sidearm, should I be mobilized, would be the 9mm FN HP-DA. Lances remained in use well until the 30 Years War, when the wheellock pistol finally superceded them. The last knightly charge with lances ever was made by the Polish Winged Hussars in the siege of Vienna 1683, crushing the Ottoman sipahi cavalry and winning the day for the Poles led by Jan Sobiesky.
