            "answer_text": "It depends on the curriculum of the vet school. Mine didn't have any subject remotely tangible to client communication when I was a student, and I had to pick up how to perform consultations on my own, on the job. If your school doesn't have one, it's best if you were to search on google for online communication training, at least to give you an idea about the first steps you have to take with each client on each consult, at least to make the first years in practice a little bit easier to bear. Be aware that sometimes, effective communication might require that you change your personality all together to become the stereotype the client wants to see. Also, try searching for tutorials on how to conduct a consult from start to finish. Think well. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they do, though usually only a few. However, a lot of what makes a good communicator can\u2019t be taught. Furthermore, you\u2019re not really given much opportunity to put the skills you learn into practice as you don\u2019t get to go past the history-taking and clinical exam phase of a consultation. You only get to do the recommendation of diagnostics and treatments when you have graduated (at least that was the case when I went to vet school, and I graduated 10 years ago). There are a lot of specific communication skills you need to learn, such as how to do a euthanasia consult properly etc, that you just can\u2019t learn in a classroom. That is why an experienced vet is preferred over a new grad - we\u2019ve already made the mistakes that teach you how to do it properly. ",
