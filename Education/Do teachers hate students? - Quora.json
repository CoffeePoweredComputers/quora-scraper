            "answer_text": "YES! Some teachers do hate students. I had problems with a few teachers who seemed to have mental issues. I had the teacher from Hell long ago in the age where teachers could spank their students in front of the class with their pants down. Naked. Can you imagine? This spanking teacher also taught at the same school as the teacher from Hell. Mrs. Gote. There were some bad teachers there and only one I liked. Be glad if you weren\u2019t around in the 1960\u2019s. Bad times. Bad teachers. This one was just evil. Mrs. Gote was a sixth grade teacher who hated me for no good reason. When I turned in homework each day she would rip it up in front of me. She made me do it again after class because she believed my father was doing it for me which was not true because he was always on military missions. The next day the same routine with her tearing up my homework and making me redo it. No wonder I hated school. What was the point of doing homework at home if I had to do it again the next day? This woman was crazy, but nobody saw it because what does a student know. I stopped doing homework at home because what was the point if she was just going to tear it up. She asked for my homework that day and I told her my reason. That really pissed her off so she sent me to the principal\u2019s office. I told the principal about this crazy teacher, but as usual nothing was done. When my father returned, I was on the receiving end of punishments due to my teacher making me stay after school which made me late getting home every night. This was back in the era of dysfunctional families and strict parents who made ass whippings a sport. My father was no exception. It was bad enough with the parents. This teacher made it worse because she was blaming me for not doing my homework. I told my father she was lying. He didn\u2019t believe me. Teachers don\u2019t lie. Students do. Right? My father went in to talk to Mrs. Gote and get her side of the story. After a few minutes with Mrs. Gote, my father realized she was the liar. He tore into her and taught both of us a few new swear words. After that she stopped making me do homework over again, but moved on to a new level of meanness. By that time I had enough and stopped going to her class. I was eventually pulled out of her class permanently. I heard after I left she started picking on other students. At the very least the rest of the class got to see what a wicked old hag she was. Some idiot on the school board finally woke up and fired her. Shortly after that she was committed to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Insane Asylum in DC. Too bad it didn\u2019t happen sooner. She died there and probably haunts it. ",

            "answer_text": "I had some students that I didn\u2019t like (much like when you meet someone who is obnoxious or a bully) but I didn\u2019t hate any of them. I always tried to make amends whenever I got into a \u201ctussle\u201d with a student of mine. I treated my students like I treat anyone in the world and how I wanted to be treated. ",
