            "answer_text": "I live in Central California and worked for Kern high school district for about 20 years. I believe the pay has increased slightly since I retired 2 1/2 years ago. However, I was making $82500 when I retired. I also had fully paid health insurance which cost the district $14000 per year. My insurance continues to be paid for me until I turn 65 (another 2 years). Kern high also paid into my retirement and matched my contributions to a 403b until I retired. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been retired for over 10 years. Teachers are not well paid, not much more than the poverty level in most states. I have been in the Classroom and also in Administration. In closing I think Administration vs Classroom Teacher salaries is weighted to far in the direction of Administration, also Upper Administration jobs have to much control of the classroom behavior.
