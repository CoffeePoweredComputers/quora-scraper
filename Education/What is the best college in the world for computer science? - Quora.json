            "answer_text": "Interesting. The one other answer here simply copies and paste lists, and these lists are problematic. The first is US-specific and both list only universities. The concept of a college as it exists in the US is (to my understanding) fairly atypical. An independent college (not a college within a university) in the US news and academic institution that typically offers only undergraduate degrees. So I'm off for limited graduate degrees. There are some universities, like Dartmouth College, that keep \u201ccollege\u201d in their title and there may be universities that offer no graduate programs, but these are standard definitions nonetheless. As a result, no colleges are on either list, despite the fact that at least one, Harvey Mudd, can clearly compete with any and all top programs at universities. I think it's important to apply to multiple different kinds of schools. There are good things about an undergraduate program at a top research university, of course. However, small or universities and colleges offer advantages, too. In some fields, \u201cacademic pedigree\" is of critical importance, as is the socio-professional network you build as an undergraduate. This is certainly true for law and investment banking. Computer Science is a much more open field; I'm not saying these things don't matter, but they aren't critical. Most of the highly successful people I know in academia and industry did not go to one of the top programs in the US News listing, and I did my undergrad at one of those institutions. Most state flagship public universities have excellent CS programs. Many small liberal arts colleges have good programs with the profound advantage of very close connection with your professors, which you will not get normally at a state flagship; they are just too big. I've seen very successful people coming out of R2s (the second tier of research universities) and regional comprehensives (the rest of the state universities). I've seen students take two years at community college and end up in top companies and graduate programs after finishing a bachelors degree, but I'll be honest: I've seen more failure here, too. What I recommend is this: visit and apply to several different schools. If you can get into your states flagship university and like it there, you are likely to get access to an excellent education and opportunities for a cost much, much lower than most private schools, which often offer have less to offer. There are affordable private colleges and universities, too; the school I teach at, Blackburn College, doesn't charge much more than the state flagship. Are we as prestigious as that school? No, as that school is ranked near the top, but my students have no trouble finding employment. Of course, they have to put up with me is there a professor, so\u2026 Most students, after they visit a few schools, have a top choice (as well as preferred alternates). The order often is not what that they think it will be before they visit. If you are able to visit and do find schools you like, make a determination of how much debt you'll incur and then evaluate your choices with that information in mind. It's probably worth taking an extra $10,000 in loans to go to your top school over your second choice, but almost certainly not worth an extra $50,000 in loans. Only you can make a determination here, though. Choose an affordable school you like, and you are likely to be happy and successful there. Good luck! ",
