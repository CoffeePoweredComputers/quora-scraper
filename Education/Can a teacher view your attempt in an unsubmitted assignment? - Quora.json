            "answer_text": "It depends on where you write the assignment. If it\u2019s on paper, the teacher cannot see it until you hand it to him/her. If it\u2019s on a Google doc, the teacher can only see it if you share it with him/her. If it\u2019s on Google classroom, the teacher can see it. In my case, my settings are such that if the student hasn\u2019t \u201cturned in\u201d the assignment, I am not notified that it\u2019s even there. I could open the student\u2019s page and look\u2014then I would see it\u2014but I wait till the due date and time to open it, whether \u201cturned in\u201d or not. So, yes, it depends on how the teacher has chosen the settings. If you\u2019re talking about another platform, I cannot help you. ",
