            "answer_text": "It all depends on the country and your qualifications. Another factor to consider is the cost of living in the country/city you live. Some examples: If you have an English Language School job in Thailand, you will earn somewhere between 25,000 Baht to 35,000 Baht per month (USD 833 to USD 1166 - based on an exchange rate of 30 Baht to 1 USD). Your salary depends on things like education, training, experience, and the school itself. If you live in Bangkok, you will find that 35,000 Baht is a tough salary to live on for a foreigner. However, if you make that in Chiang Mai, you can live pretty decently. Now, the same type of job in a place like Japan will pay in the range of 200,000 JPY to 300,000 JPY per month (USD 2,000 to USD 3,000 - based on exchange rate of 100 JPY to 1 USD). Again, your salary depends on things like education, training, experience, and the school itself. If you live in Tokyo or Osaka, you will find it somewhat difficult on this pay-scale. But outside of these larger cities, you can live quite comfortably. Salary is one factor, but I would recommend researching the cost of living in the city that the job is located. Make more, spend less, save much! To answer your question - My last job was in Japan and it paid me quite well. I was able to save nearly 50% of my paycheck per pay period. This is mainly because my employer paid for half of my accommodation and all of my travel. This was not an easy job to get though, I have been teaching for 10 years and have teaching certificates and a Masters Degree. I started with jobs like the two examples I gave and it was fun, but tough. I've heard that Korea is a really great place to work and live and the pay is quite good. I personally have no experience there, but some of my friends really enjoyed themselves and made good coin. If it's all about the money, than I would suggest the middle east. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE etc. They pay really well, give you free housing and take out NO TAXES. It's not my bag though. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "As general rule of thumb, ESL teachers are going to get paid enough to live wherever they are. And often it\u2019s an amount that is above the country\u2019s national average\u2026. we are very lucky for the opportunity. Countries in Europe may be the exception to this rule because places in Spain and Italy can be pricy to live. If you want to be an ESL teacher and make decent money you should consider these 3 things: Going to the Middle EastGoing to AsiaTeaching Business English anywhere in the worldObviously The Middle Easy and Asia are known to be where the money is for ESL teaching and it\u2019s true. HOWEVER! If the countries in these areas don\u2019t interest you, consider looking for a job that teaches Business English. These companies almost always pay more than a normal language school and sometimes have a lot of benefits in terms of your work schedule and other work opportunities. I taught Business English in Costa Rica for a year and a half, and I was also the recruiter for new teachers. I worked 18 hours a week and made $1000/month. My rent cost $220 and I spent about $180 on food. This left me with $600 a month to save or go on trips\u2026. it usually was used to go on trips. It\u2019s very easy to live comfortably as an English teacher. It\u2019s up to you to look for the right job and other opportunities through that job to make an amount you are happy with. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "As noted earlier, the type of school does make a large difference, as well as the location (both country and sometimes within a country). As an example, Japan where I am not based, is recently advertising some jobs starting as low as 170K Yen a month (and not necessarily with housing included). This is about 1500 US dollars a month (current exchange rate 111.55 Yen = 1 US$). The recommended government rate is 250K yen per month, about 2, 240 US$ a month. I am a university lecturer. and depending on the exchange rate, I have had years where I broke 100K US$ a year. I know some people who are higher on the seniority pay scale and hustle to do a lot of extra work. Now also I live on Tokyo, where it is easier to string together private lessons and various part-time jobs (I do some editing on the side, and sometimes have private students). In some areas it might be worthwhile to try running your own school and be able to write off business expenses as well.   So, because of these various factors; type of job (i.e. position and type of school you work at), country you are located in, where in that country you are located, your contacts (networking is very important for finding work), length of time in that location (both in that country and within that locale), the pay ranges can be all over the place. I would imagine most people do okay, but it is harder to make a living with a family now a days as an ESL or EFL teacher.. Then again, you could say the same for a lot of other careers in this new global economy. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very diverse question to answer, since jobs are around the world (including native English countries such as the US, UK, etc.). It should note that some jobs are volunteer or part of an overseas developing assignment (such as the Peace Corps). So, they truly don\u2019t get paid at all, or it is difficult to calculate.2. In most places, most of the time, the first two questions I\u2019d ask about are pay and (free) housing. The lowest paid jobs are a few hundred USD a month, and no housing. Even though they are quite low by US standards, this is one to three times what a regular person makes in that country (say sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico, etc.). It goes from these lows to more moderate places, such as S. Korea (Housing + $2000 USD a month), to even higher places like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Nordic Countries, (Housing + $3500+ a month). 3. Since we always like to think of \u201cwhat if\u201d best scenarios, the places with the best pay and housing I\u2019ve seen are: a. Aramco in Saudi Arabia (free private housing on European-like compounds + $6000+ a month, tax free) b. Being a professor of English in a Nordic country (such a high quality of life) c. Going to a place that off puts people because it doesn\u2019t pay well, but where you get very enthusiastic students that value education more than anything; I wish I knew all those places, but that feels like a million dollar question itself. 4. I should remind anyone thinking of career advice is that the good salary question isn\u2019t so much \u201chow much do I get paid\u201d or even \u201chow much do I save\u201d but rather \u201chow much are my net savings per hour\u201d? For instance, for the average American who makes $50,000 per year, and they can somehow save the financial planner recommended 20% into savings, IRAs, 401ks, etc. that means about $10,000 per the average of 2000 work hours per year. In other words, $5 made it into some sort of bank account per hour worked. Now, if that person is in Saudi Arabia, getting $50K a year, with (cheap but free) housing, no taxes, and a low cost of living, they could save up to $40K a year. Since Saudi\u2019s hours are less, they may only work 1500 hours or less per year. At the end of the year for the inconvenience of living in this country, they saved $20 - 25 per hour worked. Not bad, to be able to put 4\u20135x as much in your pocket. 5. I know there is discussion about extra tutoring through private tutoring, etc. I would tell anyone be very careful for two reasons: a. It is the distraction from the main task (teaching); not performing at the day job would make the moonlighting job useless b. It can be severely punished and get you banned from the country. It is a personal choice; but, if money is the concern, then maybe a different task within education, or a different field entirely, would be best. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not a good idea to consider these countries without taking into account local costs of living and taxes. I made about US$600 a month with free housing in Mexico in 2002 but lived very well, because things there were quite cheap. In Korea, a pretty common wage is about US$2000 a month with free housing (30 teaching hours/w). For someone young and single, this allows a pretty good lifestyle and the ability to pay student loans. At the university level you may see US$3000 a month (12-18 teaching h/w). At the upper end there are people with specialized graduate degrees doing US$4000 a month (9-12 teaching h/w). Someone with a lot of greed and energy could probably double their wages in Korea doing extra classes, editing, and private lessons. But keep in mind that 30 hours a week doesn't include planning, meetings, and other office duties, which multiply as you go up into university teaching. There can also be legal issues with your employment visas. In short, ESL is pretty good money and not difficult to get into, but you do hit a ceiling where it's not a great living and not terribly secure if you have a family. I don't recommend it as a lifetime career, but it is good as a springboard into something else or into becoming a professor (as I did). ",
