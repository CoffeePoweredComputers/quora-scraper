It\u2019s serious enough that there have been multiple cases of students being put in jail - although, those usually involve students hacking into school computers. In this case, reporting is could result in the loss of the counsellors job, and your friend punished by the college. Should you do anything about it? Well, that depends. Is this person a really good friend, who you don\u2019t want to lose, or get in trouble? If so, then, personally, I wouldn\u2019t do anything - obviously, you should do what you feel is best, though. Do what aligns with your morals and values. ",
