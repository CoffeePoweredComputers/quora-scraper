            "answer_text": "Yes, there's different types of legitimate works you can do from home. Of course, it will depend on what you are ready to do or work with online. We are all different and have different skills. Now It doesn't have to be an obstacle since we can all learn new skills. There's for example writing jobs, user testing jobs or reviewing jobs. Many of these jobs are very popular and they call them sometimes micro jobs or task related jobs. One type of job you could do is transcription work. In this case you usually have to transcribe small chunks of audio and then jump to the next chunk and so on. It is possible to earn an extra $4-$7 or a bit more per hour. Here's video explaining the process:  Now, as I mentioned, there's also jobs available were you have to review specific sites and then speak out loud your opinion. They in some cases ask you to download software that will record your screen and microphone while you give your opinion. You'll then have to upload your recording and send it to your employer. I used the word \u201cemployer\u201d to simplify the explanation, however, this types of gigs are available to do at your own hours. In the examples above you'll have to pass a simple test, nothing to complicated. For other tips on how to generate an income online: Make Your First $100 Online Regards, Alex ",
