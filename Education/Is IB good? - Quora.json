            "answer_text": "Sigh I swear sometimes I cringe when I see these types of questions. Not because of the question itself but more to do with the fact that there are going to be soooo many mixed answers. What I mean by that is basically you\u2019ll have two opposing factions potentially answering this question. There\u2019s the \u201cIB ruined my life and stole my soul\u201d squad. Then there\u2019s the religious cult-like followers who say \u201cIB is worth it. Would recommend. 5 stars Yelp review. 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Would take it again. I have been born again and I owe it all to IB\u201d Now. I\u2019m going to be as objective as I can in this answer. If I sound like I\u2019m rambling or ranting at any point, forgive me sempai. Currently sitting in Hong Kong International Airport after an 11 hour flight from Amsterdam and got one more flight to go. Needless to say, my jet lag is wild. If you wanna do some extra reading, here ya go: Rhys McKenna's answer to What purpose does the International Baccalaureate serve? Rhys McKenna's answer to Have you ever regretted taking the IB? Alright enough comedy. I\u2019ll try and keep this answer objective, simple, and clear. \u201cIs IB actually worth it?\u201d Well let\u2019s define the parameters around the \u201cworth it\u201d part of your answer. What do you want out of your final two years of high school? What kind of education are you looking for? Basically what I\u2019m saying is this: What are your goals? Do you want to get into university plain and simple? Or are you looking for something a little bit more reflective of what university life looks like? I\u2019m not disregarding A levels and AP as inferior. Far from it. They\u2019re rigorous in their own rights. They\u2019re also seen as equivalent by most, if not all, universities, meaning that you could take A levels or AP instead and still have the same chances of getting into university as an IB student. So this probably has you thinking \u201cWell in that case IB probably isn\u2019t worth it\u201d. If your goal is to get into college/university without any hassle, then sure. IB wouldn\u2019t be worth it for you. Here\u2019s what I got out of IB personally: Taught me fundamental skills that I never would have learned otherwise on my own or in any other curriculum (most likely). I\u2019m talking about good research essay writing and excellent citation/referencing skills.Changed my way of thinking so that now, the only way I think about anything is in the most contemplative sense. I basically just think more critically, which is what IB drills into you.I learned the importance of time management. This is a MASSIVE eye opener if you\u2019re thinking about going to university/college.Procrastination is a b*tch. Learned that the hard way.Balancing work and down time (so not working) is important for staying sane.Gave me some lifelong (not being cheesy I promise) friends. Maybe this is just because of our school but we were a close knit group and I\u2019m still in contact with them, even after graduating.Made me realize the importance of harsh feedback.I\u2019ll stop there. There\u2019s a lot more I can think of but I\u2019d be sitting here all day and would probably miss my next connecting flight to Taipei if I go into detail. Was that all worth it for me? Frankly, yes. For me, I switched schools from one I completely hated. It was this school that did things very traditionally. Get taught something straight from the textbook, memorize it, then get tested on it the next day and then it\u2019s all averaged up for your grade. Seriously, going to a school like that demoralized me. I didn\u2019t have much idea of what AP, IB, or A levels were because they were sh*t at letting us know the damn difference. That school did A levels, IGCSE\u2019s (O levels as that school called them) AP, SAT, and ACT\u2019s and I had no idea what the difference was. Essentially what I\u2019m saying is that when I changed, I was happy to get a fresh start. I had no clue what IB really was or what I was getting into. I was just happy to get away from that school and my parents seem enthusiastic about IB. So in my case, I didn\u2019t do much research and I just went along with it. Do I regret it? Nah. Not in the slightest. I had no real friends in my old school and doing IB really forced me to work on my working habits among other things of course. So that\u2019s a rather poor summary of my case and IB. Yes it was stressful. Yes it was pressuring. Yes there was a lot of work but do you really think A levels and AP are any easier? If the only secondary curriculum you did was A levels or AP, how would you ever be able to know what IB is like and vice versa? You see plenty of \u201cIB elitist\u201d students who put themselves above A level and AP students. Quantitatively you could argue IB has more work but other than that, what else have you got? Actually let\u2019s straighten this out real quick. If you\u2019re looking to specialize in a particular subject for your university degree, A levels and AP are excellent choices. If you\u2019re looking to become a more rounded student, then I can vouch for IB. They\u2019re different curriculums at their core so comparing them side by side is like comparing the sweetness of an Orange, an Apple, and a Strawberry. They\u2019re all sweet but int different ways so it\u2019s pointless. People have very different opinions anyway so it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll get a solid answer. I\u2019m getting carried away here. If you think IB isn\u2019t worth it because you feel it\u2019ll be too much work then fair enough. Though to be honest, I kind of just got used to all the work. It became a normal thing for me. So what do you want your last two years of high school to be? I can assure you no matter which curriculum you go with, you WILL feel pressured. You WILL feel stressed and you WILL feel like there\u2019s a lot of work. The education alone, regardless of curriculum is worth it. It\u2019ll get you into university regardless (unless you score poorly for reasons unknown). Look far be it for me to tell you that it\u2019s worth it. I don\u2019t want to be generic and answer in the form of a question either. I\u2019m not an expert but there were definite benefits for me for doing IB. Sure I complained a lot about it being hard. Sure I sometimes complained how students not doing IB have it easier. It\u2019s all part of being an IB student. Whether it\u2019s worth it or not depends on how you look at it and how hard you work. These factors are also dependent on what your immediate goals are in your final school years. Learn some useful, fundamental skills while getting an appetizer\u2019s taste for what university could be like? Or just avoid all the extra essay work and do another curriculum? I commend you for doing your own research. You probably know way more than I did at this point before my 2 years in IB began. I was clueless. Ok well I think I might have been rambling for quite a bit but I hope you see my point. I personally think that unless the schools around you that offer IB are utter crap, IB will be worth it purely based on what you can get out of it. In my opinion, there\u2019s no point in picking sides in the \u201cTo do or not to do IB\u201d argument and reading the opinions of aforementioned students. I think both sides exaggerate IB waaaay too much for what it really is anyway. You pay, you learn, you get stressed, you graduate, you get a world-class, widely recognized high school degree, and that\u2019s that. Alright now I\u2019m really rambling. Education is education my dude. As long as you\u2019re learning something and improving yourself intellectually, it\u2019s probably worth it. But hey. That could just be my jet lag talking. ",

            "answer_text": "My high school offers full IB. I was one of many students applying to full IB. I will share my story here. There was a lot of \"propaganda\" in the school about how beneficial IB is, so almost all the student who had 80%+ want to get into IB. The acceptance criteria are not too high, which gives many students the chance to experience IB. Unfortunately, some students are not competent or ready for full IB quite yet. So the first term into IB, I see a lot of my friends dropping out and having a hard time finding a desirable schedule to transfer back to normal course load (a lot of academic courses are full such as Calculus). I dropped out of IB in May, four-month before full IB starts in September. My action was considered bizarre and coward by some of my friends. Of course, I heard rumors about how hard IB was. I dropped out not because knowing it was hard but knowing IB is not the right path for me. IB is for people who want to find challenge in high school (few people) or people who want to go to school aboard (Ivy League or prestigious school). I wanted neither of those; I just wanted to go to university in my country (Canada). By the time of applying to universities, full IB kids and regular kids (like me) are looking at averages, which are quite interesting. Here is an example. I ended up with an average of 95+, which is 42/42 in IB scale. If I were in IB, my average would probably suffer a drop around 5%. Let's be optimistic and say that I get 90%+, then I would get at least 36/42 in IB. With this score, I would have a hard time getting into the University of Waterloo (I am currently studying here), but since I am in regular course load, I get into UWaterloo easily with 95%+ average (of course there is extra-curricular stuff). Since I am not in IB, I get more free time for extra-curricular and time to take woodwork class. My friends in IB who have similar capabilities like me ended up in other universities (aka not as good as Waterloo). So I am glad that I made the decision not taking IB. ",
