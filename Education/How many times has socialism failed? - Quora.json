            "answer_text": "In my view, socialism has been tried TWICE. The two attempts I\u2019m referring to are (1.) social democracy and (2.) Marxism-Leninism. They\u2019re both experimental models that were replicated in many countries around the world, and everywhere they\u2019ve shown roughly similar results. In both cases these were very promising, yet they never reached the socialist economic order they set out to achieve. Thus both can carefully be classified as failures. Social democracy never reached socialism, but in its attempt managed to create some of the most pleasant societies in human history. The often praised Nordic countries are great examples of its achievements Marxism-Leninism never reached socialism either, and in the attempt created some of the most repressive regimes of the last century and became responsible for millions of deaths. While the tragedy of the initial famines and political purges cannot be overstated, there still were clear victories to speak of. The USSR went through a period of industrialization that was unprecedented anywhere around the world, therein pulling many people out of absolute poverty. In its later years it was a comfortable, if somewhat dysfunctional society, that many of its citizens look back on as preferable over the current capitalist regime. All instances of socialism around the world can be identified as outgrowths of these two experiments. The idea that socialism failed time and time again is simply not true. Marxism-Leninism was tried in numerous countries, yes, but these attempts were all derived from with a single political entity and can hardly be seen as distinct. The two great socialist movements of the last century can be looked at and learned from by future socialist movements, and we desperately need those. Capitalism has become a deeply irrational system. It creates unjustifiable inequalities, seems incapable of sensibly managing information, and is destroying our environment. Humanity has to either build towards socialism or it will destroy itself.

            "answer_text": "Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century. While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny. Equality was achieved only in the sense that everyone was equal in his or her misery. In the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and misery. A pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long run because it is a flawed theory. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect:it is a system that ignores incentives. ",

Theologically speaking, this would be called \u201coriginal sin,\u201d and because all humans exhibit such a condition, we will look at what we want over what we need each time. This is not to suggest that capitalism is going to always be better; this, too, focuses on ourselves, individually, rather than our neighbor.
