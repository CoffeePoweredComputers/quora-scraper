            "answer_text": "Studying the interrelation of health, population and environment is multi-disciplinary. Human health is affected by many factors that involves affordability of health services (Economics), air and water quality (Environment), availability of health facilities and sufficient trainings (Health), availability of food and water (agriculture, biology and ecology), and level of crime rate (law). As you can see, it involves Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, economics, Climate science, Demography, public health, sociology, psychology, law and ecology. You cannot find a Biological area that teaches all of these. You requested an area of disciplinary study for an inter-disciplinary world problem. This cannot be possible. So, you have to leave the disciplinary study, Biology and go for inter-disciplinary study such as Environmental science, Environmental studies, Environmental engineering, etc. The other approach is that you can study a disciplinary Biological area (for example anatomy) and personally take the responsibility to study the other branches required to solve your problem. To achieve this you have to follow self study guides, books, internet search and asking for the human expertise. Inter-disciplinary research papers are rich sources of information in this regard. ",

            "answer_text": "area - I presume you mean academic - There is not really any aspect of Biology where these intersect - Conservation Biology would be the closest- I think closer would be Environmental Psychology or E Sciences Education through an Environmental Sciences Department. Education schools are very very far behind in terms of experience based Environmental Education ",
