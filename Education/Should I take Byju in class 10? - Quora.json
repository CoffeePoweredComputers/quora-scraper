            "answer_text": "BYJU\u2019s is useful as a supplementary learning source, meaning if some teacher is teaching you that concept and you have a doubt in that concept. I say so , because as you are in class 10 , the sheer amount of things that you study in class 11 may make you feel overwhelmed , so a strong base is necessary . For you to take BYJU\u2019s , you must already know the concept and then take BYJU\u2019s . if you just take the course , you will not understand anything. Trust Me. So you have 2 options and you may use BYJU\u2019s in any of the two options additionally if you feel the need to. Buy the JEE foundation books available for class 10 . they are really good and once you go into 11th, it will help you a lot. The \u201cPearson IIT Foundation Series\u201d books are really good and you will like them. If you completed them , Do JEE books for class 11 .( Message me if you want , and I will tell you the names, but most probably you wont need them, as the foundation books are large enough). Second Option is joining a nice Coaching institute . It helps if you start your preparation via a coaching center from class 10. So , if I want to summarise , either buy the Pearson books and do self study or join a coaching institute and in either the cases if you want take BYJU\u2019s but don\u2019t negelect the two cases and ONLY do BYJU\u2019s , you wont understand anything. Thank You ",
