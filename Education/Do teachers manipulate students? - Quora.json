            "answer_text": "Given that the fundamental purpose of education is to transform the individual on the receiving end (the student) into a higher state of knowledge, awareness and skill, some manipulation is inevitable. Teachers have to persuade students to unlock the door of learning, which is bolted on the inside, and then both to adopt ideas and to drop ideas. Another point to remember is that as students progress through an education system, it is not a continuous building of all fields of knowledge evenly. Progress is jumpy and often disjoint. Students also try out ideas in various ways, because school is a \u2018safe\u2019 environment for that: the consequences of failure are pretty low. So they will jump into feminist ideas, as Lehi Simi overheard, but drop them in 3-6 months for a different viewpoint. They had enthusiasm, which is great, but in a good educational environment that will shift around, the more the better. I had one student in college, who got very enthusiastic about one particular aspect of the larger discipline, and went off and spent a whole summer working in that area. The next year, it was something else that fired his interest, and he worked a summer in a totally different branch of the field. The next year, something different again. I thought it was great: enthusiasm, action, learning, and he was enjoying it. He took a couple of different jobs on graduation, and then became a consultant in great demand. He has an excellent education, very broad experience and lots of background across the whole discipline. I never mentioned that he had been enthusiastic about X last year, etc. We always looked forward. Nothing he did was ever lost or wasted time, it all went into his huge collection of \u2018experience.\u2019 Mind you, he was in his mid-late 20s when he started, but all students can follow that example. You could argue that different teachers manipulated his interest. Does it matter? He absorbed things like a sponge and made his own decisions. And had a great time. ",

            "answer_text": "I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of units in a typical teacher training course that examine human psychology and cognitive behaviour and elements such as how to make yourself seem bigger and more intimidating to a class of rowdy children... :) Behaviour management is a huge chunk of manipulation... if you are ever in the UK and in a primary classroom try this - stand at the front of the class and put your hand up and wait. You will be surprised at how quickly the entire class stops what it is doing and puts their hand up too. Not sure if it works in other countries but in the UK teachers are trained to instil this response into their classes as a way of controlling them. It is a technique based in peer pressure. On one of my observations while training I was also told that it would be easier for me to maintain control if I stood in a more intimidating way and another technique I learned about (but never used because it seemed really weird to do it and, besides, most places I teach in forbid food) was to go round the class with a bag of sweets - offering one to any students who are working and ignoring ones who are not. The idea is that students who are not working start to wonder why they are not getting offered and make the link and start working. That is based on a system of rewarding good behaviour rather than ignoring it (as often happens). In many classrooms it is easier to attack the bad behaviour which actually rewards the student with attention, This method removes the attention from the badly behaved students and gives it to the well behaved ones. So yeah... we do. But it is all part of our armoury of defences against apathy and attention seeking :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, teachers do manipulate students. This can be either negative or positive manipulation. Some students are naive and doesn't even know why they are in school and what they want in life. In such a situation , teachers can step in and channel such students on the path they think will help them (positive manipulation). On the other hand, some teachers also take advantage of the ignorance of some students and use them for whatever they like, even to the extent of abusing some (negative manipulation). Hence teacher's indeed manipulate students. ",

It is when you go onto #2 wherein the idea of possibly unscrupulous behavior comes into place. We manipulate all the time. It is part and parcel of getting others to do what we wish. It is when we do it for nefarious reasons, in a manner that hurts someone, that it is negative. I manage and handle kids all day long in a skillful manner, so technically I am manipulating. The big difference is that my reason and methods are for their good and the good of the entire class. ",
