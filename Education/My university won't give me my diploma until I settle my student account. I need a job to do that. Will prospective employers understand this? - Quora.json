            "answer_text": "See if you can qualify for some sort of student loan to pay off your account and get this done with. That would be the easiest thing to do, if it is possible. Then you will have your degree and can pay off the loan as quickly as possible after you get a job.Ask the school if you can work out a payment plan. And if you can, make sure you stick to it. Explain to the school that you cannot possibly pay it if you cannot get a job, and you will have real trouble getting a job without your degree.Ask the school if the failure to receive your diploma means you haven\u2019t graduated, or they are just withholding the document. That will control what you can write on your resume and tell prospective employers. You cannot tell employers you have a degree if you have not, in fact received it.If the answer to 3 is that you haven\u2019t received your degree, then you simply explain to employers that you are finalizing payment of your school bill, which is a formality, but you will have your degree as soon as you can make payment. On your resume you can put BS Expected Date and then put the date by which you can get this paid off.If the school will not agree to give you your degree, then ask it to provide you with a document stating you have fulfilled all obligations for your degree, besides the payment.",

            "answer_text": "I believe until they release the diploma to you, you are not a graduate. You took their coursework and have not yet paid for it. Can you claim you own a car you did not pay for? That said, you have taken, and I assume passed, various tests in the coursework your potential employer may be interested in. You could legitimately say you completed your studies and are awaiting the issuance of your degree after clearing up some minor financial matters, (you would not be the first Diploma held up over unpaid parking fines, Dorm fees, etc. Holding the Diploma is about all the leverage they have on a non-native or departing student, so they use it). And as you are confident in your skills, you can tell the employer \u2018if you would like to test my skills until the Diploma arrived i would be pleased to demonstrate my proficiency.\u2019 You should, hopefully have all sorts of documents to validate your attendance, your grades, etc., so you might be able to diplomatically work thru this. That all said, that requires you get to the face to face, your real problem is the resume statement. At minimum you could state Matriculation in the BA program, the time period attended and your GPA, and that would all be factual, but you can\u2019t claim the degree you don\u2019t own yet - that would be a false statement and grounds for later termination if you were hired. Perhaps a loan from a trusted resource could make a down payment that might release it? ",
