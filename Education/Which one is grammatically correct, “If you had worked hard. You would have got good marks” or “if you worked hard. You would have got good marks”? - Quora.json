Both of your sentences would have been correct if you had used a comma after \u201cif clauses\u201d. \u201cIf you had worked hard, you would have got good marks.\u201d \u2014\u2014 It\u2019s an example of 3rd conditional. [ Past perfect subjunctive if clause, past outcome]\u201cIf you worked hard, you would have got good marks.\u201d\u2014\u2014- It\u2019s an example of mixed conditional:IF + 2ND CONDITIONAL , MAIN CLAUSE IN 3RD CONDITIONAL : This type of mixed conditional expresses a general condition with an imaginary result in the past: If you were smarter, you wouldn't have borrowed money in the first place. [ past subjunctive if clause + past outcome ] (you are not smart; that's why you borrowed money)If I spoke better English [present theory- past subjunctive] , I could have got the job. (I don't speak English well enough, so I didn't get the job)Note: The past subjunctive is used to refer to the present hypothetical theory. I hope it helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "Which one is grammatically correct, \u201cIf you had worked hard. You would have got good marks\u201d or \u201cif you worked hard. You would have got good marks\u201d? While they are almost correct, neither one is quite right. The main problem is that they should both be one sentence, not two. \u201cIf you had worked hard, you would have got(ten) good marks\u201d and \u201cif you worked hard, You would have got(ten) good marks\u201d. With the second version there is also the problem that the first part is not as firmly in the past tense as the second part. Setting that aside the grammar there is a problem with the actual content. \u2018Hard\u2019 is unquantifiable so there is nothing to say if they were (for them) working hard or not. Also \u2018hard\u2019 work will not necessarily give you \u2018good\u2018 marks. Because of this I would rephrase it and say, \u201cIf you had put more effort into your studies, you might have got(ten) better marks\u201d. ",
