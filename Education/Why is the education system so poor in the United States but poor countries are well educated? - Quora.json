            "answer_text": "You are, of course, correct  Ireland and Vietnam aren\u2019t as rich as the United States, but their students do better. The United States ranks between Czech Republic and Latvia. And most of the other answers have hit on the biggest issue - local control over education, but then gloss over the bigger issue - this means rich localities have better education than poor localities. And sometimes, those localities are right next to each other in the United States. You will get a much better education in Grosse Point MI than Detroit. And that \u201clocal control\u201d is deliberate and pretty much unique to the United States. And most of that \u201clocal control\u201d deliberately and systematically pushes disadvantaged students into poorer schools. School districts are often deliberately drawn that way. Secondly though is the difference between \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d education. There is a lot of private education in the United States and the phenomenon is growing with the development of government funded \u201ccharters\u201d which are a hybrid. The first charters were excellent, but that\u2019s because they were rare. When every school tries to be a charter, the earlier ones tend to get the best staff. As a result, private resources often outcompete public ones, but that merely discourages citizens from properly funding the public schools. Compare with Finland, which used to be a country solidly in the yellow zone. It reformed its system by eliminating private schools, providing national funding for schools, and requiring better qualification for teachers. You need a Masters degree to teach high school in Finland. Teachers are also better paid. #9 South Korea has the highest teacher pay to average pay ratio in the developed world. Many teachers in the United States have to quit because pay is so low.  Yes, that\u2019s right. Mexican teachers at the top pay scales make more than American ones. ",

            "answer_text": "To get at the root answer behind America\u2019s ills one must understand subversion- its definition and how it has impacted the United States. Subversion- refers to a process by which the values and principles of a system in place are contradicted or reversed, in an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, authority, hierarchy, and social norms. I\u2019m 43 years old. I\u2019ve spent the latter half of my life undoing the first half. My education, my beliefs, my world-view have been corrupted by facades. I\u2019ve had to re-educate, re-assess and re-do a lot of things in my thinking and practice. Many Americans have been undergoing this through the past several years. Many have not, continued to swallow their blue pills and stay asleep. What I discovered beginning at the age of 21 was that my Education System was corrupted in the past, corrupted and subverted. The corruption was part of a long agenda of Institutional corruption across the board. This will take several papers to elaborate. Let\u2019s build some presuppositions first\u2014- I had to figure out on my own the nature of Institutionalism or Pillars of Society, Institutional Pillars. I deduced this from my own personal research about Secret Societies and their influence in Culture. There are Seven Basic Institutions that undergird a developed society: Government, Education, Media, Medicine, Finance, Arts & Entertainment, and one could argue Religion or perhaps the Family Unit. Without these Institutions or with only some of them\u2014 Society would be imbalanced and order would fail. They help maintain, the health, wellness, safety and overall happiness of a society. These are Societal Pillars. Without the Pillars we\u2019d be a Banana Republic, dipshits trading with salt or toilet paper (happening now), or generally uncultured and uncouth cro-magnon roaming around. When you realize that these Institutions undergird the function of a Society, it is not so unrealistic to believe that some group of people or organization have hi-jacked these Institutions mostly for the purpose of control- they want total power over the Society and probably globally. Back to Education\u2014 I believe Education was hi-jacked by this kind of agenda back in the 1920s. Subversion. First, it was the Financial Institution. Next, Media. Then, Education. I came to see this through an address given by a Theologian named John Gresham Machen. He confronted the Federal Board of Education in 1926. The basis behind Machen\u2019s confrontation was in the very nature of what Education was turning into\u2014 a Federalized or Standardized \u201csystem\u201d uniform to ALL Americans. It was a Collectivist Model engineered by Big Government. Machen flat told them that it was an evil model because it approached human beings like an assembly line or as if human beings were like Ford Factory Model Ts (remember it\u2019s 1926) It\u2019s dehumanizing to have an Education system that is like a Factory pumping out little humanoids year by year who memorize information and get \u201ctrained\u201d not \u201ceducated\u201d. Let that sit and think about the difference between education and training. Machen saw the Federalization and Standardization of Education as Moral Evil. Of course, it was too late\u2014 when something becomes Institutionalized, it becomes extremely hard to reverse. If you don\u2019t agree that this Federal Factory-Based model is evil see any one of Ken Robinson\u2019s video lectures on the problems of modern education. But I believe this is the root problem behind America\u2019s Educational Decline. Since it became Federalized, it increasingly became dumbed- down. It became more boring. It became more like a bureaucracy. It became less creative; fostered less creativity. The beginning of the decline is at its root in the 1920s. Once we understand that America\u2019s problems are due to a cancerous subversion of its Pillars we can understand better about what\u2019s been happening to this once Great Nation. Couple this with the reality that most people are apathetic to the truth. But also important are the lousy or even non-existent incentives placed in front of your average American. Housing is way too expensive. Information and Media are all fucked up. Medicine is too expensive. Education is too expensive. So, there it is\u2014 The bottom line is that America\u2019s ills are the bi-products of Elitism. Elitists hi-jacked Institutions to serve their own ends not the people\u2019s. That\u2019s why you have mounting homelessness; shithead politicians; detached Academia; ridiculous housing prices; class and race division; massive income inequality. (to be continued) ",
