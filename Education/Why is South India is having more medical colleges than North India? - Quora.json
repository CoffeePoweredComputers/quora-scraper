            "answer_text": "In general, mainly as an off-shoot of British rule, with Chennai and other places being used as ports for both trading and ferrying people, after the rule of kingdoms both local Tamil and those like Vijayanagara ended, the Marathas had token presence in that they were mainly confined to Thanjavur and one or two small areas like Jinji, which they had won from the Muslims or remnants of the Nayakas. But broadly life in Tamil country had been peaceful with majority pursuing a pastoral life revolving around agriculture. Old vedic and religious institutions broadly remained undisturbed because invasions from the Muslims had minimal impact. So when the Maratha rule waned and the British took over, stabilizing themselves after defeating the French in wars, they slowly opened educational institutions many of which were related to the church. After independence, there was continuation of this first through Central Govts. with opening of colleges like JIPMER as well as initiating industries, which were commissioned fully by the mid-70s. The British system of promoting education was continued initially by some rich industrialists like the Chettiyars of Karaikudi, who were behind opening of the sprawling Alagappa University in the Chettinad region. Then the local politicians chipped in by getting wasteland allotted for educational purposes with particular emphasis on both medicine and engineering. This was indeed the practice in the other Southern States too plus Maharashtra. Thus the west and South of India have more engineering as well as medical colleges than most other parts. ",
