            "answer_text": "Transferring into Harvard is more difficult than it used to be. Believe it or not, there used to be a time when Harvard accepted close to 100 transfer students each year. According to the most recent estimates, Harvard is now accepting somewhere in the area of 13 transfer students out of 1,432 applicants. So, to say that Harvard transfer admissions is competitive is an understatement.  From my personal success with Harvard and being successful in helping other students transfer into Harvard, here is my advice for any community college student seeking to transfer into Harvard:  GPA: The higher the better, but nothing below a 3.5.  Proper curricular preparation:This is crucial. You've got to take challenging courses, related to your major, to demonstrate that you are ready to handle the rigor of a top-tier institution. If you are a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) major, then you\u2019ll need to take rigorous mathematics (I\u2019m talking calculus 1, 2 and even 3 if your major requires it), physics (physics for non-science majors won't cut it in many cases), and sciences. Humanities majors will also need a strong mathematics background (at least calculus 1) and take the prerequisites necessary to start taking 400+ level courses once they transfer.  Check out Harvard\u2019s concentration guides to get a sense of what kind of academic preparation will be necessary: Concentrations | Harvard College If you are nervous about taking complex mathematics/science courses remember this: it\u2019s better to get a \u201cC,\u201d challenge yourself, and demonstrate intellectual curiosity by taking more rigorous coursework than it is to earn an \u201cA\u201d in easy course after easy course.  Test scores: While test scores are not as important as GPA and curricular preparation, they do still count. You\u2019ll be required to take the SAT or ACT and it\u2019s a bonus if you can demonstrate some high SAT II scores in related areas (for example, biology majors should take the SAT II Biology and score pretty well). Having low test scores doesn't immediately rule you out, but it does put more pressure on your grades and coursework.  Leadership & Extracurricular activities: Icing on the cake! I always advise community college students to focus on extracurricular activities that A) you can take a leadership position in and B) that are somewhat related to your major/career/passion. The leadership position demonstrates that you can accomplish interesting things and still do well in your coursework. Additionally, having extracurricular activities that relate to your major/career/passion shows that you are seriously passionate about what you are studying (and likely to make waves in the field\u2026something that will later make Harvard look very good). Community colleges are treasure troves of extracurricular activities (community service, clubs/organizations, internship opportunities, etc) so keep your eyes open for opportunities.  The Essay: There is no secret to writing an essay that will get you accepted as a transfer student into the best schools (bummer). However, I will give milk-toast advice anyway and say that you should spend a lot of time on your essay. Make sure that your essay tells your story, uses proper grammar, and demonstrates your passion for your career/life goals.  The same advice above applies to all top-tier institutions. If I were you, I wouldn't put all of my eggs in the Harvard basket. Frankly, if you want to get into a top-tier school like Harvard then you should also apply for the other Ivy Leagues that have much less competitive transfer admissions. For example, Cornell University accepts roughly 20% of transfer applicants (3,579 applied, 737 admitted). The other Ivy Leagues (with the exception of Princeton which doesn't have a transfer program) roughly accept 10% of their transfer candidates.  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The practical way to do this is to enroll in Harvard Extension School. HES also awards undergraduate degrees and welcomes transfer students from community colleges. The catch: you have to take 3 courses with a B or better to get formal admission to the program. Those courses often include a writing and math course meant to get community college students ready for Harvard classes. HES is a program oriented towards working adults, but with pretty high academic standards. There is a way after a year of successful HES classes to take classes along with Harvard College students. You will also have to pay full price for the first three courses. However, HES courses are quite a bit cheaper than Harvard College courses and 2 of the 3 require courses are discounted even further. After those courses you can apply for financial aid. My son took 1 class from Harvard Extension(but decided to go to University of Washington instead). I think HES is a great program for the right person. If you have fire in your belly, a strong academic aptitude and patience to jump through hoops, you can get access to some really good courses and professors. The HES faculty include a lot of teaching assistants who may be very talented but may not be experienced teachers. I think you have to something of self-starter to get through those. I think you\u2019ll get more out this program if you have strong networking skills. HES folks once they get on campus can join the same clubs as Harvard College students(with a few exceptions like the Harvard Lampoon), and join the Harvard Alumni club when they graduate. For many folks I would suggest getting a part time job and taking your classes half time, even if it takes you little longer to graduate. The Harvard connections might help you there, and you can stretch your time on campus a bit that way, which I think is a big part of the whole experience. ",

I had won: three national scholarships two international awards four school-scholarships two local scholarships three state scholarships four state awards (including the scholarships) as well as one of the top places in STEM in the Mississippi Honors Conference for original research in Combinatorial Mathematics. Beyond that, I was involved in: Three clubs/honor societies where I was heavily involved in projects and acted as President of each. The Student Government, where I acted as treasurer and secretary, though admittedly I never did anything as the SGA did not have one meeting the entire time I was \u201cinvolved,\u201d though I did get the SGA scholarship which provided half tuition for each role I had. Tutoring GED students with a pass rate of 90%. My recommenders asked me for the opportunity to write my letter of recommendation AND they pulled me inside their office to read it to me. My story: I had a fifth-grade education and was hospitalized thereafter. Once I finally got out of the hospital at 17, I acquired two jobs - one in a local restaurant and one in McDonald\u2019s. I worked each of those jobs 40\u201360 hours per week for the first year and was promoted to manager of the local restaurant within three months. I took the GED in October of the same year and passed without studying and enrolled in community college in the Spring. During my first term at community college, since I really did not want to attend college, I worked both jobs full time: McDonald\u2019s Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday from 4AM - 12 PM as well as the local restaurant from 2PM - 10 PM Monday/Wednesday/Sunday and from 2PM - 11 PM Friday/Saturday. I attended college Tuesday and Thursday from 8 AM - 6PM. My letter writers verified all of this. Near the end of my first semester, I decided to resign from McDonald\u2019s, as I needed extra time to prepare for my finals, even though I was only taking 12 credit hours, I found the workload to be overwhelming whilst working 80\u201385 hrs a week. The following school year, Fall/Spring, I enrolled in the Honors Calculus Sequence (1\u20134) double paced, in order to complete them all in one year. I cut back on my hours worked to about 30 hours a week and made it through Cal 1 and Cal 2 without missing a single question the entire time. The first time I missed a question was when I took my cal 3 final exam when both my wife and I were sick with Mono and Pneumonia, again, verified by my letter writer. I missed two questions in all of Cal 3. This story along with my letter writers backing up these claims helped me to win numerous scholarships and awards as well as admittance into Cornell, Harvard, Michigan, Wisconsin, Vanderbilt, Duke, Mississippi State, and the University of Mississippi. The only college to waitlist me was Virginia. I had no rejections. So, yes, it is possible to get into Harvard as a community college transfer, but you have to be willing to work hard to get there.

            "answer_text": "A2A Others have already answered this question as to the how to apply and how hard it is to transfer to Harvard. I think Anonymous' answer to question has given the best advice. Harvard is not a transfer university because they accept so few students, and if you are coming from a community college as opposed from another university, the odds are not in your favor. It is even less if you are an international student. While other may encourage your to give it your best shots, you need to look at other university that are designed for transfer students. http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/most-transfers lists the number of transfer student openings. You would have a better chance with those universities. You must be realistic in your choice of universities. As a community college transfer, you would be a junior taking upper division courses in your major without having the solid two years of lower division coursesword at a top university. Academically compared to the students at a top university, you would be a year behind.  Bottom line: Based on my experience with two year colleges and top universities, you are not ready for Harvard. You need a stronger background that you can get at a university that is designed to take transfer students. There is nothing wrong in seeking the best, but you must be best if you expect to succeed.

            "answer_text": "Honestly, that seems pretty difficult and unlikely if you want to transfer during your undergraduate career. Like other answerers have mentioned, Harvard only accepts maybe a dozen transfers a year, and most if not all of those transfers are from other top-tier schools. You might have a better shot if the community college you are going to is in Massachusetts and if you demonstrate a meteoric trajectory in your academics / extracurricular activities, but realistically your efforts are better spent elsewhere.  Your best bet is to transfer from the community college to a state school after two years (which is much more common), graduate from that state school with a great GPA, extracurriculars, and letters of recommendation, and then apply to a Harvard graduate or professional school.

In practice, though, they will need to have spaces in upper-level classes for those transfer students, and Harvard students hardly ever drop out. (Mark Zuckerberg excepted, of course.) So Harvard has very few openings for transfer students every year. For example, last year 1,491 students applied to transfer. Only 13 were accepted. The more exceptional your accomplishments at the community college\u2014top of your class, honors and awards, genuine impact\u2014the more competitive your transfer application will be.
