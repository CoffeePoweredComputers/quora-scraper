            "answer_text": "I would recommend reading Immigration New Zealand\u2019s Working on a student visa. You are allowed to work for up to 20 hours a week if you are studying full-time for any of the following: A recognised course or program that lasts at least two years.For a New Zealand qualification that gains points under the Skilled Migrant Category.For a foundation program for at least one academic year at Level 4 or higher on the NZ Qualifications Authority framework in Canterbury.You are also allowed to study full-time during study breaks if your course is at least one academic year and worth at least 120 points.You are allowed to work full time during the Christmas and New Year period if you are studying full time and your course is worth less than 120 points.PhD and MA research students have no restrictions on the hours they can work. English-language students are allowed to do part-time work if their course meets certain conditions outlined on the Immigration NZ page. Please bear in mind that the new Labour-led government is tightening restrictions on low-values courses to prevent employers from exploiting students as cheap labour or people illegally working while on student visas.[1] Footnotes[1] Making immigration work for New Zealand",

            "answer_text": "Andrew Lim has covered the technicalities well in his answer. Yes, international students can work for 20 hours/week. There are some conditions to each course the student does. Naturally the priority is the study for which considerable fees have been paid in advance. Students arriving on low-end courses often think the 20/hour/week income might subsidise the fees or pay for accommodation etc. In most cases it wont. Course costs should be looked upon as an investment and not as short-cut to gain extensions via visas, Permanent Residents, citizenship etc\u2026. The Labour government has clamped down on low-value courses and has now made it very difficult for students to sneak in and stay. Once the course is finished there are no extensions to the visa. Pass/Fail you will return to your own country. Is it worth the risk? Hordes of students would previously arrive here, attend classes for a week and head off to the farms to do fruit-picking, construction and labour and work in factories and shops for the 20 hour minimum wage income. Exploitation is ripe in this situation. The government has clamped on this misuse of these student visas. Whatever you do -do it within the law. One mistake and you will be deported. Universities have set-up Job Search facilities for international students to find work. These are usually menial jobs. Students on PG Degrees, especially on Research projects have less restrictions. Accomodation costs in Auckland are prohibitive. Think well and good luck. Thanks for the A2A ",
