Get the government to pay for your college education. If you don\u2019t want to risk your life for full funding I suggest you look at scholarships from employers who will pay for your degree for 3 to 5 years of your life working for them. ",

However not many people are that lucky (or brilliant). There is no full funding as a college student. The family of the student and the student are required to make some sort of financial contribution to the student\u2019s education. You can apply for financial aid and they will dole out money in the form of grants, scholarships and loans based on both academic and \u201cneed\u201d. Your parents have to fill out an application that will be a profile of the financial status of the family. ",
