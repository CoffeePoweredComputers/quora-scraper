            "answer_text": "Yes definitely you can learn C++ without knowing C. Even in my case also, the first language that I learned was C++ and later I learned C. C++ is much easier when it comes to learning than C. It is because of some of the features of C++ which is much simpler considering a new learner. Some of the examples are - \u2018cout\u2019 in \u2018C++\u2019 VS \u2018printf\u2019 in \u2018C\u2019 - When writing output on the console we don\u2019t need type checking for the output type or variable.Similarly \u2018cin\u2019 in \u2018C++\u2019 vs \u2018scanf\u2019 in \u2018C\u2019 - Similarly we need to specify the type we are reading but there is no need in C++ when using cin.Simpler dynamic memory allocation - The dynamic or run time memory allocation in C is very complex for a newbie. Although both C and C++ uses pointers for dynamically allocating memory but still in C++ one can simply allocate memory using new.OOP\u2019s paradigm vs Procedural paradigm - The object oriented paradigm in C++ makes it much easier and less complex to write programs. In C we need to make use of free flowing data and function to carry out a task.Hence in my view it is even better for a newbie to learn C++ at first. Although learning Python at first would be much more easier for you. But still learning C++ at first would make your concepts about programming more clear. I would also recommend you some basic tutorials in C++ that would make you learn C++ directly without knowing C. I initiated from \u2018Learn C++in 21 days\u2019 tutorial available online very easily. You can also visit tutorialspoint or learncpp. Hence , go for it. Happy coding!!!!!. ",

            "answer_text": "No one can ever learn a language. They understand and get familiar with the syntax. By practice you retain the syntax or piece of code in memory. So the correct question would be Can I start using C++ without knowing C? Definitely you can. I dont see a reason why anyone can\u2019t use a computer language . You can get familiar with any language without being acquainted with another language. Your question is like Do i need to know machine language for using assembly or high level language? As the fundamental concept of Computer Science remain the same in every language. The only difference is in the syntax, implementation, limitations, libraries, utilities etc. The basic essence of a programmer lies in his/her concepts like literals, data types, variables, function, recursion, loops(basic) , algorithms, pointers( off topic : my most favorite concept in computer science apart from Machine Learning ) , classes, objects(in OOP Languages higher level) , etc. Every programmer first goes through the phase of understanding these fundamental concepts and then implements them in any language of his/her choice. Academically, some universities include C in their curriculum for first year then they move onto object oriented language, some replace it with C++, some others with Java or Python. In my opinion you indirectly get familiar with C to some extent if you are with C++, some changes apart. ( depends on the compiler you are using like turbo C++, GNU C++[ C++14,C++11, C++ 4.3.2 etc], Borland C++) In my case, i was introduced to C++ in my 7th standard then in 11th and 12th. C in first year of my BTECH course. Java in second year. I felt no difficulties to understand C being from C++ background. All you need to do is get a good grasp on your fundamentals and get familiar with syntax. Keep up the Coding Spirit (practicing) . Godspeed And Best of Luck ",
