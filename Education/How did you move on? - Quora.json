            "answer_text": "My friend, for me personally it was how much I disliked the way I felt when I realized I was at what seemed to be a stand still, or a better description is that I was moving far too slowly. I have kept a promise I made to myself when I was only 12, that I will make an effort every single day to learn something new. It is a very small thing on the surface, but I am over 60 years old now and most days I can safely say it was more than one thing I learned. This is due to me holding on tightly to the kind of curiosity and wonder of the world I had as a very young child. This curiosity is what I believe is our first real gift as a human being. It\u2019s what drives us as a child to gain knowledge and wisdom we need to more safely navigate the world we have been born into, and understand how it works. I believe I would have been foolish to discard such a magnificent gift, and have no reason to think any positive aspect of ourselves, at any age in our lives will not continue to be positive beyond the age we learned it. So waking up each day and feeling grateful for another opportunity to experience, and learn, serves to start me moving forward each day. It may not seem deeply profound or even important in your eyes, but it truly is finding something small that will spark your mind and soul and allowing it to become almost ritualistic in nature. A small daily achievement is a small step in the right direction, and any size step forward is a help in moving on and going forward. Your question may have been addressing \u201cmoving on\u201d from a relationship, but wasn\u2019t clear enough for me. If you learn to always be moving forward as a person it will help the other as well. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer is not about moving on from a relationship or an ex or something. This deals with something that is more important. This deals with something that is internal. Something that was an integral part of me. Something that drove my decisions and choices for 3.5 years. How did I move on from my passion? Civil Services Examination. Even though I broke up with UPSC over 1.5 years ago, when I wrote this answer - How wonderful is the journey in becoming an IAS officer in the India? But still, the remnants of memories of being with her for such a long time still used to linger around every now and then. Some aspirant would ping me often, to ask doubts regarding the exam, some friend would ask for advice. The memories of UPSC would then jog up my brain again and again. I was posted in Bairgania, a small town in rural northern Bihar for over a year, from mid 2017 to mid 2018. And I had all my UPSC books with me still. So, every time I used to see the books near my table, even though I did not want to study, I used to get reminded of the exam. To let go of such a goal, in which I had invested so much time and energy, was a bit difficult. To see that 3.5 years of my life\u2019s hardwork go drown the drain was not a pleasing thing to think about. How did I move on from all this? I got transferred to Patna. And it was time to do something for Bairgania\u2019s local schools. There were only 2 or 3 schools, that too with minimal infrastructure and non-existent libraries. So, two weeks before I left Bairgania, I visited these two schools, Gautam Buddha school and J S Boarding school to check the condition of their libraries. One did not have a library and the other had very few books. The two school directors/principals were very close friends of mine, so I decided to start a new library by donating most of my books to the school children.  On top of the UPSC books (which are really of not much use to these tiny children, but I hoped someone would get help from my notes and scribblings), I gave away all my NCERT books hoping that the school kids will start gaining a strong base, and bought some nursery books, rhymes etc so that they can enjoy and cultivate a habit of reading. I was done. This was the first ever pic I had shared of my books, way back in 2013, in my first article on UPSC - A Detailed Strategy For UPSC Civil Services Preparation \u2013 Akand Sitra  And then the one with the school kids is the last picture of the books of UPSC. I had given away all the books. I left Bairgania. I left UPSC. I decided to move on and start my life afresh. But, still. There was some feeling, some feeling that may draw me back to UPSC in the future. And to stop from those feelings coming back to me, I had to do more. So, I finally did something that I had always wanted to do. But couldn\u2019t do it all these years due to this UPSC. A Tattoo. Ever since I was a child, I was fascinated by permanent tattoos. I tried getting one in college, but parents were strict and said a firm No. Then after graduating I thought of getting one, but by then UPSC had started. And the UPSC Medical Board frowns upon body tattoos. So, if I wanted to move on from my passion that took 3.5 years of my life, then I had to indulge in a much-older passion. So, I went ahead and got one. The one design that I had planned since I was a 17 year old kid. Lord Shiva\u2019s Trishul.  A large one, which costed me Rs. 2500. And I was so proud of it. The constant piercing of needles on my back for over 2 hours, even though was hurting, it was blissful. Every time I go for swimming now, people stare at the tattoo. It looks so cool! :P  So, yeah, to move on from my passion, I did these three things - Shift to Patna. Start life afresh.Donate all the UPSC books to schools and forget about it.Get a tattoo.And now, I finally feel free! Yay! Also, I love Patna. Meeting very interesting people every weekend. So much fun! ",
