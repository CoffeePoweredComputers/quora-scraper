            "answer_text": "If you want to learn German, there is one major problem you need to figure out: MOTIVATION The vast majority of language learners in the Duolingo-era are dabblers. They have fantasies of living in Paris, going from caf\u00e9 to caf\u00e9 and getting VIP service by the infamously blunt waiters who will be tricked into thinking they\u2019re chatting with a native. Perhaps they chose French because it\u2019s a \u201cbeautiful language\u201d. Often, this dream is shattered when they get to B1. I don\u2019t intend to be mean. I have these fantasies too. We live in an impulsive world. There are a lot of things fighting for our attention. So, when things get tough, it\u2019s easy to move on and find something else to do. The key, then, is finding a way to continue when your language learning inevitably plateaus. It will plateau. Let me explain.  I grew up in the USA. If you\u2019ve ever been there, look around at all the older generation Asian or Hispanic immigrants, who arrived not knowing a single word of English. They won\u2019t know what the hell A1 or B1 is. It only takes getting lost once in a country where no one speaks English to grasp just how absurdly hard this is. They learnt English because there was no other choice. They had a clear motivation: to survive and thrive in a new country. So, what is your motivation for learning German? Well, it could be to: Communicate with a partner and his/her familyAttend school in GermanyRead literature in original text (Goethe, Rilke, etc.)Work and live in GermanyDelve deeper films and operasIt could be something really niche. Perhaps you\u2019re a chef and you love German food. And as you\u2019re already interested in an aspect of the subculture, learning the language is a natural extension.Opera singers learn German because there\u2019s a lot of work- opera houses- in the German speaking world, and because knowing the language means knowing what you\u2019re singing about.Learning a language is like growing a plant. When the roots are fertilized, thick, broad, and healthy, the plant is strong. It can handle a few droughts or a tough winter. But a plant that is already fragile will likely not tolerate the abuse. Likewise, a language learner who has a clear, visceral need to learn German\u2014like immigrants in a new land\u2014is more likely to survive the deep bouts of frustration than one who merely learns it for fun.  In reality, everyone is different. Anything that works to motivate you, works. I am sure there are people who have learned German to fluency simply because they liked the sound of the language. But, I argue, the more essential the reason for learning, the more likely one will continue through to fluency. Here\u2019s what I recommend: Find something that you\u2019re obsessed about in German, Swiss, or Austrian culture.Do you like opera? Classical music? There\u2019s Beethoven, Schumann, Schubert, Mozart, Wagner... there\u2019s Karajan, Fischer-Dieskau\u2026Poetry? Literature? Everyone knows Goethe, Rilke.. Hermann Hesse is wonderful.Documentaries? Films? Werner Herzog & Klaus Kinski are deservedly notorious. Check out ARTE (Deutsch-franz\u00f6sischer Kultursender. Videos, Livestream | ARTE).Food? Sally\u2019s Welt on Youtube. I LOVE rye bread (Roggenbrot) and German bread is the best.Outdoors? The mountain sport scene in Switzerland/Southern Germany/Austria is renowned.Try to find reasons you would spend time in Germany in the future.A jobA relationship or family member or close friendLong vacationsBecoming fluent in a language is hard. And maintaining it is even harder. It requires frequent reading, speaking practice. At some point you will lose your German if you don\u2019t have a reason to keep polishing it. The best resources for learning German, like Anki, immersion, tutoring, DW, ARTE, are all available online and in other excellent answers to this question. You can\u2019t predict how beneficial any tool will be for improving your German, nor how fast you will progress. The one factor you do have control over is your resilience. Stay strong. The highway is littered with the corpses of Goethe-Institut B1 dropouts. The classic stock market investor saying goes, \u201cTime in the market beats timing the market.\u2019 Time always wins in the end. You will learn German, but can you cope with the emotions in between?  Like this post? Read more: Jonathan Xie \u2013 Medium ",

            "answer_text": "Im on my way to learn this language and I will answer Based on my recent experiences for each level. A1This level is quite easy for the students. You don\u2019t feel any pressure. You goto class and learn A,B,C alphabets, counting, basic introducing yourself, ask people how was their day. If you just attend the classes its kind of enough to pass this level quite easily and homework does not really take much time. I don\u2019t really want to recommend any extra material other than just following your regular class. It\u2019s also better to start getting mentally ready for a super hard time coming over soon in next levels. There are many teachers who believe that if they are strict on students from the beginning and start explaining everything in German at this level then students would learn lot faster. Monolingual learning is a very common way of teaching language but whether you should choose to be taught in that way depends completely on your situation. My situation was: 9 hours daily job with no way of practicing outside german class. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out for me. Either because of my busy schedule or maybe the way I like learning things. I chose to learn German in English and found teachers who do that. But for some others monolingual worked better. Anyway this is a big topic that I should cover in a different article. But for now just will give you a warning about choosing the right medium. Just commit a little more. Probably you can find someone who can explain you during weekends in a way you understand. Phone Apps: Duolingo and start practicing Basic language items.dict.cc its the only dictionary with offline support for German translation. This one I prefer because of offline supportBut the best dictionary app is Leo but it does not have offline translation support. But very detailed artikel/tense related explanationSchool: If you are looking for a good school in Berlin with a good budget I would recommend Kapitel Zwei Berlin. I remember I was looking for a school in Berlin and most of the schools didnt even have a form that I could fill in in English and also easy terms and conditions to start a class. Kapitel Zwei seemed having quite good price at least for Intensive Courses and also applying was very easy. I recommended this to a lot of people. They also helped one of my friends to move to Germany with Student visa. They provided all support of Housing and Certificate of Language to submit to embassy. They are super friendly. You only need to email them about your learning interest and they give you good instruction on how to manage things. I found one common problem in all German schools that is, in the beginner phases some teachers follow only German in class system that Im not very fond of as beginner. It makes initial learning steps slow, breaks confidence does not give any extra benefit for next phases other than you ending up investing more money for spending long times in classes. (But yes there are people who would disagree with me) A2This is one of the most important part of learning German. Here you learn almost all the important Grammar. There are some formula tables thats very easy to understand but to apply quick you need a lot of practice that you need to repeat maybe hundreds of times over next few months to get a better grasp of talking. This is probably the only part I did twice because I wasn\u2019t feeling comfortable and ya the teacher felt maybe quite sad about his students as we didnt really have much idea whats going on even if he explained things on English. And when I tried to find the comparison between B1 and A2 I felt quite a big distance. Books: After this I started looking for something that can make this language learning interesting and not boring Grammars. I found these nice collection Dino lernt Deutsch (9 books) You can find them cheapest as kindle edition. It explains all the tough words and you will start getting the feeling that you can read easy stories which will give you a self confidence. its really important to grasp the vocabulary at stage A2 before going to B1 Apps: In Duolingo you should make some good and regular progress. Its better if you keep your practice really constant. People have this misconception that at each level you have to spend equal amount of time. But I found the further you go the more time you have to spend to get to next level. For example in A2 you have to practice really a lot. Although very boring grammars but still this is where your Homeworks starts to kick in. B1Finally this is where your teacher can actually start explaining things in German. This level is mostly about practicing than learning new Grammar. Learn more vocabulary. At this stage you should commit a little more to learn this language because only going to school is not enough. I do suggest going to some German meetups and practicing with other people Practicing with Other People Try Meetup Website. You will find tons of them at least in Berlin. Keep trying to speak everything in German in meetups. At the end of this stage I was amazed to find out that I could hangout with my German learning friends whole weekend without using a single English word. But I could talk with such childish German only with them and real German speaking people would find it still very difficult to communicate with us :D Books At this stage you should be able to read Dino lernt Deutsch series lot more easily and without looking at word explanation you should be able to understand the context. You should be able to talk after the end of B1 but very slowly. At this level I tried talking with my German flatmates and it didnt go well as I made them repeat too many times. Every now and then we would talk in German. But still this is not the level you can start talking with German people in full German. If you try flirting with someone at a bar people will tell you your German is very sweet and continue in English I do suggest to actually take the B1 exam or at least go through the model tests of B1 exam to understand if you can pass them. I did take around 2 months of break after B1 level as preparation for B1 exam before I started B2. Youtube: You will find lots of free materials on Youtube about the exam search for B1 Deutsch Pr\u00fcfung. You can take a look at these channels Deutsch LernenLearn German with AnjaGerman TV series and Movies: At this level you can also start watching TV series or movies: German Tv Series: Dark, Turkish f\u00fcr \u00c4nfanger, Im Angesicht des Verbrechens and other English series with German dubbing and subtitles. Some good movies:Movies: Good Bye Lenin, Das Parfum, Cafe In Berlin, Frances haRadio, Music: Start listening to everything in German. All radio or movies. You need to get used to it. Watching TV in German in this stage is quite easy. You will understand 40% of what is said and rest 60% you will get from the context and the view. Books: books by Eric Kastner, he writes books in easy German. Some of the nicest ones I can recommend: Drei Manner im Schnee, Der Kleine Grenzverkehr, Die verschwundene MiniaturYou can also try books from easy readers. They have really nice collection for B1 level German Books. You can also try B2 level books in easy readers. They have only few B2 Level books in Easy readers and all are kind of understandable at end of B1 level with lots of dictionary search.Apps: I stopped with Duolingo at this level. I also changed system language of all my online social networks, Phone, Computer to German. I didnt change everything in 1 day. I did it slowly one by one. First starting from facebook, then 2 weeks later phone then 1 month later Computer. It felt really shit in the beginning but it gave me a boost in common German vocabulary like gef\u00e4llt, teilen, vertrag, stimme zu.. you wont believe how much you learn just by looking at those messages in your computer every single day Es wird geladen Dein Akku ist fast leer B2This is when you actually start speaking a slightly fast German. But with Tons of Grammatical mistakes. You will be able to make meaningful sentences but will make small mistakes in almost every sentence. At the end of this level I was able to start talking with German people without making them repeat things too many times. My flatmates are now finally talking with me fully in German. Over last 1 month the only time I had to talk with them in English was when I explained them what happened in TV series: 13 Reasons Why. But it was only because its a story told by a person after her death, which make a lots of indirect speech and passive sentences thats quite difficult at this stage. Also after this you should better make sure you have reached the level by taking an exam or solving the questions at home. Meetups: To practice for this level you need to find advanced groups in Meetup Website. This is the time when you will realize that going to every meetup group is not working out for you because you speak better than most of other people in normal meetups and you would want to take your training to next level. Youtube: Search for B2 Deutsch Pr\u00fcfung to get lots of letter samples. The writing part at this level is more practical than B1 level. At this level you should be able to write things likea letter to to quit you job contracta letter claiming your money back for something you bought online,Apply for a job position, Motivation Letter.Interesting Deutsch/European Cultural explanations ARTEde. My favourite playlists are ARTE Karambolage, (fast) Die ganze Wahrheit, Wer nicht fragt, stirbt dummScientific explanations to Problems: Kurzgesagt, maiLab, MrWissen2go.Deutsche Welle: News and current affairs from Germany and around the world | DW I found this recently and it has nice contents. You can watch these kind of as TV. They have atricles/videos/audios on current affairs of Germany. Magazine: Deutsch Perfekt: Its made specially for German learners. It has articles for all levels (divided in easy/medium/hard level). Only problem is that its a little expensive. I read it usually from a library. German Standup Comedy: Kaya Yanar(my favourite), Enissa Amani , Ilka Bessin (you can find their shows in Netflix and also in Youtube) Spotify: Audio Stories: Das Tagebuch der Anne Frank (Ungek\u00fcrzte Lesung), ich bringe mich um die ecke, Schones Antonio und Tante Poldi.Podcasts:News in Slow German,SWR2 Wissen (My favourite)Slow German (sometimes I feel its good to hear each single word and understand every sentence. Thats why this is good. Slow but good language structure)Books: At this stage you will find Dino lernt Deutsch super boring and you can start reading zweisprachig B\u00fccher (from dtv). Its better if you buy them hard copy as its 2 languages books. English on one side and German on other side. You can find them super cheap second hand on Amazon. At this stage you can turn off all the subtitles and fully focus on hearing and understanding the story in movies. C1I have just started on this. The fun part here is I can understand newspapers and German TV quite easily. But still reading books Im facing Problem only with Vocabulary. Will keep updating my Answer when Im done with this level.
