            "answer_text": " The fundamental problem with government student loans isn\u2019t the rate of interest being charged. The most an undergraduate student can borrow in federal student loans over four years is $27,000. Currently, the interest rate is a ridiculously low 2.75%. The real issues with federal student loans are, in this order, the federal student loan system, your parents, and you. The System The system is based on the illogical principle that, \u201cEveryone is entitled to go to college.\u201d The federal government will loan money, at an outrageously low rate, to almost any high school graduate, who is a US citizen, to pay for college. Their major, marketable or not, doesn\u2019t matter. By and large, their academic ability doesn\u2019t matter. (In the US almost any high school graduate can find a four-year institution that will accept them and their parent\u2019s money.) That\u2019s the \u201csystem.\u201d It is stupid. However, everybody acts surprised, and \u201cgets their nose out of joint,\u201d when student loans can\u2019t be repaid. Two out of three students who matriculate are either going to drop out or end up underemployed. They are going to have a tough time paying off their student loans. Many of these students didn\u2019t have any business, academically, being in college. Your Parents After the federal government, I blame the parents. Thomas B Walsh's answer to Why do many people in the US have lots of students loans? You I don\u2019t put much of the blame on you. You were naive teenagers when you made the dumb decisions that got you into a financial mess with student loans. But, Holy Cow! You graduated high school without understanding compound interest? You didn\u2019t bother reading the terms of the loans when you signed up for them? You felt so damn entitled, you gave no thought to what your family could afford to pay for your post-secondary education? Sorry, some of this falls on you. Notes Case in point. From the question, you don\u2019t even understand the difference between a federal student loan and a private student loan. ",

Current loans are offered at 2.75%. If you paid nothing on your student loans, it would take 22 years to hit $100,0000 and 58 years to hit $800,000. Of course, penalties can add more, but those will only happen if you don\u2019t meet income guidelines or don\u2019t work with you loan servicer. For undergraduate education, the US federal government will not loan anyone $100,000 for one degree. Most students are limited to a hair over $30,000. ",
