Current college students: welcome to start your own group and help answer questions about your college! - One of the biggest mistakes that people make on their college applications is sounding overly generic. All too often, students answer the question \u201cWhy do you want to attend this school?\u201d with something generalized and clich\u00e9d about the \u201cliberal arts education\u201d or the \u201cworld-class professors\u201d or \u201cfascinating classes.\u201d And when students are asked to answer this same exact question for 12 different schools, they may find it very tempting to copy and paste their response. After all, aren\u2019t all colleges basically the same? However, it is important not to underestimate the importance of this question. Admissions officers go through hundreds of applications, and if you want yours to stand out from the crowd, then you have to think carefully about your answer. A generic response along the lines of \u201cI want to attend this university because of the opportunity to take liberal arts classes and develop as an individual\u201d will send your college admissions officer to sleep. More importantly, a clich\u00e9d response will signify to the college admissions officer that you aren\u2019t actually interested in their school. And colleges tend to not accept students who don\u2019t seem genuinely interested in them. Here are five ways to write a college application that isn\u2019t generic. 1) Reference the school colors, motto, mascots, or other symbols. For example, if the school\u2019s colors are blue and gold, you can talk about how you look forward to walking into your first day of anthropology class decked out in blue and gold. Or, if the school mascot is a lion, you could talk about how excited you are to attend a football game tailgate and cheer for the Lions. This is incredibly simple, but it can make a huge difference to your application. It would show the college admissions officer that you\u2019ve done your research, and you\u2019re genuinely excited about attending this particular school. 2) Talk about specific extracurricular activities, student organizations, and clubs that you\u2019re interested in participating in. It is important to make these as school-specific as possible. For example, instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m excited to join the school newspaper because I like to write,\u201d try saying something like \u201cI\u2019m excited to join The Harvard Crimson, because of its long and florid history, as well as its penchant for publishing controversial opinion pieces, such as \u2018When We Let Hate on Campus.\u2019\u201d Remember\u200a\u2014\u200acolleges want to admit people who will become active members of the campus community. Research all of the extracurricular offerings, think about which ones you would actually be interested in joining, and write about them with as much detail as possible. 3) Talk about specific classes, professors, and academic experiences that you\u2019re interested in. Many college course offerings can be found online with a little research. This way, instead of writing \u201cI\u2019m interested in studying biology,\u201d you could write \u201cI\u2019m interested in pursuing a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology, and I\u2019m particularly excited to take the class \u2018The Brain: Development Plasticity and Decline\u2019 with Professor Sam Kunes.\u201d Even better, you could go on a college visit, which often comes with the opportunity to attend classes and even speak with professors. If you had that opportunity, this would be a great time to reference back to specific conversations you had with professors or specific classes you attended. This would show that you take initiative and that you\u2019re academically curious. 4) Reference back to conversations you had with current students at the college. A lot of information about each college can be found online\u200a\u2014\u200ainformation about extracurricular activities, academic offerings, symbols and colors and mottos. But some things cannot be found online. In order to really learn more about the college, it\u2019s important to talk to current students at the college. If you visit the college, you often get the opportunity to speak to current students and learn more about the aspects of the school that are less tangible\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, the social scene, the sense of community, the school spirit. You can write about those experiences in your college application. For example, you could say something like \u201cI\u2019m particularly attracted to this school because of the tight-knit sense of community and collaboration that many current students point to as the highlight of their experience.\u201d 5) Try to imagine yourself at this school. Close your eyes and really think about the kinds of things you would do every day. Maybe you will be relaxing in the lawn on a sunny day. Maybe you will be poring over ancient texts in one of the many beautiful libraries. Maybe you will be rowing down the nearby river with the intramural team. Maybe you will be making friends in the dining hall, tossing ideas for startups over mozzarella sticks. Maybe you will be a research assistant for a professor. Maybe you will be running a Model Congress conference in Hong Kong. Get creative, and write about how you see yourself spending a day at that specific college. ",

            "answer_text": "Below are the best tips for writing a good college admission essay 1. Be concise. Even though the Common Application main essay has only a suggested minimum of 250 words, and no upper limit, every admissions officer has a big stack to read every day; he or she expects to spend only a couple of minutes on the essay. If you go over 700 words, you are straining their patience, which no one should want to do. 2. Be honest. Don't embellish your achievements, titles, and offices. It's just fine to be the copy editor of the newspaper or the treasurer of the Green Club, instead of the president. Not everyone has to be the star at everything. You will feel better if you don't strain to inflate yourself. 3. Be an individual. In writing the essay, ask yourself, \"How can I distinguish myself from those thousands of others applying to College X whom I don't know\u2014and even the ones I do know?\" It's not in your activities or interests. If you're going straight from high school to college, you're just a teenager, doing teenage things. It is your mind and how it works that are distinctive. How do you think? Sure, that's hard to explain, but that's the key to the whole exercise. 4. Be coherent. Obviously, you don't want to babble, but I mean write about just one subject at a time. Don't try to cover everything in an essay. Doing so can make you sound busy, but at the same time, scattered and superficial. The whole application is a series of snapshots of what you do. It is inevitably incomplete. The colleges expect this. Go along with them. 5. Be accurate. I don't mean just use spell check (that goes without saying). Attend to the other mechanics of good writing, including conventional punctuation in the use of commas, semi-colons, etc. If you are writing about Dickens, don't say he wrote Wuthering Heights. If you write about Nietzsche, spell his name right. Read more.. ",

            "answer_text": "A good college application essay does two things: Clearly addresses the prompt.Showcases something unique or interesting about you (usually through a story).A good essay is like putting a face to your name. The whole point of college application essays is to show the admissions office something they can\u2019t learn about you from test scores and data. Here are some tips to help you write a strong essay: Brainstorming: Think of several ways to address the prompt. Your first idea isn\u2019t always going to be the best. So don\u2019t get invested in a direction until you map out your options. Almost all prompts offer some opportunities to talk about yourself or share a story. Taking the time to think of several examples helps you decide which one is most relevant, which one you have the most to say about, and which reveals the most interesting thing about you. It\u2019s totally OK to ask friends and family to help you think of experiences you\u2019ve had that address the prompt. Once you have a list of ideas, talk through them with someone who knows you well to decide on the best one. Outlining: Get off the fence! Your essay is going to be a lot more interesting if you actually take a stance on something. Especially if the essay poses a question you aren\u2019t passionate about (like a twist on the apples and oranges question\u2014which is better?), it\u2019s easy to find yourself explaining the merits of both perspectives or hanging out in the middle ground. That\u2019s boring. Pretend like you care. Pick a side! Colleges want to see you advocate for one position and pick apart the flaws in an opposing argument. It\u2019s hard to do that when you don\u2019t commit to either side. Writing: Write how you talk. It\u2019s easy to feel like you have to \u201csound smarter\u201d because you\u2019re applying to college. But that almost always leads to stilted prose that don\u2019t sound like you, and don\u2019t clearly communicate what you\u2019re really trying to say. It\u2019s like wearing a tuxedo to a birthday party. Writing how you talk lets your voice come through strong, and your friends and family can always tell you if you start to sound too informal. Editing: Think about something else for awhile The worst time to start editing your essay is right after you\u2019ve finished writing it. You just tried to formulate your best thoughts. You banged your head against the desk to find the right way to word that sentence. When you start reading your essay right after writing it, you\u2019re naturally going to overlook even some of your most glaring mistakes. That\u2019s normal. And it\u2019s why you need to do something else. Seriously. You could: Play a video game.Read a book.Go to a movie.Hang out with friends.Binge watch the new season of Stranger Things.Go on a walk.Work out.Sleep.Write another college essay.Literally do anything else.If you feel comfortable waiting a few days to revise your essay, that\u2019s even better. The idea is that you take enough time focusing on other things that you can look at your essay with fresh eyes. Ideally, you\u2019d be able to read it as if someone else wrote it. That way you won\u2019t just catch glaring mistakes\u2014you\u2019ll find better ways to communicate your point, and maybe even better points to make. Those are just a few of my best tips for writing a strong college application. ",

            "answer_text": "Traditionally, college admissions essays/personal statements are written as a story that show character, qualities demonstrated such as leadership and perseverance, overcoming hardship, etc. That\u2019s the WHAT, or the content of what you will be writing. In order to address the HOW, there could be several techniques you could utilize. Brainstorm-Brainstorming is something we\u2019ve been familiar with since those worksheets we got in fourth grade, but the process can be daunting when you feel as if you have very little content to work with. The quickest way to start the process is to simply take a blank sheet of paper and in the middle, write down \u201cME\u201d, or your name, or whatever the focal point of your personal statement should be. (It should be you.) Then, simply write down words that are offshoots of you. Focus on the positive and the qualities you\u2019ve demonstrated in your life, but if it is negative, elaborate on how that has allowed you to grow and change and develop. Remember: the events in your life are objective. The interpretation of those events become your subjective reality, as you process your life through cognition.2. Mindmap-Next, take those words and try to find the links between them. For example, if you wrote down ME in the middle, and the offshoots were a) track and field b) NHS c) social acceptance d) AP English composition f) Your family This is quite like a jumble without any kind of coherence initially. As it should be, because you\u2019re just getting started. Now let\u2019s look for the links. I have no idea what your background or personality or how you want to \u201cangle\u201d yourself to the colleges, so this has to be purely hypothetical. These 5 offshoots that I thought of off the top of my head represent sports, extracurriculars, a larger scope of HS life, academic courses, and background. Always think about what your words, sentences, and paragraphs represent. The meaning is more important than the literal words. Now, going deeper, what can we extract from these topics? Sports-leadership, teamwork, dedication, passion, achievement, competition, spirit, growth extracurriculars-going above and beyond, volunteering, sustaining excellence, balancing multiple obligations, potential leadership social acceptance-insight, analysis, relationships, humanity AP English composition-academic excellence, dedication to academics, focus, industriousness, will, interest, potential family and background-Connections, support, love, hardship, learning, growth, forgiveness, understanding 1. Layered depth-If you want to get a little fancier, we can go with something I\u2019ll call layered depth, which would be a kind of technique where you go deeper and deeper in a particular topic until you reach something so deep that it resonates and connects beyond a standard essay. Let\u2019s use the social acceptance example. a) School is tough, hard to fit in, like Mean Girls b) Why is school structure like that? Then you notice cliques c) How do people behave in cliques? Each person has a role in each group d) What is the function of each role of each person? e) How can one enter an established group or become expelled from a group through violating social norms From here, you have the opportunity to transition into a more academic and mature discussion of topics related to anthropology and sociology to show that you are more than just a typical candidate. f) How similar are humans to animals in the animal kingdom? Wolfpacks, bonobo monkeys, flocks of migrating birds, etc. (zoology) g) in-group out-group theory (psychology) h) How society functions (sociology) 1. Micro/macrocosm Lastly, microcosm and macrocosm can be used to take one tiny microscopic event and use it to symbolize a grand universal theme. Let\u2019s use sports in this example. You constantly finish last place. That\u2019s a normal occurrence. Somebody has to finish last in every race. But how does that feel? What does that mean? What did you do in response? Did you languish and accept it? Did you analyze it? Did you feel inferior? Is Darwinism the be all end all of land, or does man possess the power to harness his or her own strengths to overcome a situation through force of will and perseverance? That\u2019s one example. Another example could be SOMEONE ELSE constantly finishes last and gets bullied and picked on all the time. You, as an observer, do not contribute to the bullying nor do you aid this person. Meanwhile, you observe, and sit, and watch. How do you interpret this situation? What does this mean? What will you response in the future? Will you do anything? Did you feel compelled to help but felt powerless in the situation because of the power of the social situation? Or did you accept that such is life and one person can only do so much? These are the questions that will reveal your character, and the way you present your answers is the revelation of your own nature. There is no falsifying of content because you are who you are and nobody else. And nobody can be you. But just know that every instance, moment, event, or situation, no matter how mundane (such as Newton\u2019s apple falling from a tree), or cataclysmic (natural disasters, the terror you see in the news ever day), can represent and symbolize the essence of who you are. If you can present it well enough, and it\u2019s a good fit with the school, luck will be on your side. On that note, there will always be a factor of luck. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the means to put yourself in the best position to become the best that you are capable of becoming. Also, here\u2019s a free personal statement book that I wrote, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to write a full length, polished, and satisfactory book to my standards. But it\u2019s free so why not! Free Personal Statement Book Here\u2019s a script I wrote for a video regarding the writing process\u2026 In this video, we\u2019re going to skip a lot of the counseling process and move towards the personal statements because that\u2019s where a lot of the value is. In order to hone your editing skills, you should employ a technique I\u2019m going to refer to as \u201cThe 5 Point Check\u201d. It is essentially a checklist of key aspects of the writing in your student\u2019s essay. They are: 1) Tone 2) Structure 3) Grammar/Mechanics 4) Flow (transitions+diction) 5) Content Tone-Tone is the way something sounds. It can have a serious connotation, feeling, or vibe. This can be conveyed through periods and curt statements. Or\u2026it could be suspenseful\u2026and maybe even animated! The reader should try and stay consistent though, or else it can very difficult to establish the voice of the writer. Structure-The structure is the skeleton, template, or mold of the essay. The statement must progress forward in a way that is coherent, logical, and progressive. The classic way to ensure that structure exists before starting to write is by OUTLINING using a 5 paragraph essay. A 5 paragraph essay consists of: 1) Introduction, including the thesis statement at the end of the paragraph 2) Main Idea 1 (Body) 3) Main Idea 2 (Body) 4) Main Idea 3 (Body) 5) Conclusion that summarizes the essay and ties up loose ends That\u2019s the most BASIC structure though. There are many different ways to create form out of your substance, but as long as the essay makes sense as a cohesive whole, then structure has been established. Grammar/Mechanics-Grammar and mechanics are the rules of conventional writing. For a more in depth review of grammar, please check out this supplemental video. Please keep in mind that language is constantly evolving, so rules can be broken if it somehow appropriate. An example would be colloquialism, or if you want to sound friendly, as if you were talking to a peer. Flow-Flow is progression. Flow is smooth. It could be jagged if that\u2019s what you want to establish, but you want to put grab the reader with a hook, then put the reader in a trance with your articulate thoughts and your eloquent style. Simply progress naturally towards an eventual end of your story. Content-There is the ability to write. And then there\u2019s content. Content is the material with which you write. If you are a swordswith, your art is making swords. Your tool is a hammer, or whatever you forge swords with. Your MATERIAL is steel, or whatever you MAKE swords with. If you are a writer, your art is writing. Your tool is your pen, rhetorical devices, and your mind. Your MATERIAL is your content. Content is what life is made of. Your content is the steel with which you\u2019ll carve your character into the minds of your readers. It is most likely the most important component of the five aspects of writing we cover here. Content is important. Because content is king. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "How do you write a good essay? Very carefully. There is no formula to college essay writing, and that is exactly why colleges require one from you. The important part--even though this sounds fairly clich\u00e9--is to write from your heart. Everything you write should be truthful and important to you. If the words you are writing do not pull at your heartstrings, they certainly will not pull the heartstrings of an admissions officer. Keeping in line with the \"very carefully\" theme, the only way to write a good essay is to get it proofread as many times as possible. I registered more than ten hours of appointments with my school's Center For Writing to get professional advice on my college applications. The important distinction here is that these professionals did not write a single word of my essays--even after they offered suggestions for improvement--but talking with them gave me an idea of what an outsider thinks of my essay. Because your essay is about your life, your brain contains details that you may have forgotten to write down. It can be difficult to paint a picture with words that is true to the sights and sounds you experienced. Having a diverse group of people give you feedback prepares you and your writing to be reviewed by a committee of completely unknown people. I gave detailed advice regarding what content an applicant should include and what to avoid in response to the question Civil Services of India: What should you focus on when you're writing your college application essays for your undergrad? What are the qualities of a good essay? A good essay is... ...a complete and honest picture of who you are. Never underestimate the ability of trained professionals in their ability to detect a lying high school senior. Be honest about your mistakes and how you overcame them, but don't feel the need to spill secrets that reflect poorly upon you. ...a vignette that suggests what you would say if you could meet the admissions staff in person. A successful applicant is one that the college admissions staff can empathize with. Gaining another person's empathy is (relatively) easy in person, but a challenge when all you have is a few hundred words (when tens of thousands of other applicants also have those few hundred words too). ...within the length requirements. Write your essay so it is 80% of the maximum length allowed. Keep in mind that your true essay length limitation is not the posted limit, but the attention span of your reader. By keeping the length to about 80% of the maximum length, you leave room for all of the details the admissions staff want to know while leaving the essay short enough to motivate them to read your work in its entirety. Most importantly, never ever be so arrogant to exceed the length requirements. ...heavily polished and proofread. The biggest danger to your college essays are not typos or grammatical errors, but rather that your essay does not convey the message that you wanted. Different people can interpret an essay in different ways, and proofreading is a way to ensure that nearly all of those interpretations are positive ones. ",

            "answer_text": "Remember that a university is a brand, as much or more than any product. Ideally, they have an obligation to create an institution that is relevant, prestigious enough to attract top faculty and students, and insightful enough to provide programs than allow alumni to succeed academically, socially, athletically, and professionally. It must be safe so that the large variety of personalities can grow and mature together without hurting each other. A large, successful alumni will continue to perpetuate the brand through time, geography, other institutions, business, and governments. Any university is only as successful as its alumni and faculty. Any writing, from a professional piece, to a class assignment, to a college essay, becomes appropriate and outstanding not so much from the topic, but rather from what the topic reveals about the writer. A university wants a decent human being that has something positive to add to the environment and its brand. What have you learned? How have you changed? What are you realizing about world? Has some profound realization thumped you in the head? And most importantly, how are you different and more productive than student x? Also remember that reading any essay that positively differs from the flow of other essays immediately gives you an advantage (this definitely true for any essay you write for a teacher or instructor). The school knows your grades and scores. You volunteer. You are in extracurriculars and may play one or more sports. You play at least one instrument. You've been too poor or too rich. Your parents are wonderful or divorced. You need to find something that will resonate above the mundanity of these things and make you unique. What makes you edgy, sparkly, profound, or inspired? You are right on the cusp of adulthood and of learning so many things about yourself, but you've seen the glimmer of your future self. How is that person going to add to and to succeed at their university? Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "A college application essay is a great opportunity to tell your story. By telling your story through an essay, you have the opportunity to share all the interesting personality traits you have. Honest and genuine writing always stands out, so try not to fabricate a lot of lies. On the admission officer's part of the side, they have a lot of essays to go through which are mostly forgettable. The students try to impress the admission officers by writing smart things rather than explaining themselves. You don\u2019t need extra-ordinary characteristics to get an admission. The colleges are just looking for motivated students who can add some productivity to the first-year class. Here are some points you should consider before writing an application essay: 1)Include Something Important to You- It can be anything that has an impact on your life. 2)Don\u2019t Be a Cliche- Ignore writing the big win you got in a football game and how you helped in a group project. Try writing some unique experience and how it changed you as a person. 3)Being Funny- Remember reading a funny part in a novel that you still have fresh in your mind while the rest has vanished. Similarly, your essay could be a highlight if it has some humor in it. But keep in mind what you think of as humor might be different from that of an adult working in a college. 4)Give it Several Revisions- Write it several days in advance to have time for several revisions. Read it with the admission officer's point of view. Make sure it\u2019s written in the applicant\u2019s voice. 5)Be Appropriate- Answer the given question and don\u2019t copy from some other source. 6)A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed- Ask your friend or any known teacher to go through your essay.

            "answer_text": "Your application is mostly comprised of numbers: Your SAT/ACT scores, GPA, class rank, SAT Subject Test scores, and AP scores. However, the essay is the one time for you to come alive off the paper and become three-dimensional. It can help round out your strong application and showcase your personality. Find A Story That Highlights Your Best Qualities Students might get stuck trying to think of a big, life-changing event to write about in their essay. But even a regular occurrence can be used to create a memorable essay topic. However, most importantly, the essay needs to be personal and express something about you personally. Use your personal statement to highlight your best qualities without being boastful or arrogant. Show, Don\u2019t Tell The introduction paragraph is one of the most important parts of your essay because it must capture your reader's attention. The best way to do this is by using an anecdote. Anecdotes are my favorite way to open an essay because it can showcase a particular moment that had an impact on you. I recommend that you throw your reader right into the middle of the story. Using the five senses (sight, taste, touch, hearing, and smell) can be a useful tool to show, not tell throughout your opening paragraph. Try to make it seem like the reader is right there with you through your story. Use A Hook End your opening paragraph with a hook, so that the reader is left wanting more. By making your opening paragraph descriptive and personal, it can set the rest of your essay up to showcase your personality. Add Personal Details Throughout your essay, make sure to use many personal examples. Don't just tell us that you are empathetic. Tell us about a time you volunteered at a nursing home and spent hours talking with a particular resident. Tell us about the conversations, how you felt, and the impact the conversation had on you and the resident. Those types of stories will stick out much more to the admission officer reading your essay. End The Essay Strong To end your essay, make a reference to your opening story and the main idea throughout your essay. You might tell a similar story, use a quotation, or talk about the lessons learned. Tie everything together in your ending paragraph. ",

What\u2019s going on outside of you\u2014what you\u2019ve done, and what other people have done.After you\u2019ve written a draft of a true story about a situation that you felt good about, ask yourself, what will someone learn about me after reading this? Ask friends who read your draft the same question. Then edit as needed. I find that 90% of the time students need to add sensory details (what they saw, heard, felt, smelled, tasted) to make the story come alive. Dig deep. Be honest. Have fun.

            "answer_text": "A college admission essay is not so different from what you write in high school essay writing competitions. However, it is more than what technicalities and grammatical impeccabilities can give for you to standout. Making a point is secondary to showing who you really are to the deciding panel. Letting them see your intellectual capabilities only comes next to letting them peek the foundation of your personality and study habits. Telling them why you need to join their academe is not as appealing as telling them why you want to join them and make a difference like the rest of the alumni. Setting your goals is easy but that is not all to it when it comes to college admission essays. You need to include more elements that are often used as basis by schools. More than motivation and inspiration to push harder for that college diploma, you are expected to have a clear delineation of your plans on the duration of your stay \u2013 what you can contribute, what you can and want to change, how you will justify your alma mater after graduation. It contains more than a dream and a person or the things that inspire you. It must be concrete as any vagueness is not acceptable in writing, more so, a college admission essay. It is complicated. This is the kind of complication which decides on your faith for the next four years. For this reason, assess yourself if you can make it or not and do not force yourself just to be disappointed in the end. You may consider a last resort: buy college application essay. Buy college application essay if you know you can survive for four years in that school but do not have the capabilities to render a worthy piece as of now. Some students are not good in words but are genius in numbers. Some are utterly studious and deserve some merit but their writing style couldn\u2019t just make the cut. This is the time to buy college application essay from a recommended person or a trusted organization like what most businesses on the internet offer. For some, it may sound unjustifiable to buy college application essay and even take it as a form of cheating. But like the aforementioned point, this is only applicable if you know you can progress more in college and finish the course with flying colors. Other factors should also be considered before planning to buy college application essay. Asking other people to write the essay for you is nonsense if you cannot justify the contents by words. More so, a plan to buy college application essay is considered a bad joke if you cannot even pass the admission test and interview. You will just waste money. After assessing yourself and assuring that you can take the pressure to prove that given the time, you can write a better admission essay, then go and pick your source and buy college application essay at your own risk.

If you haven't already done so, thoroughly research the university that you plan to attend, and more specifically, the program that you are applying to be a part of.

Then, when you write your essay, relate your experiences, goals, and so on to the mission and objectives of the school or program to which you are applying and to the career field you plan to pursue. Be sure to keep certain things in mind as you write this essay: \u2022\tWhat the question asks to consider exactly. Then list some relevant main ideas; use this list as an informal outline for your essay. \u2022\tDon\u2019t write a generic essay that could pass for one that any other could have written.

Ask people who know you well what they would say about you. \u2022\tDon\u2019t simply repeat information that is already on your application form or in your resume. \u2022\tDon\u2019t use long words and obscure vocabulary simply to impress the others. \u2022\tThe appearance of your essay is important.

Good writers can write about something that is usually dismissed as too mundane for a college essay in a way that imbues the topic with passion, quirk or humor. Take any of these essay examples shared by real college students. Ranging from raindrops to bumper stickers, these successful essays use an inconsequential item to anchor the essay so that the item reveals aspects about the writer\u2019s background or point of view. If there\u2019s a weird hobby you\u2019ve pursued over the years, that\u2019s a great topic to explore. Ultimately, the most important thing is for your essay to be authentic to what you care about. If that\u2019s curing cancer, write about that. But if it\u2019s how, over the years, you\u2019ve tried dozens of ways to tie your shoes in the quest to find the best way to tie your shoes, write about that. And think about what that commitment reveals about you and why those qualities may be what college want in a student. Here\u2019s a blog post that outlines what admissions offices are looking for in college applicants (e.g., leadership, passion, empathy\u2026) and, therefore, ways your essay can more effectively highlight your qualities as an ideal candidate.

            "answer_text": "The three keys to successful college application essays are a unique perspective,  strong writing, and an authentic voice. A unique perspective reveals how you see the world and what difference you have made through your actions. Share personal moments that reveal who you are as a human being in your essay. These moments could be something as simple as a memorable meal-- you don't need to have a 'superhero' moment.Successful college admission and scholarship essays are based in stories, not arguments. Storytelling builds a powerful emotional bridge between you and your audience and connects you to with the people who read your applications in admissions offices. Your college essay should be written differently than an analytical essay for your English class, but strong writing is still important. Your authentic voice is the voice you use when you are talking to your friends. To access your unique voice, tell your story out loud into a phone or computer, and use that as the base for your essay. Many students find their authentic voice while writing their college essays, but through over-editing turn the essays back into something generic that is no longer theirs.For ideas on successful college essay topics, check out: 5 College Application Essay Topics That Always Work ",

My suggestion is that for student to stand out among other well qualified applicants the candidate must first privately answer the \u201cwho\u201d question, and not a \u201chow\u201d question. Before you put pen to paper, you need to do a great deal of introspection - with or without the help of a mentor. Who are you, at your core and as an individual? What do you distinctly value? What have you done because it was meaningful to you and not because the experience was readily available? This is not easy, but if you are applying to selective colleges you are expected to exceed \u201ceasy.\u201d Rarely is there a formulaic approach to standing out. Those ideas are diametrically opposed. ",

Writing a compelling essay is a process, and the best writing can often be plucked from our stream-of-consciousness efforts. Don\u2019t edit yourself before you allow your creativity to warm up and pour onto the page. Never judge your writing until you have a few paragraphs written down first.
