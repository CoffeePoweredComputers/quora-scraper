            "answer_text": "It means brandishing or waving a pointed stick. Nothing particularly mysterious there. The name is somewhat comparable in semantics to names like Pallas in Greek, though the English version comes from archaic English schakken, and speer, meaning \u201cshake\u201d and \u201cspear.\u201d However, although the two components of the name come from English, the combination of the two into an actual name itself probably dates to after the Norman Conquest. In French equivalent, a \u201cshake-spear\u201d was a common Norman nickname or insult from a generation or two after the Norman Conquest. The French term became back-translated into Middle English a good 300 or 400 years before Shakespeare\u2019s day. It appears the Norman nickname was given to quarrelsome or argumentative people, so we assume one of Shakespeare\u2019s great-great-great grandparents must have been something of an ass or a troublemaker to get the nickname pinned on him, and once last-names became common, the title was passed down to Shakespeare.
