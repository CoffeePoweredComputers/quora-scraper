            "answer_text": "In the US the average controller salary is approx $122,000/yr. Starting pay for non-prior experienced trainees is around $37k base pay. There is also locality pay which based on the zip code your facility is in and is a percentage of your base pay. For example at my facility in NY the locality pay is about 30% on top of our base pay. Base pay varies on facility level. ATC facilities are ranked level 4\u201312, with 4 being the smallest/slowest and 12 being the busiest and most complex. Here is a link to the FAA ATC pay scale. AG means Academy Grad and is the starting salary after the Academy. D1\u20133 are developmental bands which you go through as you get 25,50, and 75% of the positions at your facility. CPC is certified professional controller and means you are fully checked out. https://www.faa.gov/jobs/working_here/benefits/media/atspp_pay_table.xlsx ",
