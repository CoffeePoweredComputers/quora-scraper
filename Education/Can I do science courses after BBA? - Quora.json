            "answer_text": "Dear, The education system is designed in a pyramid structure. In the beginning you study all the subjects but as you grow and complete your 10th class you select your area of interest and then study those subject to grow vertically in your chosen area. BBA is your chosen area after careful thought. It is a professional course and hence you should vertically graduate in that area. University allows science subjects only if you have studied the same in undergraduate level. ",
