            "answer_text": "The obvious biggest watershed moment determining the future of the US is coming in a few days, on Nov 3, in terms of the presidential election. If Trump wins or manages o somehow steel the election, I fear that the US is going to go down a very dark path as a nation. If Biden wins, there is a chance for repair, provided that he and his administration can manage to overcome the massive division in the nation and rally the majority of Americans behind a path of healing and new growth. In my view, the root cause explaining the current state of the union can be summarized in one word: self-interest. I think, it was beginning with President Reagan in the eighties, that the US allowed a form of capitalism to take root that is overly favoring the special interests of the wealthy \u2013 individuals and corporations \u2013 at the expense of the common good and all citizens sharing in the wealth of the nation as a whole. And because of that, greatly needed investment in the common good (infrastructure, healthcare, etc.) have been pushed down the line and there is no real vision for a better future. Over the years, the party of the wealthy minority, the GOP, has perfected its strategy to gain and hold on to power despite being the minority by adeptly abusing the many flaws in the US political system through massive voter suppression, gerrymandering, stacking the courts, deceitful propaganda and misinformation, allowing or outright enlisting adversary nations meddling with elections, etc. I do believe that in principle America as a nation has it in itself to renew itself and come out stronger than before. But the list of problems to be tackled in order to truly free the giant within is mindbogglingly long: # change the presidential voting system (electoral college) to truly reflect and not distort the popular vote# take politics out of the Supreme Court and develop it into an impartial legal watchdog with the entire nations well-being in mind# outlaw all attempts at voter suppression and ensure every American gets his/her vote# introduce suitable laws and regulations to prevent deliberate misinformation and mass manipulation via media and social media# improve the educational system and make higher education more affordable# improve the healthcare system to make it more equitable and affordable# work towards reducing the wealth gap\u2026 Of course, change is possible and with the right kind of attitude and resource-pooling should be feasible within, say, a decade as the US has overcome major crisis before.But I am seriously worried that the faction of the selfishly wealthy may have already pushed the system to a point beyond possible self-healing.

            "answer_text": "As sad as it sounds, I am not optimistic. The rift in the nation is wide and deep. There seems to be no way to engage in mature political discussions any more. I might be wrong about that, since the most extreme tend to be the most vocal, but from where I stand, the notion of \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people\u201d does not apply to the political discourse any more. It changed to \u201cof my peers, by my peers, for my peers, and everybody else can fuck off\u201d. This is bound to escalate.Hundreds of people are still dying each day of COVID-19, and #45 achieved his goal to get that out of the public discussion. If that does not change quick, the most pessimistic projections show a cumulative number of casualties in excess of 13,500,000 dead Americans, and even those assume a stable health care system. If a substantial part of HCPs is affected, the numbers could be even worse. With roughly 4% dead of the population, with the breadwinners most likely to be affected, we are talking of in excess of an additional 27,000,000 Americans with no income. Sooner or later, the economy is likely to simply collapse.People seem to listen to what can at best be described as misinformation, and I personally am not afraid to describe it as propaganda. When fact-free, predigested BS telling people what they should believe is aired instead of proper news, and a substantial part of the population buys into it instead of taking the effort of actually researching the issues at hand, it is a good recipe for disaster. Take it from a German \u2014 we had that shit, people bought into the fact-free conspiracy theories that gave simple answers to complicated questions. Not because they were stupid, but because they were tired and desperate, and finally somebody showed them an easy way out. Bending a few rules here and there did not sound like much of a problem at first. After a political opinion was declared illegal, it took the Nazis 24 days to convert Germany into a dictatorship in all but name. And America has dipped more than half a foot into the same Rubicon.America is at a crossroads, imho: She can either accept that the golden times will not come back by a miracle and she instead needs to do what she is very good at, namely to roll up her sleeves and work for it. Or she can refuse to do so, hoping for a deus ex machina to restore it. Germany chose the latter, and got itself a demon turning Germany into a hellhole. ",
