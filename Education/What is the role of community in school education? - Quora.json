            "answer_text": "I think there has to be a proper motivation and an understanding of what we study in school to some real-life examples in whatever fields be it mathematics , science , social-sciences.A lot can be done by teachers , but as per the community is concerned , why not : 1. Give students projects which allow them to interact more with the community , lets say to have some real data for some experiment. 2. Also , as per the resources schools should call people from the community in relevant fields to give talks in the school to aware students about ideas / situations which they are not aware of. 3. Also , these people can talk about their experiences during their school life  about what they did to get where they are or  should  have done to be more successful.  And how students can groom themselves early on to be easily absorbed in the industry. Teachers have ideas but sometimes students need inspiration from their heroes or someone whom they can more relate to. ",
