            "answer_text": "What are the difference between development studies and economics? Within economics, development is one of several fields or specializations, with programs called \u201cdevelopment economics\u201d or \u201ceconomic development,\u201d depending on the university. Usually a program called \u201csomething\u201d studies is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing from a mix of social sciences and/or humanities fields, so we get Women\u2019s Studies, American Studies, and so on. I would thus assume that a program called \u201cdevelopment studies\u201d is interdisciplinary, drawing from economics, as well as from other fields, perhaps sociology and political science. Take a look at specific program requirements to see if this is the case. ",

Development studies look as all aspects of a development, which MAY include economic feasibility, economic impact, etc. Economics is a discipline, a field of study. I\u2019ve done several economic studies including calculating \u201cmultipliers\u201d basic business enterprises, impact studies and developed several \u201cmarket\u201d and feasibility studies for various businesses.
