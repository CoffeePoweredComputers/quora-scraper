            "answer_text": "There are so many channels on you tube. But in my opinion , I would suggest you following channels ,as I'm also belong to science stream. For chemistry I would say Bharat panchal sir is best. His channel is chemistry guruji-Bharat panchal. For physics I followed Alakh pandey sir (physics wallah channel) and Baba gang channel, this both channel are more than enough for physics. For maths I will recommend Neha agrawal, she teaches on two channels one is vedantu math and other one is neha agrawal mathematically inclined. Hope I helped you :-) ",
