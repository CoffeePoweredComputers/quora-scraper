            "answer_text": "I don't know how you learn best, but I'd either recommend taking all of them at least to an introductory level with chemistry, physics and higher level calculus all together simultaneously OR (if you think like I do) start basic and work up, starting with math to statistics to physics to chemistry to biology to psychology to sociology to your directed field of interest. Your studies won't mean anything to you unless you know exactly what is going on from a foundational standpoint, and the only way to ground your foundation in is to begin by learning how to think, then how to discern what you think to what actually happens, to what you predict will happen given what you know and think will happen, then finding out what you predict is negligible compared to nature's laws and reality of chemistry, to realizing nature's actually got it right via applications in biology, to predicting the behaviour of living organisms through psychology to analyzing behaviors of populations know sociology to clarify indeterminate variables in geology, climatology, evolutionary history, and neurobiology to fully realize what neuroscience entails. This world is too big for one lifetime, but it's never too late to start getting curious. Happy adventuring! ",

Better still, sit in on some of those classes if you can and see how you like 'em. ",
