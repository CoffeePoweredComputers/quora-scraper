            "answer_text": "To select the best online training institute in India, you shall first of all narrow down to the course that you want to pursue. I do come from a management background so I would be talking about courses related to Business Management such as Digital marketing, Business Analytics tools (Tableau, Python, Six Sigma, etc.), Soft skill development, Corporate training, etc. There are a number of online institute these days and due to the tough circumstances in 2020, online mode of education has become quite popular as well as necessary. So it becomes quite important to know which one of them will be most reliable for you to pursue your course. Based upon my experience (I did a digital marketing course from a brand named Udemy). The course was pretty attractive as it was really economical as compared to other options. It was after an interview round with one of the market leader in India in FMCG sector, I realized that I wasted a lot of my time on learning something which did not do much value addition to me when seen with the eyes of a recruiter. And in my feedback the recruiter asked me do certification in digital marketing from a better institute. And this time based upon a friend\u2019s suggestion and my research I joined Edu4Sure. From my experience over there I learned the importance of case studies, live projects and live sessions and how they all are an important ingredient for all round understanding of a topic. Based upon my experience, I would suggest you to join Edu4Sure. Thankyou! ",
