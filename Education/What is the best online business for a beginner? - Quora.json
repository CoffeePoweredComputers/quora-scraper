            "answer_text": "For beginners, to start an e-commerce business, you have multiple choices. 1. Sell Your Thrift Store Finds Do you like thrift stores? Some people spent hours and hours searching for something interesting in thrift stores. There are many unique and interesting items such as Vintage t-shirt, old soccer jersey that you probably couldn\u2019t find at other normal stores. You can purchase these interesting items at an affordable price in thrift stores. Then you can sell them on your online stores such as Shopify or WooCommerce, you are not selling products, you are selling something unique. Believe it or not, many people love these tiny beautiful items but they just don\u2019t have time to collect these, then it\u2019s a chance for you to sell these products and get money as a reward. For example, if you buy a special pattern Vintage T-shirt for $5 in a thrift store, then you can sell it for more than $30. 2. Dropshipping Business Dropshipping is a business model in which sellers selling products without having any inventory, after customers purchasing products at their store, then the shop owner sends the order to the supplier, and the supplier ship the products directly to the customer. This is how dropshipping works. There is no doubt why dropshipping is considered one of the perfect business models for new e-commerce entrepreneurs, it doesn\u2019t require large startup capital and easy to set up and manage. Moreover, \u201cAliexpress+Shopify+Facebook\u201d is regarded as one of the most popular dropshipping modes among dropshippers. Merchants source products on Aliexpress(just select products, they don\u2019t really have to purchase any of them as inventory, but they could order some of these products\u2019 samples to check the quality), then launch these products to their Shopify stores and deliver ads on Facebook. If you are an e-commerce beginner, it is a great choice for you to start a dropshipping business. You don't have to invest too much money to test your products, just do product research and launch all of them to your online store, and if someone orders one product in your store, just send the order to your supplier, and they will deliver the product to your customer directly.If a certain product sales gradually improves, then you can investigate your niche market and find your niche industry for deep plowing. The most important thing in dropshipping business is to find your winning items. What we actually do? The common steps are as following: \u2460Find winning products on FindNiche \u2461Link to the Aliexpress product page on FindNiche \u2462Use Oberlo to upload the products to your Shopify store \u2463Run Facebook ads(it depends on what you are selling and your budget)  3. Print on Demand business Print on demand is a process in which you cooperate with suppliers to customize white-label products such as t-shirts or handbags with your own designs to sell them on a per-order basis under your own brand. From t-shirts to backpacks, print on demand enables you to put your own original ideas to the products then launch to your store and sell them online.  4. Selling Services as Products Adding services as products is the easiest way to sell service online. Then you can add images and descriptions to the items you've launched. And because the items you\u2019re selling are intangible, you have to take extra care with your item listings, making sure that you describe all details regarding this item clearly and accurately, and eye-catching images are needed to attract your customers. 5. Sell Online Courses More and more people choose to pay for knowledge, especially since the epidemic(COVID-19), More and more people are participating in online courses. You can clearly see from the graph below, as Google trends shows, the popularity of \"online course\" worldwide is increasing from Feb 2020, and it reached a peak in Apr 2020.  As an e-commerce beginner, you can sell online courses to earn money. All you need to do is put together a video walkthrough explaining a subject that you\u2019re familiar with and then host it on your own e-commerce store or your personal Instagrm/Facebook/YouTube. You already have the knowledge, you just need to share it. It will take some energy to prepare all the courses, but if you manage to design a popular high-value video tutorial series and welcomed among people, people would enroll in your courses and you will gain benefits. There are many people selling their courses online, they just record some courses, and sometimes they don\u2019t even update. But one course will bring them a continuous stream of income with time goes by. Of course, if you want, there are multiple choices for beginners to start an e-commerce business. The most important thing is to find you want to do, that's to say, find a field that you have passion, and then keep going. You're going to hit a shot. ",
