            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t prepared for an emotional scene as I was leaving my 3 year old at preschool the first time. I thought he would be fine and I would come back in 3 hours to get him. But he cried a lot and didn\u2019t want me to leave. What should I do, I wondered. The teachers were accustomed to this behavior which many children experience as they separate the first time from mom to stay on their own at school. The staff knew how to handle it. They said, we\u2019ll take care of everything, he will be ok. You just go on home. I did what they told me to, but I worried about him and felt like maybe I was abandoning him. When I went to pick him up, no crying, super happy to see me, all was well. He struggled9 with the emontional separation for about a week, but I noticed some of the older children in his (Montessori) class greeted him and led him off to do some of the works. It was gratifying to see him with other children who cared about him. It was all part of his development and part of his journey toward independence. He was fine just like 99.9,% of thenother kids who don\u2019t want mom to go. Handing off a crying child to a caring, experienced professional doesn\u2019t need to worry you. It is part of being a good mom. ",

            "answer_text": "It was great. I have a very large family, so we would leave our children with their aunt or grandma sometimes, so they could play with their cousins and they could get used to the idea that we can leave them with somebody and we will come back later. Our children went to the preschool at the school where they were going to go to kindergarten. They had a half day option, and they could go 2 or 3 days a week. That way they got used to going there, and got to know the children in their age group. When Kindergarten started, it wasn\u2019t a huge difference for them. I think people who have difficulty with this never leave their child with anyone until the first day of kindergarten, and it ends up being a huge traumatic thing, when it really doesn\u2019t have to be. Getting your child used to staying with someone else ahead of time makes the transition to kindergarten much easier. ",

            "answer_text": "First, be excited for the child- kids can tell when you\u2019re not comfortable and they can feed off of that. Talk about all the positive stuff that they will encounter, the new friends- maybe even learn new games. Encourage the kid to have fun, be themselves and that you cannot waitnto hear everything when you pick them up. Hug them- love them- send them to school. Then- get to the car. Take a deep breath! It will be okay. The silence isn\u2019t bad- if it is the only child you have- you will soon remember how you had hobbies or even go back to school yourself-but you\u2019ll rediscover yourself. Plan your time to get everything done, and prepared for when your child returns. Meet with friends, go exercise, clean up and read all day- uninterrupted. Or go shopping, get a mani- pedi. Have a dance party alone and just turn the music up loud. The possibility is endless. Then go get your child- listen to everything, ask questions, laugh and breathe. You\u2019ll enjoy it. It will get better as you learn you and your new found chapter in life. If you have other children in the home- it will look different- but at least you\u2019ll still be busy handling the other child in your care. But know that it will be okay. ",
