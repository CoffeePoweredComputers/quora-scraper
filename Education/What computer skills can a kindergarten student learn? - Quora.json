            "answer_text": "My older son is a kindergartener. Desktop Computer He can type while looking at the keyboard, punch in numbers and use a mouse. While using the mouse, he frequently drags the mouse a little bit while clicking, opening a link in a new window. He can put websites in his bookmarks (videos he wants to save for later, and watch a hundred times) He can turn on and off the computer, both using the power button and the start menu. He prefers the power button, even though I always tell him he should use the start menu. He prefers the desktop computer for practicing his math and watching videos. iPad He loves the iPad because it has no phyical keyboard, the mouse is his finger, and he can carry it around. He can take pictures, movies, play any kind of game (racing and puzzle games are his favorite) and he knows where to go to find new games (the App Store). He only needs to see me put in the password once to remember it forever. iPhone Very similar to the iPad, but he knows how to use Siri and make phone calls. He asks Siri silly math questions like what is 5 times fish. She never understands. He figured out that without the password you can still ask Siri questions. He has tried his hand at programming, but it's a bit over his head. He made a snowman and a moving car, then it was too much for him. To be frank, a kindergartener can do just about anything they put their mind to. Just as long as they are interested in it, they will never stop. The biggest hurdle for a kindergartener is the parent who always tells him or her to stop. I've seen too many parents debilitating their children by telling them what they can't do. What is the point of trying something new if mom might say \u201cyou aren't old enough for that yet?\u201d ",
