            "answer_text": "There are many benefits of learning from others. When I was younger, I actually tried to learn from the mistakes that others had made, hoping I would not make the same mistakes myself. For the most part, it worked well. Unfortunately, I have had to make some mistakes on my own. Not everyone is convinced they can learn from others. Some people are slow learners, or they just do not learn from others at all. That's always very sad to me. As a retired police officer, I spend most of my TV watching time viewing true crime stories. Suffice it to say that many people residing in prison (or those who die very young) do NOT learn anything from other people. I didn't have to watch TV to learn that. As a police officer I saw people like that all the time. No amount of talking, reasoning, or cajoling, could convince these young people into even considering another way of life besides drug dealing or burglary. Because \u201conly fools work for a living\u201d. Mind you I was taking them to jail, handcuffed in the back of a police car, so it wasn't like they had gotten away with it. They were caught, they had \u201cfailed\u201d, they were paying the price. They should have been \u201clearning\u201d from their mistakes, but obviously were not. A dear friend of mine is a germaphobe. He will NOT use handrails. A couple of years ago he called me to tell me his son (about 27/28), was in the hospital on life support. His cat had run down the stairs and he had chased it, not using the handrails, and he tripped and fell, causing catastrophic brain damage. He died a few days later. Did my friend teach his son to not use handrails, or was it just youthful carelessness that caused him to not grab the rails? I don't know, I just hope Robert doesn't blame himself for his son's death. i have about a million more examples, but I think that will do for now. So, what are the benefits of learning from others? One of them is, you can avoid making the same mistakes they did. ",

            "answer_text": "Without learning, none of us would exist. Most of think of learning in terms of what one human teaches to another. However there are many things that learn. When clay is molded into the shape of a mug and fired into a kiln, it learns its shape. When strands of DNA interact with proteins to recombine and form new organisms, those organism learn what they are. When stars coalesce in interstellar nurseries, when leftover matter comes together to form planets, these forms too have learned their natures. Without learning there would be no difference from one moment to the next. Without learning, there would be no such thing as time. And yet, learning in many ways is an accident. In closed systems the overall entropy must always increase. Disorder must reign supreme in the universe. This is one of the rules by which the universe governs itself. Eventually, as far as we know, all things will be forgotten and it will be as if we never were. But for now we exist. The sun forgets vast amounts of matter, and we use the energy released from that forgetting to subsist on our renegade patch of knowledge. We live our lives day to day, experiencing joys and sorrows. And sometimes we forget how fragile it all is. And we use the energy of that forgetting to subsist on our little patches of knowledge. Some of us forget too much. Some of us not enough. But we all learn. We all change irrevocably into something new whether we wish it or not. There is no way to exist without that happening. Without learning, none of us would exist. ",
