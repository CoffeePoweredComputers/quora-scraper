            "answer_text": "I am going to take you at face value and assume your judgment is correct because I have known people in authority like this and I have had teachers like this when I was growing up who were prejudice against me because I was poor and the only kids they validated were fresh faced perfect middle class kids (which it sounds like you are). I think this is typical. All the kids around you that are outsiders, labeled nerds, trouble makers etc. - they are all dealing with the same issue you are except they have decided they are the problem not others and thus live in shame everyday. They've probably even slacked off and given up on their potential. You are lucky that you have a clear head and see the problem. Whatever you do don't give up. You can ask to change teachers. If that's not possible you could make a copy of your next assignment and ask two different teachers to grade it to see if the grade is the same. I really don't have great solutions. There are going to be people like this all the time and the only effective way I know is to avoid them. In college you do have the option of choosing classes with teachers with great reputations and those you like. In high school you just have to bear with it. You might want to double evaluate just to make sure it isn't just the teacher\u2019s style and has nothing to do with you. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on the information in your details, you will have teachers like this all the time; there isn\u2019t much you can do. The one thing I can assure you in cases like this is that they don\u2019t hate you\u2014this is just the way they grade/teach. Some are just harsh/strict so students will take their class seriously. It\u2019s not personal. They might not even see it as a harsh grading. Besides, it doesn\u2019t sound like your grades are suffering as a result if you have perfect marks like you say you do in your question. I mean, if she were giving you grades that were all consistently Fs when your work was correct through and through, that would be a problem. You feel like you deserve a higher grade, but does she feel you deserve a higher grade? I get it, it\u2019s frustrating to work really hard, expect reinforcement, and not get it. But that happens. Some teachers will push you in ways you don\u2019t feel you need, or want to be pushed. My advice? Ask her how you can improve as a student. Ask her what you can do to earn the higher grade you want. You will earn some respect that way, I promise. You and your teacher are not competitors, she is not your enemy, you are a team. I sincerely doubt that any of her grades have been personal towards you. ",
