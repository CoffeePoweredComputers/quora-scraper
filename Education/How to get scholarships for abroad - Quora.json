            "answer_text": "Getting a scholarship for your studies is a dream come true. Scholarships are just free money that can help you financially. However, the application for scholarships is not always easy. There are some courses that are very expensive, like MS and B.Tech, and this makes it difficult for some students to afford them. Colleges usually provide scholarships to some students who are academically strong. Therefore, if you want to bag some scholarships, follow this guide where we help you by providing some tips for a successful scholarship application. What is a scholarship? A Scholarship is simply a monetary benefit given by colleges to academically good students. It is a token of appreciation for such students. Scholarships also aim to help financially weak students who may not be able to afford the fees of the college they are joining. Why try for a scholarship? As mentioned earlier, scholarships are meant to be given to students who may not be able to afford the college fees but are academically sound. However, these scholarships can also be availed by other students, but it is rarely seen for a scholarship to be given to financially strong students. What documents are required for applying for a scholarship? Before you can be awarded a scholarship, the selection committee needs to verify if you are eligible to get a scholarship. For this, they need a lot of documents and scores to determine if you can perform well in the program you are applying for. The required documents may vary between scholarship programs, but the following is the list of commonly demanded documents: Undergraduate Score: This can either be GPA, CGPA, percentage or even percentile scores. This is one of the most important things that the selection committee needs so that they can judge your potential and see if you are worth the scholarship. GMAT or GRE Scores: Applicants having a score lower than the threshold scores are often rejected. Some universities declare the minimum score requirements, some don\u2019t. As is generally seen, having your scores in the top 10 to 15 percentiles can get you the scholarships. Letter of recommendation: Letter of recommendation is actually a very important document. It helps the selection committee members see how you are as a person. Sometimes, if your reference shares something that is interesting related to your goals and studies, it can lead you to get the scholarship. Professional experience: This statement helps the committee acknowledge your ability to cope up with the academics and projects you will have to do during your MS degree. Any published research papers or texts: Though not that much needed, yet it helps your profile because it indicates that you spent some time doing some research work that was worth publishing and is passionate about studies. Getting a scholarship should be one the top priorities for any student applying for their degree programs. It acts as a source of free money for your academic achievements, while also giving you some recognition. There are many international scholarship programs available to help the students. Many universities also provide their own scholarship programs. Be sure to read their guidelines, rules and eligibility criteria before applying for scholarships to avoid confusion later. All of us wish to grab the maximum out of scholarships and grants for admissions into college. But how many of us actually achieve it? Not many. But there are some genius students like Michael Brown, who grab not one, or two or three, but 20 scholarships, all from the top 20 colleges. Read this inspiring story of Michael Brown: The American Teen with Top 20 Colleges' Scholarship worth $260K. Types of Scholarships Before you start your hunt, have a look at the kinds of scholarships available. Generally, they are classified into these four types: Offered by the Government.Offered by the Unis: For the academic year 2012-13, these were the top ten Unis in the USA that offered the most aid: Wesleyan University, Stanford University, Amherst College, Trinity College, University of Chicago, Williams College, Yale University, Skidmore College, Harvard University, and Dartmouth College.Offered by philanthropists and private organisations: Leading establishments like The Reliance Foundation, Tata Group, Sun Foundation, and Aditya Birla Group are just a few of many prominent ones that offers scholarships to students.Offered as research grants (for doctoral study).Since you are here, I would also like you to read Does applying for scholarships and financial aid influence your admissions decision? Hope it helps!! ",

            "answer_text": "A recent survey found that students indicated high cost was the greatest deterrent to studying overseas followed by the lack of scholarship opportunities. However, with proper information and planning hopefully no student aspiring to go abroadwill face this predicament and compromise on their academic endeavors. There are a number of scholarships offered by schools, universities and external agencies that can help make studying abroad affordable for Indians. Let\u2019s probe into the various options: 1. University Scholarships.One of the best sources of financial aid can be the college you attend. Universities provide aid through grants and scholarships which do not have to be repaid and can be offered based on need or merit. For example: Tata Scholarships at Cornell University\u2013 There is US$25 million endowment from the Tata Education and Development Trust that supports around 20 Indian scholarsat Cornell. To be eligible, it\u2019s necessary to first be accepted into an undergraduate course at Cornell, and then apply for need-based financial aid. The British Council \u2013The British Council recently announced the single largest number of scholarships ever launched in a year in India, by offering around 370 scholarships worth almost 1 million pounds. There are 36 UK institutions participating in this program and scholarships will be offered for 260 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. 2. Current Learning Institutes. The institution you currently attendcould be a resource for financial aid. It\u2019s important to speak to your school and department heads to understand if any scholarships are available and what their admission criteria are. For example: Davis United World Colleges Scholars Program- All graduates of UWC schools who gain admission on their own merits to selected U.S. colleges or universities qualify for need-based scholarship support through the program. The program currently supports over 2,700 scholars at 94 partner colleges and universities throughout the United States. 3. Community Organizations. It is quite common for community groups to encourage and support exceptional members in their academic endeavors. For example: Mustard Seed Foundation (The Harvey Fellows Program) - Provides scholarships to Christian students who are pursuing graduate studies at premier universities in fields considered to be underrepresented by Christians and who possess a unique vision to impact society through their vocations. 4. Private Organizations.There are a number of trusts, foundations and private groups that look to aid exceptional candidates. The criterion varies depending on the ethos of the institution, but you will have to detail why you are the right candidate. For example: RotaryGlobal Grant Scholarship Program - Supports international study at the graduate level and funds graduate-level coursework or research for one to four academic years. It is a partnership between the district / club in the study location and the district / club in the scholar\u2019s home country.The minimum grant amount is US$30,000. InlaksShivdasani Foundation Scholarships \u2013 Provides scholarships of up to US$100,000 for exceptional Indian students to study in North America or Europe. The scholarship covers tuition fees, adequate living expenses and one-way travel.Applicants must be under 30 and reside in India at the time of application. NarotamSekhsaria Foundation - Awards interest-free loan scholarships to Indian students with a consistent andstrong academic record. The scholarship amount can be up to Rs. 20 lakhs and is awarded to students who wish to pursue postgraduate studies at prestigious Indian and international universities. 5. Government.The Indian Government, both individually and in collaboration, have launched scholarships to help finance proficient students looking to study outside of India. For example: Government of Telangana\u2013 Introduced the \u201cOverseas Study Scheme for Minorities\u201d for the benefit of the students belonging to minority community. Financial assistance will be sanctioned to 500 minority students/graduates per year to pursue Post Graduate/Doctoral studies abroad as per the guidelines. Fulbright-Nehru Fellowships- The Master's Fellowships are designed for outstanding Indians residing in India to pursue a master's degree at selected U.S. colleges and universities. Selected fellows have completed the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree, have at least three years of work experience, and are committed to return and contribute to their communities. There are a number of resources Indian applicants can utilize to fund their study abroad. It\u2019s imperative you do your research, connect with targeted colleges, probe into Government schemes, reach out to external agencies and speak to successful students. Start early and thoroughly explore all the options available before making your final decision. ",

What we find very surprising is some students just blindly believe every scholarship myth that litters the internet and think twice to bother even applying. Quite obviously, you will never get one if you never apply! Don\u2019t be a misguided student. Know your facts before jumping to conclusions. We do agree with you that finding scholarships may be quite challenging, but it will be worth your time and efforts.

            "answer_text": "Scholarships abroad are highly competitive and depend a lot on the applicant and his/her background. Your job as an applicant is to ensure that your application is top notch and of the highest quality. Your SOP, academic performance and your GRE score play a very important role in determining whether you get a scholarship or not. In fact, you can get your SOP reviewed by GyanDhan\u2019s team of experts for free, so that any scope of improvement can be pointed out. Most of the students who apply to universities abroad expect a scholarship. This is a natural expectation considering that most universities are expensive and the loan amount offered by banks is usually limited. Most middle-class students prefer not to pursue their education abroad if the university does not give them a decent scholarship. There are a lot of scholarships provided by charitable trusts, individuals, governments and by the universities. Some of these are based on diversity, academic performance, research experience, previous working domain, etc. The criteria for scholarships differ on an individual basis. You can find an extensive list of scholarships here. You can also reach out to professors from the department to which you are applying to and ask them for relevant Research Assistantship/ Teaching Assistantship roles. You can read more about it here how you can try obtaining an assistantship. This will help you cover a good amount of your living expenses. In addition to that, most professors have very good industry contacts. If you manage to work hard and impress the professor, you can rest assured that he/she will recommend you for internships/job opportunities in his/her industry contacts. ",

If however you have an exceptional record in your studies or you were consistently good then you can be eligible for a good amount of money being waived off for your program. ",

Most foreign scholarships are not based just on academic achievements, but based on a combination of factors such as academic qualifications, ambition, English Test Scores, extracurricular activities, financial need etc. There are several scholarships that are just for Indian citizens and other developing countries, aimed at education people all over the world. These are by external organizations that have ties with local universities. Every scholarship has unique requirements, so make sure you read them carefully.
