            "answer_text": "Previous writers have already made the simple distinction between a college and university clear. Therefore, my job is to complicate it a bit. Saul Kripke is one of the brightest people on the planet (His IQ and rapid move to prof at Princeton are legendary). His introduction into philosophy of the concept of a rigid designator might prove useful to answer your question. This concept basically says that the name of something refers it in all its possible modes of being even if that something changes over time.  Why am I telling you this? Here\u2019s an example. One of the top colleges in the US is called: The College of William and Mary.  When it was founded and existed over a long period of time it was what the other writers define as a college-- A stand-alone place rather than a set of schools under a larger frame. But that has now changed: here is the list of schools and degrees at the College of William and Mary: Academics\u2022\tPrograms in Arts & Sciences and our four graduate/professional schools: Business, Education, Law and Marine Science\u2022\tOver 30 undergraduate programs, 23 graduate and professional degree programs in Arts & Sciences, Business, Education, Law and Marine Science\u2022\tDegrees conferred: B.A., B.B.A., B.S., Ed.D., J.D., LL.M., M.A., M.A.C., M.B.A., M.Ed., M.P.P., M.S., Ph.D., Psy.D. According to the definition of a college, the College of William and Mary is not a college. But its name, following the rules of rigid designator, has stayed the same.  Why not change the name? It is a brand thing in part and it would upset the alumni. I say all this as there are a number of colleges these days that are named colleges but in fact have schools within it that would make them, according to a standard definition, a university.  An analogy might help to make the point one more time. There are rock groups out and about these days who may have only one original member, but that is still called by the well-known name. The rigid designator concept defies how this name remains the same despite significant changes to what it actually is.  So when you look at colleges in the US you might be surprised to find that a number of them are not much different than universities except in the name. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:A rigid designator designates the same object in all possible worlds in which that object exists and never designates anything else. This technical concept in the philosophy of language has critical consequences felt throughout philosophy. In their fullest generality, the consequences are metaphysical and epistemological. Whether a statement's designators are rigid or non-rigid may determine whether it is necessarily true, necessarily false, or contingent. This metaphysical status is sometimes out of accord with what one would expect given a statement's apparent epistemological status as a posteriori or a priori. Statements affected include central ones under investigation in philosophical subdisciplines from the philosophy of science to mind to ethics and aesthetics. Hence, much of the discussion in various subdisciplines of philosophy is explicitly or implicitly framed around the distinction between rigid and non-rigid designators. ",

            "answer_text": "In the United States, the word \"school\" describes any place where people learn. You can call a college a \"school.\" You can even call a university a \"school.\" You can use the word \"school\" for any English language institute, undergraduate or graduate program, or secondary (\"high\") school. U.S. university or college follows after high school, or secondary school. A college in the U.S.A. is not a high school or secondary school. College and university programs begin in the thirteenth year of school, when a student is 17 or 18 years old or older. A two-year college offers an associate's degree, as well as certificates. A four-year college or university offers a bachelor's degree. Programs that offer these degrees are called \"undergraduate\" schools. A \"university\" is a group of schools for studies after secondary school. At least one of these schools is a college where students receive a bachelor's degree. The other schools in a university are\"graduate\" (also known as \"postgraduate\") schools where students receive advanced degrees. Therefore, a university offers both the bachelor's degree and graduate degrees such as the master's (M.A.) and doctorate (Ph.D.). You can earn a bachelor's degree at either a college or a university. However, students in the U.S.A. prefer to use the word \"college\" rather than the word \"university\" when they talk about four-year undergraduate programs and the bachelor's degree. They use phrases like,\"going to college\" and \"a college degree,\" when they talk about undergraduate programs at either a college or a university. Most \"colleges\" are separate schools. They are not located in a university. Some colleges are part of a university and are located on the university campus. (The \"campus\" is the school buildings and surrounding area). A few colleges offer graduate programs in selected subjects. However, it is usually universities that offer graduate programs. So, Americans use the word\" university\" and not \"college\" when they talk about graduate study. Thanks for reading Jawahar ",
