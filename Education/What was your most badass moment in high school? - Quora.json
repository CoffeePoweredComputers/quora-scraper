            "answer_text": "In grade 10 I had formed a tight bond with a couple of other guys. We were fairly renowned for being a group of shit disturbers. Now, nothing really bad, but we were the quintessential class clowns. We were frequently sent to the principal\u2019s office for disrupting the class (i.e. making everyone, including the teachers, break out laughing). And look\u2026 I get it. It\u2019s really hard to get through to a bunch of distracted teenagers with me cracking wise about Adam Smith\u2019s economic theories. The Vice Principal was a complete jackass. He HATED us and we would frequently whine to our parents that we were complete innocents *cough*, and that the VP was simply out to get us. Our parents, quite obviously, did not exactly embrace our protestations of innocence\u2026 until one fateful day. Okay, it\u2019s 1982 and The Who have announced that they\u2019re \u201cpacking it in.\u201d This is their \u201cfarewell\u201d tour. I need you to picture my bedroom wall: I have a giant black \u201cMaximum R & B\u201d flag hanging in the corner and the wall is completely covered with photos of Pete, Roger, John and Keith (sorry Kenny). I\u2019m also a huge fan of \u201cThe Jam\u201d and pretty much all things Mod. I dress like I fell off the cover of Quadrophenia. It was a big deal to me. My parents, being pretty cool for\u2026 you know\u2026 \u201cparents\u201d at the time\u2026 gave us permission to camp outside of the place that was going to sell \u201cbus packages\u201d to Toronto to see the show. Listen, this was the 80\u2019s. There wasn\u2019t \u201cthe internet\u201d and \u201cbus packages\u201d were a thing. Okay, so the next day someone pulls a fire alarm at the school and \u201cMr. Green\u201d immediately grabs the attendance list, looking for suspects. Like a scene out of a cheesy 50\u2019s film noir, he whips out the attendance list for the day and sees that we\u2019re all absent. \u201cAha!\u201d So Greeny overplays his hand. He grabs the phone and calls my father, informing him that he has WITNESSES who saw us pulling the fire alarm. I like to imagine that he had his feet up on the desk when he made this call. Had this gamble paid off, he would\u2019ve been done with us for good. Pulling a fire alarm is serious shit. Expulsion worthy. Oh, except that we\u2019re sleeping on wet concrete outside of a storefront in the downtown core. My late father (miss you, Dad) says, \u201cOh you have witnesses, do you? That\u2019s really interesting because my son is waiting outside of Treble Clef with his best friend so that they can buy tickets to see \u201cThe Who.\u201d Green\u2019s face must've turned red (you thought I was going to say green, didn\u2019t you?). But Greeny is an uber-dickhead and when cornered, he decides to double-down. \u201cWell, do you think that\u2019s wise to let them skip school for such a frivolous thing?\u201d Bad move, Greeny. Do NOT tell my father how to parent his kid. God, I wish he had recorded that conversation. My dad launches into him. \u201cYou know, he told me that you were out to get him and I didn\u2019t believe him. If you harass my son one more time, I\u2019m going to get a lawyer and I\u2019ll have your job.\u201d OMG, the next day at school was THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE!! Sorry, Jenn\u2026 it was even better than our marriage. I know that I told you different, but come on\u2026 even you have to give that a second place to this. It was like being handed the golden ticket. I could\u2019ve burned that place to the ground after that and Greeny wouldn\u2019t have been able to do shit. The best part was seeing him in the hallway outside of the cafeteria. He held the door open for us, smiling through clenched teeth\u2026 \u201cGood morning, gentlemen.\u201d Like the snot-faced little punks we were, we just laughed as we walked through the door, never acknowledging him. He called us back and tore into us about what poor manners we had, but he was a toothless tiger at that point. Eventually I matured (somewhat) and my visits to the principal\u2019s office dwindled off. He did get revenge on my buddy, though. He took out a boundary map of school districts and determined that Jason\u2019s house was one block outside of our high school\u2019s zone. Jason also dated his daughter so I like to imagine that metaphorically, he was just returning the favour. ",

            "answer_text": "I was in 12th grade, a senior. I still had Physical Education. But not *just* P.E.. Oh no\u2026 Because I was low-vision, I took corrective P.E.! For those of you who have never HAD CorrP.E., it is the \u201cshort bus\u201d class. While other students were playing softball, football, basketball and soccer\u2026 WE were doing calisthenics (does anyone remember the \u201cChicken Fat\u201d record?! THAT one!) or stretching, or balancing things. (This is generally where I start the guitar part of \u201cAlice\u2019s Restaurant\u201d) Yes, balancing things. One class the Instructor had us balance a ping-pong ball on a paddle and walk across the gym with it. If we dropped it, we had to start over. With only one functioning eye, I had no depth perception and my coordination isn\u2019t the greatest. I got the paddle and ball and started off. Oops! Crap! I put the ball back on the paddle and tried again. Halfway across OOPS! Crap! On the THIRD trip I got pissed. I grabbed the ball and smacked it on, denting the side in. I set it on the dented flat side and carried it triumphantly across. That was not the badass moment. Oh no. Our teacher was absolutely beside herself! I had never seen an adult come unglued like that! \u201cYou BROKE school property! You will REPLACE that ping-pong ball, or you will NOT get your GRADE!\u201d she screamed in my face. \u201cDo you understand me?!\u201d Say what?!! Replace? A? Freakin\u2019? PING-PONG? Ball?! Her face was scarlet, her sweaty hair was in her eyes and I could see her tonsils as she blessed me out for destruction of the (all rise and place your hands over your hearts) Property of the Los Angeles Unified School District. It was one month to graduation; and she was threatening me with loss of that grade. It was also Friday. I went home over the weekend. I came back on Monday. In sixth period, she saw me approaching and met me outside the locker room, \u201cWhere is my Ping-Pong ball?!!\u201d Sorry about this, but yes, she always spoke in italics. I feigned ignorance giving her my best Doublemint-popping smile and a vacuous Valley-Girl 18 year old \u201cHuh?\u201d just to see the veins pop out on her forehead. \u201cOhhh\u2026 I forgot.\u201d \u201cYou have TWO WEEKS, young lady and I had BETTER have that Ping Pong ball in MY POSSESSION or YOU are not graduating! Do I make myself CLEAR?!\u201d I resisted the urge to scream back \u201cSIR, YES, SIR!!\u201d as I thought OMG, she\u2019s really going to go through with it! Well, luckily for me, she was then out for two or three days and I managed to stall until Friday. I skipped out FAST and spent the weekend planning. I needed my Mama to drive me. We went into L.A. to a fancy sporting goods store. I stepped up to the counter \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d The saleslady turned \u201cYes, may I help you?\u201d \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am\u2026 I need to buy one of your finest ping-pong balls.\u201d She stared, \u201cHoney\u2026 don\u2019t you mean you want to buy a box of our finest \u2026 uh\u2026 ping-pong balls?\u201d I shook my head \u201cNo, Ma\u2019am. I only need one\u2026 but it has to be the best.\u201d She was dumbfounded. \u201cI never really rated brands before\u2026\u201d she mused \u201cI could sell you a box of Brand Name Forgotten \u2026 they\u2019re the most expensive.\u201d I reiterated my need for just one. She looked helpless. Finally I bought a box of six, and re-donated five of them \u201cYou can give these to poor homeless kids who need them for crafts classes at the shelter, They make good frog eyes.\u201d I told her as I opened the box and dragged out one precious ball. They cost a whole dollar twenty! But hang the expense. I was On a Mission From God. Next we drove to Wilshire Blvd and the expensive jewelers\u2019 stores. \u201cYou need\u2026 what?\u201d the tuxedoed jeweler asked incredulously (mind you the shop we went to was a branch of a VERY famous east coast jewelers and they were frequented by the cream of Hollywood). This was Top Of The Line! \u201cYes, Sir, I need a jewel box that will fit a ping-pong ball.\u201d He was about to throw me and my long-suffering mother out of the shop, when my mother\u2019s boss walked in. He was a multi-millionaire contract attorney who worked in entertainment law. Boss Esquire looked at my Mama and said \u201cAh, Hello, Elsie!\u201d The jeweler began to ooze delightfully \u201cOh! Oh my! Well, we simply MUST find that box for you, my dear! A tennis ball, you say?\u201d It pays to have Employers in High Places. \u201cNo, Sir, a ping-pong ball,\u201d and then, thinking to make him feel better I lied \u201cIt\u2019s for a film.\u201d He felt better. At home I made my preparations. Then I waited through the week. Either skipping class, ducking out early, saying I\u2019d forgotten, as the Corr. P.E. Teacher got progressively angrier and angrier. Thursday, \u201cYou have a FINAL tomorrow! That ping-pong ball had better be on my DESK by end of class or you are NOT getting your grade!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have it.\u201d I promised. Friday. We had our final. Yes, P.E. classes have finals. I think we did Chicken Fat twice in a row or something. I don\u2019t remember. If you\u2019ve never heard Chicken Fat\u2026 go to You Tube and look it up. But be sure there are no firearms or sharp objects in your home before doing so. Oh, and hide the shoelaces and belts too. End of class. The teacher corners me with all the finesse of a bull elk cornering a Pekingese in heat. \u201cWHERE IS MY PING PONG BALL?!!\u201d \u201cI have it in my locker.\u201d I said. She frog-marched me to my locker, the back of my gym blouse clamped in her sweaty hand. I opened my locker. I got out the Van Cleef and Arpels labelled bag. Inside the bag was a gift wrapped small box in the signature style of V.C.&A. She stared. She ripped off the wrapping and found a velvet jewel-box. She opened it. There, gleaming softly, was the ping pong ball. \u201cWell\u2026 You came through..\u201d she said, speaking in regular Times Roman letters. Probably for the first time in her life. She signed my grade card.. I took it gratefully and headed for the door. FAST! I could see her reach into the box and I needed to put distance between myself and her. I didn\u2019t actually SEE her inspect the ping-pong ball\u2026 but I do know what was in the box. Nothing harmful. I\u2019m not *that* much of a bitch. You see\u2026 I had given her\u2026 A bag with Van Cleef & Arpels logo in silver. Gift wrapping and a silk ribbon (in the school colors) A tasteful velvet jewel case with a little cushion inside. And a very expensive (twenty CENTS) ping-pong ball\u2026 I heard the shrieks as I ran for the bus. Really\u2026 I don\u2019t know WHY she was so upset! I had REPLACED the school\u2019s property! I\u2019d even exactly duplicated the DENT in the underside! ",
