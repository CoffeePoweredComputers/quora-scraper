            "answer_text": "Bro, you don\u2019t need a degree to get ahead in life. You just need to accept your circumstances and work around it. I am too right into your shoes but with different aspect towards life. I am too 29 years old. I have spent 7 years of my life getting a degree but failed to clear 2 exams. After 4 years of graduation, I started working at a photostat shop as a typist because I failed to clear 4 exams. After 6 months at that shop, I joined a small scale company as a content writer as such low level companies don\u2019t ask for your degree. From there, I continued to try clearing those exams and simultaneously kept working on my skills. I switched from content writer to data entry operator to data entry lead to project analyst to Digital marketing professional in the same company with much lesser pay as per corporate standards. In the meanwhile, I failed to clear my exams and decided to let it go because the pressure of not having a degree is getting on my nerves and I was about to slip into depression. And after I decided to let it go, I fully drove my focus towards my skills and developed at much faster rate in my professional career. Today I don\u2019t have a degree. Neither do I have a big salary nor I am eligible to work in big companies. But today I have a decent job with decent salary (still lower than company standards) and I AM HAPPY. I only apply in all companies and if they are stubborn about the degree, I just let them go and start looking for another. Because remember there are hundreds of companies looking for skill only, degree don\u2019t matter to them. The bottom line is never lose hope. It is not necessary to follow what society expects you to. Believe in yourself and welcome everything that comes your way. Never hesitate to start small because it might take you to big later. AND if someone says there is so much competition out there, remember that competitive people only see competition but there is always an easy way available. ",
