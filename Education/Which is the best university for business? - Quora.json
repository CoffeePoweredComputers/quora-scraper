            "answer_text": "What is a \"Top Tier\" business school? I would define it as a school with sufficient academic fame and specialization that a person would attend it regardless of location.  In other words, people would consider it normal for someone to travel across the country to attend it based on its academic qualifications.* In other words, these should be schools that would be a person's legitimate first choice, ignoring geographic restrictions. What are the schools you'd travel across the country for?  Depending on your area of interest, you can make a great argument to go to any one of these schools no matter where you live: Harvard: \"I want to be a CEO\"Stanford: \"I want to be an entrepreneur or be in the tech industry\"Wharton (UPenn): \"I want to be a CFO\"INSEAD: \"My interests lie internationally\"Kellogg (Northwestern): \"I want to do Marketing\"**Booth (University of Chicago): I want to be a Professor\"***I think someone could get in to all six of these schools and have a reasonable academic argument about why they chose to go to any one over all the rest. Below that are a number of extremely good schools that are nevertheless regional. I would not call these Top Tier, but I think one could reasonably call them \"Top Tier Regional Schools.\" Sloan (MIT): Tech & entrepreneurship (probably go to Stanford if you don't care about location)Dartmouth: A great place to learn about business & drink in the woodsColumbia: New York City!Ross (U Michigan): Midwest!UC Berkeley/UCLA: California that's not StanfordYale: Non-profits? Man, they need to work on their positioningFuqua (Duke): The South!Beyond that, there are a lot more schools out there. As a test of the above ranking, we can take a look at Business Week's annual business school ranking: http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/rankings/ I treat the list as \"noisy,\" since they need to shuffle the schools every year to continue selling magazines.  Nevertheless, their list matches up pretty well with the one above (although they make \"top tier\" a much larger category). *For instance, someone who grew up in Georgia would probably not attend the University of New Mexico *for academic reasons* since the University of Georgia is much closer to home.  They might choose UNM *because* it's far from home, but they're not attending for the poly-sci degree.** Maybe. I don't personally know of anyone who specifically applied to Kellogg for their marketing excellence.  However, I think someone could definitely justify heading to Chicago from Southern California because they wanted a better focus on marketing.*** Maybe. This is more a plug for the U Chicago Business PhD program than their MBA program. ",

            "answer_text": "Note that this list is a bit US/Europe-centric and I'm talking about the MBA programs. I also do not have an MBA and most of this is just based on things I've heard from others and read: Stanford GSB and Harvard Business School are probably at the top of the heap. Followed by some combination of Wharton, INSEAD, London Business School, Kellogg (Northwestern), Booth (University of Chicago), MIT Sloan and Columbia Business School. Just beneath those schools I would put Tuck (Dartmouth), Stern (NYU) and Haas (Berkeley). Then after those schools some order of Yale SOM, Fuqua (Duke), Johnson (Cornell), Ross (University of Michigan), Anderson (UCLA) and Darden (University of Virginia). All the above schools have pretty strong brand names with some having more geographic reach than others. Harvard will be known pretty much anywhere but employers outside the US might be less familiar with Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business for example. Other than these schools there are many schools that don't have as strong a brand but receive strong recruitment from local firms and are well regarded regionally (e.g. McCombs at UT-Austin for Texas, Kenan-Flagler at UNC-Chapel Hill for Carolina/the South, USC Marshall for Southern California). While Oxford and Cambridge do have business schools, I am hesitant to classify them as being \"top-tier.\" Cambridge's Judge Business School and Oxford's Said Business school are both relatively young (founded in the 1990s). The value of business school is mainly in access to the school's connections, alumni network and being able to work and study with a diverse and intelligent student body. Oxford and Cambridge still need time to develop their networks and build their reputation. In the UK and Europe they are still definitely overshadowed by London Business School and INSEAD. The best way to judge any of these schools is to look through their employment statistics, research which firms recruit on campus, do Linkedin searches to see how many alumni are in a particular industry you want to get into and see if there is anything unique about the programs that would be helpful to your career aspirations (e.g. Cornell's Immersion Learning method, Michigan's Multi-Disciplinary Action Project, INSEAD's opportunity to study at campuses in Europe, Asia and the Middle East). Rankings are really the last thing I would consult. ",
