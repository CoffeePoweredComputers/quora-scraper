            "answer_text": "FINDING A SPONSOR TO STUDY ABROAD  Making up your mind to study in the United States is the easy part\u2014now you must find a way to fund it! While many students ultimately depend on their own and their families\u2019 resources to fund their studies in the United States, others depend on other sources. This article outlines some of those sources. FUNDING FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT The U.S. government provides funding for students from certain countries to study in the United States. This funding is often times limited and can be hard to find. To discover whether or not the U.S. funds education for students from your country, visit the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Agency for International Development. If you secure funding, know that you will likely need to attend college within certain parameters. While securing this type of funding can be difficult, it can also be highly rewarding as it sometimes pays up to 100 percent of students\u2019 tuition. FUNDING FROM YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT Students may also find that their own country is willing to foot the bill for its citizens to study abroad in the United States. Check with your country\u2019s department of education or ministry of education to determine whether or not they have funding available for study in the U.S. Also, check to see if your government has partnership with any U.S. colleges or universities. Some governments partner with schools in the U.S. to offer reduced or free education to its citizens. FUNDING FROM PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS There are private organizations throughout the world that are interested in building relationships between certain countries and the United States. Their interests may be tied to anything from economic aims to social connections, goals, and obligations. Their funding, therefore, may be meant to facilitate their main goals and missions. Therefore, if you search for private organizations that want to pay for students to study in the United States, make sure that their missions and values align with yours. If you are rewarded money to study in the U.S. from a private organization, you will likely be intimately tied to them for the duration of your studies. FUNDING FROM NON-PROFITS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS Non-profits and non-governmental organizations often times offer funds to international students who want to study in the United States. To find such organizations, look for service-oriented non-profits or non-governmental organizations that have an interest in increasing global travel and cultural interaction. International service organizations and NGOs may pay up to 100% of students\u2019 tuition and often times set up housing, internships, and other opportunities associated with studying in the United States. Just as you would when requesting funding from a private organization, strive to ensure that your non-profit or NGO organization\u2019s values and mission are consistent with your own. LOANS, GRANTS, AND SCHOLARSHIPS The most common grants in the United States, such as Pell Grants, are not available to international students. Loans, however, are sometimes available to international students if those students have a citizen of the United States as a co-signer. Scholarships may also be available to international students, even without U.S. citizen sponsorship. To find a list of scholarships available to international students, talk to the financial aid departments at the colleges and universities you would like to attend. They will be able to direct you to scholarship sites devoted to helping international students or students from certain countries find funding ",

            "answer_text": "When you say sponsor, are you looking for a business, university or government that will sponsor you? Be Clear on what you want In order to get the right sponsor, know exactly what you want to study and in which country and ideally which university, however, I must admit, that is very specific and no means a small task. There is a lot to consider when looking to study abroad. Businesses Ask them in your relevant sector and show them how you will help them push you forward. By doing this you are being proactive and giving something back to them. Businesses are only likely to sponsor for something in return for their cash, an example would be market research, product development, researching a new market or testing within students. Universities There are many options here and it depends on which country you want to go and study in. In the UK, you can apply to be a sponsor of the university, you just need to email, however they do not give this out lightly plus they will only have it for subjects which they want or are focusing on for that year! Governments I must admit, I don\u2019t know much about this, however, sometimes, your local government might offer to pay the tuition and living for you to study in another country and have a job for you when you return.

            "answer_text": "Are you looking for a sponsor for your visa or for your university application and proof of funds? If you can be a bit more specific, I could be more helpful. If it's for your visa, different countries have different requirements. In the US for example, you have to get an admission to your university before you can go to the embassy for your visa application. The US Embassy will ask you for proof of funds. They want to know how you will pay for tuition and other related expenses. Proof of funds. They will want some bank statements for your sponsor to make sure that you will afford to live in the States without being a burden to the government. When applying for admission, universities will ask for your financial situation of your parents to get an idea of how you will afford them. In this case, a sponsor is whoever shows that they will pay for your education costs. They can be anywhere: in your home country or elsewhere. Hope this helps. Didier Champion ",

            "answer_text": "As of October 2014, all Universities in Germany will not charge any tuition fees for undergraduate studies. In some Federal States, Universities will charge a semester contribution (about 50 euros) and/or administration fees (about 50 euros). This tuition fee structure can change in the future, you should check every year! Unlike undergraduate studies, most Master\u2019s or PhD studies in Germany are fee-based. The costs for postgraduate studies are in addition to the enrollment and confirmation fees. Fortunately, there are a good number of scholarships for Masters and PhD study in Germany. Indeed Germany has become a popular destination for foreign students looking for an international education. German Universities offers internationally recognized programs at a relatively cheaper cost compared to UK, USA or Australia.

            "answer_text": "A2A If you do have good scores from your previous degree, then you may find it fairly easy to get a scholarship to study abroad. If you're interested in research, then universities provide research grants that usually cover the tuition fees (this is only available for Master's and PhD). There are also funding organizations in your country or the country that you want to study in, that would support students in their higher studies. All of this is possible if a student is promising enough, because no one wants to invest money on someone who seems isn\u2019t very good academically. Additionally, some countries provide cheap to almost free education, these include Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Austria, etc. If you want to study in another country, then checking with the specific university would be the best option as universities in US, UK and Canada provide part-time jobs to students as well. Hope this helps. All the best! ",
