            "answer_text": "Education sites usually have a clear focus. Is it about encompassing knowledge like an encyclopedia? Is it about teaching? Is it an archive or library? The library of Alexandria is very different as an inspirational concept than a website for educational preschool games. The purpose matters a lot. But, here are some ideas sorted out by type and purpose. Bear in mind domains are sold all the time and I haven\u2019t checked their availability. Young kids learning is often about fun easy to comprehend things. Teach Your Monster to Read is a perfect example of this. Older kids their needs and word recognition get more complicated as well as hit and miss. So it\u2019s harder to name things for them unless it very specialized or so broad they aren\u2019t the main focus. But, here are some things you might try in that situation. https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/ Factcastles Explosivehistory Mapthepast Bouncylearninghumans Bethesponge Now you would need a very different approach for something more serious. If you were looking a compilation of knowledge at the academic level the inspiration is different. You would look at history, mythology and could potentially use more obscure references of course. For instance, grand cities of learning is always a favorite. Athens, for instance, is incredibly well known in more educated circles. Some ideas I had are just below. Newathens Essentialogos Essentia means essential and logos means the study of. Dustytomes Novawisdom Nova means new. There\u2019s no way to sort out a perfect recommendation or idea without a great deal more information. This is because any website or brand name is tied firmly to the purpose and image of a company or site. But, some conceptual ideas that would make good names are always fun to play with. The idea of a living library that had a consciousness would be fascinating. A robotic ai study buddy for people could also be interesting for memorization and keeping on task. A giant smart map of the world would be interesting as well. All the truly great names have a concept that they turn into a catchy name easy to remember. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, eLearning is on it\u2019s top gear because of the rapid penetration of the internet globally. Even the 5G is knocking the doors, so soon we may witness a huge surge in more other services online that may happen in the upcoming future. You may also have services from a professional domain consultant, they may help you to find the best domain name for your startup. Well, for an education website I would prefer to use .com, .net or .org domain extensions: My suggestions would be here: (These all domains are available to register now) http://eeduin.com http://openuni.net http://eduhour.org Please share and upvote my answer if you feel it\u2019s helpful. Let it be helpful for others as well. Thanks, ",
