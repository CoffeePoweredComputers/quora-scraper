            "answer_text": "No, a librarian can not be considered a teacher. Librarians manage the information, they store and retrieve the information, which may be in hard copy or soft copy in the library. Librarian's job is to give the library users the information they are seeking. They need to have basic knowledge about the library holdings, they need not understand the subjects. Whereas, teachers are supposed to know their subjects well. Their job is to teach and make the students understand their subjects. Teachers need not know where the information is available. A librarian gets the information to you, a teacher explains and makes you understand it. ",
