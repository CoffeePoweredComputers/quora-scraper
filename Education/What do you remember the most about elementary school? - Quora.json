            "answer_text": "In kindergarten, I remember that this one girl had long hair. Her hair was always braided. She said she did it herself. I- and others- were in awe. We couldn\u2019t braid our own hair that well. I remember one day while standing in line, I saw I was wearing pajamas underneath my regular clothes. I had somehow forgot to take off my pajamas when putting on clothes that morning. This was also the year I cracked my chin open. See: Stella Chen's answer to What\u2019s the dumbest injury you have suffered?  In first grade, I grew homesick from being at school for too long. I brought in a picture of my family, like another girl did, because I missed my family. I cried in front of the class nonetheless. First grade was also the year I developed emetephobia (See: Stella Chen's answer to What is your weirdest fear?). A girl threw up in the cafeteria. There was a lot of it. It made me pale just looking at it, so I hid my head in my arms and a teacher asked if I was alright. Two other kids in my class threw up that year, both making me extremely uncomfortable. Good times. Not.  In second grade, I remember seeing a boy had a huge book on his desk. Wow, what an advanced book, I thought. The book? It was Prisoner of Azkaban. I also remember liking this one boy (not the Harry Potter reader). He was cute. We were sitting on the floor of the computer lab flicking tiny rolled up pieces of paper with some other kids. I decided to try and impress him by flicking it really far, which I did. On Valentine\u2019s Day, we were supposed to give cards to the entire class. He was the only boy I wrote \u201cLove, Stella\u201d for on the card. Every other boy got \u201cFrom, Stella.\u201d I was quite the little flirt.  In third grade I moved. I was devastated since I was moving away from my best friend who lived around the corner from me. I made such a big deal out of it. I moved twenty minutes away to the next town over. I remember getting 100 on my math test, the \u201cWOW\u201d sticky note smiling up at me. I remember my teacher whispered to me \u201cGood job. You were the only one to get 100 in the whole class.\u201d I remember grinning uncontrollably. My mom tried to get me to read Harry Potter that year, believing I should read harder books. We only had the fifth, sixth, and seventh books at my house so I started with the fifth. I hated it. I did not like it. I stopped a few chapters in.  In fourth grade, I was a dick. An asshole. I hate fourth grade me. I wanted to be \u201cpopular\u201d like the \u201ccool kids\u201d so I befriended the most popular girl at the time. My friend liked this boy at the time. The popular girl teased my friend about it, and I joined in. I liked the same boy my friend liked. It got to the point where the popular girl and I got called down to the counselor\u2019s office to have a \u201ctalk.\u201d It wasn't the popular girl\u2019s first time there, I could tell, she acted like being there wasn't a big deal. It was a big deal for me though. I had never gotten into trouble; I was a goody two shoes. I didn't even know the counselor existed! The whole time we were there, I sat low in my seat, my eyes barely looking over the top of the table. I was so ashamed. Things got better afterward. I decided to give Harry Potter another go, from the first book this time, and I loved it. I had to write Literary Essays, and my fourth grade teacher complimented my writing, leaving me beaming. At the end of the year, she gave everyone summer reading recommendations, consisting of three books. My friends and I asked for more. We spent our free time with the teacher as she gave us books recommendations. I think I ended up with 15 or more. I finished them all. Obviously.  Going into fifth grade, I felt like a grown up. I was older than all of the other grades. I could boss people around (rule amongst the kids; older kids have more authority) and go on cool field trips. In particular, I was looking forward to a field trip that would last for three days, with hiking, canoeing, and the like. All of the other fifth graders before us went and said it was awesome. It was cancelled. Just my luck. Instead we went on a one day trip where we did similar activities. The whole grade was peeved because we had to settle for less. We were all looking forward to getting away from home. My fifth grade teacher that year was one of my favorite teachers in elementary school (the others being my fourth grade teacher and my orchestra teacher). She was young (well mid 30s [is that old] but she looked way younger), pretty, funny, and nice. My friends and I were on good terms with her. She told our class that we should avoid saying and writing \u201cand all that stuff.\u201d So whenever she said \u201cstuff\u201d I'd be like \u201cyou said stuff.\u201d Soon, my other friend joined in in calling her out whenever she said \u201cstuff.\u201d She didn't mind it. Fifth grade was also the year I got my first concussion at school after my friend accidentally knocked me down in gym. I felt so nauseous, and one girl said I was very pale. I went to the nurse who told me to eat lunch because I would feel better. Eating made me feel worse. I went back and she sent me to the classroom to get my stuff. It was indoor recess, so all the kids were playing in the classroom. The noise made my head hurt even more so I hastily grabbed all my stuff, leaving a lot behind. My friends asked my if I was alright, and to get out of there quickly, I just nodded. I was too weak to carry my backpack so I dragged it behind me. My teacher saw me in the hallway and asked if I was alright and if I needed help. Without speaking I confirmed that I was alright and I could do it myself. I curled up on a cot in the nurse\u2019s office, desperate for my mom to come take me away. She took me to the doctor\u2019s and I almost threw up multiple times there. I held it back though. I threw up four times later that day. How pleasant. A few days later, I got better and went to school. My teacher asked what happened and upon hearing that I had a concussion she said \u201cWhat? If I knew, I would've called to check in on you!\u201d I thought that was really sweet. At the end of the year, she left a nice note in my yearbook and signed it. I wrote \u201cThank you and have a great summer!\u201d or something like that. Real original, Stella.  In elementary school, I started violin. I proved to have some sort of talent for it and I was better and more advanced than my peers. In my lesson group at school, there were three kids. One day, the two other kids were absent, so I was to only one at the lesson. My orchestra teacher delighted in working on more difficult music with me instead of the easier ones we were working on in the group. My elementary orchestra teacher was- and still is- great.  So, this answer may have been longer than I anticipated. TL;DR I can't really summarize all the individual memories very well so, let's just say I remember a lot. ",

            "answer_text": " Do you see the item the other kids are sitting and standing on in this picture? That\u2019s what I remember about Senior Kindergarten,that and the little red,blue and green house that\u2019s off to the right of this picture. I also remember the metal domned jungle gyms, actual metal slides,Tire Swings,full metal Monkey Bars All things kids today have no idea ever existed because we\u2019ve Bubble Wrapped our kids. I remember slippery pavement and certain Yard Supervisors actually encouraging us kids to do the dangerous act of running then sliding down a patch of ice and cheering when a kid made it to the end of the patch of slippery ice without falling and getting hurt. I remember hearing SNOWBALL FIGHT! I remember Carnaval de Qu\u00e9bec going on during school hours with Bonhomme Carnaval leading parades around the school yard and never being able to participate since I always had to sit it out because I couldn\u2019t be exposed to the cold for more than twenty minutes and everyone was outside for hours on end and me? If I participated even bundled up nice and warm, I\u2019d be in bed sick the next freaking day with a cold. I remember making stir fry in co-op cooking class WITH NO ADULT SUPERVISION! YAY for Grade 8 Co-Op Cooking Class! I also remember that whenever it rained for days on end, my school yard flooded something awful we called it Lake St.Ben\u2019s because my school and church shared the same name St.Benedict\u2019s Roman Catholic Elementary and Church I remember having to write the Bubble Gum Chewer\u2019s Pledge when I was sucking on a throat lozenge for a sore throat I remember being insulted when being told that I had to write the Letter of Condolence because my grandmother got one when my uncle RobertCharles was killed in Action and taking it home as \u2018homework\u2019 and having my mom\u2019s brother become furious when he seen what I was writing which began \u201cDear_______,it is with great sorrow that we inform you of the untimely death of your son ______\u2019 I had to write that ten times and after learning what it was really FOR, I started refusing to write it.   Yeah those above are Letters of Condolences the EXACT THING we had to write out when some idiot threw something\u2026..eesh no wonder my uncles and mother became offended. I remember the spitters pledge I remember Pancake Day\u2014-a thing of the past because of fear of someone having a wheat and dairy allergy or being gluten intolerant Hot Dog Day can\u2019t have those anymore because someone\u2019s religion might forbid them from having hotdogs and they might become offended Hamburger day\u2014see Hot Dog Day Taco Day\u2014-again some religions might become offended over the fillings Pizza Day\u2014-no meat pizza\u2019s are an option for those who can\u2019t eat meat but then again someone might become offended because it\u2019s not made in accordance with their Religious Practices The lack of maturity sixth grade boys have when it came to learning about Menstruation and the lack of maturity sixth grade girls had when learning about Sperm (yet just four years later same girls were pregnant with their first baby and baffled as to WHY it happened the FIRST TIME THEY HAD SEX) Intramural House League Games:Kings CourtQueens CourtPin BallDodge Ball All gone the way of the Dinosaurs because they\u2019re considered \u2018Far Too Dangerous\u2019 Everything I remember from Elementary School has been taken away because Society is raising snowflakes instead of human beings.
