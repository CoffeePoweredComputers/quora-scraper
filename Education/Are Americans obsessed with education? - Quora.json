            "answer_text": "Yes. We somehow believe that education is the single most important factor in life success. That\u2019s wrong. There ARE studies which show ON AVERAGE that college grads earn more than non-grads. However, college grads generally come from more well-to-do socio-economic backgrounds\u2026and there\u2019s more correlation between background and income than college graduation and income. What we forget is that ALL education can do is lay a foundation of (a) general skills for studying and exploring and/or (b) a foundation of knowledge in a field. Success requires that students know how to apply those foundations in order to succeed. Far too many students graduate from college believing they have all they need. Fortunately, I had a boss my first job out of college who observed one \u201cwe didn\u2019t hire you because you know anything\u2026we hired you because you\u2019re trainable. So go learn stuff.\u201d It was the best advice and kicked off a superb career. What about credentials? We are a credentials obsessed society \u2014 sadly. However, the pendulum is swinging. Companies as large as Google are realizing that job descriptions mandating credentials don\u2019t often get the right person for the job. So they are beginning to reduce the need for credentials and look for other ways to evaluate potential employees. The scoop seems to be: We need a strong education system to establish a foundation on which the nation succeeds economically.BUT, that is only a start. We need a culture which acknowledges the weakness of education and the need for a wide range of individuals who are exceptionally motivated, explorers, great with detail, etc\u2026School does not today prepare you for the future because it has become more and more focused on preparing you for tomorrow.To have students prepared for the future, their ability to explore new things is far more important than anything else.Only when we make this adjustment will we be prepared for the future.

Knowing things, many things, can improve your quality of life, the opposite of this is ignorance, NOT knowing things can be very dangerous, very detrimental to a happy, healthy life. Americans are obsessed with happy and healthy, not all of them but lots of them. ",

Americans have been convinced that the only way to success is secondary education and college degrees. The result is trillions in debt, millions with degrees that are valueless and constant pressure to spend more. You tell me if that is an obsession or an actual requirement. To me the answer is crystal clear. ",
