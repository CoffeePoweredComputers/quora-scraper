            "answer_text": "Seeing the government\u2019s move & plan, it seems that they are ready to open the schools and colleges in India by the month of July itself. Just don\u2019t talk about August now. It is quite astonishing to me & beyond my understanding what they actually want. They are not still clear what and how to do next. India observed first lockdown when it reported 500 odd cases of COVID-19. I agree with this decision because it was the need of the hour to contain this deadly virus at that time so this could not spread at the earlier expected pace. We were performing successfully till lockdown 3.0 but the situation became worst after this phase. The situations slipped through our hands just like sand. India started reporting around 8000+ cases everyday. We are rapidly heading towards occupying at least 2nd spot in the table of severely hit countries with 257K positive cases in India at the time of writing this answer. The government, very smartly, named this ongoing phase as UNLOCK 1.0. People have also started believing that everything is all right now. We are not able to take any risk at this point of time because danger is yet there wandering over our heads. Running trains, opening temples, malls, restaurants, schools & colleges will definitely pose a threat to the lives of everyone. We all know that not everyone will be following the specified rules and guidelines diligently. This can create chaos. Schools and colleges have thousands of students studying together & it\u2019s impossible for everyone to maintain physical distancing there. On the other hand, some universities of the country are acting like morons & are even ready to put the lives of their students at severe risks. Conducting examinations for them is more important than saving a life. I can\u2019t understand their stupid rationale behind it. As per HRD Minister, schools and colleges can be opened in July, 2020 but they should reconsider again about this decision. Ain\u2019t they going to commit the biggest mistake? ",

            "answer_text": "What is worrying me is the fact that the whole discussion has moved to the application of digital technology. It is not just about devices, gadgets and smartphones, even watching TV amounts to screen time. In India, nobody is actually addressing about transforming schools into secure places where learning can recommence. Education is not only about some pieces of information or content delivered to students via screens. It is way beyond that and most of it happens by the means of social interactions in a school, with peers and teachers. The day online classes have begun, all that has been skipped out and I think that would have a critical developmental and cognitive impact on the child and their development. It is high time that some authorities have started to talk about how the school can be transformed into a safe zone for children to come back to, rather than entirely switching to online learning. Schools may be resuming offline in many countries, but in India, the situations are a lot more different. The schools that have opened in these countries are following SOPs with utmost precautions. For example, they are using tissue boxes for each classroom. Students can dispose of their used tissue papers in these boxes. But the problem is that the waste discarded is so huge, it will also require to be treated safely. Do Indian schools have that kind of infrastructure and resources? Also, it is challenging to make children sit in the classroom wearing masks, without touching it and disciplining them not to touch other children and their masks. If these questions are wisely dealt with by the state and central government, hopefully, the schools can resume soon. ",
