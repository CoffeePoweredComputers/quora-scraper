            "answer_text": "Wait, I took HL\u2026 was there even a difference? JK. During my year we had only two student in a class of about 25 that went with SL. Aside from a paper 3 and a bit more reading into something that is super interesting and likely useful to your life or others \u2014 HL Psych is the one very subject I\u2019d go for to get an easier HL completed. If you\u2019re thinking of doing SL anyways, then just take HL. You seriously almost won\u2019t feel a difference compared to SL. It\u2019s such a small part of it, and you\u2019ll be using CLOA, BLOA and SCLOA (the SL material) in it all anyways. The two SL Students of my class were just a part of our regular class and were gone for about a month or two when the HL material was being covered. Nobody noticed \u2014 It is hilarious that SL and HL is even divided. The difference between the SL and HL material will also be pretty obvious, you won\u2019t be at risk of mixing up the material between the exams (paper 1, 2 & 3). TAKE HL IF YOU\u2019RE GOING TO TAKE SL ANYWAYS. ",

            "answer_text": "Kind of, but not really. The only substantive difference is paper 3, which is a paper where you analyse research methods that are used in psychology, with a qualitative focus. It's not a hard paper, but there's lots of focus on structure and it really epitomises the IB's philosophy of pedanticism. Also, you get to pick another option, which isn't much of a difference. I'd say that it's not terribly difficult, and that paper 1 and 2 (the actual psychological content) is much more difficult than paper 3, and if you're good at essay writing and memorisation you won't have any issues with HL.
