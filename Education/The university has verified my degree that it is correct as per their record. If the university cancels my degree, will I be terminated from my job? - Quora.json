But question is why a University will void your degree, when it is valid as per their records? This can happen only when it is proved that any such degree is obtained by the means of forgery or by taking admission by purposeful suppression of facts that is revealed after you have taken the degree.

I am sure you have marks cards also to support which qualify your degree.I think you are seeing ghosts where they don\u2019t exist. Or do you think that there is a good reason for them to terminate your degree. If they do, there is more for you to lose than just your job. Consult a lawyer to see what action you can take if the university indeed terminates your degree. ",
