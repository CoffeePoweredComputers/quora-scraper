            "answer_text": "Yes, as long as your grades, GRE score, experience, or whatever else the school you wish to apply for looks at is good. A DVM usually requires a bachelors degree and then an additional 4 years in veterinary school. (Sometimes this can be accomplished in less time depending on the school and your abilities). Vet school is no easy job though. Veterinarians often lose respect because they're known as \u201ckitty doctors\u201d but they are real doctors that must excel in comparative medicine and the job is very serious. Not just all kitties and puppies. Vets are no less as sophisticated as human doctors although some clinics are much more lenient and this causes a misconception among the public that it's not too hard of a career to have. Veterinary school is very competitive as there are several states in the US that do not have a vet school. (I believe there are around 30 give or take in the US with thousands of applicants every year) vet schools only have a certain number of applicants that they accept each year. ",
