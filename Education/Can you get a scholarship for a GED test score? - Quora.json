            "answer_text": "I can tell you, I gave up on trying to find scholarships for ged graduates. Unless you're a dropout who went back to get her schooling, with an added bonus having kids and working, then you're not going to find any scholarships. At least that is for me. I'm a 16 year old ged graduate. I don't have any form of gpa average, in fact, I dropped out of my freshman year right before the semester ended, which caused all my grades that year to cancel. Which was a blessing because I was rocking D\u2019s and F\u2019s. I did \u201chomeschooling\u201d, lol I didn't do any work. I was just labeled as a home schooler. That was until I turned 16 in February, and started at Westside Tech as soon as possible to get my ged, I started night classes in April and ended up graduating June 3. After all that, I don't have a gpa average, I can't sign up for scholarships, and I'm still 16, so it's about impossible to find a job. But that's not stopping me. I'm starting college this august. I suggest you just find a job and save up because, at least from my experience, you won't be able to find any scholarships. ",
