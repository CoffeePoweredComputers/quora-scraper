            "answer_text": "Missing mom's food is a real thing. She's the sole person on this planet who knows the exact schedule of your stomach and that you don't like those carrots in your vegetables. It's going to be a long time before you understand what you like to eat and when to make it. No one will take those efforts for you.You're going to have to actually sit and make all that food you like. And those carrots are amazing after all, because there is no cooking process (and in desperate times, no cutlery either) involved.Waking up early to make lunch and sleeping late because you have to prepare dinner will make you wonder if you really need to eat to survive.Bills are real and they must be paid or you must retreat to the jungle.It is your friend's birthday party at 7 and the maid comes at 8.30 pm, then it is only right to leave the party by 8 pm and reach home before her. The maid trumps everyone.If you live in a society, you must know at least 55 neighbours in case your mother is under the impression that you have died in the half an hour you did not pick her call. You also need to be friendly with them for your security. Things you've never considered before like maintenance, repairs, security guards, water shortage will be of paramount importance.Anyone dropping in unannounced or after 10 pm is probably the devil in disguise and must be treated with caution.A small diary for expenses and chores. The clothes will not wash themselves and refrigerator will not be magically stocked.Never switch off your phone.Keep extra money on you.Don't let people know you have extra money on you.You don't need the candy. You need the harpic. Be wise.Keep your house well stocked with medicines. Don't delay a visit to the doctor. Do not go to a doctor's clinic alone.Some days you're going to hit the bed at 9 pm, with tiredness running deep within your bones. You might have a messy bed and a messy room. You might not have eaten well, having worked all day. It is normal. Some days, the floor will sparkle, the bed will be made, the water bottles will be stocked, you'll be well fed, the dishes will be clean and the clothes will be folded neatly. And you'll only have done chores and worked or studied the whole day and met no one. And that is an achievement too.There'll be days when the unused sofas will loom before your eyes, there will be no one chattering in the kitchen and smiling at you kindly. The only noise will be the sound of your shuffling feet, the things that take up space will be just yours. You'll turn around at the door to declare that you'll be late at night only to realise that no one is listening because the house is empty. Talk to your parents. Tell them about your day. You will cherish your mother's fussiness and your dad's voice.You'll come home and you might hate the world. People are cruel. Who cares about the clothes? The floors can go clean themselves for all you care. You're not hungry. You just want to crawl into the bed and cry. You want to be held and you want to cry. You will hold a pillow, whisper, \u201cDaddy I miss you, I want to come back\u201d and weep. You'll want to petted and told that it'll be fine. That's normal too. It'll pass. The sun shines on and moon floods the sky. Every day will help you get used to the feeling of becoming an adult.",

            "answer_text": "It has just been a little while since I moved out, moved countries infact. It wasn't easy from the moment I started gathering my stuff, from choosing what to take away to actually taking off for a new journey. It has been hell of a roller coaster, emotionally, physically and mentally. From the point I left my family, trying so hard to control my tears, literally asking them to get back in, to managing a house and being on my own has been a completely diverse experience. I definitely miss my family. All those times where I could just run to my mother and lie in her lap forgetting anything and everything that has been bothering me at all. I miss fighting with her. Now it's all about me walking to the kitchen and making whatever is available and edible, just to fulfill the bare minimum requirements. It's no more \u201c Maa, I want this for breakfast.\u201d It's no more fighting about who will do the dishes while the other cooks. I miss those evenings where all of us would just sit in together, have chai biscuits and \u201ccharcha\u201d on diverse topics. Dad coming back from work had always been the best time of the day. I miss fighting with my brother over silly things. Now, it's a luxury to even talk for a few minutes. There was a time when we couldn't stand seeing each others' face. It's not just about moving out of our house, it's basically adultting I guess. You start being responsible for yourself and then you miss all the carefree days of your life! ",
