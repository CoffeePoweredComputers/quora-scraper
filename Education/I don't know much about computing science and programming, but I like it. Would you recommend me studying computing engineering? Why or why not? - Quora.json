            "answer_text": "I dont know if other Computer/Softwae engineers agree with me. But this is how I feel. I am a Computer Engineer and I do not recommend. I do not regret my decission to become a Computer Engineer because I love my job. I would recommend you Computer Engineering if you had passion more than interest. Computer Engineering is hard, you have to be more than an engineer when you are graduated. You have to push your limits of knowledge. The problem with this field is, one can do the same jobs as you without a degree.I mean not the best jobs in Microsoft, Google etc... But %70 of  all the jobs. If you become a doctor, and If anyone has more medical knowledge than you, they cannot do your job. If you are a lawer... the same. But If you are a computer engineer you have to compete with all those people who are encouraged to take programming lessons for latest technologies. And dont think you will be better than them because you are an engineer. in every 4 years the tech trends change so much, you will only be experienced in older technology. The other problem with the field is this: copying a software is free.If you are a construction engineer and you make a building, and there is a rival next to you, you can sell your building nearly the same price. Imagine that you cannot sell that building if it is not the best one for a specific task in the world. Welcome the world of software where you compete in an area where free open source people and software giants has already produced nearly everything. It is not enaugh if you know all languages, most of the times, you have to invent something to make money. ",
