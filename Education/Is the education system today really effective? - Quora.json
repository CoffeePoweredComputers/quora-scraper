            "answer_text": "Education in India has been very systematic from the very early age of our civilisation. Previously we used to have gurukuls which provided military, Vedic and spiritual knowledge to its students. The first ever University in the world history, Nalanda University, was in India. So we Indians used to enjoy a sophisticated education system in those days, but things started changing with the advancement of our history. The Mughals came and established Islamic institutions to preach Islam, then came the Britishers who felt a need to establish some English medium schools and colleges to train the future generation about the British culture. So far everything was moving in a logical manner. The real circus started after the independence, when the whole country was facing partition in almost every field. Education system was not alien to it. States claimed to have their own education board, central board ( cbse) was introduced by the government of India and the British inaugurated ICSE was continuing too. One country and over 20 education board , each following their own syllabus and examination pattern in the primary and high school levels. And the confusion happens in central supervised entrance examinations where the state board students feel inferior to the icse or cbse students, as they are textually and personality wise lagging them. Another field that makes out education system shitty is that it focuses on theoretical knowledge rather than practical one. In today's competitive world students with more practical exposure have a better future scope in any field. Third, the industrial exposure and implementation of digital education in our country is still below the standard level. The government school condition are lower than the railway toilets. Private schools are more into business nowadays. Fees for most of the elite institutions are beyond the reach of common man. These factors need to be resolved quickly otherwise the dream of 100% literacy and an educated India can't be realised. Hope you like it. Thanks for reading.. ",

            "answer_text": "The syllabus in universities is not just outdated by a year or two but by a decade at least. It\u2019s mostly bookish and lacks practical usage. I being taught in schools so much with the intention that it would be useful in higher studies but unfortunately, days keep passing by and it remains invaluable. I am still looking for ways to use Pythagoras theorem, properties of triangles, the roman empire and a lot more which I was taught. Honestly what was taught at school and what is being taught at college fails to help me and many others practically in life. The quality of education imparted at schools and universities is completely rot learning. Mugging up answers and puking it in exams is the education scenario in the present era. So I can definitely say one thing that it doesn't look effective for now. . . I have written an article on Indian Education. If you have time please read it and share it. https://link.medium.com/46UUp2iXS3 (https://link.medium.com/46UUp2iXS3) Thanks. ",
