            "answer_text": "The most horrible thing ever faced by a 12thy and the answer is a big no ,not at all.It is not really a difficult task to score 95% or above in 12th cbse or any other state board. Just an individual have to follow a fixed methodology . The boards have their fixed curriculum for all the subjects and regarding which they have their reference books that is CBSE and many of the state boards refers NCERTs (National Council Of Educational Research and Training) for the content.Most probably a good amount of the questions in the question paper directly comes from the exercises and intext questions. That is why, if a student just have a strong vision on NCERTs from the very starting of their academic session,and have a proper revision in the prepatory holidays, it is very easy to score well in the exams. The board exams also have a great tendency to repeat the questions from the past papers so attempting the last five year question banks of all the subjects increase your chances to perform well in the boards. Board exams are just from the very basics and aims to check the subjective or say theoretical knowledge of the student. At last,I can say that just don't make chaos during preparation and just do your own that's the key to success. Thousands people have thousands suggestions. Unfortunately I myself during my 12th cbse scored 64.8% by scoring a perfect aggregate of 95.2% in 10th (mentioning that's in HBSE not CBSE) .Thats all the chaos and entropies during the whole session. You can easily score 95% or above, just do your own. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not as difficult as you might be thinking right now.It\u2019s just the result of your hard work,consistency and the zeal to achieve the goal you set up in your mind.Let me give you some of the following suggestions: 1.If you study daily for the entire then scoring 95% is quite easy as by the end of the year you are thorough with everything. 2.Set up a goal in your mind(say 98% as a target) so that it is a driving force for you when you are not willing to study and it\u2019s a motivation for you for the entire year. 3.Smart revision is a key tool during final weeks before exam.Make sure that you go through the previous year questions and see the pattern. It will give you many important question that you need to be well prepared for. 4.Don\u2019t give up.Never say to yourself that you can\u2019t do it.Remember hard work always pays off.Take me for example i scored 78% in class 11 but that doesn\u2019t stop me to work hard and consequently i achieved it. Few more tips: i don\u2019t know if it might be valid to you or not but it worked for me: 1. When i used to feel like giving up i used to watch motivational videos(Sandeep Maheshwari).That gave me enough motivation to continue being consistent and working hard. 2.Never underestimate yourself. Hard work can take you to positions that you have never dreamed off. Best of luck.Remember you can do it :) ",
