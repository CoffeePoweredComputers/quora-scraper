            "answer_text": "Unlike an exam that covers material taught in class, there is no specific syllabus for standardized tests like the SAT. Read across genres and topics such as literature, science, biographies, histories, politics, and controversial subjects. Before you begin reading, ask yourself what you want to know and what you need to learn from this source. When you\u2019ve finished reading, check to see if you found the answers to your questions. Write a paragraph on the point of view of the author, development of characters and plot or the way in which the author presented the material. Write a opinion paragraph on your experience of the work and an evaluation of both the author and the book/article/pamphlet. The reason for examining the writing is that the SAT non-math sections are Evidence Based Reading and Writing. Critically evaluating what you\u2019ve read is preparation for deciphering the evidence on which you will be questioned on the exam. When you are ready to prep, get from College Board a copy of a recent test with questions and answers (not all are available); as of 2/2019 ask for the October 2018 test. The prep materials on line do not always keep up with changes in the test itself. Take free prep tests available from many commercial test prep companies. The most significant thing to do is read, read, read! ",
