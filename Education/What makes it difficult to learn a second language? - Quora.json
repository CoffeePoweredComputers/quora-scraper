            "answer_text": "In my experience a number of things will make learning a second language difficult. Some of these will seem obvious of course. MotivationYou don't have an immediate need or real urge to learn that language. This can be seen in most foreign language classes where the students are usually there to get credit for the subject, not to actually gain competence in the language. 2. Habit This is the cousin of motivation, because if you are very motivated but don't make any habit to learn, then of course you won't learn. Now that we have passed the obligatory but obvious points here are some more. 3. Your teacher is no good Sad but true, some language teachers have no idea of how to make an inviting and effective environment to foster language growth. It could be possible that your teacher, like most of their students, is just trying to survive the class 4. You are relying on class time to give you the language If you aren't doing any independent exploration and study of the language not only will you find it harder to retain what you are learning in class, but also what you are learning may not be enough 5. You haven't got a game plan The most important game plan you need to draw up in how and when to reach threshold. It is very easy to continue a good habit and continue to grow your language once you have reached threshold. What is threshold? Threshold means you are an independent speaker of the language and you can navigate what you haven't learned yet, with what you already know. Before you reach this stage, it won't \"be hard to learn\" but it will feel hard. This is because you will still be struggling with most of what you hear and almost everything you want to say. 6. You haven't got anybody to practice with This is a common issue, not only with new language learners but also with people who have successfully learnt a language but haven't got anybody to keep their skills up with. Learners who have reached a threshold stage may be able to keep up their language practice more easily but for those who are still beginners finding sympathetic study buddy who can both challenge, guide and be patient with your attempts can be a challenge. Luckily with the advent of Skype and strong SocMed you can now find people to practice with more easily. Also finding a language learners community if you live in a big city is another great way to find people to practice with. Remember, to practice conversation it's great if the other person is a native speaker but it's not always necessary. 7. Learning costs money If you invest wisely you can make progress much more quickly than if you were to try and take the free route. A good instructor who knows how to foster language growth can help give you wings. 8.  You are busy comparing yourself to others You will learn at a different time and rate to other people. Accept this and just compete against yourself, not others. Just because you learn a skill slower than somebody else, doesn't mean you won't ever be just as good or better than them 9. You want to be perfect Accept that you need to make bucket loads of mistakes to get where you are going with the language. Every mistake is a chance to learn, if you aren't ever making mistakes you aren't learning anything. 10. Decide how much of the language you want to learn Not everybody will have the same goal in mind. Set your efforts and goals according to your needs. A good tutor or teacher will also take into account what you want to achieve. I've met professionals who have spoken broken English their whole lives at work and for socialising. They are now old and have lived very full lives, they were never perfect but got everything they needed from the language. Realise what you need the language for and when you can do that, be happy. Don't let other people's standards be your end game if it doesn't matter.  Of course in many areas a high command of the language you are learning is needed; but from what I've seen of most foreign language learners, only being able to communicate would make everything worth it, which is really quite an easy and achievable goal.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no \u201cone size fits all\u201d to whether learning another language is easy or not. It completely depends on the language, your capacity to learn, how much time you spend learning, and a bunch of other details. My first language is English, so obviously to me it feels like I didn\u2019t put much effort into learning it. Easy peasy for me. My second language is Urdu. I can actually say that learning Urdu was somewhat hard, mostly because I wasn\u2019t taught it as a child. My parents were told that if they spoke both Urdu and English to me as a kid, I\u2019d just get confused and not pick up either. I really wished they taught me properly as a kid to be honest, and didn\u2019t listen to that advice, because I wouldn\u2019t have had to put so much effort into learning Urdu. Whilst I understood most if not all of the Urdu spoken to me growing up, speaking it myself was hard, as I had to get out sounds that aren\u2019t common to English, and not to mention the writing system and characters are completely different. In contrast to my third language, French, which I felt was relatively easy to learn. I have a strong Greek and Latin root base, and French, being a romance language really capitalized on that. Can the conjugations and sentence structure get tough at times? Sure, but because I had a good background going into learning French, including living most of my life in a Francophone country, I didn\u2019t find French particularly difficult.  I know that if I wanted to learn Spanish or Italian, a dedicated 4\u20135 months of studying could get me near fluent if not fluent. However, right now for example, I wanted a challenge in the language department, and decided to begin learning Japanese. My god, I think I\u2019m going to need well over a year of dedicated study and practice before I can consider myself even remotely near-fluent. Japanese is completely unlike any of the other languages I\u2019ve learned, so I don\u2019t have much of a frame of reference. I\u2019ve been learning for about a month now, and am getting used to hiragana, but kanji, as well as how sentences are structured, is kind of complex. Or rather, it\u2019s damn complex. Oh well, \u3044\u3044\u3093\u3060\u3088 (it\u2019s fine). I totally didn\u2019t write that in Japanese just to show that I\u2019m learning even if a little bit, nope, not at all.  Anyways, to reiterate, some languages will be easier for you to learn than others, however, one thing remains true. No matter what language you\u2019re learning, without time, effort, and actual language immersion, you\u2019re not going to learn any language easily or well. If you\u2019re going to bother learning a language, put in the work. Cheers! ",
