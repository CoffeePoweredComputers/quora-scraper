            "answer_text": "No. Picric acid is not really an acid, in the same sense as sulfuric. Chemically it is trinitrophenol, a waxy solid and a high explosive.  It does, however, react with some metals to form picrates, and these tend to be extremely sensitive and dangerous explosives. Picric acid was used as a shell filling up until World War 1. It didn\u2019t react with the iron shell cases but if it ever came into contact with lead, it reacted to form lead picrate, which could be detonated by the scratch of a fingernail. Consequently, enormous precautions had to be taken wherever it was used. The Halifax Explosion was caused by picric acid. Other fun facts: Picric acid is incredibly bitter to taste. In fact the source of its name is the Greek word pikros, meaning bitter. It also stains the skin an intense yellow, so it was an extremely unpleasant chemical to work with. In the early part of the 20th Century it was widely used in whistling fireworks. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, organic acids don't even come close in terms of acidity when compared to mineral acids. Mineral acids are just too strong. Such is the case here. Kindly also note, Picric acid is another name for trinitrophenol. It isn't an acid. It just shows acidic behavior. Even CO2 gas isn't an acid, but is shows acidic behavior. ",
