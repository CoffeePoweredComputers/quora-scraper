            "answer_text": "My advice is to not take the easy way out. The easy way out is to ask your teacher or classmates for help. These options should be your last resort. Instead, I urge you to go and research the subject/topic you don\u2019t understand. Research in this instance means reading your textbook or given notes, going to the library and find a book on the topic or even better you can take a survey of the internet for relevant information and explanations. Sometimes the explanations on the internet are way better than the teachers. Why this is important is that you need to get used to going in search of information instead of always relying on other humans (teachers and classmates) because they will not be with you 24 hours a day. Instead the internet and books will always be by your side to help you understand anything that you wish to learn. ",
