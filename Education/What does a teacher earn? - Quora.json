            "answer_text": "As the other answers attest, pay can be looked up, and varies by area and district. I have worked at a private school and made less than $25,000/yr. Many years later, after my most loved district closed a building and would not let us bump, I got a job at a charter school. I was in charge of teaching 7 classes, no planning period, and had to \u201csupervise\u201d another 5 classes online. That meant answering any questions or helping stuck students, generally online. Also do any grading the computer didn\u2019t handle, and there was quite a bit of it. I got paid about $27,000/yr. I worked almost every waking moment. I survived two years. I did a year at a very bad district, and they paid well because they could not get teachers. I made the most money I have ever made about $60,000 for the school year, but it wasn\u2019t worth the money. It was hard making myself go every day. It was chaos from start to finish\u2026yelling, screaming, fighting, swearing, breaking things, stealing things, and that was just to each other. Students would spit on, hit, kick, grab chest and crotch of teachers, etc. They would also break or steal anything they could get that was in the teacher\u2019s area. I never missed a day, and I wanted to miss every day. I was also working constantly as I did for the charter school because there was so much paperwork attached to each child as almost every child had a 504 or IEP. Even if they didn\u2019t, most had a behavioral plan that the school and parents wanted put into place\u2026that the student did not follow, hence all the documentation. I also got myself a therapist, so I wouldn\u2019t lose my mind, that said she would not be able to last a week. I finished my contract and that was it. I am now at a very nice, small district, but I am making the same amount of money I did in 2006-2007, my second year teaching. Even if I am there another 20 years I won\u2019t make as much as I did last year, at the very bad school. Peace of mind is nice, but it would also be nice if my education and experience allowed me to get paid more than at year two. I am teaching Adult Education now. I share my classroom with one other teacher and our room, when we can be there, is open 8A to 7P, so we share the morning and evening hours, and have an odd schedule. Currently, with everything online, I am meeting with my adult students at all hours of the day and night and on weekends too. It might be easy to think one could stick to designated hours, but some have returned to work, and I have a seasonal weekend job now (that will expand to a few more week days once summer starts), so we have to meet when we can. In order for students to progress in online classes, teachers have to watch them test via webcam\u2026one at a time. That is not a fast process, and there can be a queue waiting for our attention. There are also the GED students that are completely stuck waiting, as all they can do is study since there is no testing available now, but they ask for help via webcam too. As well as the county jail, those inmates are not having class right now, but I have to stay in contact with the lieutenant in charge. So, I do a lot for my small paycheck. It is what it is, but I do get irritated when I see comments from people that think teachers literally only work 7A-3P, and have evenings, weekends, holidays\u2026and summers off. Then they often quote really high salaries and say we are all slackers. Wow, just wow. I wonder if any of those people, that think teachers are getting paid to do nothing, have students at home and are trying to help them with their studies. I hope they are finding it\u2019s not as easy as they thought. I also saw teachers on the news, a while back, that were striking because they were only getting $45,000/yr. I would love that, I am not currently even getting $35,000/yr. I have no idea where poor teachers making over $100,000/yr live. I don\u2019t know if I would want to live there as it sounds like the cost of living is a bit high. All I can tell you is that after 15 years of teaching, I have never made a lot of money, except once. If I had known what that job was going to be like, I would have skipped it. I am also single, and have a zero balance on my credit card. I drive a very nice 20 year old car that I own, live in a tiny apartment, and I am paying my student loan. It is not easy, but I try very hard to live within my budget. That also means that I have never gone on vacation anywhere because I am trying to save for retirement. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual salary for a teacher is approximately $55,000 per year. This means that half of all teachers in the country make more than this amount, and half make less. The 10 percent of teachers who are paid the lowest make less than $36,930 per year, and then 10 percent who are highest paid make more than $85,690. This variance depends on a variety of factors, including region, type of school, years of experience, and education level. Read on to learn more about teacher salaries in the United States. Teacher Salary by Region The highest paying states for teachers are, in order from highest to lowest: New York, Alaska, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. In general, teachers command the highest salaries in the New England, mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and West Coast regions. The highest paying metropolitan areas for teachers are, from highest to lowest: Nassau County, NY; White Plains, NY; Poughkeepsie, NY; Anaheim, CA; and New Bedford, MA. The second tier of salaries by state includes much of the West and Midwest, followed by a third tier that covers the South and a lowest-paying tier that includes most of the mountain and plains regions. Becoming a Teacher Teachers are required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree and, if teaching in public school, must be certified and licensed in the state where they\u2019ll teach. The subject in which you earn your bachelor\u2019s depends on the state. Typically, elementary teachers major in education or child psychology, while middle and high school teachers major in the subject in which they\u2019ll teach and take additional teacher preparation courses. Upon completing their degree requirements, aspiring teachers must also spend time in the classroom under the instruction of an established teacher. A test and a certain number of student teaching hours are required to become certified. Job Outlook for Teachers Job opportunities for teachers are expected to increase by six percent over the next decade. This rate is slower than other occupations. However, 52,900 new jobs are expected to be created for high school teachers, driven by retirement of existing teachers and the decrease in student-teacher ratios. Growth for teaching jobs will also be largely regional, with many new opportunities expected in the South and West. In addition, teachers in subjects where there are a shortage of qualified teachers, including math, science (especially chemistry and physics), English as a second language, and special education, are expected to be in high demand. If you love helping others and are willing to work hard, teaching can be a very lucrative and rewarding field. While there is a wide range for the annual salary for a teacher in the United States, the highest paying jobsand prospects will be for those who work in an underserved subject or region. ",
