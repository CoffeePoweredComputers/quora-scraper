            "answer_text": "Human and nature dynamics (HANDY): Modeling inequality and use of resources in the collapse or sustainability of societies is my favorite interdisciplinary study. It uses a math model for the ecology of species survival to examine the future of the human race in the light of ancient history. Its principal author has a notably interdisciplinary resume. Dr. Safa Motesharrei is an Environmental Systems Scientist whose focus is on the integration of the Human System into the Earth System Models. He has two bachelor's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics, two master's degrees in Physics and Mathematics, and two PhD degrees in Applied Mathematics / Public Policy and Physics from UMD. Dr. Motesharrei's papers have been published in a wide range of prestigious journals, including Science, Nature Communications, Ecological Economics, National Science Review, Journal of Climate, Scientific Reports, and PLOS ONE, and several of his papers are among the most cited and most downloaded papers in their respective fields. Another inter disciplinary example is Causal Entropic Forces a paper by Alex Wissner-Gross. Recent advances in fields ranging from cosmology to computer science have hinted at a possible deep connection between intelligence and entropy maximization, but no formal physical relationship between them has yet been established. Here, we explicitly propose a first step toward such a relationship in the form of a causal generalization of entropic forces that we find can cause two defining behaviors of the human \u2018\u2018cognitive niche\u2019\u2019\u2014tool use and social cooperation\u2014to spontaneously emerge in simple physical systems. Our results suggest a potentially general thermodynamic model of adaptive behavior as a nonequilibrium process in open systems. As a generalization, interdisciplinary studies examine problems or situations involving more than one area of specialization. ",

            "answer_text": "Interdisciplinary studies are an approach to scholarship, teaching, and learning, that crosses disciplinary boundaries. For example, in American Studies, the focus would include history, literature, sociology, economics, political science, and such, in aspects that deal with the US. Other interdisciplinary fields include Gender Studies, Black/African-American Studies, and Hispanic/Latino Studies. The issue in academia is that an \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d approach is one of those things that everyone thinks is a great idea, but the typical organization of a university is very much aligned with the traditional disciplines.
