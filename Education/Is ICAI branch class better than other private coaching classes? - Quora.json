            "answer_text": "Understand one thing that the coaching differs from branch to branch. It may happen that the same faculty who teaches in private classes teaches at ICAI. But as much as I know they take more tests and mock exams. With this they charge a high amount of fees too. It depends upon You, if you need more of tests and can let go money then go for institute classes and if not then go for private institutes. What I advise is for CPT go to ICAI and then IPCC onwards go to private institutions. Best of luck! ",
