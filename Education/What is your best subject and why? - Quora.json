            "answer_text": "I loved Maths the most and used to solve as many questions as I can . I always tried to be ahead of class or coaching in questions . I tried to find new questions of all the chapters even when those questions where not relevant for exams . Until I found Accountancy subject in my 11th class . I simply loved Accountancy and did the same which i used to do with Maths . I was always studying Accountancy or Maths during my 11th and 12th class & I always scored good marks in both these subjects(touchwood). The reason why i loved these subjects may be because i found out the best teachers who brought out interest for these subjects in me or maybe because i was never able to learn thoery subjects and always had interest in practical subjects . I can't remember of any other subject than these which i found so interesting and spent most of time studying them . ",
