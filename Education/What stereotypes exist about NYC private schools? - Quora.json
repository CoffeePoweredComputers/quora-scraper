            "answer_text": "I'll give you a run down of what I've gotten as a student at an NYC private school. The hilltop schools (HM, Riverdale, Fieldston) are stereotyped as being really, really uptight and over-pressured, especially in the case of Horace Mann and Riverdale. Also for having bad football teams and sex scandals. The hilltop schools are the drama hounds of the Ivy Prep League. Fieldston is more hippies and white people with dreads but they're also a prep school so there's an odd stereotype dichotomy there.  Kids from Collegiate are just dicks. I would argue that this is a fact and not a stereotype but that's an argument for another day. Also a lot of people think Collegiate guys are attractive. Chapin and Marymount girls are stereotyped as \"rich bitches.\" I don't actually really know anything about Brearley, most of my interactions with other schools come from sporting events and I've never had one against them. Saint Ann's is where you wish you had gone instead of where you are because everyone just seems happy and there are no letter grades. Calhoun is just known for having no walls for some reason--what's up with that. Poly Prep kids are insane athletes, I know there's a guy who used to attend my school who switched to Poly and now the athletic department is crying themselves to sleep because he's a total star there. I know nothing about Trinity, they seem cool though.  You said NYC specifically but once you get out of the city and into Westchester you also have Hackley, Rye, and Masters. If I talk about Masters too long I'll end up getting sued for slander by their administration. Rye kids are nice. Hackley is ultra-preppy but not irritatingly so. Also there are the public schools that have the vibe of prep schools like Stuyvesant (\"Stuy\"), Bronx Science (\"BxSci\"), and Beacon (Uh...Beacon?) Oh, yeah, and the Catholic boys' schools like Fordham Prep and Regis.  Yep. That's the insider's view. There's probably more I could say but that's all that comes to mind. Let me know if you have any more questions!  ",
