            "answer_text": "\u201cBroken\u201d would imply at one point it was perfect and now it isn\u2019t, so no, it\u2019s not broken, it\u2019s in many ways what it\u2019s always been: A \u201cdoing the best we can\u201d solution for something we can (mostly) all agree is of vital importance to the future success of the nation and its people. And I think in many ways the system has improved with time, though there are some acute policy failures that could be plausibly fixed within the current system. What I will say though is that the current system is adrift in vision. This has been true for a long time, but it\u2019s also more universally acknowledged now I think than it was a decade ago. (A decade ago there were major pushes to improve schools through testable standards and data-based incentives. While that still exists, the fact that Common Core has faced such a backlash has really killed some of the momentum on that front. This is ironic for me because I actually think the new standards (Common Core and the ones that affect me NGSS) have some quite good features to them, but I think it\u2019s good if people stop thinking that all we need is the right set of standards and the school system will get \u201cfixed\u201d.) The current k12 system is essentially a pre-college factory, and this isn\u2019t something that wasn\u2019t purely a choice by the educational system as it was pushed by a worldview American society embraced when started seeing college as \u201cthe best education\u201d and then started making making it mandatory for jobs that really don\u2019t need it. That worldview makes it an affront for k12 to track students toward specific skill-based vocations because you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t deserve \u201cthe best\u201d. That means an educational system wherein students are being forced to learn abstract things they don\u2019t see meaning in, and then are made to feel the sting of failure if they struggle at it. And so they disengage. They stop trying. They get angry. They start acting out. Just as we should expect them to do, especially when the demon of puberty hits. Of course I\u2019d be remiss if I don\u2019t point out two other things about this: Good vocational training is often quite expensive. It\u2019s a lot cheaper to teach Algebra II or AP Whatever than it is to effectively operate, teach, and the equipment you need for an auto shop.So long as the big-money jobs require a college education, there\u2019s a kernel of truth in the idea that encouraging students toward vocational training is limiting their possibilities.We\u2019re starting to see a push toward what\u2019s being called \u201cCTE\u201d for Career and Technical Education. This is a push in the right direction, but CTE as is is designed to fit into our current k12 system. The reality is that we need the current k12 system - mainly secondary school education - to be rebuild along CTE lines. It will take a tremendous amount of will to make that happen. Much more than we have right now. The reaction against Common Core was so severe, and that was a very minor change that didn\u2019t even fundamentally shift teacher roles. We\u2019re not going to be ready for the scale of changes we need to make until the problems with the current system become tangible enough for people to easily understand, and that could take a very long time.

            "answer_text": "There really is no such thing as \u201cthe American school system.\u201d Every local community has its own school board and its own system. They determine their own curriculum. They hire teachers. They set rates of pay. Schools in New York have no actual connection to schools in Texas. Public schools in wealthy suburban communities are perfectly fine. Urban school districts generally have some excellent schools and some very dysfunctional schools. Rural schools may lack some of the opportunities that larger schools have. (However, in my opinion, school consolidation has made even rural schools large and impersonal, in a harmful way.) There is almost a perfect correlation between the income level of a school and the achievement of its students. One reason schools in the US seem troubled is how many of its communities and its kids are troubled. Poor kids do poorly in school. Rich kids do well in school. There are layers of reasons why this is so, and it\u2019s not necessarily because there\u2019s something wrong with poor kids (though some communities of poor kids are so violent that the kids are likely suffering from PTSD, which, even in grown men, makes learning difficult. When there\u2019s a mismatch between the culture of a community and the culture of the school, kids tend to identify with their own community (as they should!) and may be alienated from the values that schools represent. But it\u2019s complicated. Paying teachers a living wage (brought to you by unions) is not the problem with public school. Relatively low wages and low respect bring relatively less talented people into the teaching pool. The greater job opportunities for women over the past generation has eliminated some people who would have been teachers, back when other careers were shut to bright women. Nevertheless, against a tide of barely-informed public opinion and distrust, most schools are doing the best they can, and doing fairly well. (I teach community college, so i see the output of public schools. It\u2019s not a disaster!) ",
