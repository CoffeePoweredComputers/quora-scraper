            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question actually. I have to wonder if you have asked this of your teachers. My recommendation would be to ask your teachers, privately, not in class, why they have asked this of you. Many teachers are often struggling to get students to ask any questions at all. However, I can think of a few reasons why a teacher might suggest you ask fewer questions. Without knowing more about you and your classes and teachers, it's difficult to analyze the situation. But here are a few possible reasons. Your questions indicate extreme reluctantance to engage in academic risk. Some questions show curiosity about a subject or an interest in improving understanding. However, some other questions indicate a desire for perfection or a fear of failure. For example, asking: What is the answer to problem number 3? This is not seeking to improve understanding. This is asking for the answer. Before just giving up, you should consult some other resources. Did you read the textbook? Did you discuss the question with a classmate? Have you made a reasonable effort to answer the problem on your own? Sometimes the answer isn't obvious and you're supposed to spend some time working on it. Asking excessive questions is often an indication of fear of failure or fear of academic risk. If you demonstrate extreme reluctance at ever having a wrong answer, your teachers may be trying to get you to take some academic risk, and you would be wise to follow their advice. Being able to learn from your mistakes is an important skill to cultivate. But if you're so scared of making any mistakes that you take all steps to avoid them, then you don't have the opportunity to make those discoveries.You could be dominating the class. If you have excessive questions, you might prevent others from having opportunities to ask questions. Some students need a few moments to develop their question or get the courage to ask. If you're always asking multiple questions immediately, it may prevent others from asking. Additionally, if the lesson is longer, or tightly timed, too many questions might interfere with the schedule and prevent the teacher from completing the lesson on time. Once in a while, this is OK. But if it happens frequently, it can be a big problem. Maybe you should consider asking some of your questions privately.Your questions show a reluctance to work hard. Maybe your teachers want you to spend a little more time figuring things out. If you're looking for answers at the first sign of struggle, your teachers might want you to develop some resilience or learn to use other resources as well.I'm sure there are other possible reasons. But I would guess some combination of these things are involved. Take some time to talk with your teachers privately and see what they suggest. Maybe you could arrange for a conference with your teachers and parents. The thing to keep in mind here is that teaching is about more than just conveying knowledge and assessing student understanding. Teaching is about helping students grow as critical thinkers and problem solvers. Sometimes, good teaching does involve knowing when to give an answer and when to make a student work for it. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the jobs of a teacher is to make sure that nobody gets left out. It's not stated, but part of our job is to keep a limit on the ones who participate too much and to bring out and encourage those who participate less or not at all. It's great that you are a bright and enthusiastic student: every classroom needs students like you. But it's important for you to apply your intelligence to realize a couple of things. Just because the other students don't speak up as often or don't ask as many questions, that doesn't mean they are less interested in the subject than you. They may not be as quick to ask questions or respond, or they may \"feel\" the question but be struggling to find the right words. Or they really don't know, but in being called on will have to sharpen their mental processes to learn how to take information and formulate answers. Class time is the primary place where a person can practice and develop these skills. In cases like this, some things have a tendency to happen that it is a teacher's job to manage. One is that the shyer, quieter or more hesitant students need as much of a chance to participate and ask their own questions as possible, and they may actually be as smart as you, just not as apt to speak up. The teacher had to support these quieter students, because after a while they will begin to feel they have no voice in the classroom if there are always one or two \"stars\" asking questions. This will cause them to lose faith in themselves and lose interest in the subject at the same time.  It also creates a feedback loop where they are even less likely to actually do their work if they know they don't have to worry about being called on because you always are the one to speak up.  So you as an individual may feel good about your classroom experience, but your teacher is asking you to be more mindful about sharing that experience and letting other classmates participate in their own time and their own way. Because they also need to learn, and participation for everyone is a huge part of learning. Your teacher is very aware that you are intelligent, curious, and a good worker and participant. What she is now asking is for you to do one more thing to help her bring the rest of the class along. If you have a good enough relationship with her, perhaps you can ask to meet with her after class and show her this message if you like. Ask her if there is anything you can do to make her life easier with respect to making the classroom participation more balanced. I had a friend in college who asked so many questions that nobody else was participating, and the teacher good-naturedly put him on a \"diet\" of two questions per class period, and the general discussion improved in the class.   One more thing - unless there are many voices in a classroom all trying to help each other find their way, classroom discussion becomes an echo chamber of one. Whether you realize it or not, if you let other students take the floor more often, you will hear different ways of approaching the material and different sets of ideas than you could ever have thought of. You will learn more. You will get to know your classmates better by hearing their voiced thoughts. You may even hear other students asking the same questions you want to ask, if they just have a little time to think and respond, and you will have a more diverse and interesting classroom experience. Difficult as it may be, you might need to dial things down for the benefit of the class as whole. That doesn't mean you shouldn't keep learning as far, fast and well as you can, just that you need to yield the floor more often. You may also begin to take more responsibility for keeping your learning curve robust. Instead of asking them aloud, write down your questions and then outside of class review the class material to see if you can find the simpler answers on your own, or in the case of more difficult and advanced material, make all the use you can of your local library and reliable internet sources, developing your research habits into the bargain.
