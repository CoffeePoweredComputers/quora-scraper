In modern history - in the US - I think discussions of thinking and fostering thought - might be found in the writings of John Dewey - the late 19th/early 20th century psychologist/philosopher and he might have been influenced by the Kindergarten movement in Germany which wasn\u2019t just about adding a grade to school - but as a reform movement of sorts - the 1960s was the decade of revisionist scholarship - and how to think not what to think has certainly been under discussion since then- Metacognition - we should look up when that word was introduced to K-12 educators as a worthy approach to teaching and learning - it would inform the search for the origin(s) of \u2018how to think\u2019 - ",
