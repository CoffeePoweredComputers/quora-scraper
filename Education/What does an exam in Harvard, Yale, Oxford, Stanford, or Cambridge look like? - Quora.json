            "answer_text": "Oxford, PPE: You sat 8 Finals Papers (or 7 if you did a thesis, which a minority of people do).  Each of these is 3 hours long.  For all the papers that I sat, they took the form a set of say, 16 questions, of which you answered 3.  You were expected to spend roughly an hour on each question. You typically know before you enter the exam the set of questions you want to answer, (so there were maybe 6 topics in political theory that I could write a really competent answer on) and you choose which particular questions based on how well the question is worded compared to the question you really want to answer.  For example, there are only so many questions they can ask on political obligation, but they might come at it from an odd angle that you're not prepared for, despite you knowing a lot about political obligation. So, your answers are 3 essays, each of which argues for a point of view.  If you just critically survey the literature, you will do badly. Annoyingly, past papers seem to be behind a sign-on system so I can't link any past papers. ",

            "answer_text": "I read Theoretical Physics at Oxford, and I had different types of examination: 5 written examinations, one of them being 2 hours, the rest 3 hours long. You have to wear your university uniform (\u2018sub-fusc\u2019) and gown. The exam papers included 4 questions, 3 of which you had to answer.One dissertation, which was basically an extended essay, max. 30 pages long.One oral presentation about the content of your dissertation.2 take-home exams, which is basically a very difficult exam that you can solve at home. You have to submit answers to all questions online and to the Examination Schools.Homework completion tasks: We also received grades on problem sets, either A, B, C or F. For some of the written exams or take-home exams you need to get an A, B or C on at least 50% of the exercises, otherwise you were not allowed to take the exam. There were courses with homework completion requirement only.My favourite? The take-home exam. I could work on them at night when I was more productive than during the day! ",
