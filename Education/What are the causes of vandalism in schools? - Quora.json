            "answer_text": "One thing readily comes to mind\u2026 Poor Communication / PR In my third year in college, a supposed \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d became a riot, one that led to the burning down of the school\u2019s \u2018Exams and records unit\u2019, the office of the then Vice Chancellor, the school security post, and the destruction of other valuables. What happened? I'll try to keep it short and straight to the point\u2026 Some financial adjustments were made by the school authority (a raise in bus fare and fees). One the students weren't particularly pleased with, so some very \u2018livered\u2019 students of some faculties went on what they termed \u201ca peaceful protest.\u201d \u2026Indeed it was a peaceful protest, students just went from one lecture hall to the other trying to halt lectures at least so the impact of what they were doing could be felt -of course what is the essence of a protest if people still go on with their normal business like nothing is happening at all?- Sooo\u2026it was peaceful\u2026until they demanded to speak with the Vice Chancellor (VC) who rather than speak with them would call the police. So the police comes to school with teargas and Life bullets. Yes! LIVE BULLETS! And begin to shoot sporadically. DANG! A student is shot! Kingsley, a 200level Zoology student, an only child of his poor mom (at least what we heard) is lying lifeless on the ground! DEAD! Boom!\u2026students get infuriated, of course they should be, one of them has just been killed, just like that! So they manage to get petrol and lighter and let that speak for them. \u2026Because their voices MUST be heard, a way or the other. What would have been Different? Communication/PR: Students need to be carried along in major decisions that would affect them! If the students were earlier on informed about the raise and why, it wouldn't get to a point where they\u2019d have to protest!Communication/PR: Why call the police on innocent students when you can just step out of your office and address them? \u201cWe're looking into the matter\u201d, \u201cThe issue is being resolved\u201d, \u201cwe're sorry for every inconvenience this may cause you\u2026\u201d, \u201c\u2026we promise to do something soon about it\u201d. Those words can calm a raging storm! Believe me. Like I said to my mates then, all the students needed at that point was \u2018audience\u2019, to be granted audience. If the VC had come address the students or at least send a \u2018worthy\u2019 representative, it would've made a whole difference! Even if it means making promises you don't have any intentions of fulfilling soon, calm them; the goal. Communicate; the first thing! Buy yourself some time to review the decision and plan your next step!Communication/PR: The essence of communication/PR in \u2018Pre, During, and Post Major Decisions\u2019 cannot be overemphasized!Communicate! Relate!\u2026That's key! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I can't speak for every situation, but I can tell you as a teacher what my experience has been. The majority of children who vandalized were mostly kids who had no way of channeling excess energy. With courses like music art and physical education sometimes cut from curriculums, there is often no place to channel creative energy. Granted there were some students who vandalized just for meaness and were dealt with, a lot of them were good kids with pent up energy. For example; there was a young man in our school who liked to draw on classroom walls. To be honest, his drawings were pretty good, so even though he did have to clean up his damage as punishment, he became the go to person whenever a mural was needed, or a teacher needed help with a bulletin board or door decoration. Not only did it give him a sense of pride in his work, but it also helped to channel his urge to deface walls into something creative and it kept him out of trouble. Those who do it just for meaness\u2026..I believe they are screaming for attention. Whether it's from parents, teachers, society..Even if it's negative attention, it's better than no attention at all. They feel a need to be heard and validated. And a small majority just like to do it for meaness. I'm not a psychologist so I can't give a good answer. I'm just answering using what I have experienced. I hope this helps. ",
