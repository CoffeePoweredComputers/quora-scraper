            "answer_text": "I would encourage you to study medicine on low tuition or cheapest tuition in Russia. The universities are world class and you\u2019ll certainly enjoy your stay there. Find more info below: Many students now chose to study medicine in Russian universities since the cost of studying medicine else where is high. For instance to study medicine in countries like USA, Canada or Australia, you might have to budget up to about $50,000 per year for tuition fees only. But this is not the case in Russia. Medical universities in Russia have low tuition fees for international students. You can pay as low as $2500 and as high as $6000 per year. I have compiled a list of these low tuition universities as can be seen below: Please find below, a list of medical universities in Russia: Saint Petersburg State Mechnikov Medical Academy English medium :First year : USD 3,600Second to sixth year : USD 3,600Russian medium :First year : USD 2,600Second to sixth year : USD 2,600Saint Petersburg State Pediatrics Medical Academy English medium :First year : USD 3,000Second to sixth year : USD 3,000Russian medium :First year : USD 2,000Second to sixth year : USD 2,000Saint Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University English medium :First year : USD 5,300Second to sixth year : USD 5,300Russian medium :First year : USD 3,200Second to sixth year : USD 3,200Kazan State Medical University English medium :First year : USD 2,800Second to sixth year : USD 2,800Russian medium :First year : USD 1,700 + 300 = USD 2,000Second to sixth year : USD 1,700Hostel Fees: USD 100 per yearInsurance: USD 100 per yearAshtrakhan State Medical Academy English medium :First year : USD 2,300Second to sixth year : USD 2,300Russian medium :First year : USD 2,000Second to sixth year : USD 2,000Hostel Fees: USD 150 per yearInsurance: 100 per yearVolgagrad State Medical Academy English medium :First year : USD 3,200Second to sixth year : USD 3,200Russian medium :First year : USD 2,000Second to sixth year : USD 2,000Ivanovo State Medical Academy English medium :First year : USD 2,700Second to sixth year : USD 2,200Rostov State Medical Academy English medium :First year : USD 3,300Second to sixth year : USD 2,800(The above said fees includes College fees, hostel fees and medical Insurance) Stavropol State Medical University English medium :First year : USD 3,000Second to sixth year : USD 2,500(The above said fees includes College fees, hostel fees and medical Insurance) Vitebsk State Medical University English medium :First year : USD 2,700Second to sixth year : USD 2,200Source: List Of Low Tuition Medical University in Russia ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest not to opt for China, Russia, Philippines, Ukraine, etc. The reason is simple! You find it really hard to clear the MCI exam and your future becomes a big question mark if you can\u2019t clear this! Second, there is always a language barrier and hence it is very difficult for you to interact and understand the difficulties of the patient. This makes you ignorant and that is completely useless for any medical student. If you seek medical education to fit in your budget, you can always look at pursuing MBBS in the Caribbean. This is a wonderful choice. There are many Universities like Texila, that have many Indian students. These institutions have a big impact because these universities also offer the same USA curriculum and you can anytime get into the USA for your higher education. These are very well recognized by MCI and the World Directory of Medical Schools The university helps you get into the USA by simultaneously providing the training for the licensure examination as well. The medium of education will also be in English leaving behind the barrier of studying the local language. ",
