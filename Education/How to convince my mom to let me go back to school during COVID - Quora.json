My friend is a teacher and he just had to be quarantined at home along with his wife and daughter because another teacher in his school was diagnosed with Covid. He and his family just had Covid tests and they were negative. I\u2019m not sure whether he is back in school. There are risks to attending school in person and not only to you, but your family as well. I\u2019m not sure if I had a school age kid that I would send them in-person myself. ",
