            "answer_text": "The answer is, \u201cIt varies\u201d. Understand though that leave accrues at 2.5 days per month of active duty. While you get 30 days of leave per year, it\u2019s not something granted the moment you arrive at boot camp. The math works out like this. 3 months of boot camp and your accrue 7.5 days of leave. Most Marines take leave between boot camp and their MOS training. If you take 2 weeks (14 days), which is normally acceptable, you go into a leave debt of 6.5 days. It\u2019ll take another 3 months before your balance goes above zero. If your MOS training is 3 months, then you\u2019ll only have 1 day of leave accrued when training is completed. You may be authorized to go on leave again, but you\u2019ll go into leave debt again. If you take another 14 days, you\u2019ll be negative 13 days by the time you reach your duty station. When you arrive at your permanent duty station, I can guarantee that they won\u2019t let you accrue any more negative days (unless it\u2019s an extreme emergency). So, you\u2019ll have 6 months before you can take a day off again. Do yourself a favor and only take 7 days after boot camp, then another 7 after MOS training. You\u2019ll thank yourself in the long run. Trust me. The girl ain\u2019t worth it. Your old friends aren\u2019t worth it. Your family may be worth but you\u2019ll be sick of them after a week anyway. Get your training done, get to your permanent duty station, then use accrued leave to bring the important people to you so they can see the new life you have. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how much leave you have saved up. You accumulate 2.5 days per month. If you take leave after boot camp like, most Marines, that\u2019s usually a week or so. Then it\u2019s on to MCT or SOI. That\u2019s another 2.5 day of leave accumulated. After that, it depends on how long your MOS school is. If it\u2019s another 3 months or so of schooling, you may have enough leave to take again before you report to your first duty station. Most of the time your command will let you go on leave before your first duty station. You can go into a negative leave balance, if you have sick spouse or child or immediate family member . Once you hit your duty station, your command won\u2019t let you go on leave until you have a positive leave balance, unless it\u2019s a death in the family. Pro Tip: Find out the date when your MOS school actually starts. If you arrive there 3 weeks early like I did. You can be expected to help move furniture into new offices, and painting rocks in front of those new offices scarlet and gold, plus other general clean up duties. Also PTing, lots of PTing. Try to time your leave out until right about the time your MOS school starts. Little victories. ",

If your graduate Boot Camp on 16 Oct and your school starts on 02 Nov then you can decide at that point on whether your want to go home for 2 weeks or go straight to your duty station.

I should have drove across country but my senses were limited then. Or, if you want to get used to your new digs and settle in, all you need to do is be to the airport on time.
