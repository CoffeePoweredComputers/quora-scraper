            "answer_text": "Let us solve with the help of the Venn Diagram to understand it better. It is given 40% of the students passed mathematics. This can be represented in a Venn Diagram like :  Assume, that sea-green circle represents maths and blue - English And also given 30% passed English, this can be represented in the Venn diagram as :  and also given 10% passed them both. this can be represented in the Venn diagram as  But when you see that the 10 lies in both maths and English So we subtract 10 from both the circles to get the exact no of students those who passed maths only and English only. *only means- 40% says that the no of students passed math includes the students those who have passed English also. only is emphasised because we want the students those who passed maths and not English. Got it? So, when we subtract the 10 from both we get students who passed only math and only English and can be represented in the Venn diagram as:  So, now we got the students who passed only maths-30% english-20% and both English and math = 10% Now summing up all three quantities 30%+20%+10%=60% Out of 100%, 60% passed and remaining are failed. Hence, 100%-60%=40% 40% failed. I know that this is a problem is a piece of cake, yet I exaggerated because when we dig deeper into the simple question we might end up with an understanding of incredible things. ",
