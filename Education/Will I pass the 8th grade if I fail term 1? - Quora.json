            "answer_text": "It depends on a few things. Mathematics. How many terms are there? Two? Four? Six? If you score well enough in other terms then you should still be able to average pass. That is failing grade in one term plus passing grades in other term(s) divided by number of terms equals (fingers crossed) passing grade overall. Work ethic. Are you making good use of your time? Are you using smart strategies? Are you taking good notes? Are you actively listening? Are you asking questions to increase your understanding? Are you checking your work? Are you submitting all assignments? Are you studying for your tests? Are you reading the questions and prompts carefully? Are you looking at the questions you missed and learning from your mistakes as you go? Level of difficulty. Are you in classes that are perhaps not a good fit for your current skill set? If not, is there something you can do about it? Tutorials, schedule change, etc.? Understanding of the material. Since I\u2019m term two, classes tend to build on the foundation that was set in term one, do you understand enough of what you missed to continue to absorb new material and organise/synthesise the information in your brain? Might you do well to revisit some of the concepts, maybe with a friend from class who can help, or perhaps your teacher? Leniency of teachers. How generous are they? Will they drop your lowest test grade? Will they offer opportunities for extra credit? Will seeing your increased attention and effort to your studies perhaps cause them to push your grade up by a letter? If your grade completely based on accuracy and understanding of the material, then I suggest you try your level best. Actually, you might want to do that either way. Good luck! Oh, and if you have a kind Mathematics teacher, he or she may be able to help you figure out an achievable goal of what marks you need to obtain in order to pass this year. Sometimes final exams and midterms get put into separate grading categories from regular term averages, so it can get a little bit tricky. But a teacher from your school should know what\u2019s what and since arithmetic is involved\u2026maths would be my top pick for a teacher\u2019s help. TL;DR: Maybe. Maybe not. Ask your maths teacher and work hard. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Students who attend an ordinary U.S. middle school can fail every class and still be elevated to high school the following year. American public schools routinely practice social promotion, and cannot retain students without parental consent. Having said that, once U.S. public school students reach ninth grade, they must begin to accumulate enough required and elective class credits to meet graduation requirements. Middle school students who possess even the most modest academic skill set are able to earn respectable grades so long as they regularly attend class, complete some of the assignments, pass a few of the tests, and, importantly, do not create problems for staff. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",
