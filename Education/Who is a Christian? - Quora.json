            "answer_text": "A Christian is anyone who chooses to accept Jesus Christ for their sacrifice for their sins. Jesus died for the whole world so anyone can become a Christian, all you have to do is accept him as your sacrifice and also your mediator between mankind and God.    God is pure Truth and he can't tolerate sin in his presence...  Before Jesus came, God traveled with the Hebrews for over 40 years to protect the 7 seeds that would produce Jesus. Everything had to be done perfect in his presence. The ancient Hebrews had to be really careful not to sin in the presence of God because they would be annihilated on the spot. Aaron's kids were annihilated for burning the wrong insense in the Holy Place where God dwelled. One man was annihilated for picking up sticks on the Sabbath in the presence of God.    The Hebrews were allowed to offer up animal sacrifices for a temporary sacrifice to cover their sins. This was a temporary sacrifice and had to be offered each time they sinned. This went on for over 40 years. Can you imigine having to live under these laws. That's why God was so strict with the Hebrews so that they would not have to die in his presence.   From the ark of Noah there were 7 seeds of mankind that we all sprang from.  From those 7 seeds Jesus Christ was formed over the many generations. In the end, Mary carried half the seeds and Joseph carried the others. Jesus was born with all 7 seeds in his blood so that his blood would be a part of every man, woman and child that was on the earth. He was like a brother to us all and understood us all because of the same blood.   Jesus could tolerate sin and even took on all the sins of every man when he died on the cross as our sacrifice. Therefore God give him eternal life and allowed him to become our mediator between God and mankind. God also give him the power to be able to become our mediator.   Now, there is no annihilation when we sin because of Jesus because he can tolerate sin and he has the power to wash us clean and take us before God so that we can be forgiven. Once forgiven, it's forgotten as long as we can forgive everyone else. Then if you sin again and you're sincere, God can forgive you again and again as long as you can forgive others.   The people that refuse to accept Jesus as their sacrifice are called the antichrists and unless they repent and accept Jesus they will die as an antichrist with no sacrifice for their sins. The ones that are still alive will die at the battle if Armageddon by the hand of Jesus Christ. Then only Christians will remain and will live in world peace for 1000 years. Satan will be locked in the chains of darkness.   Then in my understanding, there will be a resurrection for all that never had a chance to know God or Jesus. Little aborded babies and people from far away islands that died without knowing God. Satan will be released to tempt them. The Bible calls it a short time, ... I picture it as one lifetime... After these last few have made their choice then the day of judgement will come and everyone will be be judged by what they did during their life on earth. That will be when God will take his own to heaven and the evil will be cast into eternal hell along with Satan.   That's my answer to what a Christian is and why it's so important to accept Jesus as your sacrifice and mediator. We are living in the last days now, so repent will you are still alive. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, I will like us to consider first the definition of the word 'Christian' given by Emmet Russell in the Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary. The Biblical meaning is \"adherent of Christ.\" The disciples were formally called Christians first in Antioch (Acts 11:26). Agrippa recognized that to believe what Paul preached would make him Christian (Acts 26:28). Peter accepted the name as in itself basis for persecution (1 Pet. 4:16). Thus gradually a name imposed by Gentiles was adopted by the disciples of Jesus. Some Jews had referred to them  as \"the sect of the Nazarenes\" (Acts 24:5); and Paul, when a persecutor, as those \"of the Way\" (Acts 9:2). The Latin termination ianos, widely used throughput the empire, often designated the slaves of the one with whose name it was compounded. This implication occurs in the NT (eg. Rom. 6:22; 1 Pet. 2:16). The apostles wrote of themselves as servants (slaves) of Christ (Rom. 1:1; James 1:1; II Pet. 1:1; Jude 1:1; Rev. 1:1). The NT calls the followers of Christ brethren (Acts 14:2); disciples (Acts 6:1, 2);  saints (Acts 9:13;  Ron. 1:7; I Cor. 1:2); believers (I Tim. 4:12); the church of God (Acts 20:28); those that call upon the name of the Lord (Acts 9:14; Ron. 10:12, 13); etc. To the first Christians, their own name mattered not at all: their concern was with the one Name of Jesus Christ (Acts 3:16; 4:10, 12; 5:28). Inevitably, the name which they invoked was given to them: Christians, Christ's men. Its NT meaning is alone adequate for us. So the appellation 'Christian' is generally used for all followers of Christ whether they attend church services regularly or not. Hence it is not for us to judge who is a Christian and who is not because the Lord knows those who are His (2 Timothy 2:19) and those who call themselves Christians know whether they are truly Christians or not. However, to identity those who are true Christians the term 'born-again' has been added to read 'born-again Christian.'  Anyone who has repented of their sins, exercised faith in Christ saving grace and experienced the new birth, is known as born-again Christian. ",
