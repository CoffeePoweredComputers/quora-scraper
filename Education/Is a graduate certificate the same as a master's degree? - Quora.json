            "answer_text": "No, it is not. I hold both, and the Master\u2019s is much, much more intensive. A certificate is typically a lot fewer courses. With that said, both can be incredibly useful. To be honest, most people care less what I studied in grad school and are impressed that I have the degree; the certificate (which I hold in Evaluation) buys me some extra credibility in that topic. I\u2019d encourage you to think about what you\u2019re looking for. What are your educational goals? Why? Some employers are more inclined to hire/promote someone with a grad certificate; but it is a lighter program than a full Master\u2019s. Also, don\u2019t anticipate that the certificate courses will be any easier than their Master\u2019s equivalents; mine were, on average, much harder! I\u2019d encourage you to check out my free guide: 11 Mistakes Students Make Applying to Grad School. I think it will provide you some perspective, at least on the Master\u2019s degree. For more information about what you should start thinking about, here\u2019s a link to my service page (I coach students through the graduate application process at all levels, including certifications). Here\u2019s the link: Services Best of luck! ",
