            "answer_text": "I am a female teacher. I have noticed that students, mostly boys, respond better to male teachers. It may be this way because men have stronger voices and tend to use authority more so than a female teacher. It may have to do with what children are taught at home regarding males and females and how you should regard them. my favorite teacher was a male. It wasn\u2019t because of any other reason than he was the best teacher I had in my entire education. He cared and he worked very hard at his job. We didn\u2019t just read books, we lived books. One particular example was a book we read called, Alive:The Story of the Andes Survivors, a true story about a plane filled with a rugby team that crashed in the Andes mountains and they climbed their way out after 70 days on the mountain. Our teacher had us tightly packed, sitting on the floor among upturned desks and chairs while reading the book, just like the survivors in the book were tightly packed among each other and debris in the fuselage. He had rags that we tied around our heads and arms and legs just like the survivors with their real injuries. He even opened the windows to the classroom in the midst of winter to get the feeling of being so cold, just as the survivors were. Our teacher brought that book, and others, to life for us. He was truly a great teacher and I remember his lessons both about life and reading to this day. I don\u2019t know why you like your male teachers better than your female teachers, but both have qualities that you can gain from. I would suggest looking for the best in your teachers as opposed to what you may not like about them. Everyone has something to offer. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly depends on the pupil. I was at an all boys\u2019 school - and was gay. Closeted, unsure - but gay. I only ever managed to get on with the male teachers who weren\u2019t growly, butch, with something to prove, even to eleven year old boys such as myself. My mother very quickly noticed that generally I got higher marks and had less trouble, in the classes with non-sporty male teachers, and, particularly, female teachers. In fact, in one case, the English teacher I had for four and a half years out of seven - well, more like her, and I would\u2019ve come out of that school top of every class. I believe my mother\u2019s words were \u201cGod, she LOVES you - think she\u2019d adopt you if she could!\u201d No surprise then that my very best exam results came from the classes she taught me, without exception. (And as for my one time geography teacher, form tutor, and school rugby coach - well, when your own mother comes home and utters the words \u201cJust ignore that arsehole\u2026\u201d!) And if anyone thinks it was just luck, let me point to my French studies. I excelled at languages, having started with a gentle, kind male teacher, continued with a female teacher - and was close to top marks at GCSE. However, come A-Level, and those teachers gave way to much more \u201cmanly\u201d a man - in his own mind at least. And at that point, my French grades dropped from top As to Ds. Mum couldn\u2019t work out why, until parents\u2019 evening - when she met the man in question. Such a shame he had to take six months\u2019 leave just as A-level season began - replaced by the gentler guy, I clawed my way back up to a C. I do wish it wasn\u2019t that straightforward, but seriously. It\u2019s really not so hard to just be the same with all pupils, regardless of whether they\u2019re into school sports or not. Still, 21 years later, I\u2019d just say - Mrs Seddon, you were a bloody legend. And Mr McKie? Go fuck yourself seventeen ways to Tuesday. ",
