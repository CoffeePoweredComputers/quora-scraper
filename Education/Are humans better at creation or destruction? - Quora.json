            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll venture a few thoughts here.  It is much easier to destroy than to create. There are so many examples, but I\u2019ll take one. The World trade Centre in New York was destroyed in a few hours on 9/11/2001. The Freedom tower was finished in 2015. Although it took only 11 years[1] , the full enterprise took closer to 14 years, which in itself is very fast. So, whatever example you take destroying is always easier.  Creation takes a lot of effort. It usually takes persuading a lot of people, and it takes a lot of time and effort. Wether it is building a plane, a ship, a road, a factory, a company, it takes a lot of time and effort. And It is a never ending process. We are perpetually building on prior steps. After 2 story buildings, came 3, 4, 5-story buildings. After fixed lined phones came wireless phones \u2026 So, us, humans, we are perpetually building and creating, and overcoming new challenges.  Now, us, humans, we have also been able to conceive of extremely powerful weapons of mass destruction, like nuclear bombs, and of multiple sophisticated genocides executed with mathematical precision. So yes, we are also very good at destruction.  However, the most compelling argument, in my mind, would be: look around. What do you see? Do you see things that are built, things that are harmonious and clean, things that work smoothly? Or do you see rubble and destruction?  Therefore, overall, I think, in our universal consciousness, we are better at creating things. all the best! Are people better at creating things or destroying them?

            "answer_text": "There a art to engineering and knowledge that required to create things without consequences and if there is consequences how do you solve them.the world is a big place . It is an immense biosphere. When they first built steam locomotives and used coal to fuel the flame they had no idea that technology over a period of time this type of pollution would accumulate and pollute the world. Coal was the new driving force. It would be used to heat buildings,coal burning stoves,steam ships. Black smoke would be billowing out of chimneys. The smoke would dissipate and eventually disappear from the sky. The civilization was flourishing people were expanded and prosperous . People didn't. Understand what was coming forms those smoke stacks and chimneys except soot but it contain green house gases heavy metals and sulfur dioxide., lrad to fall as acid rain. As time went by they discovered oil and natural gas and people multiplying using more and more fossil fuels. As science progress scientists began to realize the properties of this type of pollution. The climate was being affected by these gases ever so slowly until it it was obvious. People who were and still rather chalk up to a weather amormaly but an anomaly is now the new norm and it is creating catastrophe all over the world but the people making trillions would rather deny it because money is the only thing that matters to them now and are using the slightest of a doubt to deny it. From the beginning of the industrial revolution has been going on for almost 300 years we polluted the air and water with green house gases and toxic chemicals. It is even the drinking water. If you were a fisherman there are fish you shouldn't be eating anymore like the striped bass that swim up the Hudson to spawn. People are warned not to eat more than one fish a month and pregnant women should avoid it all together because of high risk of birth defects. Now in the 21 century we continue to pollute knowing the consequences. In this day in age we should be innovating things that don't have such negative . iconsequences or is if the immediate benefits are neccessary figure out how to minimize such consequences. We are running very late on taking action and the negative consequences are now inevitable. America doesn't even want to slow it down blinded by greed and lack of vision that does not extend past their own lifespans. This lack to react to prior knowledge or to foresee it by by using science CDto forecast such consequences the whole planet and there is no sustainable future. I know these things from engineering and to know the physics of electronics to incorporate in the a circuit design to be able to deal with it with the first prototype. It real time for no more mistakes and lack of vision. We are now in a state where we have done more damage than good. Money has blinded us from the future shooting for relative short term goals. Design circuits for aviation, telecommunications and medical devices. So I know a great deal about consequential thinking ",

It is thus a chain reaction of evolution for millenniums. A change for the better, in most of the cases, is a process of Creation. A change for the worse, is an eventual stumbling block in the path of creation. Humanity has come this far thru a tumult of Creative & destructive minds. Creation and Destruction, exists in the human minds \u2013 One or the other, is an expression of the inner inspiration, urge or agitation.

            "answer_text": "Destruction is always going to be easier than creation because of entropy. A neolithic man would struggle to build a computer, but he would find it easy enough to break one. Similarly, I bet I could break whatever inconceivably advanced technology they come up with in the future. In fact, I bet I will - probably on the day I buy it. Hell, this phone I'm using right now is completely smashed. So I think destruction comes more easily, but not because we are more destructive. It's just because it's always easier to fuck things up; you have so many more options. In fact, it's pretty impressive that we manage to successfully create anything at all, given that the most basic laws of the universe seem so keen to see us fail. ",
