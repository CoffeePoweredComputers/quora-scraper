            "answer_text": "I do not know what educational background you are from or what you are pursuing. But the answer to this question is common to all. Do not try to compete with others; rather compete with yourself. Try to improve yourself everyday. The position you stand at this moment, shall rise the next moment. So it hardly matters if you\u2019re second or you come first in your class in the near future. What matters is how knowledgeable you\u2019re and when the time comes how well you present yourselves. I hope these two lines written above, makes a difference in your life. Good Luck! ",
