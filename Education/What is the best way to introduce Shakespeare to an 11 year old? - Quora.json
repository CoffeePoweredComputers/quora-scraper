            "answer_text": "Well, start with reading her one of his plays and then going into a lesson about the man who wrote it. I know that one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays in novel/book format is pretty daunting for an 11 year old, so I\u2019d suggest starting with a graphic novel version. They make ones that are basic and are not word for word, but rather are a summary with the key quotes. I read several of these when I was in sixth grade. The other option is the verbatim play, but accompanied by pictures so it looks just like a comic book with old English that is made easier to understand by the visuals. Both are pretty good options, depending on the level you feel he/she is ready to go to. I hope this helps! ",
