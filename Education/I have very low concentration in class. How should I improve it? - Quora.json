During the lecture, if all your doubts are not cleared, or some new questions come up, engage those taking class appropriately. As you have made certain questions to be answered, attending closely to the lecture should become easier. ",

            "answer_text": "How to improve concentration in the classroom? Focus on the task at hand: If talking with someone: ask questions; if reading a book or a report: ask yourself how you would summarize what you just read to a friend or to your teacher.In general, avoid and/or eliminate distractions. Tune out every\u00adthing else. The harder the task, the more impor\u00adtant it is to tune out dis\u00adtrac\u00adtions.Do not try to double-task, this will increase your errors and divide your attention. Attention is limited. When you try to do several things at once, you necessarily have to divide your attention and thus concentrate less on each individual tasks.Use meditation. Several studies have shown that meditation can be a good brain training tool that affects especially attentional / concentration skills.",
