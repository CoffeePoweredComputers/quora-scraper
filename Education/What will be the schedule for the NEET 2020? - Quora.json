            "answer_text": "I am expecting NEET 2020 and other major competitive exams to be organized by June end or July beginning. My analysis is based on following facts UGC in its recent circular dated 28th April,has recommended that final year students will have to appear for the annual semester exams, which can be held in the month of July 2020.The circular further says that the classes for the new academic year will start from 1st August. So all university exams would be held in the month of July.Maharashtra by polls in 9 districts on 21st May. Now all of us know that Maharashtra is the worst effected state and announcing bypolls on 21st means that government would ease of most restrictions by that time.Also Government has given lot of relaxations in the Lockdown 3 from 4th to 17th May. Now most of the things are open except air/Train and metro travel, cinema halls,Hotels and malls, school/colleges and coaching institutes. So my reading and internal information says that if Covid cases don\u2019t rise exponentially in next few days and India is able to flatten the curve most of the restrictions would be over by 17th May.So with this background information the time to give your peak performance (100%) has come. I would like to share a short story to further emphasise my point. The tile of the story is \u201cKaash Mujhe Phele Pata Hota\u201d An elderly carpenter was due to retire after 40 years of service. He told his Boss that he wants to leave the job and spend rest of his life along with his family in village. His boss was disappointed as the carpenter had been a loyal and diligent worker for many years, so he was sad to see him go. He had build some very good looking wooden houses in the last 40 years and was one of his best employee. But the boss understood his desire and said OK you can go but as a last favour please build one more house as the client has specifically asked his house to be build by you. The old carpenter agreed, but it was soon clear that his heart wasn\u2019t in it. As he took shortcuts, used inferior materials and put in a half-hearted effort. In the end the final product was well short of his usual standards. It was a disappointing way to end his career. Finally the carpenter completed the house before schedule and went to his boss to hand over the keys. The boss took the keys, turned back and put them in a box and handed over the box to the carpenter and said \u201cThis house is a parting gift from me to you and your entire family. I remember you once said that your wife wished if she also lived in a nice wooden house\u201d The old carpenter was shocked and embarrassed because he had not build the house perfectly and had made many compromises in design and raw material. His immediate reaction was \u201cKaash Mujhe Phele Pata Hota\u201d. If only he had known, he would have given his best to make the house the best in the world. Moral: We all do this in our life, and later say, \u2018Kash Mujhe Phele Pata hota\u2019. We don\u2019t give 100% in our studies and work half heartedly and later repent when we don\u2019t get desired results. As students when a question comes in the test from a chapter we left we say, I wish I had known this before. Just remember each and every question you are solving and each and every day you are studying you are laying foundation of our career which you will enjoy all your life. I have also made a detailed padcast on this topic. You can listen to complete podcast on this on spotify titled \u201dStudents Move ahead in Corona Crisis\u201d. So to finish don\u2019t worry too much about factors which are not in our hands, infact think this as an opportunity to take your preparation to next level. Don\u2019t let this opportunity go waste else you will regret in your life and say \u201cKaash Mujhe Phele Pata Hota\u201d I am confident that you will make your parents and teachers proud. Wishing you all the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Answering as on 29th April Huh!!! So - yeah- any predictions? 1500 hundred cases coming in daily. I live in Chandigarh. This place was having just 27 cases for the longest period of time. Police was patrolling hard and the people are abiding - given that everybody has a stable income . Now this guy- a class four worker - a ward boy in the hospital comes positive and drags two doctors with him in the pit. My sister works in the same hospital and was in contact with the two doctors with 29 others- all of them are home quarantined and the first test has also been conducted. Some people from a particular colony test positive as well , some worker distributing food tests positive too and now the count in just a day has increased to 56. The numbers doubled in a day. I must tell you that Chandigarh is the most well planned city in India. You go out and you may never see a crowd walking together. It\u2019s spacious- ample enough for an Indian city. The police is extremely strict - this place is funded by two state governments and the central government being a UT. But what happened ? That too in a lockdown. What shall happen if it all opens up ? Now I am too scared a bit. Few days ago I thought everything is going to be fine- but that\u2019s nowhere the case. Poach yourself. Keep shouting that it\u2019s all fine. Be happy listening to the extremely impartial media houses telling every second that it\u2019s going to be fine. But the bottom line remains the same. AAP tweeted about considering board merit for JEE . They said they could not risk the lives of Delhi children for an exam. But what I read in that tweet - which was in the subtext/ subconscious We can\u2019t imagine getting 1000\u2019s of students getting ill together. We can\u2019t handle it. We can\u2019t risk the asset of this country for an academic year. Now this may look like a bad option. But the reality isn\u2019t far too. So when shall be the exam be conducted ? Till it\u2019s safe to make 16 lakh students sit in this country - on different places - together- for at least 5 hours. If a guy can make things bad for a town - just think about these students plus the staff combined - can do how much good for a nation with a billion population ! God save the earth. ",
