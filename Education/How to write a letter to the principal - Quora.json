            "answer_text": "Very simply. First, keep it respectful. Second, identify the action you would like from your principal. How you begin will depend upon whether the principal knows your or not. Assuming the principal does not, introduce yourself. You might start with: \u201cDear Mr./Ms. - My name is John Doe. I am a senior here at Name of School High School. I am interested in pursuing a college degree at University of Choice. In order to further increase my chances of being accepted, I would be grateful if you might provide a letter of recommendation for me. Here are a few of my strengths that I believe have made me successful here. (Patience, hard work, etc).\u201d If you are requesting something else, you would place the request first and follow it by your reasons: \u201cDear Mr./Ms. - My name is Jane Doe and I am a senior here at Name of High School. I would like to request a change in cafeteria food, specifically the meatloaf. While this may seem like an odd request, there are serious reasons why I believe a change is necessary. (State your reasons). I appreciate your consideration in this matter. Best regards, Your name.\u201d Hope this helps! ",

Drop down two lines: underneath the date write Attention: name of school official (Mr. or Ms.), title (Principal); brief (a few words) subject title (line). Drop down two spaces to write salutation: \"Dear Mr/Ms\u2026\" Greetings, Principal\u2026\" \"Principal (name)\"; follow with a colon: not a semi-colon and do not use all capital letters. Either indent (tab) for paragraph or begin writing (best choice 1 1/2 line space) from the very most left edge margin. Double (2 line) space between each paragraph: indent tab and number points or (a) (b) (c) to attention\u2026 (I) (A) or 1. highlight pointsBullets \u2022 can be usedOr * Asterisk.Objects of interestIf the text exceeds one page, center a page number, -1- or -one-, two spaces below the last line of the 1st page paragraph (at least two spaces from (above) the very bottom. If a header function is possible, enter a header text name of principal/school, your name, date, subject: or enter this information across the top\u2014starting at left margin, single space to a second line (if necessary). And then drop down two-three lines to begin the first second page paragraph. It's easier if header function is available: if the letter exceeds a second page, the same process for a centered placed page #, manually written header is necessary: copy/paste is fast for header info and changing just a page number (such as from -2- to -3-). Repeat the exact same process/text/numbering for all pages other than the title on page -one- (-1-). Keep consistent paragraph line space and left to right margins. Otherwise: do not be a slimy CHUMMY CHUMP; be courteous\u2014do not write in intimate/personal nuances\u2014and polite, not preposterous. Do not make assumptions of knowledge: explain what, why, where, who, when, why and how you have decided to initiate communication. At the very last paragraph on the last page, drop down two-three spaces for a closing salutation, 'Sincerely' 'Respectfully' or\u2026 'By full knowledge of the penalties for Perjury'\u2026 And then drop down two-three spaces: enter a solid line for a signature over the top of\u2014single space\u2014a typed full legal name; single space one line down to write an address of the sender (letter writer). Single space one line: ema address/phone number of sender. The closing salutation and signature block can start at the left margin or be centered (in the middle of the page) of the last 1/4 of the page; don't forget to leave room for the last page number. If there's room on the last page\u2014above or below closing salutation or signature line block: below all of the letter's body text\u2014a photocopy of a (photo) student ID or driver's license image is acceptable, depending on the circumstance. [A helpful thing: enter an online search for \"example of a professional letter\" or \"example of a demand letter\"; typically, this will result physical images of examples that can be followed.] ",

            "answer_text": "A formal letter format for a school principal is usually letter sent by a student, by the group of students in the school or by the parents. Most of the schools have the policy to encourage students to address their problems to school principal in person rather than sending a formal complaint letter. Therefore a formal letter for a school principal is the document which will be carefully considered by the school board. The formal letter format for school principal follows the design of the formal complaint letter or formal request letter. You should pay attention to edit the letter in the way that all typos are corrected. Another important thing is that you should keep a cheerful, approachable tone in the letter, even when you are filing a complaint. Formal letter format for school principal (One Of The Best Method) [Name of the school] [Address] Subject: [Name the request, complaint] Dear Mr. / Ms. [Last name], I am writing to you [here state the purpose of the letter, for example, to schedule an appointment to discuss something, to submit a request, etc. Here you start writing your letter. For example, you can begin by expressing your interest in the school. Tell them something you like about the school or make a compliment. Expand on that information a little. You can start slowly in this paragraph with your main remarks or with your request. That\u2019s your first paragraph. This paragraph should explain that you have some questions/complaints/ requests. Then, you ask the questions, focus on any details that are of particular concern to you. In the last paragraph, you should thank the person to whom you are writing for their time and tell them that you appreciate their response to your questions. Thanking You.

Then the recipient\u2019s address should follow. DateSkip one line then write your date in full like 2nd September 2018. Formality should be maintained. Avoid writing 2/9/2022. The date should be written on the left-hand side. Greetings or SalutationIf you are aware of whoever you are addressing by name, include a relevant tile before their name like Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms, Dr, or Prof., e.g., Dear Dr. Jefferson, If you do not know their name, use Dear Sir or Madam. This is respectful. SubjectThis is the heading of what you are writing about and should be written in capital letters. Eg. SUB: LETTER OF ADMISSION. Begin the subject from the far left side and skip a line after the greeting then get to the subject. BodyHere, you should be precise in what you are trying to put across. Write this in proper grammar and make it straight to the point. Begin by introducing yourself briefly and write your intentions of the letter. The second paragraph should be a humble plea to be granted your request. Thank whoever you are addressing. Sign OffSkip a line and end your letter with Yours Faithfully, or Yours Sincerely, below this your signature should follow then your name and class if you are a student. ",

That means thinking about how they\u2019re likely to react to what you\u2019re saying. So, if you want them to read beyond the first sentence, use that first sentence to set the stage for them to continue. Even if your letter contains a complaint, you can still start by saying something like, \u201cNo doubt, you get many letters to read, and while this topic might not be your favorite, I appreciate you reading it all the same.\u201d Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "You may need to write an application letter to the principal of your college asking for transfer certificate for various reasons. You might feel that you are not pursuing the right course and want a shift in your academic career; you may face financial difficulties that would render yourself unable to pursue the course; you might have landed a job and no longer want to continue with the course. Whatever the reason, a letter to principal asking for transfer certificate from college is a quite common one. When you are studying in a college or pursuing some professional course, we would assume that you have attained majority and no longer require the guardianship of your parent(s). In such cases, you may apply for the transfer certificate yourself, with your own signature at the bottom. Our model TC application letters have been written in a similar fashion assuming that the student candidate is writing it himself herself. In case you are a minor, and your guardian has to write the application letter to the principal for transfer on your behalf, please read our transfer certificate application letter to school head. Please note that the model transfer certificate letters are to be used as sample formats only. Though the change of address and change in academic interest are often the most common reasons for seeking transfer from college, there may be other cases as well and you have to write your letter accordingly. However, more or less all the transfer certificate application letters, whatever may be the reason, will have certain similarities between them. ",
