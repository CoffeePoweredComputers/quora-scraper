            "answer_text": "That all depends on the state and school district in which you live. In my school district, you cannot fail more than two core classes and still pass. You ALSO have to pass those respective state tests. If you want to know how many Fs you can get in a class, that all depends on how many assignments there are and how much they are weighted. For example, a teacher might weight tests as 50% of the grade. If you have two tests, they are each worth 25%. If regular assignments are the other 50% and you have 25 of those, they will each be worth 2% of your final grade. Obviously you could fail a lot more of those than tests. If all assignments and tests are weighted and worth the same, just add all your grades and divide by the number of assignments/tests. Then see if you have a passing score (in my district, a 70%). So if everything is worth the same amount, it will take two 100s to make up for every 0 and bring you to a passing grade. Zeroes are grade killers! As you can see, it's much easier to just do your best and do all the assignments than to try to figure out how much you can slack. ",

            "answer_text": "In CA schools you can get all Fs and be socially promoted into the 9th grade. If a student gets all Fs, middle school administrators probably want to get rid of the student and send him or her to high school. Once you get to high schools, things are different. You have to pass courses in order to graduate with a high school diploma. I know high school administrators who were pleased when troublesome, non-performing students reached the age of 18. The student was removed that day from regular high school and sent to Adult School. ",
