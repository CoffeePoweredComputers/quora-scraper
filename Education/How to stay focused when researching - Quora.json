            "answer_text": "List all the known distractions and a reasonable way for you to react to them. Keep a cheatsheet handy- humans forget that we have weaknesses. Clearly define the scope of your research and objectives before you commence actual research, ensure it is measurable. You need to know when to stop and exit. You need to know when you have successfully met the expected outcomes. Create a template/structure/tracking chart for your observations/experiments/lessons and stick to it.  Keep a live journal which is in chronological and succinct so it doesn't become a hinderance to the process. Keep it in a format which is search friendly.  Keep a 10% reserve time for auditing/self reflection- refine your template/structure/chart and Mark the quality of your work in the reserve time. Find a mentor or a senior who you trust and can confide in, for direction and feedback. Ensure you have balance in your daily activities - sleep, nutrition, exercise, social engagements and work. The most important thing is that you must enjoy your work to remain focused, if you enjoy what you do- you won't have to find a way to focus. ",

            "answer_text": "It's more common, I have seen many of us facing these problems.   The solution is when you will try to find/ search for some thing follow these steps:  1.  Take a sticky-note (Yellow color) and write the topic you're looking for then stick it into the laptop or tablet or desk top / Or/ You can use windows Seven provides an application called Stick Notes, you can write something on it and pin it to your desktop . And remember when you will search for something always take a look to the Sticky Note.  2.  Say the topic name several times slowly when you'll search for something (ex. searching for Organization Development, say the Topic word several times unless or until you find the write topic) 3. While you search for some thing keep repeating this question to you, \" What is the Topic that I am looking for\"  4. Like wise Mr. Bharadwaj Says Meditate on daily basis to improve your focus and reduce your mood swings. ",
