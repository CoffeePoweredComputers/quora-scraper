            "answer_text": "iIn most schools a 60% is a D- and that is passing but barely, a mild sneeze will be murder. However, even if over all you have 62% you are still faced with three classes that you FLUNKED, get ready for summer school. You probably will have to make those classes up, as I am betting they were required courses. So if you wish to graduate with your classmates, four years from now you need to get those grades up to passing. So get to work and quit goofing off. Now I\u2019ll bet that is not what you expected or wanted to read. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the school. However most schools would consider a F as not passing. In order to pass a class you have to have a minimum grade in the class, which is different for every school. I personally don\u2019t think that you passed those three classes since you got F\u2019s in them. You better get the grade up to at least a C in order to guarantee passing. ",
