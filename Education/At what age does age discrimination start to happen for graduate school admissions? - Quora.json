            "answer_text": "I'm more familiar with computer science departments ranked 50-100.  It's easier for a 50-year-old to get accepted than a 25-year-old:  if you're 50 and looking to go back for a PhD, you probably have extensive industry experience and an unusually strong motivation to do research (otherwise, why would you bother?).  Professors will see you as someone who can take a leadership position in their lab as well as someone who has deep expertise in an area that's (hopefully) related to their research.   Discrimination would probably kick in around 60.  You're signing up for a 6-8 year job, and is preparing for your dissertation defense really what you want to be worrying about when you're 68?  At that point, the risks probably outweigh the benefits. ",

If you already have a Master's, 28 to 30 might be more likely. The biological sciences peak later, because so many people go to medical school as well as something else, in an M.D./Ph.D. program. ",
