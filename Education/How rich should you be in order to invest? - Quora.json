            "answer_text": "You have it backwards. You don\u2019t wait to be \u201crich\u201d, you get yourself in order and you start as soon as you can. First, you need to pay your bills\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t be investing if you have debts. Get your finances in order, pay off your debts (except your mortgage if you have a house). Then start putting away 15% of your gross income each and every month into retirement investments. This will most likely be a 401k at your place of employment, and personal IRA\u2019s that you\u2019ll create when you move from one job to another and transfer your old 401k into an IRA that you can direct. The key to investing in TIME and discipline. You can grow rich if you start young enough to have 35 years of compound interest, and you need to be putting something away each and every month. This runs contrary to human nature as some people way over think this and stop investing when the market takes a down turn. This is a really bad thing as they fail to realize that stocks are on sale and that their buying power is multiplied. They wait till the market gets strong and start buying after the stock prices rise\u2026 remember the old adage\u2026 \u201cBuy low, sell high\u201d\u2026 they are doing the opposite. ",

I have no reason to quarrel with Amazon having done a splendid job for me But I need money I need help on this ",

This means that you have to have enough to pay your bills, provide for your family, have an emergency fund and still have a bit left over that you don't need to use for anything. Your investment money should come from this last item on the list. You have a lot of options to invest in. You just need to educate yourself in the field that you want to invest in and be comfortable with your decision. You can invest in the stock market, real estate, precious metals and stones, art, local businesses\u2026 just pick something and learn as much as you can first. ",

Are you deeply in debt? Are you making a lot of payments? Do you still keep on buying something that's taking money away from you? If you don't have a lot of debt, you have a decent amount in your savings, and your more conservative with your money, I would say it's time for you to invest. If you dont like to invest yourself, just go to a insurance company, a bank, or any Financial service member to open an IRA (roth or traditional) ",

Meaning, rent any room you got vacant to reduce your part of the rent or mortgage. The extra money can be saved to invest. buy a duplex or triplex. Live in one side and rent the rest. purchase a house every couple of years. If you buy a house, you can live in it for one year, then buy a second one as your primary home, move to the new one and rent the other one. Now, I have done this. Most people tend to think you must buy a nice house. If you do that, it is hard to come up with the down payment every year. But if you buy houses or condos in Class \u201cC\u201d neighborhoods, is easier to do. Yes, it takes sacrifice. Yes, it is not easy to do. But it can be done because I have done it. ",

            "answer_text": "Its not about been rich and then only you can trade. One can start trading when they are financially secured. As trading involves the fluctuation of the market. And nobody is completely or 100% sure about how the market will turn. So, in my opinion one should start trading while they are having other source of income. In the beginning they should be trading in the mini lot and once they start understanding about the market, gained a good experience or having the proper knowledge about the risk management and money management. then they can increase there time duration on trading. However still having other source of income then trading is also very important. Though trading gives a financial independence. However ones should always be ready with the backup So, its not about been how much rich you are because even people who are rich makes mistake and loose all there money in revenge trading. ",
