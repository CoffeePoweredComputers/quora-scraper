Not a chance of going forward if your GPA is in the basement and if your grade level competency is somewhere south of the 6th grade, you may be in for a rude surprise. Quit playing around, the material isn\u2019t that difficult if you pay attention and take notes, and do at least a major part of your homework. I taught 8th grade for 15 years and recognized the slackers pretty quick. Parents would come in because their child\u2019s grades were tanking. I would pull the notebook of an A student with maybe 80\u2013100 pages of notes by mid year, and show that and their child\u2019s notebook of maybe 10 pages for 18 weeks. It was a Captain Obvious moment for them, and the student would catch hell from the parents for being a screw-off. Sometimes it worked to light a fire under their butts, but you have to work smart and not make things overly complicated. Do the work and ask questions in class if you don\u2019t understand something. Chances are if you don\u2019t get it, someone else in class doesn\u2019t either. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings, Nearly everybody attending a public middle school in the United States is summarily elevated to high school the following year regardless of academic performance. Social promotion policies dictate that students are passed along to the next higher grade level until the fail to accumulate enough required and elective credits to earn a high school diploma. Having said that, no student who possesses even the most modest skill set has any business failing a middle school course. Struggling students in rigorous classes are easily transferred to a section with fewer expectations. For instance, a kid who is underperforming in \u201cHonors Algebra\u201d can be moved to \u201cMath 8\u201d without much schedule disruption. Best wishes for every success. Sincerely, AJG. ",
