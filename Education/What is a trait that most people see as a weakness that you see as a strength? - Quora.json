            "answer_text": "I\u2019m someone who bullies himself a lot. Not because I like bad mouthing a short guy standing in front of the mirror, but because I used to ignore all my flaws. After having a few people point this out, I began over-analyzing everything I do. One of the things I dislike the most about myself is how I hyper fixate on things. A subtle itch on my ankle? Not so subtle anymore, because now I\u2019m practically scratching the skin off that spot. My slightly crooked tooth that should be straight after having braces on-and-off for five years? Now I refuse to show my teeth anywhere near a camera. Okay, you get the picture. Anyways, this whole hyper-fixating-on-small-things ordeal is something that drives me pretty crazy. I feel like it\u2019s always just a burden. Recently, we were working on the layout for a painting we\u2019re going to do in art class. So far, I\u2019ve got a rough outline of a sandwich (because sandwiches are beautiful and deserve to have paintings dedicated to them):  Unlike how I quickly scribbled something down for this answer, I couldn\u2019t quit fussing over my actual outline. I kept erasing small things and trying to fix them, only to keep drawing the same thing over and over again, which only added to my frustration. \u201cDude,\u201d Jason snapped while grabbing my arm to stop the vigorous erasing, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna put a whole in the damn paper.\u201d \u201cWill you just-\u201d I said through clenched teeth while trying to pull my arm away. \u201cNo,\u201d he cut me off. \u201cI know how you get over stuff like this. Well, guess what? You\u2019ll never get that sandwich to look \u2018perfect\u2019.\u201d I groaned in annoyance, \u201cThank you for adding absolutely nothing to this conversation. Now, give me my arm back.\u201d Jason dropped my arm and let me get back to ruining a piece of paper. \u201cI will say,\u201d he started, \u201cthat effort is gonna really come in handy for math today. We\u2019re doing stuff with the protractor again, and Mr. B wants the answers to be exact.\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but that made me really happy. As someone who\u2019s always annoyed because of the need to be perfect at everything, having someone more or less say this was going to be good for a specific situation made me feel better. And you know what? I was the only person in my class that day who answered everything exactly how the teacher wanted. That was probably the only time that\u2019ll ever happen. Sincerely, Skylar ",

            "answer_text": "SILENCE When two people get into an argument and if, after a point of time, one of them chooses to remain silent it is assumed that that person is weaker and can\u2019t fight back. Speaking out of personal experience, if I happen to debate on a controversial or moral issue where am trying to put my views forward and if I see that the other person is so engrossed with themselves that they would not bother even hearing me out properly, I just retreat. More often than not, I see a smug expression on their face wherein they have assumed that since they have had the last word there, it is their point that stays and hence, they win. Silence is generally seen as a trait of a weak person, of somebody who is submissive and so timid that they are not capable of fighting back or standing up.But what most people don\u2019t know is that silence is the only mature way to sometimes deal with immaturity, that it is a tool you use knowing that the other person is not ready or capable yet of comprehending what you have to say, that if they pay attention they will realize that somebody\u2019s silence speaks a lot more than words, it baffles more than words and it strikes more than words. However, it is important to know when to remain silent and when to speak up in a determined manner. Music is always better than silence but silence is always better than noise. ",
