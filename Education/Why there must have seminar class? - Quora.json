            "answer_text": "FYI, I\u2019ve conducted seminars as a teacher and trainer. And I\u2019ve gone to them too. So I\u2019ve seen things from both sides.There are many factors that come into play to answer your question. One is how relevant the seminar is to your job, what you plan on doing, your business, etc. Another factor is who\u2019s running the seminar. So it is being run by somebody or a company that knows their stuff, has a good reputation, is legit, etc? Another important factor is how well the seminar is being run. So we have seminars that are extremely useful and enjoyable! We have those that are useful but not overly to our liking. And we have those which aren\u2019t useful to us at all. But wanting to learn more, grow, or become better are all good things. And reasons why many people attend seminars. ",

            "answer_text": "The importance of a seminar is that it is usually presented by the person who has actually done the work under discussion, or is the leader of the group in which it was done. This makes it possible to discuss the work in detail in a somewhat informal manner and to discuss aspects that would not normally appear in an academic paper on the work, such as experimental \u2018tricks\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Seminars are usually closely focused, and offer an opportunity to plunge deeply into a topic. Usually, they either fill in the gaps so you can understand the basics (especially helpful if you find yourself tackling a job you weren\u2019t expecting); or they fill you in on new research that won\u2019t be in the textbooks yet. They will also often offer you chances to ask questions and get direct, immediate answers, and they will help you to expand your network. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Poorna, Preparing for a seminar is like to preparing food. You need to get exact ingredients for the recipe and add them in an order with sufficient quantity (if quantity of ingredients is less or more it spoils the taste of food ) , then check the taste and be confident on your chef skills and serve it, then an appreciation for the food from others give you a feel and energy and confidence that you are capable of doing something. In the same way , for preparing seminar you need the exact content for the topic you need to present and prepare it in an order with valuable stuff which is more key points of that topic, and keep it in a simple and sweet ..Finally present it in a way that you need the listeners grab all the information you provided. It makes you so confident while you speak in front of people , it makes you creative while you prepare it , it makes you to think and opens your mind while you search for the content of the topic. I hope you got it. All the best!! Regards, Akhil ",
