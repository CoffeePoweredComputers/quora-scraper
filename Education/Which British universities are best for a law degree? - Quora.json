            "answer_text": "There are a couple of factors here; what type of degree and who you want to work for. Many of the older firms and chambers still have a preference for an Oxbridge bachelors degree. This is slowly coming round but certain specialties such as intellectual property are focused to a few elite universities. If you are studying a postgraduate diploma in law (GDL) then most places will be good as long as you can fit the study hours around work. For an LLM, pick a university that caters to your interest. An LLM tends to be specialised so universities will have different subjects. A good example is maritime law or technology law. In most instances as long as the uni offers a qualifying law degree then it doesn't matter to the majority of recruiters. ",
