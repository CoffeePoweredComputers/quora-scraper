            "answer_text": "Yes, it already has. The cause, however, is more complicated than marriage. If you read Herrnstein, R. J., & Murray, C. (1994). The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life. New York: Free Press, you will see that one of the primary topics of analysis and discussion is the partitioning of society, based on intelligence. Assortative mating is based on intelligence and traits that vary with intelligence. Here is what Jensen had to say about it: The spouse correlation is of interest here because it is the assortative matingcoefficient, and assortative mating on a particular trait adds to the populationvariance of the genotypes for that trait in the offspring generation. The amountof increase in the population variance depends on the degree of assortativemating in the population, which for IQ is a spouse correlation of about +.40.It is worth noting that IQ has a higher spouse correlation than any other behavioral trait and is higher than for most physical traits. (For instance, the spousecorrelation is about +.30 for height; it is zero for fingerprint ridge-count.) Ifthere were no assortative mating for whatever is measured by IQ, the populationvariance of IQ would be decreased by about 10 to 15 percent. source: Page 183 of Jensen, A. R. (1998). The g factor: The science of mental ability. Westport, CT: Praeger. This relatively small study shows the factors that relate to mate selection: Many evolutionary psychology studies have addressed the topic of mate preferences, focusing particularly on gender and cultural differences. However, the extent to which situational and environmental variables might affect mate preferences has been comparatively neglected. We tested 288 participants in order to investigate the perceived relative importance of six traits of an ideal partner (wealth, dominance, intelligence, height, kindness, attractiveness) under four different hypothetical scenarios (status quo/nowadays, violence/post-nuclear, poverty/resource exhaustion, prosperity/global wellbeing). An equal number of participants (36 women, 36 men) was allotted to each scenario; each was asked to allocate 120 points across the six traits according to their perceived value. Overall, intelligence was the trait to which participants assigned most importance, followed by kindness and attractiveness, and then by wealth, dominance and height.

PLoS ONE 8(9): e74282. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0074282 One of the most important aspects of social partitioning is socioeconomic status (SES), which is the obvious factor underlying how people partition themselves in religious denominations, neighborhoods, clubs, sports, universities selected, etc. In fact, most of what we see as human activity is partitioned by SES. The dominant cause of SES is intelligence. The most cited study of the cause of SES is Jencks, C. (1979). Who gets ahead? The determinants of economic success in America. New York: Basic Books. He studied brothers, who were reared together and found that, as adults, the brother with the higher IQ statistically had the higher SES. This was important, since their environments were effectively the same. For a detailed discussion of why SES (using other studies) is caused by IQ, see Jensen, A. R. (1998). The g factor: The science of mental ability. Westport, CT: Praeger. In that text, Jensen shows that SES is the product of IQ, not the cause of it. Low SES parents are statistically low IQ parents. Because IQ is essentially determined by genes, the low SES parents have mostly low IQ children. Because of the relatively high assortive mating (spouses having similar IQs), the low IQ children form low IQ/low SES families and have more low IQ children, etc. The cycle goes on and on, while the reverse happens among higher SES/IQ families. Social and reproductive behaviors are complex. The most detailed way to model and understand them is by structural equation modeling. When this is done, various factors are linked in a path diagram. Often there are links in both directions between two factors. This may happen between SES and IQ, meaning that there is some SES influence on IQ, even though the greater influence is from IQ to SES. On a worldwide basis, more intelligent people are statistically more powerful, wealthy, educated, and socially separated from the rest of society. But this effect is continuous, covering all levels of intelligence. Low IQ people are more likely to marry similarly dull spouses and continue the partitioning and SES standing, as explained above.

            "answer_text": "Q. Will the fact that highly educated and intelligent people tend to get married to each other nowadays and are more likely to have intelligent kids who they push towards their goals lead to a class system based on intelligence? A bedtime story -One time in near future, the resources of the earth become scarce. Mankind has to decide how to change living style before everybody meets famine and disaster. Human population cannot be increased indefinitely and people cannot use whatever they wish as before. So they need to decide something for the future. -They have to decide about the living life of mankind on earth by spending expenditures as little as possible without affecting the present living standard of mankind. After meeting many times, the mankind knows that the present knowledge and technology is sufficient enough for the future life and living standard of mankind. No further advanced knowledge and technology is needed for existence. If mankind can maintain the existing technology, it is alright for mankind and the earth. So mankind decides to remove the education system for all children. They just need certain amount of children with genius and high I.Q for those maintenance and just giving education to those children is more economical. As for other children, they can be raised and educated at home by existing advanced technology without extra spending. When they become adult, they can work in society by servicing, by entertaining with dancing, singing, painting, writing essay, story, novel, poetry, song, playing music, performing arts, sports. Those skills can be taught at home or privately without spending huge amount of money. The people can choose whatever one likes according to one\u2019s talent. -Then they end the pregnancy of male embryo. The mankind doesn\u2019t need any more male sex for further generation. Technology for being pregnant without the help of male human is already there. And the people reason that most of the problems, wars, conflicts in human world are started by males. In recent generations, female population dominates the important position of the companies, government agencies and it also demonstrates that females can not only handle the conflicts of the world affairs but also better than male counterparts by ending with peaceful situations. But the most important problem is the changing attitudes on role of women by the other opposite sex. When the human world is dominated by men in the past, almost all of the human affairs are decided by men and all the conditions are decidedly favored for men. The most important positions in the organizations are dominated by men. Even at the start of life, the boys are more favored the girls. The family names are chosen from father\u2019s name despite the fact that pregnancies are carried by women and real mother is clearer than real father from the start. The families are dominated by the fathers due to their money finding power rather than the facts that mothers take care and raise the children and the family life. As the mankind advances, more and more women get education and dominate the key position of organizations and records show women\u2019s decisions result more peaceful, fairer and less wasteful outcomes. The conflict for role of sex appears. In the previous traditional family role, men dominate in the house. Now the women dominate in the house and workplace and leadership. The later part of human history is filled with (physical or mental) battles between male and female sexes. The last straw for men is the technology of making embryo without the need of two sexes. One can make the embryo with only one sex (men or women) cheaply but the pregnancy without uterus (womb) is extremely expensive and not successful in most of the time. So the female sex comes out as a clear winner in the long term. During the moment like scarce resources to choose for one sex, the decision becomes more clear. So it can be predicted that male sex will almost disappeared from the earth in decades because almost all of the pregnancies are female embryos, with a few exceptions. -To maintain the population of geniuses, the mankind has to make future generation of some males with extraordinary abilities from existing male population. The mankind finds out that there are some geniuses in technology who show the talent since young in every generation. Mankind needs to maintain that population by making the embryos with exactly same genes of these people. It is no problems for genius women because they will become girl embryos. But for the genius men, the mankind must make boy embryos to make exact replica. So it is the very reason that the mankind also needs to bear some male embryos in the future. -So it is decided that all the available DNA sequences of genes of previous men with great achievements in science and technology will be made into clone embryos for future generation. -The needed amount of persons for maintenance of present existing technology will be enough by finding out genius children among the future generation. According to record, incidence of spontaneous appearance of genius persons among human births will be enough. -So the goal is set. The technology is already there. It only needs to change a little from the present condition for the future. After decades, the mankind finds out something is terribly wrong with what they plan. - -The genius children with science and technology talent do appear among the random embryos but the incidence of random appearing becomes less and less in successive generations. Instead, the incidence of genius children with arts, sports among children become more and more in successive generations. As for the cloning of genius children from the previous generations, the people with similar physical structures with previous genius persons grow up without genius part. In other words, the clones of genius people only become ordinary people. -Then the latest development is that one of the richest and the most powerful woman in the world plans to leave her legacy behind with a lot of her clones. She is perfect in every way. She is the one of the most beautiful women in the world. Her I.Q is within the range of top 5%. So if she wants to make clones, there\u2019s no problem for mankind in theory. So when she wants to make thousands of clones at her own expense, it only needs volunteers for carrying the embryos. There are enough women willing to do for her. So the number is set at five thousand pregnancies at least. But every pregnancy is not successful. Some end with spontaneous abortion. The reason? No one knows really. But most of the pregnancies are successful as normal births. So the mankind gets the much needed talented people. That\u2019s what the mankind thinks. But the reality is what the mankind does not expect. - -After those clones grow up, their IQ and personalities are revealed slowly. They are the exact replica of their mother in physical structure. But majorities are in average IQ range with no special talents. Some of the remaining clones showed high IQ but their personalities are diverse. Some are aggressive, some are easy going, some are strict, some are extrovert, some introvert, and some are flexible and have sense of humor. Their interests and talents are also diverse. Some have talent in science, math, some in arts or sports. The rest of clones show shocking results. They have below average IQ. Some have autistic characters, some are Aspergers. Those results make mankind confused. The strange thing is that compared to incidence of those traits with general population at that time, there is no statistically significant. -The mother cannot accept the result. She reasons that they were carried by different pregnant mothers, so their differences were due to different environment during pregnancy period. So she does another cloning work. When all of her children reach 18 years old, they have to play the role of surrogate mother with clone embryo of their mother. Decades after the birth of second generation clones, the result shows again that their differences in personality, characters, IQ also appear like the general population again. So the mankind finally realizes that their line of thinking has some problems in somewhere, but they cannot find out yet. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. - - Rise in autism 'may be linked to clever parents' Scientists are testing the theory that intelligent parents are fuelling the rise in the number of autistic children.Nov 2011A team of researchers at Cambridge University is exploring the link between high-achieving parents, such as engineers, scientists and computer programmers, and the development of their children.Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at the university, said there were signs that adults who work in science and maths-based jobs were more likely to have autistic children.\"A clear test of the hypothesis will enable us to test if couples who are both strong systemisers, for example, those who studied and works in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineerings and maths) and other fields related to systemising, are more likely to have a child with an autism spectrum diagnosis than couples where only one is a strong systemiser, or where neither is,\" he said.The study will involve recruiting graduates to survey the development of their children along with the subject studied at university to test the theory, which has already been highlighted in other research.In 2001, a report found mathematicians had higher rates of autism than other professions. A study in 1997 found the children and grandchildren of engineers were more likely to be autistic.From Rise in autism 'may be linked to clever parents' - Telegraph - Please see the answer Cheng Tien Pao's answer to How is human intelligence inherited? - - Another bedtime story -In future, the scientists successfully discover the sequence of genetic arrangement causing intelligence. Actually, they find that half of people with that specific genetic arrangement have high IQ and another half of those people have average IQ. Further studies confirm that there are specific epigenetic changes (i.e., attachment of methyl groups into specific gene locations) making those people to have high IQ. -The good news is that science can make those specific epigenetic changes to these genes by inserting nanobots (very small robots) into human body and attach the methyl groups to those specific genes. So the first step is to find who has that sequence of genes. The good news is most of human beings have those gene sequence. The next step is to attach methyl groups to genes. It needs money. It is estimated that five millions dollars will be needed to attach methyl groups and maintain those changes for the whole life of a human being. It also needs to start from young age. So it has to commercialize the whole service. If one has the money, he will get that service. So a lot of rich people plan to give that service to their children because they can afford it. -After 50 years later, scientists look back the service and analyze the results. Among those people who get the service, only a small percentage of people can maintain those epigenetic changes and those people also choose the academic and science research as their career in their adult life. Large percentage of people who get service cannot maintain those epigenetic changes and they need a lot of repairing to attach back methyl groups all the time. Those people are enjoying their whole life with so-called upper class entertainments all the time because their families are rich and never intend to use their intelligence for further use. Their IQ are fluctuated all the times. Later the servicing company which is making attachment of methyl group to specific genes all the time goes bankrupt. -At the same time in the Asia, there is a country which is actually a capitalist society but pretends to be a communist one. The scientists in that country announce the result of 50 years research. As soon as the scientists found out the genetic sequences of intelligence, the scientists in that Asia country checked the newborns in their countries whether they had the desired genetic sequences. After selecting the children with desired genetic sequences, the scientists gave them special education classes in their student days. Actually, it is the ruthless, heartless teaching method supervised by cruel, abusive teachers and parents in the eyes of developed advanced society. Their rate of teaching is double that of ordinary students. If ordinary students need 12 years of schooling before university, those selected students only need 6 years. After 50 years, that country already has 5 millions of such people (resulting from experiment). (That country is very big and very populated.) -And majority of those people achieve their goals. Only a small percentage of those people drop out of the experiment or made suicide themselves. When the genetic structure of those people are examined at the end of research, the scientists find out that desired epigenetic changes (attachment of methyl groups in specific genetic sequences) are present in those people without using of nanobots. -When that news reach to the Western developed nations, the leaders and scientists there criticize the method. How can the civilized societies follow such a cruel method? They rather improve the nanobot method for the sake of children - the future leaders of their world - than to abuse them with that cruel method!!!!!!!!!!!!! - - Child prodigy in piano playing -In psychology research literature, the term child prodigy is defined as person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert performer. Child prodigies are rare, and in some domains there are no child prodigies at all. Prodigiousness in childhood does not always predict adult eminence. (From Wikipedia) -Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child, and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures. Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role, many times in obvious ways. -In child prodigy, there were many children talented in piano playing. They were recognized for piano playing ability since very young. Among them, many of them lost interest in piano playing in adulthood. Some of them continued to play in concert and are still famous as gifted piano players in later life. A small portion of them became famous composers in addition to gifted piano playing. What is certain is that those who continue to become musicians are devoting significant amount of time in practicing piano playing besides their in born talent of piano playing. It means they need a lot of practice to maintain the piano playing ability. -If someone is not a piano prodigy and if he is interested in playing piano, he has to do a lot of practice and needs a lot of years to become a professional piano player. -So what is the nature of child prodigy in piano playing? It is not due to inheritance from genetic traits because many of them have no talented piano players in their previous generations. Some said it is due to in-born trait (like just lucky brain development which makes one easy in learning piano playing). -In a book called the power of habit written by Charles Duhigg, there is a chapter about a man called Eugene Pauly who got viral encephalitis and it destroyed part of brain and made him permanent loss of the recent memory. He could remember his past, his previous experiences very well. But he could not remember what happened each and every moment after viral encephalitis. When he met a stranger and he was introduced to that man and made conversation with him for a time, he couldn't remember that particular man when he met again him later that day. He didn't even remember what he did an hour ago. After watching a particular TV program, when someone made him watch that again, he would watch that program as if entirely new to him. So he could not form recent memory and remote memory starting from the time of viral encephalitis. -When he was discharged from hospital, he and his wife moved into a new house with new environment. His doctors warned his wife not to get lose him. His wife took him on a walk outside their home, always together and always along the same route everyday for a period of time. But one day, Eugene went out without his wife and he returned safely later. When he was asked, he didn\u2019t know whether he went out along and how he walked back home without losing his way. (\u2026\u2026. It was clear to Squire (The scientist who made research on Eugene) that Eugene was absorbing new information. But where inside his brain was that information residing? How could someone find his way home when he had no idea which house was his? How were new patterns forming inside Eugene\u2019s damaged brain?To test if Eugene was forming new habits, Squire devised an experiment. He took sixteen different objects\u2014bits of plastic and brightly colored pieces of toys\u2014and glued them to cardboard rectangles. He then divided them into eight pairs: choice A and choice B. In each pairing, one piece of cardboard, chosen at random, had a sticker placed on the bottom that read \u201ccorrect.\u201dEugene was seated at a table, given a pair of objects, and asked to choose one. Next, he was told to turn over his choice to see if there was a \u201ccorrect\u201d sticker underneath. This is a common way to measure memory. Since there are only sixteen objects, and they are always presented in the same eight pairings, most people can memorize which item is \u201ccorrect\u201d after a few rounds.Eugene couldn\u2019t remember any of the \u201ccorrect\u201d items, no matter how many times he did the test. He repeated the experiment twice a week for months, looking at forty pairings each day.But as the weeks passed, Eugene\u2019s performance improved. After twenty-eight days of training, Eugene was choosing the \u201ccorrect\u201d object 85 percent of the time. At thirty-six days, he was right 95 percent of the time. After one test, Eugene looked at the researcher, bewildered by his success.\u201cHow am I doing this?\u201d he asked her.The experiments demonstrated that Eugene had the ability to form new habits, even when they involved tasks or objects he couldn\u2019t remember for more than a few seconds. This explained how Eugene managed to go for a walk every morning.Excerpt from the power of habit by Charles Duhigg) - -Suppose that Eugene is able to remember what he does for one day and forgets on the second day. Suppose he has never used bow and arrow in his whole life. Suppose we train him to shoot a target with bow and arrow everyday. He will wake up everyday and he will feel that he has never practiced shooting a target with bow and arrow previously, his arrow shooting skill will get better and better day by day. And finally one day, he will very surprised to find himself that although he feels that he has never shot and practiced arrow shooting in the past, he can shoot straight into target nearly every time he makes attempts. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of arrow shooting. -Just like above example, suppose that we train Eugene to play piano likewise, ..................\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. -And finally one day, he will very surprised to find that although he has never learned to play the piano in the past (so he thought), he finds out that he can play the piano very well. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of piano playing. -Just like above example, suppose a human being is interested in music and learns to play the piano his/her whole life and he/she can play the piano very well finally. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she can play piano very well since very young. People will be surprised about his/her in-born skill in piano playing. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 -Just like above example, suppose a human being is interested in (one particular subject) and learns and study (one particular subject) his/her whole life and he/she knows, understand (one particular subject) very well finally.
