Parents and kids change schools or go to other schools because something is not available at their regular school. A child of mine had a recommendation from her swim coach. He knew her 2 years. Her previous coach passed away after 10 years\u2026. The old coach was her year round coach and high school swim coach. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Who are your other recommenders? In the details, your teacher is only tutoring you. They can only view you academically which would show on your transcript, not as a character reference. It would be a weak recommendation. If you look at the selection criteria, recommenders are telling the university what you bring to the table if you were admitted. Saying that you had a tutor does not answer this question. To get an idea of what the university is looking for, see College essays, the last and most important step in an undergraduate application where I use MIT selection criteria as an example. Although this is about graduate admissions, I also recommend that you have your recommenders read Advice to Graduate School Recommendation Letter Writers that will show them how to write a letter of recommendation. Bottom line: When you ask someone to write a letter of recommendation, you should give them the selection criteria. ",
