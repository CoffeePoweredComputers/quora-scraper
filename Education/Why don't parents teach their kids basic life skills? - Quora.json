            "answer_text": "Many do, some don\u2019t, and many do but the kid tunes out. I have seen some abysmal parenting, though, and studied the behavior of the parents as well as that of their offspring. Some parents mean well, but simply deem their children too helpless to master certain skills (i.e. a parent who does his own tax returns, but insists on doing his children\u2019s tax returns when they start working, \u201cso that they don\u2019t make a mistake\u201d. My Dad, by contrast, told me to do my own first tax return, then show it to him so he could see how I did. I\u2019ve done my own taxes - and those of a few others - ever since, and made only one goof, on my own return, where I forgot to mention an IRA contribution.). Some probably mean well, but are too lazy or hypocritical, and thus set a terrible example. And some are just mind-blowingly bad, apparently having kids so they could use them as accomplices in crime, train them to misbehave so they can defend the bad behavior, force them to enter pageants or play sports they don\u2019t enjoy so the parents can vicariously get the trophies they thought they were supposed to get, or just haul off and beat or neglect their children. That last category makes me seriously consider the merits of sterilization. Even when the parents do teach their children life skills, and do so gradually and effectively so the children learn and master them, things can go wrong. My parents were not taught to address anyone as \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d, and I\u2019ve found that my own interactions would probably go more smoothly if I\u2019d been raised with that habit, which I of course was not. And in the case of getting medical treatment in the USA, nothing can be done. Whatever my parents figured out is completely obsolete within the year. Even receptionists at hospitals and health-care provider agencies cannot give one accurate instruction on what one must do, as whatever they were trained to say is no longer valid. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the parents do not indulge in teaching per se, meaning now a days \u2018telling; or advising is not received well. But children do learn from the parents though not as much as the previous generations. Some of the old norms do not hold I guess. For example, Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Most of the jobs are flexi time and trans time zones and today\u2019s children are watching their parents tune themselves to various time zones and languages. You tell them to go out and play, they prefer to play on the laptop or mobile and join a Gym to build their body, may be take help of a trainer or use a YouTube video for guidance\u2026 and so on. The parents have provided an environment in which children can experiment, explore and experience. Talking about interpersonal skills, the children are comfortable on the whatsapp, facebook and physical human interactions are much less than before\u2026 The future generations will have to identify the new life skills for the emerging future!
