            "answer_text": "I hate to say it, but be careful about articles that will cause the school district or the staff personal/professional embarrassment. Sure you may envision yourself as a crusader against injustice and you want to expose corruption and lies in the administration. Word to the wise: Leave that for professional reporters. That is their job. You are still a student and like it or not, your future is in their hands. So, be careful on what and how you write as long as you are vulnerable to them. Then, once you are a graduate and now in COLLEGE journalism class, blast the high school crooks out of the water. You could write it as a college assignment. You could even submit it to the old high school newspaper and request they print it. There may be a student editor then who doesn\u2019t care about his future. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say almost anything that interests or concerns you: teachers, class size, homework (pro or con, amount, purpose, benefit), required courses, sports, cell phones in class, dress code, field trips, cafeteria food, drugs or other illegal substances, college preparedness, current events and their relevance to students, violence on campus, campus shootings (reactions to recent shootings in the news, such as Parkland, FL). There are many more topics, but I hope this gives you some inspiration. Good luck on your article! ",
