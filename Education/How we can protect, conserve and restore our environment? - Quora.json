            "answer_text": "First off, people need to stop lying or exaggerating about something that could either be or not be a problem.. That helps absolutely nothing.. Secondly, we need to find out the true facts and have answers to basic questions about a problem.. Knowing the basic information about the environment gives us a specific solution to fix it or leave it alone.. (You don't clean up all the plastic in the oceans by spilling oil all over the place) Lastly, we need to weigh the dangers of acting to fix a problem that might not exist with a solution that would definitely harm the environment.. (Most times it is the solution that does the harm) ",

The obvious fact is that we are the part of that \u201cenvironment\u201d - we are not separated from it. Crazy ideas about options of such possible separation - cosmic flights and programs to settle on Mars - are only prove it - separation impossible. Then, when you deeply realize that you and life around has same source - problem will disappears. Only wrong stupid approach to explore something apart from Life leads us to current point, changing of that direction will leads us to the light!  ",
