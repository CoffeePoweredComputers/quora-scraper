            "answer_text": "First up, thank you Anonymous for asking me to answer this question. Why are the universities like Harvard and Cambridge world class? Is it because they are very old? Or Is it because they are located in well developed countries? Or Is it because they receive huge amounts of funding? I would say NO. Even we have universities that are centuries old, Universities that are equipped with state of the art facilities and Universities that receive decent amount of funding when compared with Harvard and Cambridge. But why aren't our universities world class? The thing is we don't appreciate them enough! Let's take an example - a guy 'X' from India wants to get into the premier institute of our country and so he decides to work his butt off during his higher secondary years so that he can clear the entrance exam. After getting into the institute the guy either becomes lazy or a mugging up machine and ends up with a decent score. He in the meantime prepares for GRE/TOEFL/GMAT/CAT/GATE/UPSC or other such exams and tries to clear them, once he clears and joins the desired stream he decides that he has had enough of learning and starts to think of a life in luxury. This is applicable for 75% of us! We tend to do something that is not entirely of our interest. Our students prepare for exam after exam and lose their interest in gaining knowledge and the coaching centres are not helping either. Now if the same guy 'X' is from one of the developed countries, he won't do that! This is a major reason for our institutes not being world class. If you ask a person to choose the best among IISc and MIT, that person would definitely choose MIT because of a common misconception that U.S. universities are the best. We can't completely blame them either. Each and every institute around the world is famous only because of their achievements and their students. In India, students do not try to join the IITs or the IISc to gain knowledge most of the times, they just think of it as another step to aide them in achieving their dream life. The education scenario needs to change in our country so that people will fall in love with learning! Not even in a single country other than ours you will find engineering trolled so much! But still many people choose it! Why? The teaching scenario is also completely different here. We still believe in spoon feeding the students rather than letting them to experience it on their own. We should just guide them in the right path based on their interest The huge mistake we have done till date is to believe and let our students study in the coaching institutes that promise us some XYZ rank in some exam! They just make us even more prone to getting sick of learning. There is no value or opportunity to self - learn! Firstly we should have faith in our institutions only then they will develop. Everything done in our country is based on Supply and Demand. Encourage the students to learn a lot and that too at their own pace so that they can identify their passion and pursue it! Once all this happens we can compare those institutions with ours! Everything needs to be compared on a fair basis, right? ; ) Jai Hind! ",

            "answer_text": "The necessary condition for establishing Prestigious institute like Oxford and Harvard, Cambridge , would be to have bright students and excellent faculty members and the sufficient condition would be to have the continuous influx of Fund I believe that India satisfy the very necessary condition for if that wasn\u2019t the case , CEO of google and Microsoft wouldn\u2019t have been Sundar Pichai and Sataya Nadella respectively. Now we will address Why does India fails to satisfy the sufficient condition. The reason is simple. There is hierarchy of priority for allotting fund in India. The Universities comes at the bottom in terms of priority. I wouldn\u2019t go into detail rather would like to illustrate for some chosen sector. (The reason being these sector gain more media attraction. ) Defence. India invest 2.25%[1] of the GDP in defence ,whereas it invest only 0.88%[2] of it\u2019s GDP in R & D (Just compare the Investment in R and D to other countries .) The recent example is the Agni V. The cost per unit is INR250m to 350INR [3] . Surprisingly this cost is equal (approximately)to endowment made in a IISER[4] Vote Bank Indian political parties do realize that investing huge money in sector like Research institute will not attract majority of the people simply because they don\u2019t love long term gain,They would love short terms gain or the sector they would directly benefit from. Example are mid day meal ,MNREGA etc. The recent example would be the Shivaji\u2019s Statue. The Fund allotted to the Shivaji Statue is more [5] than total endowment made in 5 IISER\u2019s More importantly the fund allotted to Indian universities( say IISER\u2019s ) is very much low as compared to Prestigious Institutes like Oxford [6] . Apart from these , India also has to think of basic requirement like water ,transport , Food ,Health care etc before Investing into Indian Universities. So as a consequence , India fails to satisfy the sufficient condition to have a prestigious University like Oxford. Edits Here I haven\u2019t criticized any government or any particular political parties rather have put general views through facts and in order to make it simple I have been less general while illustrating ( have chosen a particular University for comparison ).
