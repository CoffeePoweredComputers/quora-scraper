            "answer_text": "No of course not. Socialism is not a single institution; it is a system or set of interrelated processes and institutions. The institutions and processes that make up a socialist system cannot be abstracted away from the overarching system they are components in. While educational institutions would implicitly be public or collective in a socialist system, they would exist and operate within the context and needs of a broader socialist economy. In capitalism public education mainly serves to facilitate the economy and business activity (the supply of labor and development of human capital) as a public good; it therefore exists as a component in a capitalist system and not as a component of a non-capitalist economy. It is also important to recognize that an educated population generates positive externalities irrespective of the economic system in question. Public provision and financing of education has nothing to do with socialism which is principally about the ownership of the means of producing wealth by the entire community so that said public wealth is remitted to benefit to the entire population. This is an entirely different concept independent of public goods and the rationale for providing public goods as a government service. ",

There is the Profit Corporate Private School, Not for profit Catholic parochial or other religious school, or not for profit private or state charter school. These schools are being given PUBLIC money intended for PUBLIC schools. Why are we concerned about whether the schools are socialist? we pay for them in our taxes, but they are socialist in that anyone can go, and they are intended for the education and betterment of society. Is that Socialism? I say the private schools are Elitist, and possibly racist, thus undemocratic. ",

The few elite decide the fate of millions. Decisions that should be made by millions of people in daily transactions are made by know it all education bureaucracy. It is a complete failure. The only reason compulsory gov. schools exist today is because the government forces tax payers to fund unworkable systems. Gov schools would be gone in a generation if there was a free market in education. ",
