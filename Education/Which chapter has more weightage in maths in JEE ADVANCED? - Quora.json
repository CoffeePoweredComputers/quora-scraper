            "answer_text": "JEE Advanced Mathematics Syllabus with weightage is a crucial tool that can be used to prepare smartly in order to score better. Students who are aware of the topics being asked regularly can focus accordingly. Chapter-wise weightage is important in getting a clear idea about where to concentrate your efforts. I have divided all the chapters of Maths into 4 units for better understanding. Algebra - 35.00 marksCalculus - 32.67 marksCoordinate Geometry - 25.33 marksTrigonometry - 7.00 marksChapter-wise weightage Binomial Theorem - 3 marks Complex Numbers - 7 marks Coordinate Geometry - 18 marks Differential & Integral Calculus - 38 marks Probability - 9 marks Quadratic Equation - 3 marks Permutation & Combination - 3 marks Matrices - 14 marks Sequence & Series - 3 marks Trigonometry - 10 marks Vector & 3D - 11 marks Fundamentals of Mathematics - 5 marks ",

            "answer_text": "JEE Advanced focuses on a lot of topics. All topics are important. The most important ones include:  1)Conic Sections,3-D geometry and Vector Algebra (Analytic geometry) - This is one of the most difficult topics in maths and they like asking difficult,time consuming question from this topic. 2)Calculus-Limits,differentiation, integration etc. This is one of the major chunks of the maths syllabus. Very important. Definitely , questions come from this topic every year. 3)Trignometry- Again ,a very important topic. 4)Probability,Matrices and Binomial Theorem - These topics are important and useful for engineering ,so questions can be expected from them. 5)Algebra and Complex analysis -  Another big chunk of the syllabus. They like asking questions related to logarithm,quadratic eqns, sequences and series etc.  Complex analysis is also important ,especially with respect to geometric interpretation of complex numbers. However, where the maths paper is deadly ,is when they combine questions from different topics to give more complex questions. So all topics are important. The topics listed here are from my opinion of what is important. Hope this helps. ",
