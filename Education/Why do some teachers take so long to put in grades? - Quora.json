            "answer_text": "The other answers here are correct. I\u2019m only going to add two more possibilities, both of which are true in my school: They\u2019re waiting for students who didn\u2019t turn in the work to turn it in. This way they can grade and comment on the whole pile at once. This is also why some teachers take a long time to return assignments. We don\u2019t want to return a graded assignment when there are still students who haven\u2019t done the assignment. It\u2019s like handing out the right answers to their friends.If your\u200b school has an online gradebook that you or your parents can check any time, it doesn\u2019t mean that the teacher uses just that gradebook. They may have a traditional paper gradebook that they use first. Then they input all of the grades online in one big sitting. There are a few reasons to do this, but I do it this way because it keeps students and parents from complaining about their grades every single day. I input grades online every few weeks, in big chunks. Then brace for a day of complaints, then move on with teaching.",

            "answer_text": "While both of the answers here are pretty legitimate, I\u2019ll add another few wrinkles to it. Subject matters: Multiple choice tests are easy. Heck, sometimes they even auto-posted in this day and age. Essays are the opposite.Time of year matters: At certain times of year, a great many other educational obligations loom. Towards the end of the year, teachers are often required to fill out lots of paperwork about student progress for special programs. That takes away from grading.Priorities: Ask me if I\u2019d rather grade or spend time talking with my students, helping them work through a challenging assignment, or checking on their general well-being.Priorities, revisited: I love teaching. It\u2019s my job and my passion. I love my family more. When I leave the school, I\u2019m a father. I don\u2019t teach, grade, or answer educational emails outside of the school day. I don\u2019t apologize for that. I don\u2019t even eat lunch with other teachers, so I don\u2019t waste time at work. When I go home, though, I am focused on MY children, not yours.That last in particular may not be popular in some circles, but I don\u2019t think many other folks would approve if their jobs forced them to ignore their families night after night. I\u2019m well aware some people take jobs with that asterisk, and that\u2019s fine for them. I didn\u2019t, and I never hide that in interviews. Somehow I\u2019m still being hired, so I guess my point of view there isn\u2019t so radical after all. ",
