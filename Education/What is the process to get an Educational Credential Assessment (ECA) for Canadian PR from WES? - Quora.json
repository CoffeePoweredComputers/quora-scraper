            "answer_text": "For everyone asking questions on WES. Steps for WES ECA evaluation for Canada Immigration purpose, important points and some more info.(a lot of info, so going to be a long post) Before you start just check following things: 1. Website: World Education Services Canada: International Credential Evaluation Please please go through the website and make yourself familiar with navigation. You will get most of your answers there. Don't start asking questions before going through information posted on website. Its for your own good to get first hand information before listening to other people. ***Always make sure you are on Canada website not USA one. you can see that on top right corner of Website where a flag is listed with country name or in website address with \"/ca\" listed in address.*** 2. Degree equivalency tool Degree Equivalency Tool WES has free tool to check equivalency of your degree to Canadian degree. Don't rely completely on this as the final assessment always depends on the actual evaluation but it will give you an idea and a head start. If your degree is not listed there it doesn't mean it wont be equivalent to anything, you will get to know that in real assessment. ***If you are not sure after using the tool, if your degree/college will be valid for ECA through WES try to email/ WES to check or ask if anyone had same degree evaluated before. That might help you little bit in the case where your degree/ college is not valid and save you some money, you can check other designated organizations for your ECA then.*** 3. Required Documents Required Documents - World Education Services Check what documents you need for your evaluation here. If you don't have those in hand just start collecting those. Get your transcripts from your university or any other document listed as per your education. You can also ask your university if they can mail your transcripts directly to WES, you can use \"Academic records request form\" given on website for this. Check if your University needs their own form filled too for releasing your documents.(do this after you get your WES reference number as you will need that in case you are giving the address of WES to university for mailing your transcripts, In case you are taking your transcripts yourself for mailing, you can get reference number later too). ***Make sure your transcripts are valid. Transcripts must show: all subjects taken, grades received for each subject, and for each year you were in the program. Semester wise transcripts are not valid for evaluation. Transcripts should be sealed and signed with a stamp from university.*** ***If your University does not give subject-wise Transcript, Ask if you can get all your mark sheets attested from University, and they will sign and stamp all photocopies and put them in one envelope and seal them with stamp like transcripts. That is mostly called document verification in University.*** 4. Check how will you pay your fees. Credit card/ Money order/ Western Union or in case any other option listed in instructions. Check it out. Fee is approximately $225-$230(including taxes) in Canadian currency. Rest depends on what additional services you chose for delivery etc. Cheapest courier option is $7. ECA - World Education Services Next steps: 1. Create a WES account. World Education Services Canada: International Credential Evaluation Click \"Apply now\", then click on \"Canada\", Then \"ECA application for IRCC\" and proceed with further steps. ***Make sure you choose ECA application for IRCC not the other option.*** Fill up your details in all pages very carefully and correctly. You will have to provide a recipient address, give your address there. When you will proceed it will automatically generate \"Recipient 2\" as IRCC. Don't worry about that one, it is used for electronic delivery of your records to IRCC when you put your WES report number while filling your express entry profile. 2. Pay your fees 3. Reference number will be generated.(This will be used in all your communications with WES) ***Once you submit your profile and reference number is generated you cannot edit your information so do not be in haste, check carefully and then submit.*** ***Your reference number is not ECA report number. You can't use it in Express entry profile. It is only used for communication with WES. When your evaluation is completed and you get your ECA report it will have your ECA number which you will mention in Express Entry application.*** 4. Read all instructions on what documents to send and at which address. *** Put your reference number on all your transcript envelops(at an empty space, not on the seal or signature or anywhere on flaps) and backside of your degree photocopies. I will suggest using a pencil not a pen for that as sometimes pen ink leaks through paper.*** ***You can put all your documents in one big/ master envelope and send to WES. No need to mail everything separately. Make sure again to put your reference number with WES address on the packet.*** ***Do not send any original document to WES unless asked specifically with instructions that they will return it after evaluation.*** 5. you can check status of your application by logging in your WES account. It will show once they have received your documents, your evaluation report will take up to 20 days after your documents are received. Be patient. ***If you are using tracking with your courier and it shows your documents delivered but WES account doesn't show received don't panic. It takes up to a week for WES to update receiving of documents.*** 6. Once your evaluation is completed you most probably will receive an email. You can find pdf copy of your report by logging in your WES account. ***Check your report that everything is correctly mentioned.*** ***No need to wait for hard copy of your report for Express entry if you have got pdf version in your account. It is same and have your report number on it which you can use for express entry profile.*** ***Your ECA is valid for 5 years.*** Note: Do not ask any question if you have not read entire post. If the information is already posted here just check it out. I am no expert but will try to answer any question which I haven't answered here if and only I am sure about that. Will also edit the post and add the point. If I have posted anything wrong feel free to mention and I will edit the post. Good Luck. Cheers. ",
