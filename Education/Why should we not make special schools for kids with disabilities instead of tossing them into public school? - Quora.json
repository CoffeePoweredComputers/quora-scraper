            "answer_text": "We do. Those schools do still exist. Given the option between \u201ctossing them\u201d in public school and sending them to a school equipped to address their needs with the staffing and funding to provide an appropriate education, you\u2019re right: the latter sounds like a much better option. However, that\u2019s not the choice. The choice is between putting a child who has disabilities in a less restrictive mainstream classroom where they can be supported versus putting them in the most restrictive environment where they can be supported. There certainly are some children for whom a mainstream classroom isn\u2019t appropriate. That\u2019s why the \u201cspecial schools\u201d do still exist. However, for many children, there\u2019s really no reason to keep them out of a typical classroom. While I hate the cliche of \u201cdifferently abled,\u201d it is a fair term in this case. We see no issue with having students deemed to be gifted and talented in a mainstream classroom and we make sure that there are opportunities for these students to have their lessons adapted to their capabilities, even if that is different than most others in their class. They\u2019re given opportunities for pull out classes with others who have similar advanced skills so they can learn other skills/information, but for most of their classes, they\u2019re around their peers. That\u2019s exactly what inclusion looks like for kids who have disabilities. Their work is adapted to their learning level. They get extra help if needed. They\u2019re provided opportunities for pull out classes to work with other students who also have disabilities or to receive things like PT/OT/speech therapy. Most of the time, they get to learn with their peers. With the appropriate support for both the student and their education team, there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t be successful. There\u2019s certainly no reason to lock up people with disabilities and hide them away from society. There\u2019s also more to school than just the curriculum. There are social skills too. For example, my sister was included through most of her education and there was a year or two where we did try putting her in a special school. It was awful. She was nonverbal due to her cerebral palsy and was thrown in a class with others who were nonverbal and had severe disabilities. They didn\u2019t encourage interaction between the students. They barely talked to the students themselves. The only social interaction she had was between her and the adults who acted as her aides. What value is there in sitting in silence staring at walls all day? I mean, despite her disabilities, in elementary school she was able to do multiplication just like her peers, she could identify colors just like her peers. She knew people expected little from her because of her disabilities and she\u2019d even give the wrong answer sometimes and laugh about it before giving the correct answer, just to mess with them and reinforce that they shouldn\u2019t underestimate her. Putting her in a \u201cspecial school\u201d didn\u2019t meet her needs. At least in a mainstream classroom, people actually interacted with her. ",

            "answer_text": "What sort of people are \u201ckids with disabilities\u201d? They have challenges, but all have something to offer the other kids in their classes. We need kids with challenges to educate the \u201ctypical\u201d kids. All kids need to learn that our communities are made of many kinds of people, including people with disabilities. All our kids need to learn that everyone participates, everyone can be a friend, and everyone can make the world better. If we don\u2019t teach children how valuable all people are, they might grow up to think that people with disabilities should be hidden away somewhere. ",
