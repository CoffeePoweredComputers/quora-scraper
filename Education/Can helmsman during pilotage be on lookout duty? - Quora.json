            "answer_text": "No. And it is next to impossible to fulfil all aspects of bridge manning during pilotage.  I look at it this way; I override the SMS based on a risk assessment for reduced manning.  For example, if the weather and visibility is good then there's no need for an extra lookout considering you are in river pilotage in Europe or south America. If its the other case then also one can take extra mitigating measure like reducing speed to full manoeuvring instead of 'sea speed' as it mostly happens, increasing the position plotting frequency, report position on vhf more frequently to VTS etc, etc,. You can't fulfil 100% aspects of btm, but you can try and rest your crew sufficiently.  I chose the latter. The SMS can be your best friend or worst enemy. Being a by the book person can upset the management and being totally gung-ho and ignorant may land you in trouble. One needs to find the perfect balance. ",
