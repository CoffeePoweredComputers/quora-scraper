            "answer_text": "Ideally, you should go through all the chapters from modules at least once. But, if time doesn\u2019t permit, then go for topics with higher weightage: Ecology, Genetics & Diversity. If you read Ecology and Genetics directly from NCERT, you would get a feeling of everything getting mixed up. Module tries to ease the things by marking a boundary within topics. Diversity has been explained nicely in NCERT, but you ought to have an understanding above that level so that you don\u2019t waste much of your time in the exam hall. Also, for Diversity, prepare a separate chart with all the examples written over a single place, so that you could revise them much often. Above three topics demand regular revisions. They are damn volatile. Leave them untouched for a month or two and they are gone. Apart from these, Plant Physiology may be a bit difficult to understand directly from NCERT. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t hesitate to clear your concepts regarding those cycles. Have one or two readings from any help book until you get an idea about how they operate. Once you are done, prepare short notes and charts accordingly. Rest other chapters as Cell, Human Physiology, etc won\u2019t cause much trouble if you pay attention during your classes and clear NCERT simultaneously. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to practice a lot of MCQs. And, Revision is the key! Best of Luck! ",
