            "answer_text": "Not necessarily.  Most private schools look better than most public schools on paper.  However, instead of asking whether the private school is better than the public school, it usually makes more sense to ask whether the private school is a better fit for you.  It may not be.  Keep in mind that if a school is large, the metrics that are printed in your local paper or posted online may not reflect what your experience would be if you attended.   Some schools do very well educating certain segments of the population, but less well educating other segments.  For example, our local high school has a terrible graduation rate and low standardized test scores compared to other schools in the county.  Does that mean you shouldn't attend?  It turns out that the school has a superb program for autistic children.  Families move into the district to take advantage of that and that affects the graduation rate.  They have an amazing music program.  On the other hand, they don't offer AP Physics or AP Computer Science;  they don't have enough students to fill those classes.  It could either be the perfect school for you, or a bad fit.  Either way, the school statistics may not tell you what you need to know. If you are trying to decide between two schools, you should talk to students who attend those schools and whom you consider to be similar to you (or your child, if you are a parent).  You are interested in things like:   What courses are actually offered? Just because it is in the course catalog doesn't mean they have it.  Does the school have support systems in place for any issues you may have?  One friend had a daughter with a chronic health condition.  When she explained and asked what the policy was for absences they responded, \"She should go to school somewhere else.\"Does the school have the extracurricular activities you are interested in?What advanced classes are offered, and what is the policy for taking them?  One local private school has such a strict policy for taking AP classes, that students often leave after sophomore year because they aren't permitted to register for the classes they want.  On the other hand, some of the local public schools don't have enough advanced students to support many advanced classes.In some districts you need to consider safety.  Is there a crime problem?  Don't assume that the private school has less crime than the public school.  They may have fewer assaults, but a higher rate of substance abuse.Will you fit in with the school culture?  If the school is very large, there will probably be a variety of social niches, but a small school might only have one or two.",

            "answer_text": "No. It depends on the school. There are great, big name, very expensive private schools who only accept the top students. Yes, they are going to be better. Public schools have to accept everyone, including special needs kids and kids with parents who don\u2019t care at all about their kids education. However, the \u201cless than great\u201d private schools have a problem. No parent is going to pay top dollar if their kid isn\u2019t doing great. Therefore there is pressure to give students high grades they don\u2019t deserve. We have a teacher at my public school who left her private school job for that reason. I\u2019ve also had kids come back to the public school from private for various reasons (money, friends were at the public school, etc) and they don\u2019t seem to have learned much of anything at the private school, although they were told they were stars. In my area there are a lot of private schools, which seem to range from top notch to jokes. Of course there are horrible public schools too. There may be other reasons for picking a private school - such as wanting your kid to have a religious education or wanting your kid to play on a top notch sports team (yes, that\u2019s a real reason for some.) Sadly you can\u2019t just pick a school based on a label - public or private. You really have to do your homework. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, usually. For all kinds of reasons, here are three top reasons: Because they are private, these schools are more free to teach the way they want, using resources they know are better (resources not determined by the state!).Because they charge tuition, and in some cases very substantial tuition, you are already guaranteed to get kids from families very invested in education. Parents willing to spend $50,000 a year on a 13-year-old are likely going to be engaged, focused, and involved - kids do much better with parents who are partnering with them and who have plenty of skin in the game.Public schools, more or less, must accept anyone who appears on the doorstep and who lives in the district, regardless of ability. Private schools can turn a student away. Many private schools have entry exams and will only accept students who can handle a very rigorous academic workload.",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is yes they can be. The long answer is much more complicated. There are terrible private schools, and decent public schools. Maybe there are even a handful of good public schools. Private schools have some real advantages baked into the cake. They can easily expel students with behavioral issues, and public schools really can\u2019t. They can accept only students that meet a certain academic level, and public schools can\u2019t. This self selection guarantees that private schools have better behaved smarter students, so it\u2019s no surprise that they have better test results. So are they really more effective, or do they just have a better starting point? The answer can be both. State schools must abide by the state mandated curriculum, behavioral policy, testing policy, and other mandates. Much of their effort is focused on getting the bottom 1/3 of the class to be able to pass standardized tests. The top 2/3 will pass, and so no real effort needs to be spent on them. The remedial approaches to get substantially sub par students to meet minimum standards really don\u2019t help bright kids much. If your child is in that top 2/3s, the choice is pretty obvious. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. We live in a town with a public high school that was among the top 100 in the country, Public or Private. A high school is merely a learning center. It is up to the students to take advantage of the resources that are around them. Our high school provided a lot of resources, and everyone\u2019s towns/communities provides a lot more resources. Public schools work for some students and private better for others. Indeed, there were several families that we know who sent one child to a public school in our town and the other to a private school. They both thrived and did well within a supportive environment for them. All of my family only went to public schools, and I believe we have all done fine. Private schools cost a Lot of money, and you still have to pay the taxes to support your local public schools. We tend to be Frugal. ",

            "answer_text": "Some private schools provide smaller class sizes and thus a smaller student load overall for their teachers. Some private schools ask teachers to teach four sections instead of five and prepare two courses instead of three (or four or five), so the teachers have more time for students. Some private schools do a better job than some public schools at holding students accountable for their behavior and academic performance. Some private schools accept only high achieving students, and thus teachers can aim higher in their curricula. Some private schools allow their teachers to generate their own curricula rather than forcing them to teach out of a textbook. These teachers might enjoy themselves more and pass that enjoyment on to their students. Some private schools prepare their students for more than just the standardized test at the end of the year. Since parents are paying tuition in addition to their taxes, students at some private schools face a greater pressure to perform. But some private schools are not better than public schools. Schools, like students, are individuals with strengths and weaknesses. They can be hard to compare. ",

The upshot was that public schools did better in Math education. There are multiple other studies showing about the same results. ",
