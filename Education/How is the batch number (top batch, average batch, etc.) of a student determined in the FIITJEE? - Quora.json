            "answer_text": "Hi , well ia m in fiitjee's best batch so I find myself apt to answer this question Basically when you first join you will be in a batch based on your score in the admission test or ftre After this the first phase test of classes 9 th and 11 th will be the reshuffling test . if you are among the top 30\u201335 then you will be in the beat batch and so on \u2026\u2026\u2026 At the end of class 9 and 10 there is a reshuffling test to determine your batch for next year \u2026.. A constant shuffling keeps on happening if you show a drastic improvement on the phase tests and the mid phase tests that occur The perks of being in top batch are huge you study among the best in the business , you get the best teachers and are given the special LPP I.e lecture practice problems they contain questions of jee main and jee advanced level and are made on pattern of jee advanced like having multi correct and paragraph questions You need to reply work hard to be in the best batch and you need to constantly keep yourself among the top 35 Getting to top batch is a fight on its own but then you need to fight to get to the top of it because there are thousands of coaching institutes among which you must compete So just work hard and try to keep yourself on the top Cheers!
