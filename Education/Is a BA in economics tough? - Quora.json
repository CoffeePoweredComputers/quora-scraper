            "answer_text": " Economics is not a tough subject, especially if you are good at 12th standard mathematics. Parts of 11th and 12th standard math like differential and integral calculus form core parts of several economic theories. During the years of studying economics, you will find out that there isn\u2019t much to mug up. Unlike history or political science, it does not demand the prowess of long-term memory. Most exams in the life of a BA economics student tests his or her understanding of the subject. A large part of the coursework is proving economic theories mathematically. Moreover, the two integral subjects \u2013 econometrics and mathematical economics form the lifeblood of bachelor\u2019s level economics. Both the subjects demand a thorough understanding of +2 standard mathematics. Most students find economics to be relatable to their everyday lives. Concepts like demand and supply, India\u2019s economics, micro and macroeconomics are based on the topics most boards have already covered in their economics classes in the +2 levels. Provided, you understand the high school mathematics, statistics and economics, you should not find bachelors in economics tough. Go for your BA in economics under a renowned college or university like BMU, DU, CU or BHU for learning under the best faculties. Several educational institutions now offer a look at their course syllabus so you can see if you will be able to manage the pressure. Check out BMU\u2019s official website to see which topics the three-year course will cover. The three-year course in economics is indeed vast and it covers more topics than you have covered in your 11th and 12th grades. However, with the proper guidance, some additional study material and easy to follow online lectures, it is not going to be a hurdle. ",

So its a very interesting subject. Hope this will help. ",
