            "answer_text": "In statistical hypothesis testing, a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis.What is the difference between a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis? The null hypothesis states that a population parameter (such as the mean, the standard deviation, and so on) is equal to a hypothesized value. ... The alternative hypothesis states that a population parameter is smaller, greater, or different than the hypothesized value in the null hypothesis.What is null and alternative hypothesis in research? The null hypothesis is a general statement that states that there is no relationship between two phenomenon under consideration or that there is no association between two groups.An alternative hypothesis is a statement that describes that there is a relationship between two selected variables in a study.What does statistically significant mean to statisticians? THUS Statistical significance is the likelihood that a relationship between two or more variables is caused by something other than chance cause Statistical significance is used to accept or reject the null hypothesis,which hypothesizes that there is no relationship between measuredvariables.ALSO statistical significance In statistics, a number that expresses the probability that the result of a given experiment or study could have occurred purely by chance. This number can be a margin of error (\u201cThe results of this public opinion poll are accurate to five percent\u201d),or it can indicate a confidence level (\u201cIf this experiment were repeated, there is a probability of ninety-five percent that our conclusions would be substantiated\u201d).Blessings and best wishes ",

            "answer_text": "At the core, it means that the difference is clear. You could also have written this: After investigating the statistics, it has become clear TO ME, but stop! That\u2019s not what the statistically inclined reader is looking for. He/she is looking to how he/she can inform himself/herself as to the degree of clarity. The need is not just to know if a hypothesis was passed or not, what level of certainty you (subjectively/concention-abidingly) chose as your cutoff value, how big the sample size was, whether or not the underlying assumptions of (normal) distribution can be said to apply, if any outliers have been excluded from the dataset in some step of the research process, whether or not the correct question was asked in the first place - the need is to know ALL these things. When all this is available to everybody you have done your bit making your insights accessible to them. Well done! ",
