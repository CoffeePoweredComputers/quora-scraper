            "answer_text": "LOBOs So called lender options borrower options. A structured financial product. Perfect to exercise a hefty meal of cash..  This is textbook example of stupidity, greed, fear, and everything else.  Local authorities, or so called bureaucrats who work at the council wanted money. Delicious money. Because these inebriated clowns wanted money to spend on themse.. on folks who live in this council, and who are in need of dire help.. council workers are good samaritans after all. Normally, such a council would get Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) from the government. But councils didn't like it. They want more money, more quickly, and at better interest rates (at least so they thought). Who can jump in? Take advantage of non-literate folks who would buy everything. Us, the financial industry. So banks created products called LOBOs (tricky derivatives you can price with Bermudan Swaptions). These LOBOs are long term GBP loans, 30/40/50 year maturity and offer so-called teaser rates. A teaser rate is the other word for, you are a fucking dumbass, all you read is this low-interest rate percentage. And you won't read this either.. as by signing this, you allow us as a bank to reset the interest far higher after you took the bait, and fuck you up the ass. Because a teaser rate was nothing more but a low-interest percentage rate, to appeal others to take the loan. At a few years fixed. The banks then had the ability to increase interest rate thereafter. Obviously, banks would never do so, oh wait.. These teaser rates were lower than the PWLB loans, so a Dick Fungus bureaucrat who tells his buddies, we have to take a LOBO because its interest rate is far lower than these PWLB loans, others are, fuck yeah! And in case they weren't convinced, we had folks, Treasury Management Advice (TMAs), who would provide the councils with the usual, guys, come on, banks won't fuck you up the ass. Take these loans! People online started to ask questions. Approved Variation of Commission Fees Payable on LOBO Loans and Selection of Broker - a Freedom of Information request to Slough Borough Counci Banks finally get sued by the councils. RBS sued by Newham council over the terms of \u00a3150m in loans LOBOs valuation changed IFRS style from Amorticed Costs to Fair Value as a result, risk teams of Barclays, RBS suddenly had to put these loans on the books. What happened then? They started getting rid of these \u201ctoxic loans\u201d.. And the circle is round. (1) a party wants more money, at lower interest rates than currently available. Driven by greed. (2) banks were looking for customers, saw a market and supplied what the market wanted. Driven by greed. (3) that market didn\u2019t do its due dilligence so they fell for these horrible loans. Blinded by stupidity. (4) banks were cashing, until the market said, wait a minute, this shit is a bit shady. Blinded by greed and stupidity until they started getting issues with repayment of these loans. Councils woke up. (5) regulation changed, and suddenly risk had to be put in the books in banks. Banks woke up. (6) banks started to settle and dump these loans (but obviously profited from it). I have been involved in many of the final end stages of LOBOs for banks, from a reporting to board/pricing aspect. It was amazing. Suddenly c-divison suits said, get rid of it. It has been on the books for years. Bad PR, and lets dump it. Shallow as hell. But stereotypical for the greedy corporate fat cat. ",
