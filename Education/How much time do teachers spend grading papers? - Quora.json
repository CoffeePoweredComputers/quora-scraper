            "answer_text": "In my very limited experience, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours or days to grade one set of assignments. Multiply that by the number of papers the teacher assigns and how many classes they teach, and it can take up more than 20 hours a week in addition to the normal work hours. As a teaching assistant, I once assisted in grading a set of assignments for a research psychology course. To grade each of the 60 eight-page papers, I had to: Read the paper once throughGrab a printed grading rubric (a chart listing all the assignment requirements and how they are scored)Read the paper again, this time marking any grammar or writing errors, mistakes in formatting, and checking off the assignment sections and cited sourcesFill out the grading rubric while scanning the paper a third time, making notes about why I was deducting pointsIf there\u2019s reason to suspect plagiarism (irregularities or suspicious changes in writing), search sections of the paper through a plagiarism checker and/or search engineThis took me about 10 minutes per paper, so it took almost a week of grading after school and work and homework. Another assignment I graded was basically one page per student every week. I still read each page twice while looking to see that the basic assignment requirements were fulfilled, so maybe 2 minutes per page. I know teachers who take more or less time than that to grade an assignment, so it really depends. ",

But that was mostly my fault: I assigned way too much homework (see Dave Consiglio's answer to What is the worst example of plagiarism you've seen as a teacher? for why I don\u2019t anymore), I graded everything meticulously, and my tests were really hard to grade. In the ensuing 18 years, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at writing an easily-gradable test. Sadly this is something I learned on the job, not in my teacher training. This is one of many reasons a significant fraction of newer teachers leave the profession - no one teaches them the tricks. So how much now? About 5 hours a week on average, though there\u2019s a fair amount of variance. That\u2019s just grading and does not include planning (which often takes longer). ",

My heaviest paper-grading is for an advanced ESL writing class that serves as a gateway to college freshman English composition. (That is, when students pass this course they are finished with our ESL program and go on to college classes with native English speakers.) These papers take up many hours each week. The students do multiple drafts. I usually spend the weekend going over batches of 25\u201330 papers and giving ten or fifteen minutes to each paper. (I fool around online the way I am doing now when I need to take a break from it.) On the other hand, I know there are teachers of other subjects who just give multiple choice tests and run them through the Scan-tron. Of course multiple choice tests take time to write, so these people may not be as lazy as they look, but they can still look pretty lazy to me. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the subject, how many papers you assign, how closely they need to be read, and how long the assignments are. The worst would be English. Each paper needs to be meticulously read and marked for improvement. I can see a diligent English teacher spending 3 or 4 hours a NIGHT on papers, Figure 25 to 30 hours a week. This does not include planning, review of material (like watching movies you plan to show the class), writing notes, making phone calls, so on.  I teach Social Studies, so I am off easy at about 5 to 10 hours a week on Grading, maybe a bit less (that says nothing about planning, review of material and so on). Figure another 10 to 20 hours a week for planning, review, and so on.  Math is closer to English. My ex was a math teacher. She graded papers all the time. A good thick stack every night.  You can get an idea why teachers are offended by those ninnies who say we only work 30 hours a week. Those who think they know education because they went to school are like those who think that because they have a brain, they can be a brain surgeon. Good luck with that.  ",

When you think about subjects, P.E. Would be different from mathematics. Being a math teacher, I had daily homework from about 130 students daily. At a minute apiece, a couple hours is needed, and when I graded tests which take a lot of time, I graded all weekend. I tried to grade while watching sports on tv or while relaxing in a recliner so it wasn\u2019t constant but was a big part of my job. Elementary teachers might only have 25 students, but they have all the subjects, and daily grading is a huge job. As I\u2019ve told others, every job is more difficult than it might seem from the outside. ",

            "answer_text": "One thing I did not see in the answers already given is that a teacher can make the process of grading written papers much easier for both students and themselves by becoming good at using rubrics. A good rubric will state the criteria that will be graded \u2014 what specific content, format, use of references, etc. Then you show how many points can be gained by each level of meeting expectations. I will attach one from Indiana Wesleyan for grading a large graduate project as an example. For K-12 work which is shorter and simpler, the rubric can also be much simpler. Then, grading becomes looking at each paper for the specific criteria. It is much quicker for the teacher than trying to read and weigh the comparative worth of all the total papers. And it is much easier for students to know what they need to do to achieve the grade they are seeking. A final aside; for teachers in subjects like art that are seen as subjective, it can avoid a lot of hassle with people believing you just give higher grades to the students you like or the work that matches your own preferences. A good rubric says exactly what you will be looking for and the levels of quality which will result in each grade. It takes a great deal of the mystery and accusations of favoritism out of grading, as well as shortening the time required for grading. For teachers who see 200 students a day or more, rubrics can make the difference of having a life outside of school!  ",

I scheduled term papers for me to correct during holiday recess sessions. The two free periods allotted to each teacher during the day were also used but not as effectively as evening hours where I could rely on total silence. I had over 100 juniors and would guess I spent a total of between 25 and 30 hours a week correcting papers. Their assignments included one journal entry a day (which I did collect and comment on over the holidays), an essay a week, and two term papers a year. ",
