            "answer_text": "They might or might not be. The first is the student. Some intelligent students get bored and become lazy, and might do very poorly in school if not given proper motivation and a good challenge. Other factors can also cause poor performance, such as bullying, abuse, personality conflict with the teacher, an incompetent teacher, or factors not related directly to the school. A student might also skip a year or two, and be doing work ahead of what would be his grade level. Then there is the teacher. In the same school, some teachers\u2019 classes are easier to get good grades than others. Some are known as \u201ceasy \u2018A\u2019 classes/teachers\u201d and other pride themselves in rarely giving an \u201cA.\u201d Some teachers teach better than average, maybe far better than average, and there are some who are not effective at teaching their subjects. Good, average, and bad teachers might be very strict in grading or very lenient in grading. Some might try to help a student succeed while others intentionally try to stop them from succeeding. Another is the school. Some schools are better than others. Some have more difficult work and higher standards. It is not unusual for some private schools to have students doing work 2\u20133 years ahead of typical public schools. The same student might get straight \u201cA\u201ds in a public school will likely get a lower GPA in a private school with harder work and higher standards unless he works much harder. Then there are the classes and subjects themselves. Some are more difficult than others. Combining a few of these factors, a student who should be a freshman could have skipped a hear and then gone to a tough private school as a sophomore could enroll in classes usually taken by juniors and seniors. He\u2019d have a more difficult time getting the same grade than he would have if he stayed in his age group and in a typical public school. Grades don\u2019t really reflect intelligence, and don\u2019t really reflect learning either. In the case of learning, it is very common for people to get good grades in classes and then not be able to discuss the topic only a few years later. Even intelligent people can do this. ",

Anecdotally\u2026 (I have taught hundreds of students)\u2026 In any classroom there is a bell-curve. The ones between 1 and 2 standard deviations to the right of average will do best. Too far to the right, and the pace Of the class and its ability to keep the interest of the student is not a fit. On the left-side there is much effort involved and maybe 1 std Dev to the left and the subject is not well-understood viscerally. That does not mean that a less than average student in intellect cannot do well, they can and will with determination. Finally, there is still the question of whether \u201csmart\u201d is in anyway relevant to a classroom. Some of the smartest people I know by most counts are intelligent enough but have other non-academic skills that make us respect them and create their \u201csmart\u201d success-factors. ",

Some are good at learning. Poor at doing. A few years ago, I worked for an HVAC dealer. A young man with a learning disability was trying to become an apprentice. He had a HELLA awful time with the written study material. I tried to help him. See I can read, study, recall. He had issues here. But DOING? Here, he was a winner. As my boss said: We should let you study and go take the test. But if I needed a furnace or AC maintained, fixed, or installed, you would be the last guy I would pick for that. See? He, was a doer. Me, a learner. It the test is climbing a tree, the monkey wins. The fish, is an idiot. If the test is swimming in a river, the monkey drowns. The fish keeps on trucking. So, yes, they can be. But just because Bob can bang out an essay, and you cannot, that tells us little about your brains or abilities. ",

            "answer_text": " It is common to talk about children's intelligence & intellectual achievements in term of high grades, ranks, and numbers, and scholastic pursuits as reading, writing, studying or likewise. As far as measuring children's intelligence with high grades is concerned, it has two dimensions. Yes, it does matter. Second, it is not entirely dependent on it, it is only one part or phase of education. Intelligent includes the scholastic achievements, no doubts but not confined to it. Mental growth of the child is not solely dependant upon his pursuits in school. He learns immensely more from the home and other informal agencies of education. Children's poor grades are not a problem, because sometimes bad grades are related to lack of interest and attention rather than intelligence. Therefore, to choose the right field based on their individual abilities and interests is a great problem for them so that they can provide better results. ",

But personally I haven\u2019t gotten good grades since 4th grade, (3yrs ago) thats simply because I don\u2019t really care. It doesnt matter to me. Kids bragging about their GPA being 3.5 doesn\u2019t bother me, doesn\u2019t make me jealous, it just annoys me. Some think its a bragging matter, most think of it as a personal thing, gladly. But with my astonishing GPA of 2.61 because I don\u2019t bother with school. I sleep through about a quarter of every class, other than that I pay attention but don\u2019t do projects nor homework tests are the only reason I have even semi-high grades. ",

There are people that can be called letter hunters or in my case with the IB system, number hunters. These people only do the minimum amount of work required to get an A. It means that they are smart at coming up with answers for certain things but does not mean that they are highly intelligent. Another kind of example would be looking at someone conducting a research project and a test. The person may be able to receive an A for the research but a C for the test. They know how to use their resources to get information but do not necessarily know that information and come up with their conclusions. Catch my drift? ",

Nowadays if there's survey among high grades students, we'll find that most of them will have only theoretical or bookish knowledge but they hardly know about practical knowledge. We see most of the colleges or schools doesn't provide proper practical classes. If they do, most of the students just mug those up rather than knowing its actual applications. I can say \u2018a single piece of paper cannot decide your intelligence\u2019. I didn't mean to say that students should only have practical knowledge but knowing both the concepts (practical as well as theoretical) will make you a good student. Having good grades is a very nice thing. You should have good grades. But knowing those things practically will make you good at another level. ",

This ease of learning can be said to stem from intelligence.

Likewise, there are people with a high IQ that are not great test takers. I for one do great on IQ tests, but did not do as well on the standardized tests such as SATs. I still scored 1280 out of 1600 but nowhere near as high as my IQ results. ",

Students with \u201chigh intelligence\u201d tend to easily get bored with the routine and only focus on issues that interest them. From my experience, students with high grades, in most cases, have been the guys who aren\u2019t as \u201cintelligent\u201d as those guys, but have generated superb work ethic to achieve the goal of high grades. But the answer largely depends on how you define intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "I know of two Nurses ( RNs), and one Dr, who scored 100% in the case of the Nurses, and one Dr who was so useless it was surreal but the Dr's marks were high. In all 3 cases, they quite literally a danger to their patients, but they functioned a bit like HOUSE in the TV series, i.e. great at diagnostics, but absolutely abysmal at practical. One of the RNs became super qualified, and was a supervisor of a brain trauma unit ( nice pay too), and the Dr became an in house Dr at a University clinic for students, where 99% of her work was referring to other Docs. All of these 3, had near perfect photographic style recall of facts, but applying the knowledge was just beyond them. I know some of the history of the Dr, and the \"funniest\" was after a patient started cynaosing ( turning blue), the Dr ran out of the ward screaming, so the nurses worked on the patient and saved the patient, and the screaming event was hushed up. So, basically, you can be great in theory, but not necessarily in practice. In my view, the best way to be is to know your strong points and where your intelligence works best. Focus on what you do best, and realize that the reverse is true, someone can be great at practice but awful at exams. Each intelligence has a place, just know your skill-set. ",
