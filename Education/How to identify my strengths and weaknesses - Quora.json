            "answer_text": "1. First, create two lists Before you use any outside sources to help identify your strengths and weaknesses, I\u2019d recommend that you spend about 30 minutes alone creating two lists. Your first list is going to be centered on your business or entrepreneurship goals. Call it something like, \u201cSkills Needed to Succeed.\u201d Don\u2019t worry about whether you\u2019ve thought of every possible skill required for your business to succeed. This is meant to be an overview, and is fairly general. Depending on your business, it might list things like, \u201can understanding of the market,\u201d \u201cbusiness development,\u201d \u201cwebsite development,\u201d or \u201cproduct expertise.\u201d Once you\u2019ve completed your list, highlight the skills that you already have, and put a star next to the ones you think you\u2019ll need to develop. Then, set this list aside\u2014you\u2019ll come back to it later. The next list you\u2019re going to create requires you to be completely honest about yourself. You can create two columns, one called \u201cStrengths\u201d and the other called \u201cWeaknesses.\u201d Depending on your personality, you\u2019ll find one of these columns a lot easier to fill out. I can only encourage you by suggesting that you do your best to be objective. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over what you think are major flaws, and don\u2019t overestimate how great your strengths are. Just write them down, and move on. You also don\u2019t need to have a comprehensive list of 100 strengths and weaknesses. If you\u2019ve included more than 10-15 items in each column, then you\u2019re probably starting to focus too much on strengths and weaknesses that aren\u2019t that significant. Examples of what you might add to this list range from aspects of your character, like \u201ccalm under pressure\u201d or \u201cachievement-driven,\u201d to technical skills you may have, like \u201cHTML expertise\u201d or \u201cproject management experience.\u201d The purpose of this list will be to start off with some general ideas that you have about yourself, and then get input from other sources to help you refine your list. To help you think about what to include in your strengths and weaknesses, try asking yourself questions like: What am I good at?What have others complimented me about?What have others had to help me with on more than one occasion?Which projects and tasks seem to drain my energy?Which projects have I spent hours on without getting tired?What are my hobbies, and why do I like doing them?After you\u2019ve spent some time honestly assessing your strengths and weaknesses, it\u2019s time to get input from those closest to you: a significant other, your mentor, close friends, or family members. 2. Talk to people you trust The problem with using a list of strengths and weaknesses that only you\u2019ve completed is that you have a biased opinion of yourself. Most people think too highly of themselves, or too little of themselves. If you\u2019re like me, then you somehow manage to do both at the same time. We all need some kind of \u201csounding board\u201d to help us gain clarity and get closer to the truth about ourselves. That\u2019s where other people come in handy. Try thinking of three to five people whose opinions you trust, and who have had the chance to live or work with you for an extended period of time. You want people who have observed your behavior and character in a number of different situations. For most people, that group will include a significant other, perhaps a mentor or advisor, a best friend, one or more siblings, or your parent(s). The length of your relationships isn\u2019t the only thing to consider. The most important thing is whether or not you value or trust their opinion of you. Some friends and family members will be too biased\u2014they either think everything you do is amazing, or their opinions have been hurtful and destructive in the past. Carefully select people who have a good track record of being balanced and helpful, even when they\u2019ve needed to tell you something that you didn\u2019t want to hear. Once you\u2019ve got a group of people selected, reach out to them. You can go out to coffee with each of them, or simply send an email with some questions and ask for their honest feedback. When you reach out to them, make sure you give some context as to why you\u2019re asking for their opinion. Tell them that you want to start a business, and that in order to be successful, you\u2019re trying to take stock of your strengths and weaknesses. Ask them what it is about you that they think will contribute to your success. Then, ask them to tell you the weaknesses you have that may cause you to fail. As you receive feedback, start adding more details to your two lists. You\u2019ll start to see that some of the strengths and weaknesses you listed are confirmed by those you trust, while others that you listed aren\u2019t as significant to the people who have spent time with you. Refine your lists. 3. Take a personality test In addition to the time you\u2019ve spent thinking about yourself and the opinions you\u2019ve gathered from others, personality tests are another useful resource to help you identify strengths and weaknesses. 4. Try new things One problem with identifying strengths and weaknesses comes when you have a lack of experience. In some cases, you might look at your list of weaknesses and notice that it mostly boils down to \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never tried.\u201d For instance, how do you know if you have an athletic or artistic ability if you\u2019ve never tried to do something athletic or artistic? I\u2019m a big believer in pushing yourself to grow by doing things you\u2019ve never done before. To be honest, if you\u2019re reluctant to try new things, then here\u2019s your instant personality test result: don\u2019t be an entrepreneur. Evaluating your lists Now that you\u2019ve spent some time identifying your strengths and weaknesses, you can evaluate which ones need some additional attention from you. Some of your strengths represent the absolute best you have to offer right now. Other strengths may need to be further developed before they can be used to their fullest potential. Finally, some strengths likely won\u2019t be integral to your success. In your \u201cweaknesses\u201d column, some weaknesses will be glaring. You will need to address them and improve upon them before you\u2019ll be able to succeed. Other weaknesses, like some of your strengths, may simply be irrelevant to your overall business objectives. Finally, some weaknesses may be important, but maybe you\u2019re not the one to overcome them. In order to understand what I mean, we need to talk about opportunity cost. ",

            "answer_text": "I found really great article about how you can identify your strengths and weaknesses.  So here you have it. First thing, you need to understand is your abilities 1. Appreciate your effort. You should take a good look at where you are already strong and where you could stand some improvement. Give your awesome self a pat on the back and remember that you are an amazing person. 2. Write down what you do. Spend some time ( a few days or week) writing down all of the activities you do throughou  a day. Rate them from one to five, depending upon how much you enjoy doing or participating in them. 3. Think about your values. Sometimes, it can be difficult to identify our strengths and weaknesses because we haven't taken the time to clarify our core values.  Here are some great questions to ask yourself: Think about a few people you respect. What do you admire about them? What traits do they possess that you value? How do you see these in your own life? Imagine you could change one thing about your community. What would it be?Why? What do you think that shows about what's most important to you? Remember a moment in your life where you felt very satisfied or fulfilled. What was that moment? What happened? Who were you with? Why did you feel that way? Imagine that your house is on fire (but all pets and people are safe) and you can save just 3 objects. What would you save, and why? 4. Examine your responses for themes and patterns. Once you've reflected on your values, examine the responses for things that may repeat. For example, perhaps you admire Bill Gates and Richard Branson for their entrepreneurial spirit and creativity. This suggests that you may value Ambition, Competition, and Ingenuity.  5. Determine whether your life aligns with your values. Sometimes, we may feel like we have a weakness in a particular area when our lives don't align with our core values, for whatever reason.  For example, perhaps you value Ambition and Competition, but you feel stuck at a dead-end job where you're never challenged or given an opportunity to prove yourself. You might feel that you have a weakness in this area because your life isn't currently aligned with what's very important to you. 6. Consider situational meanings. Think about what constitute strengths or weaknesses relative to the social conventions or customs withinyour local context. Knowing how these differ depending on where you live canhelp you determine what might be seen as a strength or weakness in thatparticular geographic location.  For example, if you live in a  area where everyone works with their hands, the members of this community will likely value attributes related to physical labor and working long hours during the day. If you happen to live in a large city, however, these attributes might not appear as important, unless you happen to work some other manual labor job. So to understand your abilities you need to : appreciate your effort, write down what you do, think about your value, Examine your responses for themes and patterns,  Determine whether your life aligns with your values and Consider situational meanings. Second thing, you need perform a reflective best self exercise 1. Find people to ask. To help you figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are, you can do a Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise. This helps you figure out what others think about you in order to help you find yourstrengths. To start, think of people in every aspect of your life. 2. Ask for feedback. Once you've chosen your candidate, send them ane-mail asking them about your strengths. Ask them to give you particular instances where they saw you use these strengths. Make sure to mention that these strengths can be skill-based or personality -based. Both kinds of responses are important. 3. Look for commonalities. Once you receive all the results,you need to look for things that are similar in them. Read through each response and think about what it means. Try to pull out what traits each person is pointing, and read the specific instance to see if any other traits arise. After you interpret them all, compare them to one another and find similar traits that many people mention. 4. Make a self-portrait. Once you have all the results, write a self-portrait analysis of your strengths. Make sure to incorporate all the different aspects that people pinpointed in their discussion of you and any traits you brought out in your own analysis. It reminds you of the characteristics you use when you are at your best and can help lead your future actions on how to strive touse them more.  To perform a reflective self exercise you need to : Find people to ask,  Ask for feedback, Look for commonalities and Make a self-portrait. Third thing, you need to list is your actions 1. Write about your actions. Consider how you respond in certain situations that require action, thought, and insight.  The reason for doing this is that the spontaneous reactions tell you a lot about how you react in both ordinary and intense situations. You can write them down to help you decipher your actions and abilities.   2. Think of a challenging situation in which something bad happened. Perhaps it's being in a car crash or a child suddenly dashing out in front of your car while you slam on your brakes. How did you react when confronted with the spontaneous situation? Did you clam up and retreat or did you meet the challenge head on, assembling tools and resources to address the situation? If you took control and acted as a leader, you probably feel that courage and being able to handle these situations is a strength. If you reacted by crying uncontrollably, feeling helpless or lashing out at others, staying inself-control during a challenging situation might be a weakness.   Make sure to consider things from several angles.  3. Find a less challenging situation. Think about a time when you faced a hard decision but one that wasn't so life and death. For example, how do you react when you enter a crowded room? Do you want to engage everyone you meet there or do you want to find a quiet corner away from the noise and connect with just one person? 4. Consider times you faced a difficult personal situation. Think of a timewhen you've been put on the spot and had to react immediately. How quickly did you learn and adapt to new situations? Are you a fast thinker, rattling off agreat comeback when a co-worker makes a snide remark? Or do you tend to absorb, think, and then react in those situations? Remember that any strength you might have developed can sometimes have tradeoffs. If you spend most of your life alone reading and writing, for example, you might not be as apt at small talk as other people, but you will probably have a knack for finding the plot of a book and discussing deep topics with others. You also may grown up with younger siblings, which means you maybe compassionate, patient, and good at diffusing situations. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the world needs many different people with different types of strengths and interests in order to be as diverse as it is. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be good at everything, just at what you consider important for yourself. To know your actions: Write them down, Think of a challenging situation in which something bad happened, Find a less challenging situation and Consider times you faced a difficult personal situation. Fourth thing, you need to list is your desires 1. Ask yourself about your desires. Your desires say a lot about you, even if you've been spending a lot of time denying them. Consider why you want to complete those activities or goals and what it will take toreach them.  Many people fall into the trap of doing what their families want and becoming a doctor or lawyer when they'd rather have been a ballet dancer or a mountain trekker instead. Ask yourself, \"What are my desires in life?\" Whether you're applying for your first job or have just settled into retirement, you should always have goals and yearnings in life. Determine what drives you and what makes you happy. 2. Decide what you enjoy. Begin to ask yourself about the things you most enjoy in life. Write down the answers to the question,\"What types of activities do I find satisfying or appealing?\" For some people, sitting by the fire with their Labrador Retriever by their side sis extremely satisfying. For others, they\u2019d rather be rock climbing or taking aroad trip. 3. Consider what motivates you. Along with your desires, you need to decide what keeps you motivated in life. Write down your answers to the question, \"When do I feel energized and motivated?\"Consider times in your life when you feel ready to take the world on by storm or inspired to go to the next level. The areas that inspire and motivate you are typically where you are strongest. To know about your desires: Ask yourself about them, Decide what you enjoy, Consider what motivates you. Fifth thing: Assessing Your Strengths and Weaknesses 1. Rethink your weaknesses. \"Weakness\" isn't the most helpful way to think about areas for development. In reality, people really aren\u2019t weak, even though we might really feel or think this way at times. However, most people feel that they could be stronger in certain areas in their lives, their skill sets, and other areas. Since they feel they are not as strong in those areas, it\u2019s common to assign the opposite to describe when we feel we need to work on an area to feel stronger and competent. Instead of focusing on \"weakness,\" which has a negative feel to it, think about your areas for growth or improvement - this keeps you focused on the future and what you can do to get better. Weaknesses could be conceived as something about yourself that you either have the power to improve, in so far as they are at all related to your desires, or are perhaps simply not relevant to your desires or goals in life whatsoever. Acknowledging either one is acceptable. Weaknesses are not permanent aspects of ourselves, but instead are changeable aspects of how we do things so we can become even more excellent. 2. Identify your areas for growth. Areas in which you can develop might be related to anything, including certain professional or social skills or poor self-restraint with food. You could also simply refer to an inability to catch a baseball or perform math equations quickly. Often times, areas forgrowth are framed in terms of \"learning lessons from life\" and notrepeating mistakes. Other times, it's about making the effort to overcome alack of skills you perceive in yourself. 3. Focus on your strengths. Some might consider focusing on personal weaknesses at all as waste of time, or even a mis-framing of the issues. Instead, focus primarily on your strengths and try to cultivate these whenever possible.  For example, if you want to work on becoming more assertive, first start with what assertiveness skills you feel you\u2019re already doing. Maybe you have trouble saying no, but instead you have the ability to state your intentions in a way where your intention is understood and you can spare the feelings of the person.  4. Write down your strengths and weaknesses. Once you assess all you've written down about your actions and desires, it's time to focus on what you think your strengths and weaknesses are. Using the lists from other people you got earlier and that you have learned about yourself through the other exercises, write down areas of your work and life that you think are your strong and weak areas. Focus on how you currently see your own strengths and weaknesses based on what you're doing in your life right now, both personal and professional, rather than looking to the past or to your desires. 5. Compare the lists against one another. Did they match up and did you findany surprises? Did you think you were strong in one area but in your actions list that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case? This type of mismatch occurs when you're telling yourself you're one way, but a challenging situation displays your real character instead. 6. Consider any surprises or mismatches. Look at the different lists you'vemade. Look for any surprises or places that don't match up. Reflect on why you think that some of the qualities and weaknesses you've spotted have turned outto be different. Is it possible that you think you enjoy certain things or that you're motivated by certain things, but in actuality you can't or you aren\u2019t? These lists will help you see that. Focus on those areas that differ and try to identify situations that address the area. For example, did you write that you aspire to become asinger, but on your lists of believed strengths, you said that you were good atscience or medicine? While a singing doctor might be a novelty, the two professions differ considerably. Figure out which area really motivates you inthe long-term. 7. Ask the opinions of friends or family. Have a close friend or family member provide you with constructive feedback. Although self examination can lead you to a few answers, getting an outside opinion will help you either solidify your observations or can shatter a few illusions as well. Learning how to receive constructive feedback from others is essential to being part of acommunity. It is important not to get defensive, or take it as a personal attack, simply because someone suggests an area of improvement. Learning toincorporate constructive feedback from others into your everyday life can be astrength in itself. If you don't think that a family member can be honest, choose someone who will give you the truth and not sugar coat or gloss over your weaknesses. Findan external, neutral person, preferably a peer or a mentor, to give you honest, constructive feedback. 8. Reflect on your findings. After you assess your strengths and weaknesses, spend some time to reflect and determine how you feel about what you found. Decide if you need or want to work on any of your weaknesses and contemplate what you will need to do to attack or change these weaknesses. Enlist in a class or find activities that will address your weaknesses. For example, if you find that you become a deer in headlights when confronted with a spontaneous situation, put yourself in situations where spontaneity occurs. Examples including joining a community theater, participating on a sports team, or doing karaoke at the bar. 9. Reject perfectionism. Take care not to become hung up on your weaknesses. This pattern can quickly fall into the nonconstructive patternof perfectionism, which can actually hold you back from success. It\u2019s better to begin with what you do well for a given skill set, then find several details to enhance those skills and slowly improve over time.   For example, you want to improve your communication skills. After someself-reflection, you decide you are actually a pretty good listener, which is your strength. However, you clam up when it\u2019s your turn to speak, which is your weakness. You decide you want to be more verbal, so you work on interjecting maybe a sentence or two within the conversation at small pauses. 10. Don't deny important moments in your life. Everyone hasthings in their life that they excel at. There are times when you do somethingyou've never done before, but it just clicks and you find that you're a total natural at it. This might be sport, art, creative pursuits, interacting with animals, or standing in for someone who is away and doing their job. Not everyone will experience the same amazing moments as you, but when you have them, work with it to enhance your life and reach your true potential.

It hurt. But that is the path a hard-core 11 year old journalist / spy must take. Every day I\u2019d look around and if I saw David looking at Joanna I\u2019d write in my book, \u201cDavid likes Joanna!\u201d I was 11. All day long I\u2019d write down what I saw. I\u2019d record conversations I overheard, I\u2019d write down glances two kids would give each other. Soon everyone realized what I was doing. All the other kids wanted to see what was in my notebook. They\u2019d start screaming at me to let them see. Finally the teacher said, \u201cLet me see that book\u201d. She read it. \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to bring this book back into school,\u201d she told me. Banned and censored for the first time.  At age 12 I wanted to be in the newspaper. I interviewed many politicians. I\u2019d call up Senators, Congressmen, even the President. I interviewed the minority leader of the House. I interviewed the Chief Usher of the White House. I interviewed Governors. I interviewed Senators. I pretended to be sick so I\u2019d stay home from school just in case someone called me back. My parents hated it. Phone calls weren\u2019t cheap then. I ran up a $600 bill one month. Then $1100 the next. My dad yelled at me, \u201cYou are owing us back this money!\u201d and he stopped my allowance. But then the South Brunswick Central Post paid me $150 to run some of the interviews. It wasn\u2019t enough to pay what I owed my parents. But I didn\u2019t really care about that.   Here\u2019s what you do: Write down the ten things you loved doing when you were six, seven, eight, ten, 12, 14, 18, 22. I loved: WritingChessStarting businesses (I was on my fourth failed business by the time I was 27). At a young age I was obsessed with reading about Howard Hughes and the topic of \u201cbillionaires\u201d.Politics (not the issues so much as the game of it). I loved reading about how elections were won (Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s \u201cFear & Loathing on the Campaign Trail in \u201872\u201d, Ted White\u2019s \u201cMaking of the President\u201d series).Investing (I was reading the Wall St Journal every day as a kid even though I knew nothing about the companies the articles were about)Computers (I tried to build one and failed).Breakdancing (yes).The occult (I wanted to learn how to astral project so I can project invisibly out of my body at night and watch girls changing their clothes).Psychology (because there were so many stories about sex, I read every pop psychology book I could find. For instance, \u201cDon\u2019t Say Yes When You Want to Say No\u201d.)Advice columns. I was obsessed with reading \u201cDear Abbe\u201d and \u201cDear Meg\u201d and \u201cAnn Landers\u201d and I read all the books of the compilation of their columns.Comic books. I collected everything.All of these things I loved by the time I was 15.  How the Brain Builds Strengths The brain is always changing. Always forming new connections. But there are two times in life when the brain forms extra fast connections (sheathed by something called myelin which is sort of like saying myelin creates the paths that are hyper loops in the brain): A) when you are born. And you need to learn all those good things like eating, walking, etc. B) when you hit puberty and have to learn all the skills that are necessary to be a productive and successful member of the tribe. Your strengths are going to plant their seeds during these periods.  I was lost and looking for something to do with my life. So I wrote down the above list to try and figure out what I could do with my life. This was about 15 years ago. And then I had to figure out: what can I do with these interests now? With each item I figured out how it \u201caged\u201d. For instance, with investing, I could read and learn about all the latest investing techniques and perhaps start a business in the sector. I ended up starting five businesses involving investing and writing six books about the topic. With comic books, I scripted one out, hired someone to draw it. It bombed. But that\u2019s ok. I did it. With \u201cthe occult\u201d I never succeeded in astral projection. But starting when I was 14 it began a life-long journey into Taoism, Buddhism, and meditation. How did this serve me as an adult? Other than the intangible ways, one of my books \u201cThe Power of No\u201d, was published by one of the premium spiritual publishers. Breakdancing. Hey! It\u2019s how I work out every day. It\u2019s exhausting! Writing. I\u2019ve now written 18 books. Working on the next and the next. I\u2019d like to try writing a novel. Maybe that will be next. Oh, and if you are at all curious about my writing process, read this. Politics. Someone just asked me to run for a particular party for Governor of New York. Fortunately I was smart enough to say \u201cNo\u201d (the power of NO!). Chess. I played for about an hour this morning. Chess has helped me get almost every job or opportunity I\u2019ve ever had. More than any college degree. And Advice Columns. Well\u2026I love writing on Quora! ",

            "answer_text": " Weakness is nothing to be ashamed of. But strength is no reason for pride, either. Each of us has unique strengths and weaknesses that compose who we are. But even if you already know your why, knowing your strengths and weaknesses can help you shape how to reach your goals. So rather than spinning your wheels trying to be good at everything, why not spend your time becoming great at one or two things? WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT? What comes naturally to you that others find difficult? What are the things you\u2019re doing when you lose track of time? These are your strengths. The opposite items would be your weaknesses: the things that you find difficult, boring, or that make you want to fast-forward so it will be over already. When you know what you\u2019re capable of, it can help you shape your goals. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses can help you create the most effective path to reaching your vision. It can help you plan around obstacles before you reach them in order to improve your chances of success. SHOULD WE FOCUS ON STRENGTHS OR WEAKNESSES? We\u2019ve often been told to work on our weaknesses. And while it\u2019s never a bad thing to improve ourselves, sometimes our time is better spent focusing on our strengths.It\u2019s basically the concept of specialization of labor. It used to be that a person had to be a jack-of-all-trades just to get by. Nowadays, we specialize. One man writes software all day, while another cleans suits all day. Then those two exchange money for the product or service that the other provides. Each one focuses on using their strengths, because the programmer wouldn\u2019t be very good at dry cleaning, and the cleaner wouldn\u2019t be very good at writing software. Could it get done if they switched? Maybe, but the quality will certainly be lower. Hence, we specialize. ALWAYS GIVE YOUR BEST EFFORT\u2026 WHICH SOMETIMES MEANS LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO IT If you know you are good at something, that\u2019s great! Do it to the best of your ability and enjoy the work. If you know you aren\u2019t good at something, that\u2019s okay too. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to hire someone else to do it for you. The time and stress you will save from having to learn to do it yourself will definitely be worth the cost. There will probably be exceptions where it makes sense for you to try to learn a new skill. But remember, it\u2019s impossible to learn everything, especially on a professional level. The sooner you let go of the idea that you have to do everything yourself (sorry, perfectionists), the better off you\u2019ll be. FOCUS ON YOUR STRENGTHS If you still aren\u2019t convinced, here\u2019s one more example. Let\u2019s say you are a right-handed batter and you just got your big break in the major leagues. Do you decide to practice your left-handed swing because you\u2019re not as good at it? Of course not! You work on further improving your right-handed swing, because that will give you the best chance of success. If you have no idea what your strengths are, take out a sheet of paper and try to come up with at least five things that you are good at. If you\u2019ve never done this before, it can be difficult, since the possibilities might as well be endless. Think of what you would do with your time if money didn\u2019t matter. Would you build things with your hands, or would you write song lyrics? If you could switch to any career you wanted, what would it be? What aspects of that career make it sound appealing? Are you good with numbers? What are the parts of your day that you look forward to? Do you enjoy giving presentations? What topics do your friends come and ask you about? Is there a trivia category that you would dominate? If you are still having trouble identifying your strengths, ask a friend or family member to tell you what they think you\u2019re good at. You may be surprised by their answers! Once you have your list, you can keep your strengths in mind when deciding how to spend your time. For instance, if you aren\u2019t good with numbers, you might want to hire a CPA to do your taxes for you. That way you can be intentional about the way you spend your time \u2014 your taxes will get done properly, and you will be freed up to work on your debut novel. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people misunderstand this question (it's a popular one). There is a difference between your strengths and your weaknesses IN GENERAL, and your strengths and your weaknesses in regards to your primary craft. For example: In general, here are some of my strengths and weaknesses... STRENGTHS CreativityProblem-solvingWritingStorytellingTechnologyEtc.WEAKNESSES MathScienceHistoryMultiple-choice testingEtc.When people say \"focus on your strengths and not your weaknesses,\" I disagree. That approach only speaks to generalities. Sure, I should be a \"writer\" and not a \"mathematician.\"  Got it. But then what? The key is to figure out what your strengths are and your weaknesses are in regards to your primary aim.  For example: If all you want to be a writer in today's world, it's not about ignoring everything that isn't writing\u2014actually quite the opposite. It means realizing you'll probably have to publish independently: in which case you need to understand marketing, and cover design, and copywriting, and how you're going to promote the book on different channels, which means doing podcasts and YouTube interviews, and oh wait one of your weaknesses is public speaking because you're shy, well now you need to work on that too, etc. This whole question should be reframed: \"How can I identify my strengths and weaknesses IN REGARDS TO MY PRIMARY AIM?\" I know I'm terrible at multiple-choice testing. I know I'm not great at exams or memorizing anatomy or having the structure to follow an antibody science experiment from start to finish. I know these things\u2014which is why I did not follow in my father's footsteps to become a doctor. Even with all his pushing and prodding, I actually felt like I was doing him a huge favor. Why try to be something I'm not (and have him fund it) when I'd just end up failing? Not by choice, but by discourse. That's not who I am, that's a poor use of my time, and it's a horrible investment. (You're welcome, Dad.) What is a better investment is taking what I know I want to become and putting ALL my resources into that. So then it becomes a question of: \"How can I identify my strengths and my weaknesses BASED ON WHO I WANT TO BE AND WHERE I WANT TO GO.\" In the gym, we live by this phrase: If it hurts, it's good for you. If it hurts more, it's better. It's very easy to identify what you're already good at and what you still need to practice. How do you know? (Again, in regards to your primary aim in life...) If you look forward to doing it, chances are you're already pretty good at it.  (And again, in regards to your primary aim in life...) If you hate doing it, or find it less fun or less enjoyable, chances are you still need to work at it. In most cases, that rule holds true. ",

I also tell great stories and I\u2019m very entertaining and creative.I\u2019m fiercely loyal to my friends. I would do anything for those I love. Even to those I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m gentle. I genuinely hate seeing people in pain.I\u2019m generous. I give great presents and I really put effort into it. I\u2019m also helpful. I really find my day is best when I can help someone else.I\u2019m honest with my feelings. You know where you stand with me, I don\u2019t fake friendship.I seek help and advice, and listen to it.Weaknesses I\u2019m deeply jealous. I want to be the best and if I\u2019m not, I can be very upset.I am incredibly harsh on myself. Seriously, if I make a mistake, I can beat myself down for months. External criticism is even harder for me, I am overly sensitive. I cry easily, and it can be a burden to my friends.I worry too much. I always assume the worst.I can be thoughtless and a bit\u2026silly about getting attention or my actions. It gets me into enormous trouble. Like screwing up here on Quora, or even doing stuff that risks my own life. I\u2019m much better now.I am very awkward with people. I can be very odd in conversation. It makes getting close to me very hard.I can be incredibly lazy, if I don\u2019t like a task. I can dig my heels and procrastinate like no other which means I\u2019m a terrible housekeeper.",

            "answer_text": "I love my \u2018weaknesses,\u2019 and here is why I don\u2019t want to fix them, from my article \u2014 What If I Don\u2019t Want to be Fixed? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be fixed. I want to use my \u2018weaknesses\u2019 to propel me to live the life that I want.\u201d I plan what I\u2019m not going to do, then I still do stupid things. This week I was introduced to the carnage that is \u2018Pie Face.\u2019 There is a special place reserved in hell for the creator of this device. He\u2019s laughing at parents everywhere now. \u2018Let\u2019s have a game that involves loads of kids whacking a high striker with a hammer, that then throws whipped cream all over the living room.\u2019 Genius! I hate you pie face man. I love it when everything is clean and tidy at home, it helps me relax. Naturally then, I hate it when it\u2019s a shithole. If it\u2019s a shithole maybe Donald Trump won\u2019t let me in America. \u2018Aren\u2019t the kids enjoying themselves!\u2019 Yes. But I\u2019m dying inside. Must clean. Must clean. Must clean! NOW. Stupid Matt. Have some fun. I always tell myself I need to be less uptight at home. After three years of trying to teach, coerce, persuade and demand my wife and step-kids to be tidier, nothing has changed. And I\u2019ve eventually realised \u2013 it never will. Maybe this isn\u2019t a bad thing. Why do I want to fix them? Why do I want to fix myself so that I can be more care-free? Why do I want to write things that people can relate to so that they can fix themselves? Why are we so obsessed with self-improvement? Things I should try to fix about myself that I\u2019m not going to dwell on as much anymore: I get angry sometimesI am anxious most daysI always worry, or think, about money, even if I\u2019m in a secure momentI\u2019m a bit of a hypochondriac, but not about me. I worry about those I love getting sickI work too hard, maybe, if there\u2019s such a thingI don\u2019t want to be fixed, so I\u2019m not going to worry about any of this. All of these things seem negative, but to me that\u2019s not always the case. Here\u2019s why\u2026 Anger & Anxiety James Altucher says that anger is just fear clothed. And he\u2019s right. I was scared Pie Face would destroy my home, so I got a bit angry. Only on the inside though, on this occasion. I can\u2019t think of a time that fear wasn\u2019t behind an angry moment. I got mad earlier today when a driver cut me up. I was scared that an accident might hurt me. It might cost me money. It might cost me time. Everything compounded. ARRGHH! Stupid woman. Anger can be a great fuel to my fire though. A fire of productivity, not of rage. When I see stupid people doing their normal stupid things it makes me want to change the world. It drives me to do my own stupid things that will probably make no difference to the world. This week I wanted to write a letter to the council and complain about a pedestrian crossing. But they wouldn\u2019t have cared. That makes me a bit angry. Maybe if I become rich and famous more people would listen to me. More people would know me, so more people might think I am stupid. That sounds good. I need to work harder to get more attention. Thank you anger for the push. Money Worries Billionaires also worry about money, just differently than the rest of us. They worry about keeping wealth, while we worry about creating it, or at least being able to buy food next week. I go through cycles. I make quite a lot, then I lose or spend it all. Then I repeat this again and again. I think stability would be good, but maybe boring. I want to find out. This year I\u2019ll be mostly being sensible and conservative. Then next year I can think about losing everything again. From bad property projects, to a stupidly expensive wedding, to my complete inability to save, I am good at finding stupid things to do with any money I make. But I wouldn\u2019t change any of the experiences I\u2019ve had as a result. And I\u2019m always increasing my income streams generally. My worries and intermittent failures also help me to plan and execute my financial strategies better. They make me more conscientious. Thank you money worries for giving me my drive. Plus, money is interesting to me. Everybody, including me, says things like: \u2018I don\u2019t do it for the money\u2019 \u2018Add value to the world and money will chase you\u2019 These things can be true, but why is it bad to do things for the money? Money will always motivate me, whether I have a little or a lot. That\u2019s my truth and I\u2019m not sorry for that. I love you though, that\u2019s why all my content is free. I don\u2019t want your money. Worrying About Getting Sick My family are mostly worriers. We worry about each other getting sick, which makes ourselves sick. Maybe this makes us all stupid, or nice, I don\u2019t know. But what\u2019s the point. Worrying about something that\u2019s out of our control never makes the thing better, or less likely to happen. Please don\u2019t worry about me family. I worry that worrying might make you sick. But hold on\u2026 Worrying about everyone getting sick makes me want to spend more time with the important people in my life, and create more happy memories. Thank you health worries for making me live life. Related article \u2014 How to Never Worry About Anything Ever Again Working Too Hard I don\u2019t think this is a thing. Not for me anyway, I have lofty ambitions. If I\u2019m not willing to put in the work, I don\u2019t deserve the life that I think I want. I don\u2019t like people who don\u2019t work hard and think that the world owes them something. I wrote a full rant about this. I work hard because I worry about failing. If I can outwork everyone else, and do good work, then I should always be OK. I\u2019ll never fall for the \u2018work smart, not hard\u2019 BS. Do both. You lazy bastard. But only if you want to change your life and maybe be remembered for something. If you don\u2019t, go and sit on the sofa and binge on Netflix. I like Netflix. I would do this all day if I didn\u2019t care so much about my future. Thank you to my parents and my influences for giving me the hunger to do something with my life. That\u2019s Why I Don\u2019t Want to be Fixed\u2026 I want to use all my \u2018negative\u2019 traits to learn about myself and then use them to drive the positive. To live better. To make more lasting memories. To maybe even leave a legacy. Or maybe I should worry that I just wrote an article saying that anger, anxiety and worry are all good things? That was really stupid. Maybe I\u2019ll do it again soon. But for now\u2026 In anger and resentment, sincerely,  -Matthew Brown What are you going to achieve in 2018? Are you struggling for an idea?

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t overemphasize how important it is to know your top strengths and top weaknesses. Knowing your top strengths gives you a filter through which you can make decision about what you will and won\u2019t do with your time. Knowing your top weaknesses allows you to be aware of what you need to work on so that you won\u2019t be limited. All people like knowing their strengths, but it takes a very mature person to actively seek out their weaknesses in order to improve them. While your strengths are what will make you successful, working on your top weaknesses will help you live with less stress. 1. Try a wide range of activities. Matthew Jones had a great point about trying a wide variety of activities. I would also agree with this. Make a list of things you may be good at and start finding chances to try each activity. After you\u2019ve completed one, assess yourself and how you did. I am planning on doing this for myself soon. It will involve writing a list of about 6 things I want to try and then giving each one a certain amount of time or sessions to see how it goes. 2: Find a good personality test I\u2019m usually pretty wary of personality tests. However, I stumbled on one that actually did help me, Jordan Peterson\u2019s \u2018present authoring program\u2019. Jordan B Peterson is a clinical psycologist who is gaining in popularity these days. While I\u2019ve done a handful of personality tests before, his program brought to light some of my weaknesses that I\u2019ve never considered. There are two section to the program. One deals with your \u201cvirtues\u201d (strengths) and one deal with your faults (weaknesses). Over a series of pages, he makes you select your top virtues and faults from various lists. Then, at the end, he makes you select the \u201ctop of the top\u201d from all the selections you\u2019ve made. After that, he makes you rank these final selections from most to least impactful in your life. While I had a basic idea of my strengths and weaknesses before, making me narrow the list down and then order it was a great way to force me to prioritize. From doing this program, I learned my top virtues are: Like to learn new thingsMake friends easilyDo things according to a planI somewhat knew these already but it was cool to see how I ranked them. My top faults were: feel that I\u2019m being unproductive when I relaxseriously dislike having my routine or schedule interruptedam interested in so many things that I don\u2019t know what to focus onThe faults were what blew my mind. I had never actually made the connection that I have a real issue with getting aggravated when my schedule gets interrupted. But after seeing it and thinking more about it, it\u2019s spot on. I began realizing all the times that I\u2019ve given people attitude because they messed up my plan for the day. This is something I really need to work on so I\u2019m thankful this program helped me spot it. 3: Ask people Sometimes your strengths and weaknesses are very apparent to others but unknown to you. It\u2019s easy for us to look at someone else and see what they are good and not so good at because we are looking at them from a third person point of view. But when we try to analyze ourselves, we let our ego and other thoughts get in the way of the truth. Find a couple people who know you, but don\u2019t know you as well as your best friends and family. Often times, these are the people who will give you the most honest answers since they don\u2019t have pressure to make you feel good like your best friends and family. Tell them you are working on improving yourself and looking for feedback on your top 3 strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s very important to tell them to be honest and that your feelings won\u2019t get hurt (note: you must mean it!). The key to this entire process of finding your strengths and weaknesses is to drop your ego. When your ego gets in the way, your judgement gets cloudy and you don\u2019t accept criticism. No one likes to be told what they aren\u2019t good at, but the people who can listen to this feedback and actively work on it are the ones who will rise to the top. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you asking for advice on how to answer this question in the context of a job interview? If so, I believe you have no choice but honesty. Anything else will come back to bite you. So for example, let\u2019s say you are really strong at managing projects, and you know that you are not strong in verbal communication in a group setting. You might say, \u201cI believe my ability to manage projects is a strength that will add a lot of value to this team, and if I were to choose one area I\u2019d like to improve on it would be presenting to groups - I get a little tongue tied there, and could improve on that with more practice.\u201d There. You have admitted the thing that makes you most nervous, but framed it in a way that shows you are aware and willing to improve. Nothing to hide - and you have claimed the thing you do best - no false humility. This kind of candor and confident vulnerability will put you in a positive light. Those people who try to make themselves look \u201cperfect\u201d by falsely presenting an attractive quality as a weakness come off insincere. If you say, \u201cI guess my flaw is that I simply work too much,\u201d even if it is true, it comes across as inauthentic. Be genuine in sharing what you do well and where you want to grow, then you can relax and know that they hired you knowing you are not perfect. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people want to develop self-awareness. Whether you\u2019re a CEO, entrepreneur, or aspiring artist, the more knowledge you have of your strengths and weaknesses, the easier life becomes. When you take a step back and can see the whole playing field, you can make adjustments. Maximizing your strengths and improving your weaknesses is the key to self growth.  Here are four ways to identify strengths and weaknesses: 1. Pause and reflect.  There\u2019s no substitute for self-reflection. Take the time to reflect on your abilities. Contemplate the tasks and activities that come naturally to you, the things that, for some reason, you can perform well with very little effort. Recall various time periods of your life and the various interests you had. Make a list of the the things that you do well and then consider your shortcomings. Some people are more aware of their strengths, while others are more aware of their weaknesses\u2014it\u2019s normal to be more aware of one than the other. Spend greater time thinking about the whichever you know the least about.  2. Ask others for their input.  Get feedback from the people in your life. Instead of playing a personal guessing game, gain some certainty by asking others what they perceive to be your strengths and weaknesses. Some of what people say may surprise you, while other statements may reflect some of your internal thoughts. Either way, you\u2019ll continue to learn and gain confirmation of your inner dialogue.  3. Engage in a wide range of activities. The only way to confirm your strengths and weakness is to put yourself in diverse situations. We rarely recognize what we\u2019re bad at because we structure our environments in a way that minimizes or covers our strengths. Similarly, we may have hidden strengths that are not complimented by our surroundings. Change your circumstances and try new things so that you can find your true capabilities.  4. Hire a specialist.  Most people want to wear their self-awareness on their sleeve. They speak the self-help lingo, read self-help books, talk about their spirituality, and have yet to work through their deepest issues. By surrounding themselves with positivity, they cover their challenges with a blanket of self development frou-frou. The people that are actually self-aware don\u2019t have to brag about it, they just meet with their therapist on a consistent basis. If you\u2019re serious about knowing your strengths and weaknesses, then work with a professional who can help you grow and mature as a person.  Most people give up their pursuit of self growth. They assume that they know all about themselves and are comfortable relaxing rather than putting in the time and effort needed to continue growing. Stagnant, they find a laundry list of excuses, and then spend the majority of their days complaining about their life circumstances.  Don\u2019t be that type of person. Challenge yourself to continue learning and growing so that you can live a happy and fulfilling life. Reflect, ask for feedback, try new things,and hire a professional so that you can work through your weaknesses and amplify your strengths. Increase your self-awareness and achieve your potential.  -------------------- Matthew Jones writes at presencepowerpotential.com, where he shares an integrated approach to wellness and self-fulfillment that\u2019s focused on balancing the mind, body, and spirit.

            "answer_text": " Many of us feel what we do the most, the best is our strength. I believe maybe yes, if we are talking about skills but otherwise, NO. I\u2019d like to proceed talking about strengths and weakness on nature/ behavioural basis.(It is very easy to strengthen yourself in terms of skills and equally difficult in terms of behaviour and nature.Behaviour is the resultant of nature of a person (in majority) plus circumstance. This means there can be slight difference in behaviour as per circumstances but it is not the same with nature.) Your greatest strength is your weakness - anonymous To explain.. If you are a great talker, you talk too much. Listen more.(I didn\u2019t say,great speaker)If you are a great listener, you listen too much. Talk more.(Sharing multiplies knowledge)If you are great at execution, you rely too much on getting things done. Dream more.(You\u2019re a human, not machine)If you are a detail person, you\u2019re rigid. Adapt more.(Rigidity might destroy you)If you are more professional, you\u2019re work oriented. Enjoy personal life more.(Have a balance)Some qualities (core values) are such which don\u2019t have labels of good/best or bad/worse.. either you have it or you just do not have it. For example : Consistency - either you are consistent or inconsistent, there is no good/bad consistency.Integrity - either you are a person with integrity or disintegrity, there is no good/bad in itCourage - either you are courageous or not courageous, there is no less or more in it.Loyalty - either you are loyal or you\u2019re not loyal, there is no less or more in it.Honesty - either you are honest or dishonest, there exists no less or more honest. (One may read \u2018 My Experiments with Truth \u2019 for better understanding of core values)Experiences along with self introspection can only help you know your strengths and weaknesses. Consider multiple experiences from your life and find the common traits, they will be your true strengths and weaknesses. Thank you for reading :) Image source : Google images. ",

            "answer_text": "People tend to dramatize their weaknesses and they\u2019ll often try to do what they aren\u2019t good at because it haunts them. Their attention gets stuck on it because they so desperately want to handle it. I did business with this guy years ago and he always talked about \u201cethics\u201d and was always trying to push ethics on other people and frequently talked about it in a righteous manner. Later we found out that this guy had transgressions personally with a female colleague and financially in his business. I\u2019ve come across people who\u2019ve been terrible at certain areas of business and that\u2019s the thing that they consistently get pulled toward and talk about the most. For me, I\u2019ve always struggled with focus and it\u2019s something I tend to think about and talk about a lot over the years and something I\u2019m constantly working to improve. My message to you is this, before projecting on others or pointing fingers at others about something you have your attention on, first check yourself to verify that the thing you\u2019re trying to put on others isn\u2019t something that\u2019s actually more intimately affecting you and that you personally have work to do to fix. Because that\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve noticed; the thing you\u2019re weak on and compelled to get better at, that consumes your attention, you tend to project on others to try to get them to handle when you\u2019re the one that either needs to handle it or move your attention to your strengths and find others who are strong in those areas and can support that side of the company to offset it. So if you find yourself stressing and projecting on other people a specific thing, take a second to look at yourself. Challenge yourself and say\u200a\u2014\u200awhere I am not doing this? Where am I not strong on this point? How am I weak on this? Then start there and work to solve that first by either fixing it yourself or finding others who are strong on that thing and have them help support the company so you can focus on your strengths. It\u2019s important to know where you\u2019re strong and where you\u2019re weak and a clear indicator is the thing that consumes your attention and constantly seems to come up for you, is probably the thing that you\u2019re weak on.

            "answer_text": " Reflect - What is it you have been told in the past that you have done very well? Write down everything you have liked to do and everything you did not like to do. Reflect on these things as often as you can, but at least once per week. Your strengths and weaknesses change constantly so keep track of them by reflecting upon them. Ask friends - Most often your closest friends know what you are good at, or what you like to do. Even if solely based on the way you talk about it or how you interact with others in certain situations. We all have a certain image of ourselves in our heads that is different to how others perceive us. Ask others for their honest opinions in both strengths and weaknesses without taking them too personally. Meditate - The point of meditation as a whole is to look within and to find out more about yourself. Take an hour out of your day and just sit with yourself and the question and see what comes up. We go about our lives in such a frantic way that we never talk to ourselves and find out more about who we are. Take some time and get to know the person you spend 24 hours every day with. Look for what you want to do - Even though you may not be good at it yet, the things you like to do are often those in which you develop your greatest strengths, simply because you will invest the most time in it. Everyone has natural talents, but those only account for a very minute part of your strenghts and weaknesses. If you find out what you like you will find out what you will grow most rapidly in. Opposite the two - Instead of asking \u201cWhat are my strengths/weaknesses?\u201d ask \u201cWhat are not strengths/weaknesses of mine?\u201d. Right now you want to identify your strengths and weaknesses and if you cannot do that by finding out directly then start eliminating that which it is not. This may be a longer process but it will get you closer nonetheless.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thinking about your strengths and weaknesses as separate affects your ability to understand yourself. You strengths and your weaknesses are one and the same. Here is an example. I recently worked with a wonderful, intelligent, ambitious woman who found she was having trouble getting ahead. She was involved, driven, action oriented and open to feedback. The type of person who \u201cgets things done\u201d. If our strengths are also our weaknesses, can we take a look at the price her motivation comes with? What are the disadvantages of a singular focus on getting things done? She is always managing high levels of stress. I encourage her to take a breath, to intentionally let some time go by (sometimes an extra minute, sometimes a night) between a thought and her reaction to the thought. This, compounded, will result in less anxiety, less mental frenzy, added clarity and focus; and also in action that is more deliberate and thought-through. I suggest she take the time to read others. If her focus is getting things done, she is thinking of what to say or do while the other person (often her manager) is still talking. Can we listen without any other intent? If we cannot, what are we missing? What about collaboration? Action oriented people have a tendency to be faster, more efficient than others, and as such often resolve to act alone. \u201cThis will be easier if I just get it done\u201d. But, this often means we sacrifice what we might learn from others. Fact: our way is not always the best way. Collaboration might compromise speed and might not come naturally, but it arrives with other benefits, one of which is increased self-awareness. The same applies to our ability to delegate. \u201cFor this to get done right, I have to do it\u201d is the sign of a bad manager. It means we impair others and affect our own ability to scale. Delegation means growth: for others and for ourselves. The most important thing we can learn from this strength/weakness perspective is that it\u2019s not supposed to be this hard. Feeling like we need to react quickly, like there is no time, like we can\u2019t take a second to assess what another is going through, like everything has to get done by me and only me, is exhausting, isolating, unsustainable. Learning more about ourselves is about suffering less. ",

            "answer_text": "Late night dinner with my bestie. Sex and the city dress code. Wine, because wine not? I\u2019ve called her and set in up in heart beat. She was sure a had a new scoop, a juicy gossip or life changing event I want to celebrate. I was waiting at the table with 2 sheets of paper. One for her, one for me. I was in a troubled time in my life and needed a little help. I already did the heavy emotional lifting on my own, but sometimes you want to have someone by your side. I handed her the piece of paper and asked her to do me favor and lay down her raw, unfiltered thought about me. Categories: best quality, biggest weakness, what you admire the most, what drives you crazy, what needs improvement and what I needed to let go. I did the same for her, on my sheet of paper. She needed help with what era to focus her efforts on. We laughed, we cried and cursed like sailors. Laughed again. Personal audits are though. You have to play good cop/bad cop with yourself and still feel like you\u2019re winning in the end. Deep down, we all know our strengths and especially our weakness, but we can never have the big picture and know how those come across for other people. How they are perceived or how they affect the ones we love. Changing the perspective, switching it up for a more comprehensive view will help you improve and build up confidence as well. You\u2019ll see that your flaws are not the end of the world and people might actually love you for them, and not despite of them. The most important takeaway is that personal growth is a process. It takes time. Accepting yourself as a whole, the good, the bad, the ugly, will take you closer to your end goal: becoming the best version of yourself and not just answering this strengths/weaknesses question at your next interview. Having a clear image will help you improve, change and love yourself more!  ",

            "answer_text": "On the 25th of September 2014 I received an email with the subject line: \u201cYou\u2019ve received a gift from Tai Lopez!\u201d It was the audiobook of Managing Oneself by Peter Drucker.  Back then, you could sign up for his program for a $5 flat fee and got the book on top. Boy was that a good decision. I listened to the audiobook the next day on my drive home (it\u2019s just 45 minutes long). I have never learned more about myself than in those 45 minutes. Drucker walks you through the questions all knowledge workers (and today we\u2019re all knowledge workers) have to ask to succeed: Who am I?What are my strengths?How do I work?Where do I belong?What is my contribution?To find out your strengths, he suggests to use feedback analysis. Here\u2019s how he describes this method: Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations. I have been practicing this method for 15 to 20 years now, and every time I do it, I am surprised. [\u2026] Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie-and this is the most important thing to know. Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. Third, discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it. Other questions Drucker addresses in the book to help you cultivate self-awareness are: Am I a reader or a listener?How do I learn?Do I work well with people, or am I a loner?In what relationship do I work well with people?Do I produce results as a decision maker or an adviser?What are my values?What kind of person do I want to see when I look in the mirror in the morning?What should I contribute?Where and how can I have results that make a difference?This book helped me set myself on the trajectory I\u2019ve been on for the past 2.5 years. But it was just the first step on a long staircase. I try to take the next step every day.  (stairs in Japan I saw while traveling in 2013) Some other tests, quizzes and resources that have helped me become more self-aware since then are: The OLD test (Obsessive Learning Disorder)Strengthsfinder 2.0The Habit Tendency QuizThe Jung Typology TestThe Learning Style QuizThe Bad Habit Breaker QuizSelf-awareness is the fuel of success. Without it, you\u2019ll be swinging the bat on the wrong side of the field. Or worse, on the wrong field altogether. I hope you\u2019ll find it faster than me. But to do that, one day you\u2019ll have to start looking. Make today that day.  I write more here. ",

            "answer_text": "Business author Peter Drucker said, \u201cA person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weakness, let alone on something one cannot do at all.\u201d Invest your time and energy into anything that pushes you towards the top of the mountain rather than away from it. That starts with keeping track of what you did and the results. The writer notes his or her word-count, the weightlifter their lifts and the runner miles on the track or road. Similarly, the sales executives tracks their calls or client meetings and the trader his or her positions. Identifying a strength gives you an opportunity to build on it. Repetition build competency. Competency leads to success. But what should you do after identifying a weakness? Perhaps you find writing really difficult, loathe public speaking or find busy rooms draining? Or perhaps you just hate jogging? Well, if you\u2019re an introvert, perfecting your ability to work a room isn\u2019t a great use of time. Similarly, if you\u2019re an extrovert, you\u2019re probably not going to enjoy long periods of quiet reflection. When you find a weakness, compensate for it by enlisting the help of someone else who cites that activity as a strength. Consider the CEO who relies on his or her chief operating offer to make the trains run on time their company. That COO frees the CEO to lead rather than get mired in the details. I once met an entrepreneur who specalised in connecting like-minded entrepreneurs with each other. Investors. CEOs. Public speakers. Authors. Those kinds of people. However, he struggled with the logistics of running a business, like admin, finances and finding new clients. So he partnered up with a friend who delights in the details but shies away from networking. Caution: a strength can become a weakness. Elon Musk loves telling the public all about his ambitious goals like colonising Mars or selling affordable electric cars to the masses. Capturing people\u2019s attention is his strength but his promises don\u2019t always translate into projects shipped on time. In other words, he can overpromise and under-deliver (a weakness) The same principles can work in your personal life. Or at least, they do in mine. I\u2019ll happily spend hundreds of dollars hiring someone to complete projects around the house because DIY is a weakness. I can also focus on a single project, like writing a book chapter for a few hours, without getting distracted. That strength turns into a weakness whereby I focus too much on one project to the exclusion of everything else around me. My wife once complained, \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed\u201d when I said I\u2019d spend the afternoon editing a troublesome article than outside in the sun. I knew my strengths. She knew my weaknesses.

It\u2019s quite a task to fool me as I\u2019m aware of Ponzi schemes, laws of nature and various conspiracy theories. To know how the world works is to know when you are most likely to being lied to.I\u2019m loyal to those I love. Finding sincere people is is extremely hard so I appreciate those I have around me.My significant other told me that I always expect the best from people. If you have read my answers here on Quora, you might disagree, but in real life if someone asks for my help, I can almost never refuse. I consider this a good trait, because I personally like it if people are willing to help me in this rare occasion when I ask for it.I highly respect older people, even if they belong to \u201clower\u201d class in the eyes of society. They have personally seen some stuff I can never even hope to witness myself. I don\u2019t always agree with them, but they have taught me a lot.I see personality first, then appearance. It has shaped my life in the better direction.I see myself as an eternal student. Not because I delayed my university graduation for some years, but because I always see something new to learn. I will never be the master and I love it.I\u2019m an introvert. Instead of following the path of popularity and fame, I have created some neat stuff in my lair. Instead of going out every weekend and getting wasted, I have discovered philosophy and the magic of knowledge.I have my own path and moral code. I don\u2019t follow the rules 100% as I\u2019m expected to.I was so pumped up by positive energy that I don\u2019t want to provide any weaknesses anymore, but nobody is complete without any flaws so here they come.  Weaknesses The gates of my castle are closed by default, so it\u2019s hard for me to reach out to other people having a fun picnic over the other side of the moat. Also, it\u2019s a difficult task to earn my trust.My filter settings are set to extremely low, thus sometimes I\u2019m too honest even when inappropriate. Also, I have no taboos.I\u2019m constantly spacing out thinking about the plot of my sci-fi series. That\u2019s why I tend to function inefficiently in our society and forget even simple daily chores.Pessimism. I\u2019m always ready for the worst scenario and my daily thought process reflects it.Sarcasm and irony. If I\u2019m in an extremely bad mood and I see something that I consider dumb, I tend to vent \u201cindirectly\u201d, sometimes the victim being totally oblivious of the cannon fire they just received (Philosophical war question: does firing non-damaging cannons have any point at all?).I find it hard to adapt to our modern life. I\u2019m not even 30, but I feel like soon I will resemble that old grumpy gardener over there, who shouts \u201cGet off the lawn, damn kids!\u201d. The kids are like alien technology such as Instagram, Twitter and mumble rap. The lawn surrounding my moat is the last buffer zone separating my darlings from the things I don\u2019t understand. I would be lost without retro, disco, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, boxy cars, Roman Empire and all the fascinating history and its outdated values. I\u2019m always ready for the last battle as I said before - I\u2019m loyal to those I love. Metaphorically speaking - will I survive the year 1453? ",

            "answer_text": "I am an Advocate. Confusing? Some time ago, I received a message on Quora regarding my personality. They said they think I am an INFJ personality type. Before even looking into it, I did a test on a personality website. Out of curiosity. I recommend doing it if you're interested and have a lot of spare time. Free personality test | 16Personalities (If you want to do the test though, do it before learning about the personality types.) And yep, that was the answer. Honestly I was surprised by how accurate it was. But then, by the end of the test, it had been written that I don't have to be surprised simply because I felt understood as they spent years on the research itself. It really helped me see my good side and my bad side. Here are INFJ personality type's strengths according to the site : They use their creativity to solve problems that seem real in the human world.Advocates are passionate about what they do. So the determination comes with their passion. Most often, Advocates are fighting for a cause they think is important.They prefer honesty. They use their insight to look past lies or dishonesty and to understand issues better.Apparently, Advocates have an inspirational, humane way of writing. If it's something they are interested in talking about, they may also have a convincing way of speaking.Advocates tend to follow through their plans until the end if it's something they consider important. Their decision making involves a lot of thought. They are good decision-makers.They believe in making this world a better place. Contributing to humanity is one of their biggest purposes in life. For that, they even come forth with their plans and ideas carried by strong beliefs.They choose quality over quantity when it comes to friendships. They look for authenticity, similar ideologies, comfort and potential growth (for themselves) when it comes to friendships. They are very loyal and supportive as friends.Quality over quantity in relationships too. When it comes to relationships, they want it to be authentic, meaningful and compatible. They need to feel a connection. When they have found the right person, their level of depth and sincerity reaches what most people can only dream of.They give their all when it comes to love. They commit fully. And they love endlessly.People with INFJ personality type are not compromising when it comes to their devotion for their children. They encourage their children to be independent, responsible, well-mannered and to form their own beliefs. Still they would like to see their children to be able to differentiate between what\u2019s right and wrong and would like to see them contribute to the world in a way or two.Yes weaknesses exist too. And here are some : They are sensitive and usually not ready for arguments. They often get hurt if their \u2018strong\u2019 beliefs are criticized in some way.Advocates are perfectionists. However, in the real world, situations are far from perfect. They always believe in a \u201cbetter\u201d option and overlook healthy decisions or situations.If their beliefs aren\u2019t kept in balance with the reality, they are most likely to exhaust themselves.Their passion comes with a cause. And so often, they are disappointed and lose their motivation if they don\u2019t see a cause.Privacy is very important to Advocates; it\u2019s important to the point that it keeps them from opening up to even their closest friends and family members.They are picky when it comes to relationships and friendships. Acts like lying, trying to talk them into something they don\u2019t want, blaming them without expressing one\u2019s concerns and not putting two-sided efforts are usually not forgiven.Because of that, they spend a lot of their time trying to find the right partner and right friends. And sometimes they are left with none.Advocates are scared to commit because of their tendency to love endlessly, and because of their sensitivity in issues. Small things matter to them.Advocates tend to force their beliefs (the ones they deem as right) on their children. They like to see a lot of their qualities on their children and sometimes they go to extents to make that happen.They have a hard time choosing a career path because of their beliefs. They see so many different paths. And often question themselves.Famous people with this personality type : Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Jimmy Carter and Morgan Freeman. ",

However there is a problem; it is very difficult for a lot of people to identify their strengths and weaknesses. We often underestimate how good we are at some things and overestimate the thing's we're not particularly good at. It takes a lot of self awareness to be able to accurately evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. Becoming more self aware is a good place to start and can be incredibly useful for life in general.   I have come up with a method I often use myself that gives me exactly what you are looking for. I started by not focusing on my strengths or weaknesses. I focussed on my achievements and failures. I found it easier to identify those thing's. I think you will too. List your successes and list your failures, then next to each success and each failure, write what strengths are needed to achieve them. You should begin to find a pattern. Your strengths should consistently show up on your successes and your weaknesses will consistently show up on your failures. When you've done this, congratulations, you've found what you are looking for. Then you can start working on improving on the weaknesses you feel are particularly important to you and your future.

            "answer_text": "There is a whole set of very good books out there, using the method called the \u201cstrengthfinder\u201d approach as pioneered by Tom Rath (strengthfinders 2.0) and Marcus Buckingham (Standout 2.0). They ask you to assess a fundamental question to identify whether your current role taps into your natural strengths: to what extent do you agree with this statement? \u201cMy job gives me the opportunity to do what I do best every day.\u201c It\u2019s a really good question to ponder. I have a slightly different and complementary take on this. Here\u2019s my rationale, and a good assessment for you. In my study, we identified 7 key work practices that predicted two-thirds of the difference in performance among the 5,000 people in our study. Other things matter too, of course, such as your natural talent, experience and luck, among other things. These 7 practices seem really important. Given that, the question becomes, how do you currently stack up against those seven? Which are you currently doing pretty well, and which ones not? Armed with that information, you can choose what to focus on to improve your work practices. The management experts behind the strengthfinder approach advocate that you keep improving on your strengths, and that makes sense in their use of the term. In my approach, I would go for the \u201cweakest link\u201d: pinpoint which of the seven is your weakest part yet key in your job. For example, say you score low on the practices of \u201cfight and unite,\u201d which sometimes is called \u201cdisagree and commit.\u201d This involves speaking up and generating a rigorous debate in meetings to let the best arguments and ideas emerge and prevail. Now, if you don\u2019t run or participate in such meetings in your job, you wouldn\u2019t pick this one. But if you do and your score is low, it\u2019s a good place to start developing your skills. So how do you find out? It\u2019s of course a process of some assessment and introspection. To get you started, I have developed a brief assessment of 20 questions that let you benchmark yourself against our sample of 5,000 managers and employees (it\u2019s an abbreviated version of the lengthy survey instrument we used).

Your strengths and your weakness are the same thing in different contexts: in one sense you know what you're doing and are confident, while in another you are too confident and something sneaks past you. This is a navel-gazing question, and if you go too deep with it, you will pull everybody else in the conversation into the deep end and make them work too hard. So, it's kind of a trap. In a personal conversation, make things up. \u201cI'm a really good swimmer, but if I get the teeniest amount of water?? Man, I can't think straight for the vertigo it causes.\u201d Or, \u201cI can sleep anywhere, but I'm afraid of the dark.\u201d \u201cI can't touch or eat foods that are temperature-hot, but I can eat consecutive ghost chilies\u2026\u201d that last one is a great example of why you should make what you say nonsense or reasonable to accomplish, should it backfire.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that a strength is something that makes you and your life better. A weakness is something that makes you or your life less happy or more difficult. Using myself as an example when I was young I decided one of my weaknesses was my trusting nature. After having decided that was a weakness I then had to decide what to do about it. I certainly didn\u2019t want to be a distrustful scrooge but I also didn\u2019t want to naive. Time and maturity took care of some of the problem and with that I learned how best to deal with the kind of person who prays on those who are by nature, trusting. So what gets you into trouble? Analyze that and ask yourself, is this connected to a weakness that you can work on to better yourself? As for strengths, sometimes they hide in what you may think of as weakness. Again let me use myself as an example. After 58 years of life I can say without a doubt what I do best is taking care of others. I tried to fight it when I was young but it\u2019s what I am. Nurturers often have a hard time learning to say no to people (another weakness). Learning to say \u201cNO\u201d however is something a \u201cNurturer\u201d has to learn not only in self defense but because it is not healthy for the \u201cNurturer\u201d or those we care for, for us to always say \u201cYes\u201d. My strength, \u201cNurturing\u201d would become a weakness if I did not know when to say, \u201cNO\u201d. Understanding that I feel is another strength. I hope this helps. Good luck finding your strengths and weaknesses, it is a quest of a lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "I prepared for thus as an question for my job interview but today I\u2019m gonna answer this in a much more original way. Strengths- Adaptability - I have been to lot of places changed school 4\u20136 times but I always gelled up with people easily.Integrity- for me integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching. When you have tons of people looking at you than obviously you\u2019ll do the right thing but when no one is around than the actual version of you shows up. The choice you make in that situation is the real you.Work ethic - I am a huge kf Cristiano Ronaldo and there are two things for which he is very famous for apart from his football skills are his hardwork and work ethic. Go on YouTube an watch anyone talking about him, they\u2019ll tell how hardworking he is and what is his work ethic.Commitment- see I\u2019m not mentioning hard-work as my strength because if I\u2019m committed to something only then I\u2019ll work hard. Let me give you an example , When I was preparing for GATE my schedule was something like this 5:30 to 7 am - Gym , 8 to 5 Mtech classes , 6 to 11:45 Library (Studying for GATE) , during vacation my schedule was 9 am to 11:45 pm library. Once i got the job in a PSU than I thought now I\u2019ll prepare for ISRO . My job is a typical 9 to 5 with weekends off. But i was not committed to ISRO that\u2019s why even when i had time to study I didn\u2019t.Punctuality- I value time a lot and i don\u2019t think I need to explain how importer time is.Weakness- Procrastination - The biggest weakness of mine. I have imagined my self in situation which have never occurred and maybe they\u2019ll never occur in future.Mobile phone- I uses my phone a lot now .Thats it. I think procrastination in itself is such a thing that can kill so much of your time and is so tough to get rid of. If my answer was any help for you do upvote , share and follow me. It gives an extra motivation to write and share more on quora. Peace ",

I daydream too much, am much more interested in really getting to know my colleagues and clients to focus on the details of an invoice. I feel like am violating myself when I spend time on an administrative task. They fired me after three months. I would have fired me after one month. I suck at seducing girls in a crowded and loud club. I know, because I have tried. I can't dance and I feel awkward. I need to be able to talk to women, or nothing will happen. I know, because I've met all my girlfriends and my wife outside of clubs. I suck at driving a car. I know, because I've tried. People have told me that I would do about as much damage firing an AR-15 in a crowded place as by driving a car. I daydream too much to focus on the road. I'm very creative, I know because all the ideas I constantly have make me suck at almost everything else. After trying out many things, and many profession, I have come to accept that I'm only good at about three or four things: I can really listen to people and find out the root causes of their issuesI can brainstorm ideas like a tornado on steroidsI can writeI'm excellent at putting people at ease in face to face conversationsSend me to any country and I'll be fluent in the local language in about three to six months, depending on how different the language is from the ones I already speakI consistently fuck up all administrative tasks, I freeze like a paralyzed penguin whenever I need to make a phone call, I'm too nice to charge real money for services, I am not interested in any practical stuff, I want to hear about your biggest traumas and hell, I can make you feel better about it. Today I'm a therapist, translator and language teacher in Slovakia, where people give me lots of credit for fucking up things that are mundane and easy for most people, but hell for me, just because they think a foreigner can't learn Slovak, especially not in one year of living here. I have some exceptional strengths, which are balanced out completely by some MASSIVE shortcomings, if I didn't have those shortcomings I would be rich today. I'm not. As a results my friends praise me almost daily for being o so smart, but I know better\u2026 I'm like a race horse with no lungs. ",

Here they are: Compile a list of 10+ close contacts: family, friends, etc. and their contact details (Whatsapp, Email, etc.) - 10 minsDraft a short intro letter explaining that you are looking for their input concerning your strength and weaknesses - 10 mins - here is mine: 3. Send the intro letter to your close contacts - 5 mins 4. Wait 5. Receive highly valuable feedback regarding your strengths and weaknesses  I did this exercise a couple of months ago and it was the first time anyone told me that I speak too slowly sometimes!!! Since then, I have tried correcting it and made big progress. I would have never known though if I hadn\u2019t tried this \u201cSWOT analysis\u201d.  BTW: Taking this one step further, you would now have to think about Opportunities and Threats arising from the Strengths and Weaknesses your close contacts mentioned (that\u2019s why it is called a personal SWOT analysis). E.g. introversion could lead to threats like not being able to approach client to make a sale. However, it could also lead to many opportunities!

He humiliated me in a worst possible manner during whole 4.5 years. He used to make jokes on me and along with him few friends they laughed. Almost every day in clinics or practicals or wherever he get chances. Before sometime he needed a favour. His best friend refused. He came to me and I did. All of my friends were shocked. Even he himself was! I also don't understand why I said yes!!! (This is just an example!) What is worst in that? Helping him doesn't hurt me. But the belief in mind of people around me, they can do anything with me - but I will help them, hurts me. I think by this, I am devaluating myself!!! ProcrastinationYou can call me legendary procrastinator. I am too lazy that I don't put stopper on my room door so that I don't need to go and open. I take my toothbrush and soap together so I have to go to bathroom only once. I have kept my bed nearby switches otherwise I can bath in sweat but don't start fan!!!! But best is, I don't like to stand up from my chair when I am reading. So I read for 1\u20132 hours extra. I mean for 4\u20135 hours continued without even going to washroom. I sometimes read for 20\u201322 hours continuously at library. Because I am too lazy to come to room and sleep. But when I sleep, I also don't like to stand up from bed. But I keep my books by bedside. So when I wake up, until I can stand myself up, I read on bed!!!  ",

            "answer_text": "Knowing your own emotional triggers from your childhood are very important. The chip on your shoulder is what will drive much of your decision making, because your brain rewards you for satisfying those chips. There are three paths: You prioritize political power / economic security, because you were either bullied or ostracized in your youth, or came from a working-class background, you will naturally choose that path.You prioritize building community, a vibrant social life, fame, influence or notoriety, because your childhood rewarded you with lots of external validation from your primary school peers, you will naturally choose this path.You prioritize authenticity, craftsmanship, or working with things, because you had a very reserved, quiet, but deep & rich inner life of experimentation & creativity, you\u2019ll naturally choose this path.The thing is - money is only a number. After making money, those chips are the garden you need to tend to, because they are what will build a lot of anxiety unless you address it. Choosing to optimize on addressing that anxiety (it\u2019s part of your mental health), and finding the career / lifestyle that addresses it is the best path to take, for each individual. Derick Sivers outlined this well, in his article: Why are you doing?. We can only choose one: fame, freedom / lifestyle, money, power, learning. Trying to optimize on all will only dilute your strengths. A more accurate litmus test is: \u201cWhich type of beach town will you retire at?\u201d - it\u2019ll review much more about your personality, more than what you do for a living. ",

            "answer_text": "Many leaders would rather eat a bug than admit to others they made a mistake or expose a weakness. Exposing your own failures is not a sign of weakness. Hiding your failures is! Nobody believes we are perfect. In fact, when we own up to our own weaknesses, we are rarely telling them anything they don\u2019t already know.  It is counter-cultural among leaders to point out their own short-comings. We seem to feel if we expose a weakness, then they will think less of us. Or, they might not trust us because we have exposed our soft white underbelly to others. The decision to not expose our past mistakes and current short-comings actually accomplishes exactly what we are trying to avoid. When we hide our frailties from people who already know what they are, we lose our chance of gaining the respect, the trust and the allegiance of the people we are supposed to be leading. When we admit our frailties to people who already know what those frailties are, what we gain is respect. We gain trust. We gain allies. Exposing your weaknesses actually attracts followers. Why Do Leaders Hide Their Failures Why do we avoid exposing our failures to others? There is only one real answer \u2013 PRIDE. When you never admit to your failures or weaknesses, you absolve yourself of any responsibility for growing beyond the person you already are. A leader who is not growing is a leader who is losing ground and will eventually lose the people he desires to have following him. An interesting thing happens when you swallow your pride and begin to expose your weaknesses and failures to others \u2013 you begin to take ownership of them. You begin to grow and gain from others what you were afraid of losing \u2013 respect, trust, and allegiance. The Bottom Line Breaking the cycle of pride and developing the Habit of Character called Humility takes practice. Humility is like a muscle, you have to exercise it regularly or it will never gain strength. On the other hand, if you exercise pride, it will become a dominant habit in your character. What are some simple exercises a leader can do to develop Humility to the point it is stronger than our pride? Here are a few for your consideration: Humility Exercises Report your failures to your supervisor, your employees, your spouse, or your children. Don\u2019t wait for them to discover them.Tell your team you are not good at a particular aspect of your job, and ask someone to help you.Apologize after losing your temper at work or at home.If you screw up, admit it and share with others how you are going to fix it.Laugh when you do something embarrassing instead of hiding it, running from it, or getting angry about it.By exposing your weaknesses and failures to others, you strengthen your character. You strengthen your Humility. You strengthen the bonds of respect, trust, and allegiance that both the leader and the led want and need desperately. Source: www.andersonleadershipsolutions.com ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it doesn't make sense to try to analyze strengths and weaknesses without a context. You can develop a general list of strong or weak points but unless you have a goal in mind they don't really mean anything. For instance your strengths and weaknesses in considering a career field will be different for each choice. Say are a great driver but the career you are considering has you at only one location all day. While driving may be a strength it doesn't really matter because it doesn't play into the plan for your career. The second reason I say have a context is so that you can follow your heart. I've seen the results of people who listed what they thought were their strengths and then said \u201cwhat can I do that matches that?\u201d They can have nice, stable, boring careers and make a good living but it can turn miserable and usually does. Instead start from the context of what you would like to do. List the strengths that make people successful doing that and then rate how strong you are in each of the areas. Take a long hard look at the gap between your current capabilities and the successful state and decide if you are willing to pay the price in discipline and work to bridge those gaps. This approach will rarely tell you you can't do something and can help you formulate a plan for success if you honestly decide you should go for it. Don't make a major long term decision without going over what you have worked out with one or two people who know you well. We all have blind spots to both our positive and negative capabilities. When you get feedback don't react, think long on it and and then decide on whether to act on your plan, amend it, or start over. ",

Having control over your own emotions, habits and action. Person who can't control his actions will never be able to control his own life. 5. Lastly, admitting and accepting defeat and mistakes. Probably the greatest power.  Weakness:1. Opposite of all the above. 2. Doing wrong and casting harm, just because someone did that to you. Rise above this petty feeling of grudge there is more to life. 3. Being judgmental. 4. Not knowing or drawing your own limits. Some people cause harm, When they want to do good, but they can't because they don't know their limits. 5. Lastly, blaming the world for your losses and defeats. It's easy to point a finger at the world, try the other way round, the world as you it will come crashing down upon you.

We often perceive ourselves differently than others do. Our perception is our reality, though. It's very interesting to hear what other's have to say . Prepare yourself emotionally to hear anything, but  I have found this to be a very helpful exercise. Use the feedback you receive, both positive and negative, to provide clarity to your own self-understanding.  Empower yourself to build on your strengths and continue to improve.

Or to put it in different, more positive side - you haven\u2019t done it enough times to feel confident enough to do it. About strengths it\u2019s a little bit tricky. You have to actually listen what people praise you for. Also that might be things already so deeply embedded in your personality that from your perspective it is \u201cnormal, and nothing to be proud of\u201d . Only good observer can point it out.

I can be too forgiving too quickly. Another dual strength and weakness: patience (sometimes I have too much patience). I have many strengths and weaknesses and I think some come into play in different scenarios or different chapters in life. Some weaknesses that come to mind at the moment are: over-analyzing, splitting hairs, and the tendency to be lazy or apathetic in social situations because I would rather just sit back and be a spectator instead of a participator in all the social interactions that go on all around me. If there is one constant strength I have, it might be the independence and self acceptance that I developed thanks to having a very strong foundation of support as a child, from two responsible adults who knew how to be excellent parents. A lifetime weakness I\u2019ve had is the below average ability to do small talk and other similar socially normal ways of interaction just for the sake of social interaction. (My brother Napu on the other hand, is a genius at social interaction) ",

Just b/c you excel in an area does not necessarily mean that you have to utilize that strength if it doesn't appeal to you.  For example, I am fairly strong in the kitchen -- I'm the type who doesn't have to follow a recipe and likes to experiment and most of the time my creations receive compliments.  However, I never once considered becoming a professional chef b/c my main interest is computer programming.   So, while it's good to be aware of your strengths, you need to also be aware of what you like.  It's much easier to handle an activity if you want to be there as opposed to simply being good at it.

To make this easier for you, begin with creating a list of your weaknesses and strengths. Take a piece of paper and divide it into two columns. On one column write your strengths and the other your weaknesses. However, this is not yet a surefire way of knowing yourself since we tend to be biased with the opinions we have of ourselves. You want to talk to people you trust and have been over your life for some time. It could be a friend, colleague, or schoolmate. Also, try new things. Dancing, singing, public speaking, or running. These activities may help you identify what you are good at and what you are not. If all fails, you may want to pay for a personality test and get to know about your strengths and weaknesses from a proven system. ",

Jot down your mistakes. Analyze. Focus on options you did not follow. There might have been better solutions but were missed. Reasons of missing should be written. Regular diary-writing should continue. Important events be noted separately on a yearly basis (on separate sheet, if necessary). Learn SWOT analysis technique. Work on yourself before starting an assignment/task. See where are the voids. Fill in through experience. Do SWOT again. How SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) Analysis Works You will be able to identify strengths and weaknesses and much, much more. Thanks for reading. ",

Because all you need to do is relate your skills, your achievements, your education to the job description and role and showcase your strong skills and how you are perfect fit to the position being interviewed. I am sure anyone can support greatest strengths, but answering greatest weaknesses is tough. It can cost you the job. What is your greatest weakness? Most career books tell you to select a strength and present it as a weakness. Such as: \"I work too much. I just work and work and work.\" Wrong. First of all, using a strength and presenting it as a weakness is deceiving. Second, it misses the point of the question. You should select a weakness that you have been actively working to overcome. For example: \"I have had trouble in the past with planning and prioritization. However, I'm now taking steps to correct this. I just started a planner app on my mobile to better plan and prioritize\u2026\" then pull out your mobile to show how you are using the app. Talk about a true weakness and show what you are doing to overcome it. Good Luck!!! ",

If you want to dig deeper, then recollect those moments when you were happy high or really down. These moments represent the situations which make you Excel or succumb (become submissive). Once both of these exercises are done you know what people like/dislike and what you like/dislike. E.g say I was very happy getting selected for an scholarship. That could mean I strength is hard work and diligence and it could also mean that I love appreciation because of which I can do great feats. Identify which one has a greater pull by looking back at more instances where one of the 2 played out. And you will have your answer. Being truthful if also important if you are doing this for self good. If you are doing this for an interview say anything that the crowd likes. ",

Things that do not fit into your mold and you have trouble living with them are your weaknesses. The fact is that all this is your own doing and therefore, illusions. Once you put your mind to it and say to yourself that nothing is beyond achievement if I try hard and long enough, you will, hopefully see a change in your mindset. You must exercise the power of the mind in your favor and not succumb to the negativity that arises due to low self esteem or lack of confidence. Yoour question merely asked how you would know.

When it comes to strengths and weaknesses one of the simplest way to analyze them is to see first what things make your temper rise(weakness) and what emotions make you fight that temper(strengths). For example if you fight with people around you quite quickly then a good listening might be a weakness but if you know how to ask sorry from those people then you have strength of prioritizing relationships than ego. The first thing you have to do is explore yourself, your behavior to different emotions. You can start writing diary for your daily observation. It will definitely work. Weaknesses are as important as strengths. So never feel down on your weaknesses. Whenever a weakness is there, a strength is added to our personality to fight the former. All the best Aditya. ",

            "answer_text": "Strengths: 1. I am a born again Christian. 2. I'm smart enough to pick up some of meaningful things at a moment's notice. I just can teach myself without ever having a frame of reference. This makes my mind ideal for tutoring someone else. 3. I am cynical in thinking and will not agree with someone who has something wrong in mind or the subject matter is wrong, even if it is popular. 4. Can eat almost all vegetables or edible food, even if they are nasty. Weaknesses: 1. Memory used to be great, but now I only can remember numbers kind of good and not much else. If I learned trig for instance, then I might have to learn it again after putting it down a month. Also, if I had to become a teacher and remember all of those students, I don't think I could keep them straight. 2. I am a slower thinker than most, but I do know how to compensate for this in a lot of areas. 3. I don't have much drive. 4. I don't stick to things for a long time. 5. I am more shy than I'd like, but not like I used to be. ",

Personally one such effective which I rely on is an unbiased and simple swot analysis.  These are the four elements of the analysis. One can one by one work upon them. For better picture you can seek help from people in your surroundings who know you very well mad will give you true feedback. Ultimately I believe that you will be able to capitalise on your strengths and minimise or eliminate your weaknesses. Thank you!! ",

Hopefully, we can find a place in the world where we meet all four needs. Before that, there is getting to know yourself. I personally took Jordan Peterson's approach by determining my BIG 5 personality traits, as this would tell me where I'm most likely to fail and succeed. Afterwards I got an indispensable book I would recommend, \u20187 Habits of Highly Effective People'. It taught me the need for interdependence and the value of good relationships. Mainly, I think it starts with figuring out who you are and who you want to be. You will find opportunities that play to your strengths once you know them better. ",

In detail -I have opinions and beliefs. Like everybody else. How did I form those beliefs? By reading a lot on those topics. Then, maybe somewhere, I read that the people I admire also have those beliefs. My mind forms a bias. Now, my mind will not accept anything else. It will close itself. It won\u2019t bother listening to other people's opinions and will not understand them and interrupt them when they speak/express their opinions. So, for example, if I read somewhere that Mark Zuckerberg would never have kids because he considers his career the most important thing, my beliefs about having kids will change (if they were different), and when people try explaining me their opinion (which is different from Mark's and now mine), I won't listen to them and instead start rationalising. It\u2019s a weakness because - Open mindedness is important. If you don\u2019t listen to other people, your relationship with them will get worse.If a billionaire says anything unrelated (or even related) to money, he\u2019s not necessarily correct all the time. (I have a hard time telling this to my brain).Maybe whatever I\u2019ve read on the topic could\u2019ve been biased.In life, there is no set of rules.",

IMHO you might learn about little quirks you never noticed, but if you are a self-critical, open-minded individual, most of what other people can tell you you should already know yourself. I`ve found that a good way to gauge yourself is by looking back on your own life and considering which activities/pursuits you've given up or avoided and for what reason. Most strengths and weaknesses are basically a matter of how far it was pursued. ",

            "answer_text": "See, the same thing which can be strength, can also be the weakness, and vice versa.  Anything which is below the particular desirable limit, is a weakness, and in the same way anything which is above the particular desirable limit, is also a weakness. So that's the point. So everything should be under the desirable limit, to be strength. But I said that the same thing which can be strength, can also be the weakness, so can I replace weakness with strength and vice versa, in above paragraph? Well, yes, thats also will be correct, but, the above paragraph is more correct, for general purposes and goals, however the right opposite of it can also be correct, for a particular purposes and goals. So the qualities one have, is only about more or less correct as per the desired goals, its not about whether the qualities are strengths or weakness, as it depends upon the goal to be achieved. So, a quality, could be a weakness for achieving one goal, and could be a strength for achieving another goal.  For example, there are two sides of a work, one is related to thinking, and another is related to practicality i.e. one side needs thoughtfulness, and another side needs being practical. Every work need some degree of thoughtfulness, and some degree of practicality, and not all work has same proportion of thoughtfulness to practicality. Every work has varying degree of both, some work demands more practicality than thoughtfulness, and some requires more thoughtfulness than practicality. You know that both these qualities are actually strengths, and desirable, but both these, are kind of inversely proportional to each other i.e. if thoughtfulness will be more, the practicality will be less, in proportion, and vice versa. That means you need to sacrifice some of one quality to gain some of other quality, or, whenever you try to gain some of one good quality, you will lose some of the other good quality, which means, though both good qualities are strengths, but trying to gain one will result in losing other in proportion. Thats the truth of it which is difficult to explain and understand, if you don't have an experience or mindset to take notice of that experience. So, if you think that you have weakness in one quality and trying to overcome that weakness, you have to sacrifice the another strength of you, which will be your next weakness. Take into the notice from above paragraph, that both the qualities above mentioned, that  one can have, is actually a strength, and, the thinking that someone thinks that he/she has one weakness in one of the quality, above mentioned as example, is his/her own thinking, because thinking something to be weakness/strength depends on what exactly your work and goal is, and also that one good quality is inversely proportional to other good quality, which means it is an individual who is wrong, who think a quality to be a weakness or strength. Quality of human is a \"Quality\", not a weakness or strength. A quality is a strength or weakness, depending upon the work you do or chose to do i.e. your goal, otherwise it is only a strength, if the work and goal is not considered, or rightly chosen as per your quality. So I would say all the qualities you have is a strength, and try to chose a goal as per your qualities, and don't consider your qualities as a weakness, depending upon your wrong goal. That's the idea behind the true education.  For more clarification, let's have my very own example I am over-thinking person, means I used to think a lot, and continuously think, think, and more think, and I enjoy thinking, and I almost always all the time lost in thinking about something, some problems, some questions, some solutions, some ideas, some philosophies. I find thoughts to be very beautiful, which I cannot quit, and also useful. However this quality of mine is still not at all productive except increased understanding, logicalness, explanatory capabilities, new ideas etc. but it is not at all productive in monetary terms, or making my life any good. Some people knows that over-thinking causes a kind of laziness, and perceived as being idle (I am working though, but my job is only to sit and enjoy), and not contributing much to others life. My over-thinking nature bestow me an ability to share my thoughts, as I am always in front of my computer, reading and writing, but because I am over-thinking person, I can less be a practical person, and that's psychology. My over-thinking and lost in thinking attitude makes me unable to do anything productive on monetary terms over the internet, on which I am being all the time throughout the day. Now you can perceive my over-thinking nature as a weakness, Right? Because you have attached my over-thinking attitude with some work, Right? Laziness is also not a strength, but it is a weakness, am I right? So do you think I need to quit over-thinking? Well, though it seems to be a weakness, I certainly know that this is my strength, and I certainly know, that for understanding, sharing thoughts, being logical, its very necessary to be over-thinking, and many many areas of the world requires over thinking attitudes, though they are very less, and rarely get notice, but I think those are the most important ones, as thinking precedes practice, no matter thinker don't practice its thoughts, generally. And quite frankly, those who are practical and do not think, generally practice thinking of some intellectual work of the other, thats for sure. So thinking is quite an important job in itself, and it requires free time, and mental processing. So what if I leave over-thinking and try to be practical, thinking that over-thinking is a weakness? Well, that way I will lose over-thinking attitude which is much important in some which requires deeper understanding with logical reasoning. What if I try to leave laziness, which is certainly perceived as weakness, but I know there is only two side of work, one of which is related to thinking, and one of which related to practicing. One which relates to thinking is generally perceived as weakness, like say, laziness, lack of concentration (as you need to change perspective for thinking, but focus on one for practicing), lack of memory (that is difficult to explain here), weird (thinker many times are foolish, that people generally don't like), bitter (truthful) slow learner (thinking requires you to be slow to understand. So there are two side of any work, thinking and practicing, and the qualities related to thinking side is generally perceived as weakness, though it is not, and those qualities are not required generally, but very specifically and rarely.  In the same way, qualities related to practicalness is perceived as strengths, and they are, of course, but generally. Actually you only have strengths, and you need to find a proper thing which requires your qualities to be considered or perceived as strengths. So I would say, don't judge yourself by the ability of climbing a tree, when you are a fish. I think, if you can read this comment again, it will certainly help you. Thank you. I am sorry, I wrote really lengthy reply. ",

The self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to positive feedback between belief and behavior. When you feel weakness, you should encourage yourself. Then, we also need to discover our strengths and weakness. Because we are willing to do something, it does not mean we have the ability to do this. Based on the theory of Gladwell, if we are professional to something, we need 10,000 hours training about this. We can recollect the everything trained. Then we can classify all the ability.  Once we classify the ability, we need some time to adjust if it is the truth. We need to think for more time, the example to support the result and unsupported. Through about one week thinging, we are sure the ability.  And the ability is not the eternal, we should adjust it periodly, for example quality. ",

I actually wanted to make a list based on what I find really useful from my observation and research over a long time that I browse the internet. Finally I received a link from a friend and student wanting me to run a test on Free personality test, type descriptions, relationship and career advice to identify my strength and weaknesses based on some psychological theory of the hosts. Truly I was amazed by the accuracy of the result as I'm able to identify some of my strengths as well as weaknessess base on those theories. Not only that, but with some useful suggestion on how to improve by tackling the weakness. I'll suggest you give it a shot too. Good-luck .! ",

I remember telling some 7th graders the story of the demoniac in the Bible who could snap any chains put on him. I had a small piece of chain with me as as an illustrative aid. I asked if anyone there could break such a chain and to my surprise, one boy leaped up, grabbed the chain and did his best to break it. He was a bit demonic himself as he was a discipline problem, so it was nice to see his cocky self-assuredness drain away in public before his pals as he could not break the rather light chain. ",

For each skill/trait/core competency, make sure to set the average standard output, then compare your own output to it. If you\u2019re above average, then it\u2019s definitely a strength point, monitor it, sharpen it, it will benefit you in the future, however, if you leave it unattended, it will fade away and you\u2019ll require to re-sharpen it again in the future if you\u2019re ever to use it. If you\u2019re below/within average, then it\u2019s certainly a weakness point, at that point you\u2019re going to have to make a choice; either pursue it in an attempt to improve, or leave it be and accept that it\u2019s just not your thing. One thing you need to do is, never let your weakness get in the way of keeping your strength points; if you have 2 cars in your garage, one damaged and one working, this doesn\u2019t mean you should drive the good one and leave the other one to rot, neither should you spend your entire time trying to fix the damaged one and forget that you already have another one that\u2019s fully functional. Make sure both cars get their due diligence. Good Luck ! ",

I spent my adult life (for the most part) teaching the handicapped, so I find it difficult to listen to hale and hearty adults whine about minor discomfits.  I get testy when I see someone gaming the system to avoid putting in  honest effort. I tend to lecture.  If someone asks for advice, they're usually in for something akin to a TED talk on the subject at hand and connected areas in which they might have no interest at all.   And chocolate.  Mustn't forget chocolate. My greatest strengths are an ability to compartmentalize my life so that bad stuff  (mostly) doesn't carry over from one part to another, and an ability to be analytical and dispassionate.  Just the facts, please.  I don't hesitate to make decisions, and I am not afraid to fail.  I love to try new things and jump on opportunities to broaden my experience.  I'm pretty smart.  That's in the upvote column.  And I'm educated in all sorts of seemingly random areas, which reflects the time I spent doing research for articles when I was doing content production and to increase my understanding of my students' problems.   That's me in a nutshell (and most of my friends would put the emphasis on \"nut\"). ",

When you really look deep, you can see that your strengths are also your weaknesses! But, over here, I believe that you are looking for qualities in which you are better than others, vs in which you are not. That can be identified when you look at your past performance record.

Secondly, analyze your past successes and failures and if required talk about them also with your close friends. Be in a calm situation and unperturbed mind and do your own analysis as well. In the end, do your own analysis. Use all of the inputs from your friends but trust your instincts. Because no one other than your own self can chart your best path to success. ",

I was great in maths when I was in 5th class and but by the time I reached 10th class I failed two years in maths only.   You only need to learn and understand other people's weakness and you should built on your strengths and in both case one should not advertise. The life will not teach you all your strengths and weaknesses - Its a process and understanding them and learning from our mistakes is our life.  Parents are the prime teachers who tell you where you are going wrong and what are your weaknesses and believe in them, ask mother to know your strengths and ask dad to know your faults and appreciate them.

Instead of improving your weaknesses, widen your circle of friends / advisors / consultants and let them, not you, do what you are not so good at.  You'll eventually find a need that no one else is filling AND where your experts can't find a flaw. That's the business idea you devote more time to research.

Not what you think you can not do but that which, when there was a need to do it, you shied away from and would happily do the same in future. Make no mistake about it, a strength is a strength, even if it is not exactly aligned with your current goal/s. Similarly, a weakness is a weakness, even if it is not currently coming in your way. I hope this has helped. Please feel free to ask your query/ies if any. I shall try my best to address them. ",

Here are some mantras for knowing your strengths and weaknesses from my own experience as a Student, Teacher, Head of the Dept, Project Guide, Mentor, Head of the Institute, Trainer of senior industry personnel, peers, subordinates and seniors at workplace. Mind you all of this needs to be in self learning mode. No one else can identify your strengths and weaknesses.  Fill up some survey forms online which provide you some inputs on your personality traits: MBTI questionnaire, attitude, interpersonal skills, positivity, communication, leadership style etc\u2026.. Once you attempt these questionnaires, you will get a fair idea of what you are. Hope this helps. ",

The strenghts we think we have often are not the ones we actually have or at least the ones others perceive in us. Again, pay close attention to the compliments you receive more often, such as being supportive, a good persuader or a person others can rely on when in need. Some honest feedback can make you no harm once you want to go on a journey of understanding yourself better. Best of luck to you! ",

On the other hand, when the same person suddenly does something kind in return, be it to make it up or simply sincerely, I would also remember their deeds. Even when the time is ripe for revenge, the left hand always seems to restrain the right hand as I remind myself of the good that the individual has also done for me.
