            "answer_text": "A B.S. in Legal Studies is the worst undergraduate major an aspiring law student could possibly choose. Major in something else. Major in anything else. It doesn\u2019t matter what you major in \u2014 as long as you don\u2019t major in Legal Studies. Legal Studies a/k/a \u201cpre-law\u201d is the one subject I actively discourage aspiring lawyers from selecting as an undergraduate major. I\u2019ve written elsewhere on Quora in detail about the reasons why Legal Studies is such a bad choice of major and I\u2019m not in the mood to repeat myself, so I\u2019m going to give you a links to a few of my other answers. Alice Baker's answer to Are law school admissions likely to look down on Legal Studies majors? I want to do this major to shore up my legal research skills. Alice Baker's answer to Why is it that Law Schools and Law firms are telling prospects that Pre-Law is no longer desirable before law school and upon hiring? Here are a few bullet points: Law schools are looking for well-rounded students. Legal Studies will not make you a well-rounded student.It doesn\u2019t matter what you major in, as long as you major in something. When you major in Legal Studies, you\u2019re not really majoring in anything. It\u2019s sort of a \u201claw school lite.\u201d Majoring in Legal Studies won\u2019t give you anything extra to bring to the table.There is a mismatch between the courses that are included in most Legal Studies majors and the courses that aspiring students actually need.Anything the Legal Studies major contains that you need to know as a lawyer, the law school itself will teach you, and the law school will do a better job.The nonlawyer faculty who teach in Legal Studies programs frequently make substantive errors. You will have to unlearn misinformation before you can learn things correctly.Legal Studies majors sometimes lull students into a false sense of security by leading those students to believe they\u2019re more prepared for law school than their classmates. The empirical reality is that Legal Studies majors usually perform worse in law school than students who majored in other disciplines.Instead of majoring in Legal Studies, you should focus on learning material that lawyers need to know, and which law schools don\u2019t teach. This subject matter includes math, business, English composition, formal logic, accounting, and economics.",

            "answer_text": "Attorney Baker\u2019s answer seems to be the most popular amongst law school professors. I am not a law professor so I wouldn\u2019t be qualified to challenge it. I did want to make 2 points, though. The first is that you can certainly use legal studies as your undergrad to go to law school because it only requires some sort of undergrad. You get open electives as part of that degree. You can take the classes she suggested as your electives. I think it would depend on the school as well. I say this because I have had nothing but actual practicing lawyers and a judge as my professors. The common thing that legal studies majors are faulted for is believing that they already know the law when entering law school, and therefore don\u2019t pay attention and study like the other students. The other thing is, why would you get a law degree to get a law degree? You could get your undergrad in business or another field, still go to law school, and if you didn\u2019t make it in law school you could always use your undergrad degree. ",
