            "answer_text": "I feel inclined to answer this as you are probably in the same position I was in before university. TLDR; Yes you can lean either field conceptually, but not at any fundamental level (some notable exceptions are simple quantum phenomenon). I was always bored during my physics or math classes and was actually failing in school until halfway through my 11th year of school. The reason why I fell in love with physics is a ridiculous story better left for another day. The reason I began studying and paving a pathway into university is because I became passionate about my studies, through the help of quantum physics/particle physics; just like you. This passion spilled over into other subjects as I began to reapt the benefits of becoming successful. It all started with some simple research on quantum physics through Wikipedia, find a topic and see how far you can take it. Most of the math can actually be ignored if you're willing to accept things for how they are. The more you begin to do this the easier it becomes when you begin learning the math behind the principles. Start off with something simple like the double slit experiment or the photoelectric effect, then move onto slighter more complex things that help explain these phenomenon without the math (fundamental forces, particle compositions, Feynman diagrams (careful with this one)). If you're ever having trouble, look into YouTube videos, they are excellent in describing things conceptually generally without the use of too much math. In all honesty though it comes down to persistence, you may be like me among many others that was nervous taking their first step but after a few months couldn't imagine never taking that step. Or, you could be like most people interested in these topics that follow it for a few weeks then drop it out of lack of interest; either way, it can't hurt to gain a bit more knowledge. You'll surprise yourself with how much spillover a passion from one subject will give to others. Uf wederleuge, bis am nochschte antw\u00f6rti ",

            "answer_text": "I would say: study the mathematical foundations of Quantum Physics. It hinges on basic fundamental principles of Calculus I and II : knowledge of Power Series, Taylor Series, Limits, Improper Integrals, and Common Derivative + Integral Tables, which you can download any pdf off of Google. Know Differential equations: 1st and 2nd Order Differential Equations; both homogenous, non-homogenous forms. Know Partial differential equations, which mostly involve separation of variables, and the three basic forms: Heat Equation, Wave Equation, and Laplace Equation (\u2018The Big Threes\u2019). Then, there\u2019s Linear Algebra: I can\u2019t stress enough HOW IMPORTANT Linear Algebra is. The entire idea of states of particles and wave functions is predicated on the notion of Eigenvectors, methods which are explored in both Partial Differential Equations and Matrix/Linear Maps/Determinants - Linear Algebra concepts (i.e. Pauli\u2019s matricies for x, y, and z coordinates) \u2026. For every measurement/observation, the system returns an eigenvalue and/or multiple eigenvalues, alloted to each particle that is being observed. Know your Linear Algebra. Do tutorials on Linear Algebra concepts, download ebooks dealing with Linear Algebra. Take an online course in Linear Algebra. Its prob. the most important concept you\u2019ll need towards understanding Quantum Physics as well as Particle Physics.  No, you don\u2019t necessarily need Classical Newtonian Physics in order to understand Quantum Mechanics. As a matter of fact, the notion of classical physics gets thrown out the window with Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle\u2026..CP is only important when understanding the Bohr model (via Hydrogen Atom), only because it hinges on basic CP principles like linear Momentum, Angular Momentum, Simple Harmonic Motion (Oscillator) / frequency. However, that\u2019s it\u2026.know Conservation of Energy, which will take you 30 mins. to understand (maybe less)\u2026\u2026I would also suggest learning about Statistical Mechanics (Partition Functions, Equipartitian Functions, Micro/Macrostates, Entropy) \u2026 That\u2019s important in both particle Physics and Quantum Physics\u2026..Colliding bodies, Conservation of Momentum in CP is not important, when dealing with Particle Physics, because nothing in the physical, \u201cMacro-World\u201d \u201cdecays\u201d into something entirely different (i.e. throwing a basketball towards another basketball, and having those two balls \u2018transform\u2019 into normal tennis ball and an \u201canti-tennis ball\u201d), and that\u2019s what Particle Physics mostly deals with \u2026.Learning Particle Physics almost feels like reading a science fiction novel, because of its inherent abstract nature\u2014but this is how reality operates strangely enough..\u2026Furthermore, I WOULD study Special Relativity extensively before tackling Particle Physics\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Depends. Can you learn kind of decontextualized facts about stuff like electron spin and radioactive decay and stuff like that? Sure; you can get that from a pop-sci book or Wikipedia without too much trouble. But if what you're interested in doing involves the quantitative aspects of the science, as well as actual calculation involving prediction or what-have-you, then probably not, no. For instance, when you're talking about some quantum state, you're going to deal with something called the Hamiltonian operator, which gives you the total energy of the state. But the Hamiltonian is actually a tool imported from analytical (read: classical) mechanics, so I'm not sure you can get that good a hold on it. Or, to take another example, when you're talking about a particle accelerator, you're probably going to need some collision theory, which is a subject most usually developed in the context of classical mechanics. (Note: depending on the velocity of the matter in the accelerator, you might also have to deal with special relativistic effects, so there's also that.) So, tl;dr - if you want to just recite facts about quantum mechanics like the \"I F*cking Love Science\" crowd, then yeah. If you actually want to do science quantitatively, then probably not without at least some classical mechanics, no. ",

Many advanced concepts are taught via analogy with their classical counterparts. If you are missing the classical understanding, then you won\u2019t have any conceptual hooks on which to hang the quantum ideas. But more importantly, you\u2019ll need mastery of the mathematical toolbox that becomes gradually filled while studying those things\u2026 differential and integral calculus\u2026 differential equations\u2026 a smattering of linear algebra\u2026 etc etc. Encountering these things for the first time in the context of quantum field theory will be a huge roadblock to your understanding.
