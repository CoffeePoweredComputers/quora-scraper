            "answer_text": "PES University will start the classes online in the last week of November/first week of December for the first year of 2020\u201321 via Microsoft Teams. You will be given the credentials maybe like few days before classes start. Most probably classes this year will be online itself but you need to attend internals and final sem exam offline (on campus). The reason for offline tests is for easy logistics compared to online exams and the management feels that there can be a lot of malpractices during online tests and the best way to judge a student's capability is by an offline test. All the best!!! ",
