            "answer_text": "Suppose that the present age of A and B = 5x and 4x respectively. After 5 years the age of A will be 5x + 5 and similarly the age of B =4x+5. Given that after 5 years the ratio of their age =11:9. A.T.Q. 5x+5/4x+5= 11/9 45x + 45 = 44x + 55 45x-44x = 55-45 X = 10 Hence the present age of A is 5\u00d710 = 50 years. Let's check then answer. Present age ratio= 50 : 40 = 5:4. After 5 years the age of A and B will be 55 and 45 respectively. Hence the ratio will be = 55:45 = 11:9. ",
