            "answer_text": "You DON\u2019T! You should leave your teacher out of it. Read on. To do it correctly, you must be diagnosed by those who have the professional credentials and can diagnose ADHD properly. Remember that everyone has some components of ADHD. Anyone can get screened for ADHD and will score somewhere on the bell curve. It isn\u2019t until the bell curve score becomes really significant that ADHD enters the realm of a disability. Honestly, if you really think you may have it, then talk to your doctor about getting diagnosed properly. S/he can give you a referral to a clinic that specializes in such disorders and THEY can give you a positive diagnosis. Only then will you hve any leverage with your teachers. This is because they hear every excuse in the book for students not performing and ADHD is the most popular excuse EVER. They will need to see some serious proof. ",

            "answer_text": "Ask your mum to make an appointment with your GP & discuss the difficulties you are experiencing. If the GP considers you need an assessment, they will refer you. You can also get referred by the school to see a school psychologist who can do an assessment on you. If you are diagnosed with ADHD/ADD, then it won\u2019t be necessary to inform your teachers as they will already be informed via the psychologist. I wouldn\u2019t recommend telling your teachers that you \u2018think\u2019 you have ADHD, if you have not been diagnosed. ",
