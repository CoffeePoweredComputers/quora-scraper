            "answer_text": "The correct sequence to study organic 11th class can be something like this: First learn the nomenclature of compounds very clearly and practice it a lot because when we study it, it appears as a cakewalk but when we are somewhere in middle of 12th and get a question on reaction involving nomenclature we gat stuck as now most of us have forgot the rules. This happens to many and you loose marks for a simple reaction because of nomenclature. Ten you will be taught isomerism not in much detail because it comes again in 12th but in a very haunting form. This is where many students make mistake by not studying it thoroughly and thinking that they will do it in 12th but you will not find time in 12th to go through it. So take it seriously and learn it in best way possible in 11th itself. It is very important topic and JEE always asks it by blending it with reactions to see its most horrifying appearance look at 2018 paper of JEE advanced. Next you will be thought GOC. The great GOC. Believe me with ought it you wont we able to solve even a single question in JEE. It contains a vast variety of concepts and is applied in almost every question and takes a months time for completion. So solve this as much as you and learn it as if you are learning ABCD of organic otherwise you will regret when you will be taught reactions. Then learn basic reactions some of which are dehydration, hydrolysis, Finklestine, chlorination etc. etc. t name a few an practice. After that you can move to Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes and learns some basic mechanisms and do not forget to learn their special reactions and properties. Be sure that you are thorough with each and every concept of NCERT ALL THE BEST ",

            "answer_text": "Organic chemistry is one of the most interesting and fun part of chemistry. And easy too, if you learn it well. But learning organic chemistry has to go in a sequence. If not one will find organic chemistry too tough to master. So, the learning sequence should be like this, Nomenclature (order of choosing principal functional group is very important here)learn to split and write the structure when a name is given. For example, 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid, if we split it as- 2- Hydroxy Propan- Oic-acid. This will help a lot to crack IUPAC names provided you know nomenclature well.What is functional isomerism? what is metamerism? What is tautomerism? Learn isomerism concepts.Optical and geometrical isomerism ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR COMPETITIVE EXAMS. So, I recommend you to have a tight grip on concepts before moving further.Electronegativity concept( it\u2019s hardly a paragraph, but plays important role in organic chemistry)I-effect, M-effect, Hyperconjugation ( WHOLE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY STANDS ON THESE PILLARS)preference order when it comes to I-effect, M-effect, hyperconjugation( M-effect comes first, next comes hyperconjugation and then comes I-effect)Acidity and basicity order of given compounds(this is important for competitive part)Ortho-para directing and meta directingtypes of fission-homolytic, heterolyticMechanisms- electrophilic addition, nucleophilic addition, electrophilic substitutions, nucleophilic substitution, anti addition, syn additionOnce mechanisms are learnt work on Hydrocarbons chapter of class 11. You can understand and crack the mechanisms of almost all reactions on your own. This is the fun partThe ones which you can\u2019t write mechanism for, which are catalyst drived ones, should be memorised.Now comes the reagent part, make a list of reagent, learn mechanisms for each reagent actions. Just learn and fix it in your mind. You don\u2019t have to write those mechanisms every time you solve a problem. For example, Sulphuric acid is a dehydrating agent. It provides a proton which combines with -OH group and eliminates water and later that proton is derived back at the end of the reaction.You can see this reaction when you convert an alcohol into an alkeneMemorise the named reactionswhen you are perfect with all the above steps, go through NCERT, which will be a piece of cake. You will understand each and everything clearly.You can get these in sequence in Arihant Publications. You can also refer to someother publications for organic chemistry itself. But, learning should always be in a sequence. Without knowing the mechanisms, just cramming the reactions will make it no different than inorganic chemistry. Understand. Follow the sequence. Learn. Don\u2019t cram the reactions. This will make you fall in love with organic chemistry. Organic chemistry is never a dry or a boring part of chemistry. If you get hold of concepts, organic chemistry is just as fun as your favorite subject is. Hope you found this helpful :) ",
