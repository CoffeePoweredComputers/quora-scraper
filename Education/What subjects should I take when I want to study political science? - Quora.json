            "answer_text": "There will be a standard curriculum for the major, with certain required courses and your choice of several more within the department. You will probably be required to take at least introductory micro- and macro- economics, but I would recommend taking as many more economics courses as you can possibly fit in. There is very little that has anything to do with politics and government that is very far removed from money. Taking enough accounting to understand basic financial statements will help, too. Most people who are successful in anything that is related to political science are good communicators. You will certainly have to take Freshman English courses, but if you have the opportunity to take an advanced composition and/or a business and professional writing course, do so. It might also be useful to get some journalism under your belt, even if that isn\u2019t going to be your career path. Public speaking will probably be a required course. If you can take some additional courses in rhetoric and in interpersonal communication, do so. Political science is also about people, so you need to understand them. Courses in psychology, sociology, and cultural anthropology are all useful. Geography is another useful subject, and these days so is environmental science. History has traditionally been a very important foundation for political science, so be sure to include some of that. If there is any possibility at all that you are going to be working with non-anglophone populations at any point in your career, then having mastery of a major foreign language like French, Spanish, or Mandarin will certainly have its advantages. You are probably going to be required to take an introductory statistics course. Statistics is a hugely useful tool in politics and government, and it is worth taking additional or more challenging courses to attain a higher level of mastery. A student who has gotten as much of all these things as they possibly can will certainly be very well prepared for any of many different careers that are appropriate for poli sci majors. ",

            "answer_text": "The most obvious answer is that you will want to take courses in political science, but I assume that you are asking about courses in other disciplines that will help you to better understand the content in the political science courses. Several very good suggestions have been given in the other responses (Economics, Philosophy, History, etc.), but let me suggest a couple of others. Sociology has already been suggested, but Cultural Anthropology is a either a good alternative to this or a good complement. Both of these disciplines lend themselves well to qualitative research and analysis. Qualitative research does not enjoy quite the same level of acceptance within the discipline that it used to enjoy, but is still done, is often much more interesting, and raises a lot of the important questions that form the foundation for quantitative research. Quantitative research and analysis are the major tools in the discipline today, so a solid foundation in math (or maths) and statistics is pretty much required. If you are serious about pursuing political science, learn to use one or two of the major software packages out there (R, SPSS, SAS, Stata, etc.). The suggestions for History, Philosophy, Economics, and the like are all good foundations for any of the subdisciplines of political science, but History and Philosophy are particularly well suited if you want to explore political theory. Any of the hard sciences are useful, but more for their methodology than for their content. Unlike the hard sciences, political science is probabilistic rather than deterministic (y-amount of water is produced from combining x-amounts of hydrogen and oxygen, but y-amount of economic growth does not always result from x-amounts of tax cuts), so in this respect it probably resembles meteorology more than physics.
