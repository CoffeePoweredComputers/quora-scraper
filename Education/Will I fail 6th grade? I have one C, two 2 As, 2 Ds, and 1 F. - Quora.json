            "answer_text": "You probably won't fail this year. Schools tend to push kids on to the next grade regardless of academics unless they fail almost everything. However, there is a good chance you will fail grade 7 or any of the other grades between now and high school. Subject matter gets progressively harder as the grades increase. Try to fix any problems that are leading to your low grades so that you can make it through high school without failing out. ",
