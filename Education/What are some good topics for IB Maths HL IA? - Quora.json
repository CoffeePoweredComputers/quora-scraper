            "answer_text": "Choosing a good topic is tricky. I'd recommend a modelling exploration, though, if I really have license to recommend anything. A theoretical exploration is difficult because quite often you'll only be rehashing the footsteps of mathematicians before you (you are not expected to invent new mathematics). Modelling has the simultaneous benefits of being a) relevant to you and your life, if you choose to make it so and b) easier to score highly on for the personal engagement criterion, because you'll be forced to contrive your own approaches and ensure, via your own devices, that you consider possible pitfalls. Read: no possibility of cheating with Google, because ideally, what you're doing in a modelling exploration will not have been done before. Here are some nice modelling ideas that I've seen: Does hitting the 'magic square' on a basketball backboard indeed guarantee a shot?How might I use double-slit interference in order to diminish the perceptible noise in my room due to the neighbour's woodsaw?Can I model the sound wave of Twinkle Twinkle being played on the piano using only function transformations?(Thanks for the A2A.)

            "answer_text": "Most of the topics you'll find online, I think, are not interesting and the use of math is poor and basic. When I struggling to come up with a topic, I came to the conclusion that I had to go further, talking about what IB math covers. That's because IB's math isn't that close to real life, but university's math is. The most interesting topic is the use of Fourier series. It isn't that difficult and because I like math and physics, it sounds like a good idea to me. You can compare the sound of two \"similar\" instruments, piano and keyboard, and there you go, 20/20. A friend of mine is predicting moon's movement with observation and he's just finished doing his functions. Hope it helps! ",
