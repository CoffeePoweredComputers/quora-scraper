            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see why not. I had sex ed in public school and I don\u2019t see what the problem is. In Estonia, as far as I know, it is part of the national curriculum and I don\u2019t know anyone apart from one classmate who hadn\u2019t finished high school at the time, who became pregnant before they had at least graduated high school or were about to obtain or had obtained a degree or some sort. The point of sex ed is to prepare young people for independent life and that includes intimate life. You need to know the tools and how to use them so that you get to decide when to have children, if you want them, among other things. It\u2019s important to leading an enjoyable, happy, healthy and fruitful life. You also get taught about how the reproductive system works so there is no stigma, it\u2019s normalized and people can talk about it without shame. Boys know how girls\u2019 bodies work and vice versa. This means there\u2019s no shame, misunderstanding, false and harmful ideas or fear. You know what\u2019s up, you feel secure and all that\u2019s left is to have fun exploring. I haven\u2019t ever been in a situation where having had sex ed in school has been a disadvantage. Nor do I know of any schoolmates or classmates who\u2019ve felt so. I knew how to use condoms and where to get them, where I could get pills and knew, in general, how they worked and what their alternatives are. I even saw high schoolers with the patch, so it\u2019s safe to say they knew the alternatives, too. I support sex ed for the very reason that it helps people be knowledgeable and feel safe when they want to have sex, whenever that may be, and by talking about it in school, you alleviate the awkwardness and show people that it\u2019s okay to talk about it. To be fair, sex ed in Estonia is taught within a subject that teaches all kinds of things about living in a society - what grief is like, manners, family relationships, respect and so on and so forth - everything to do with everyday life that sex is part of, like it or not. Reproduction and sexual organs are discussed in middle school biology too as part of the national curriculum. It would be, sorry, idiotic to strike sex ed off just because it makes someone uncomfortable. Life would be pretty dull indeed if every time we felt uncomfortable, the whole of society needed to dance to our tune. ",
