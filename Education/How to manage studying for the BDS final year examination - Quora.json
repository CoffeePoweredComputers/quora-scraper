            "answer_text": "It becomes pretty challenging for final year students to juggle both academics and patients. Here is a simple guide for an average student to make through final year smoothly. 1. Regularity There are no fixed hours or defined parameters, but one thing for sure is regularity in studies. Do qualitative study regularly, so that it doesn\u2019t pile up in the end. 2. Patient quota While this varies from college to college and department to department, patient quota is one of the biggest worries of a final Prof Student. Complete your patient work and records on time, so that you have time for theory revision later. 3. Midterms Most of the students take midterms very lightly and only study before send up exams. But, in fact midterms act as a syllabus reducing agent by preparing you step by step. Be sincere and appear in them with good preparation. 4. Don\u2019t panic Seeing this much amount of syllabus, a lot of students lose their morale. Calm down, clear your head and take baby steps by completing one topic at a time. 5. Notes There are 8 subjects each with a clinical and theory aspect, hence it is very difficult to consult the reference books during exams. So it is a wise decision to make good notes which will help you revise in time while giving you the best from all the books. 6. Seniors Establish a good rapport with your college seniors, because many a times they will guide you in a way no teacher can. They have been through the same situation as yours. Learn from their mistakes but don\u2019t solely rely on them. 7. Be professional Whenever you are with a patient, be professional in your conduct. Do your work honestly and don\u2019t speak ill about your colleagues, your seniors or staff. It is up to you to maintain a doctor\u2019s dignity and establish a trust-based relationship with your patient. If u feel inadequate in dealing, consult your senior staff immediately 8. Dress code This is not of much importance in other fields but in dentistry, a lot depends on it. Follow the college dress code and appear approachable, humble and dignified in front of your external. 9. Be positive Now days a lot of students are taking drastic measures to deal with the pressure, but things don\u2019t need to be that way. Remember, like all times, this will also pass. So stay motivated and be positive. After all, you are going to be a doctor anytime soon!! ",

            "answer_text": "If one start preparing 60 days prior to the final exam , we can get through BDS but actually it's the cases and quota that will make one think WHY DID WE OPT FOR IT? (EDHUKU?) All we require is little bit of effort from our side to finish the quota despite all these(headaches,disappointments, back stabbing, hatred, drama) . Oooooooooooffff!!! At the end of 5 successful years we emerge out as Dentists trying to figure out the TOUGH part of \u201cBEING A BDS GRADUATE\u201d ( sounds creepy ryt? ) So it's not tough to study BDS it's tough to survive as a BDS graduate IN INDIA .. \u263a\ufe0f ",
