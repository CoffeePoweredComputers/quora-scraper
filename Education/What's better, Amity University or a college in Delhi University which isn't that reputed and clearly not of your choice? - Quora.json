            "answer_text": "Firstly, think about the course that you want to get into. And not the college. In case you\u2019re getting a college that provides you the course you want, but isn\u2019t reputed, as you might feel, pls don\u2019t let it bother you. Because in the long run, you wouldn\u2019t want to do something you don\u2019t like and enjoy. As far as DU is concerned, there are a few colleges, which are not that popular, but have come up with new campuses, with excellent infrastructure and labs. No matter which college you\u2019re from , you get the same degree. Before jumping to a conclusion, discuss with your seniors, parents or elder siblings about the course that you intend to pursue. And then join the college, which suits your interest. ",

            "answer_text": "In this case, go for Amity. I am not saying this because I am a student at Amity University myself but because 2 years ago, I was in the same situation. I was getting DU colleges which were\u2019t very reputed. When I visited their campus, to be very honest, it was bad. The buildings were not properly constructed, the place was very gloomy. Moreover I was not getting subject of my choice. At Amity, I got the subject I wanted to study. The campus is huge. The people are very active. There are almost all the facilities you can ask for. But the most important, they are very strict about studies. Also the faculty is good. I have presented my opinion. I hope the answer helps :) ",
