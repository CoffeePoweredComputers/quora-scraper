            "answer_text": "Safety of students. Despite having ~10% of the US's student population in private schools, 6% of school shootings have occurred at a private school since 2000(https://www.cato.org/blog/are-shootings-more-likely-occur-public-schools). Private schools can implement security that is different than what the school district recommends. They don't have to do frequent active shooter drills that traumatize students. They can simply subject the teachers to training days and drills when students aren't present. Better academics at selective private schools. This is especially true in the South. You either live in the only good school district in your county/state region, or you send your kids to private school, where the curriculum is more rigorous and there are more AP courses. No one is going to dismiss the rigor at schools like Gulliver, where a lot of students attend elite colleges after graduation. If you want your child to attend a top college and you're not an alum, prep schools are the easiest route in--lots of desirable activities, rigorous academics, and opportunities for internships. Religion or political views. Some parents don't want their children to be taught certain things at 6 years old, when they cannot reason through their own beliefs vs. those of others. Having the sex talk with a 6-year-old would not be my first choice, and I don't blame parents who want to wait until middle school to discuss sexual orientation, premarital sex, and transgender issues. And those who do have gay children or transgender children who don't want to be in the middle of a political battle at a public school might want to choose a school more suitable to their child's needs. Like a private one that is more accepting of these kids or prides itself on diversity. Similarly, a 6-year-old isn't going to understand why he can't pray to Jesus out loud in school like he does at home. ",

            "answer_text": "I was state-school educated all the way down, but many, if not most, of the people I\u2019m now around at university were private school educated. Firstly, it\u2019s worth noting that most of these people were \u2018sent\u2019 to private schools, rather than given the choice by their parents. Here are some of the reasons I\u2019ve heard: Better education. This includes everything like the local comprehensive being too rough or having a los OFSTED rating, smaller class sizes at private schools, expanded curriculum, etc.They could afford it and figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt. This is surprisingly common. I hear a lot of, we had the money so why not?They wanted to do a different certificate. For example, the IB rather than A-levels, or an international standard which isn\u2019t on offer at state schools.They wanted an all girls / boys school. There isn\u2019t really single-sex education in state schools.Tradition. The parent was sent to a fancy private school and they wanted their child(ren) to have the same experience. I know people who were at Eton and this is usually the cited reason.Prestige and status. This is a pretty big one to be honest, although it\u2019s normally not cited directly. People say other things that sort of lead to this. I know people who went to private schools to be socialised \u2018correctly\u2019, prepared for getting into Oxbridge, and so they could say they did.Boarding schools. Some people\u2019s parents wanted them to go to boarding schools, and these are all private. The kindest reason for this is the parents travelling a lot and it just making sense. I think there are probably a few people I know whose parents just wanted them somewhere else most of the time.There are probably others, but these are ones I\u2019ve heard. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the default position is going to the local state school. The next option would be going to another non-private school, like a grammar school or a sixth form college that, for example, offers the IB. Then, after that, is going to a fee-paying private school. Statistically, this is about right in terms of the population of the UK, but I\u2019ve had to stop making that assumption at uni, because so many of the people I\u2019m around went to private schools.
