            "answer_text": "To be honest, it differs for every student. Few students are really in love with online classes as they are able to work with their own timetable and are comfortable being at home. They are able to find time for everything they want to do and are really comfortable asking questions to teachers through virtual classes. On the other hand\u2026there are students who truly hate online classes. These students aren\u2019t able to concentrate on their classes , they prefer being in a real classroom, where they are able to communicate with their teachers easily. Speaking through a device scares the shit out of them\u2026so they pretty much stay invisible throughout the class and never ask their doubts. I am a 11th grader who is experiencing online class during this time of Covid-19 and I personally feel that online classes isn\u2019t comfortable for a majority of students. Being an introvert I hate talking to others through a device (texting is way better). I also feel that grade 11 is entirely different comparing to grade 10(CBSE) . While going through a huge transition most of us feel that the subject is complex and have so many doubts. Most students are in a helpless situation. I have been staying at home for almost 8 months since completing my 10th boards . I also shifted to a new school which makes it even harder for me to make new friends and interact with the new teacher. The only thing I followed during online class is that I took really good notes. With that I was able to study later in the evening . I watched my recorded classes once again and read my text books. I\u2019m pretty much learning all by myself. We also have tests every week on Sunday (which is sad) , most students copy everything from google, But I restrict myself from doing that. Students really hate online classes\u2026.Everyone is having a hard time because of Covid-19 and I hope it gets better and I also hope that schools can open again. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Good Evening well to answer your question, if you ask a question like this to students they would answer that \u201c we don't even want to go to school.\u201d According to me, online classes are not that efficient for a student. Going to school and sitting in front of the teacher. And being able to face the teacher in the classroom, does not give the feeling in the online classes. Students are facing bigger issues in online classes. You don\u2019t get the studying environment while attending online classes. The difference is that before the COVID attacked the world, students use to love to go to the school and meet their teachers and talk with them face to face. But now if you ask students if they prefer online classes then they would definitely say NO. But the good thing is that COVID has given us plenty of time to study, and I think this is the number one advantage the COVID has given to students and to many people out there. But students liked being in the house during lockdown for the first few months but now if you ask any student about their online classes then they would say \u201cI want to go out\u201d. This is the issue for each and every people out there, not just for students but also for other people. I would definitely say that going to school is the best. You may hate waking up early and going to school in a HURRY. But I think that is the best option for a student. Thank you for reading the answer and have a good day!!! ",

            "answer_text": "As a student myself, i can tell you that online classes suck. There's no interaction between the students which makes these classes very boring. I can guarantee you that more than half of the class is not paying attention and are doing something else on their devices. The only thing that i like about these classes is that, and I'm not proud of it, YOU CAN CHEAT ALL YOU WANT DURING THE EXAMS! There's no way they'll know! My class teachers were shocked to see the marks. Even the girl who always failed in maths, got full marks! Our teacher told us that in the english exam, she was shocked when she saw that most of the essays are the same(even I don't understand this, how can you copy an essay?) This is a great advantage for students to score good marks! So some may like this way of teaching better. One more good thing is that you don't have to wear the school uniform!(we don't have to turn on our camera) just wear whatever you want and look as ugly as u want and nobody will ever know!! Now, THE WORST THING about these classes is that some students are taking them so lightly that they're not studying at all and their academic progress is 0. They don't have to worry about exams because they can cheat and so they're on cloud 9! Now this will impact them very much in the next session or whenever the schools reopen. All in all, for me, the normal way of teaching is wayyyy better and i do miss going to school! Hope this lockdown ends soon so that i can go out and meet my friends!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I am a Chinese student, and I have experienced a 3-month period of online course(from Feb to May) under quarantine because of the coronavirus. I, and most of my friends, do not like the online-oriented course. Although online course save a lot of time, especially the commuting time, the loneliness is terrible. Try to imagine, you were studying in your own room, and staring at your laptop for a whole day. In the first couple of weeks, we felt that it was fun because we can cheat in the test and close the camera, however, believe me, this feeling is absolutely terrible if you have to remain this status for 3 months. Nevertheless, online courses make self-study and self-thinking more available and more efficient. As a \u2018fast learner\u2019, I feel that I could learn the new knowledge even faster and easier than in school. The lack of socalising and interruptions in schools actually increase my efficiency. After May, in China, most of the high schools were allowed to open but staffs and students should wear a mask(government provide 2 mask for each student per day). I felt that my efficiency decreased again but I truly felt happier, because I could hang out with my friends again. ",

I can make sure, most or some of the students use other apps bunking class. I myself have done twice\ud83d\ude05. It's very irritating to sit in one place for at least so many hours. It's even harmful. The phone is also harmful more our body and mind. Online classes, I can't even be attentive because our teachers only ask questions to whom those who have good internet connection. I feel sad about it. So I think, they should stop these drama. Cuz it's harming more than being useful. I hope you get my point. ",
