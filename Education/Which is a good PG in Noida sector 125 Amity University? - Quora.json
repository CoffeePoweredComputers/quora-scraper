            "answer_text": "There are many PG home ( To-let) facility rooms in Noida, Sector 125 inside Raipur (Village). Since you want to know about some good PG names I can list that down here But I will recommend you to (physically) go at that place and find it yourself ( which you think is best of your choice). Because it is too early to say about any PG their facilities, rent, accommodation etc.( it changes from year to year) and your requirement also matters. There are always some new construction going every single year for new PG homes or To-let facility rooms in Noida. Therefore it is better to check that in by going there. However as I said I can recall few names which I know during my time in University. (some of my batch students used to stay at) BS PG Abhishek PG Shri Krishnakunj PG ( For Boys) Vikrant Palace Yash PG As of now I can recall only these names I will edit if I come to recall any new one. But as I said it will be better if you check in by (yourself) going there. Hope it helps !!! ",
