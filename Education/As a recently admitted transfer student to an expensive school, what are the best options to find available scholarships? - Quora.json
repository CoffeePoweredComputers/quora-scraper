            "answer_text": "Thank you for taking the time to read my question. I look forward to reading any helpful insight and sage advice that might be offered. My situation is fairly straight forward, after retiring from the military, yours truly grew tired of going to work at places like St Paul Island, Alaska, and Afghanistan to make good money. As a gift to myself, I vowed to break away from my long career in meteorology to pursue a creative path. Thus, I decided to quit my NATO job, go back to school. After completing an Associates degree, I applied to two schools, both great, schools and one is considered as a public Ivy School (UNC at Chapel Hill\u2019s School of Media and Journalism) and the other is a private Ivy (Columbia). As a veteran, my education benefits are sublime, but to attend Columbia, I need to look at every option available to ensure not racking up a substantial school debt. The challenge I currently face is that nearly most online scholarship search pages (that I\u2019ve encountered) seem more about advertisements or creating subscription accounts and not all that useful to check for the availability of scholarships. Therefore, to narrow down my search, does anyone have any advice on the best avenues to pursue learning about the seemingly infinite number of academic scholarships available? Thank you for both your time and consideration, Darrell ",
