            "answer_text": "Not really.  You should come to embrace the fact that you aren't going to feel motivated to do most things.  Being interested, or curious, or passionate is a luxury.  You have those things sometimes, and you have to get a whole lot of crap done in the meantime. Get your homework done.  You won't feel good while doing it.  You won't feel productive.  You'll feel better after you do it, but you never feel better while you do it.  You don't have to feel good to do something.  You don't have to be motivated to do a good job.  In fact, most of the time you'll just have to do your work, and find some way to get through it.  In most menial jobs, you don't even have to smile, or be happy, you just have to get your task done. This is similar to people who want to feel motivated to go the gym.  People always ask me, \"How do you motivate yourself?\"  I don't.  I hate going to the gym.  I am not motivated to go to the gym.  I just go, and get it done.  I just know that if I don't grind through the workouts and do the bare minimum, then my physical state will one day stop me from accomplishing something that is important to me.   This is similar to people who ask how to not be shy, or how to be brave.  You never stop being anxious, having self-doubt, or experiencing fear.  It's just that you operate while having the emotions.  Nothing ever changes. Give up on trying to feel motivated.  Just get your shit done.  Motivation is a luxury.  Being able to \"grind\" through a task and get it done is worth more.  Stop needing to feel the right way to do things.  Instead, love and cherish when you're in the right emotional state to do something. ",

            "answer_text": "Good for you.   Rebel, and give the middle finger to what everybody says.  Seriously. However, that won't solve the question of what you're going to do with your life, yes?   If you listen to people tell you what you should be doing, it gets very noisy... there's lots of recommendations, yes?    Who are you?   That is the biggest of the big questions.   I suggest that it's the question of your lifetime -- you got born in order to answer that question, in a sense.   So, anything which doesn't seem like it might help in that quest is a waste of time, probably.   Not always... sometimes you find yourself lurking behind a gray door which looked utterly uninteresting from the outside.    But still -- the point is that if you're going to spend a bunch of energy looking behind every grey door, it's going to be a long process. You can get some clues by learning to distinguish the essence of what \"lights you up\".   What experiences have you had in life where you sensed something larger than yourself at work?   Unity has a funny way of leaving calling cards with strangely-scrawled names: you might hear the voice of the infinite in the shape of a child's smile or a song written long ago.   You've got to understand the message -- what is being ignited by that flame? Follow that, whatever that is.   Get it to expand, serve it.   Whatever that is will be the keyhole.   You don't have the key, you have to make that out of whatever is laying around.   But don't give up, and don't forget to keep your middle finger extended to those who tell you that you're crazy or that you're going to die of starvation. ",
