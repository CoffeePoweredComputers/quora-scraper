            "answer_text": "As far as I am aware of, no. The only thing that seems to matter (and I could be mistaken) is your ability to pass a university\u2019s entrance test. Your performance in high school, as a point of reference, does not seem to have any real bearing on admissions. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you can sleep your way through school (I\u2019m looking at you, every single one of my students). Adolescence is about habit forming. If you have poor habits in school and never learned anything, you aren\u2019t likely to pass the incredibly difficult university admissions tests (as an aside, it\u2019s said that if you have enough knowledge to pass the test, you basically already have the degree). So while your grades themselves might not matter, the work needed to get those grades will. ",

            "answer_text": "This is me assuming you're an American student. I have one word for you. GOOGLE. That\u2019s all it took for me to answer your question and I did it because I was honestly prepared to be like, what the heck is wrong with you? Because what popped in my head immediately was, if you don\u2019t have good grades how do you expect to be able to keep up with Japanese education? While grades don\u2019t always represent someone\u2019s intellectual capabilities it does somewhat show a persons knowledge on a subject. And if you have really bad grades, you need to catch up. Theirs a reason why Japan is ranked one of the highest in education, their kids study. While the requirements to enter a Japanese college don\u2019t include grades and it is said they take it a little easy with foreigners this doesn\u2019t mean you should slack off. It also doesn\u2019t mean that the schools you apply to won\u2019t see your grades, you still have to hand in a transcripts accord their requirements and still are required to take an entrance exam like any other students and if you didn\u2019t do well in high school it may be difficult to pass this exam. But these are just my thoughts. Best of luck! ",
