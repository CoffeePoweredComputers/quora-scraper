I recently submitted my claimbills again for a new session easily and this is how.Keep your scanned docs in .jpeg/.jpg and should be below 500KB as safe side. Use MS paint for that! (Open paint and use Ctrl+W)Just after submitting a claim bill (say, claimbill-2), it will show please fill Form-2 (again). JUST IGNORE THAT! this is just a wrong dialog box. Ignore it and Continue to the next Claim bill (claimbill-3) and follow up.Finally after submitting the report card, it shall say, all bills submitted. note down the reference number for future use. JOB DONE! ~JD ",
