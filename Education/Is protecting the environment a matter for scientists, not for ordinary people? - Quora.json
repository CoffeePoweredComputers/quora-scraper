            "answer_text": "Scientists give us the facts, the public uses those facts to vote responsibly and the politicians adjust the checks and balances to achieve the desired outcome. That's how it's supposed to work. In environmental matters, the scientists have done their job. But the voting public and our elected representatives have failed disastrously. For issues concerning environmentalism, scientists are our harbingers. They are the ones who distill raw data into conclusions and projections. They are the ones who are best equipped to warn us about the environmental consequences of our choices. Individuals can make personal choices like not smoking, not buying aerosols with CFCs, not using leaded gasoline or not buying electricity from providers who generate their product from fossil fuels. But these are ineffectual bandaid solutions that only penalise those who try to do the right thing. To effectively tackle our major environmental challenges, the voting public has to listen to the scientists and vote for politicians who have a genuine commitment to meaningful action. Scientists are the specialists. They are the rationalists. They devote their entire careers to a narrow field of study to become high-level experts. They tackle complex questions and problems that most of us would find inconceivable and incomprehensibly difficult. They embrace doubt and uncertainty, discussing and debating amongst themselves for decades. When no consensus can be reached, the issue remains unresolved. The scientific community doesn't pretend to be more knowledgable or certain than it is. That's what makes the scientific consensus so reliable as an accurate interpretation of reality. This is also what makes those who reject the scientific consensus for entirely political or ideological reasons, such a contemptible breed of liars. Never trust an ideologue who disputes education, research and facts with volume, repetition and an unshakable faith in their own infallibility. ",

            "answer_text": "scientists are one of the biggest problems with environmental damage. Almost all damage is in their hands. One could say that science is at the heart of the problem. The environmental damage at the hands of science and government is far larger than anything any of the problems they wave in our faces. 528 atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons created a massive amount of heat and altered the atmosphere forever. There were also 1500 underground nuclear tests. The ones in nevada made their underground water supply to radioactive for use and made a whole region of nevada look like a moonscape of craters. This is only a scratch of the surface of the damage done by science. ",
