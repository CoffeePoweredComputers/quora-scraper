            "answer_text": "Studies not confined by the arbitrary distinctions between disciplines. Skills, people, and knowledge from all areas and walks of life are synthesized in a team to solve a problem spanning everyone\u2019s unique backgrounds, and investigate a big question to find new knowledge. It is the freeing of the intellect to develop its greatest potential. Take for instance the fields of systems engineering and astrobiology. Systems engineering is the study of how a system is designed, developed, tested, and implemented to serve a purpose for people. A system is a designed arrangement of components, such that the whole has capabilities beyond its components. Making the best systems in the best way requires knowledge of the mechanics of the system itself, as well as knowledge of the environment in which the system will function, knowledge relating to its purpose (from my experience, usually space science), knowledge of budget management, project management, outreach, administrative stuff, and team psychology. All of this knowledge is traditionally kept far away from each other in various scattered academic and professional silos called \u201cdisciplines\u201d. But it must come together to put a rover on Mars. Similarly, astrobiology integrates fields like planetary geology, stellar astrophysics, climatology, microbiology, and biochemistry to study the habitability of various envirionments beyond present-day Earth. This includes other planetary bodies in the Solar System (many Mars missions have had astrobiology components or objectives), exoplanets, the universe itself, and past/future Earth. I\u2019ve mostly cited Mars-related examples, but the possibilities are endless. Let your imagination run wild. Break free of the compartmentalization. You will have a more valuable skillset and experiences as a result\u2014but the real motivation is the sheer intellectual satisfaction. ",

Another way to define this is the way we amalgamate, blend, unify the facts, statics, figures of more than two disciples in order to gain something very valuable from learning point of view is Interdisciplinary. If you part the Interdisciplinary-it results in \u2018inter\u2019 and \u2018disciplinary\u2019. Where Inter defined as- in the midst of, mutually. Whereas Disciplines is described as- a branch of knowledge, specific area of academic concentration. Educational websites which can help you: Emerging Interdisciplinary Domains The Time we are living in is changing rapidly by each passing days and learning everyday new things, only benefit ourselves for growth in some or another way. What are the Interdisciplinary fields which are emerging at highest levels: Cyber Security: So as to achieve the pace which has been increase in past recent years towards the change in the world of of technology `and to motivate and directs the different engineering system.Social system scientist: The interdisciplinary has changes the earlier way to interact with social, ethical and moral systems.How to focus on multi disciplinary: Build Your Profile for College Admissions Many more disciplines will undergo changes in coming days as- Biometric, living engineering, complex engineering, etc. There are a lot future opportunities in interdisciplinary: 1. Autonomous automobile (which can driverless cars, trains) 2. Artificial intelligence based Factories gaining maximum outputs. 3. Analytical and Reasonable machines. 4. Multidimensional Holographic cameras. In the coming years we will witness a advancement in every field due to regular advancement technology. #interdisciplinary #univadmithelp #Emerging Domains ",
