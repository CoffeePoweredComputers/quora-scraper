            "answer_text": "Scoring good marks in English Literature demands a bit of hard as well as smart work. The hard work is before the examination. You should have a sound understanding of all the topics that are scheduled for your upcoming examination. I will list down some techniques which I followed to fetch great marks. For poems \u2014 be clear about the author, his intention of writing the poem and on what theme is the poem based. It really helps to know certain technicalities like the metre on which the poem runs and what are the figure of speech used in it. Whatever the question a clever mention of these things will definitely impress your teacher.Plays and novels are almost same except that in plays you have to remember which event occurred in which act of the play. Be very thorough about this.mentioning the act number and the scene number with all the characters present in the particular scene is always a good bet even if you don't know a lot about the play. Secondly again remembering the age to which the author belongs and the background in which the play/novel was written is crucial.There may be other topics like Literary Criticism or History of English Literature or Language. These are mostly fact based topics and you need to prepare notes on each and every chapter because they help form a strong foundation of the subject for you. Please do not ignore these especially History of English Literature because it is like the subject Mathematics of our school days. The more you try to escape it's clutches the more tightly it will grasp back at you with its claws! Don't be scared. English is a subject to be enjoyed and loved. The more you love it the better it will serve you in the future.All the best!",

            "answer_text": "Start by reading the assignments listed in your course calendar. Actually read them. Don't put the anthology under your pillow and hope to absorb the works by osmosis.  While you are reading them, take a pencil and mark anything that catches your eye, like words you are unfamiliar with, interesting phrasing, ideas that don't seem to fit with the rest of the theme or style, etc.  If the class is discussion based, wade on in. Take some chances with your interpretations. Back the argument with evidence from the work itself. Maybe do a little research on the context in which the work is written. For example, if you are studying \"Red Badge of Courage\" having some context for the American Civil War is helpful. If you are studying Faulkner, some knowledge of the South after the Civil War makes all the difference.  Make sure that when you write the papers, you follow the instructions and don't take your sources from study sites like Sparknotes. Use the school's databases to find legitimate critics who have discussed the work, author, or context of the piece. Work on it from the day it is assigned. It takes time to read the work and then find the research, so procrastination is the enemy here. Write a couple of drafts. Check you that you actually writing analysis and not a summary. Make sure you have proper quotes, paraphrases, and summaries, and that they are properly cited. Show your work in other words. Then turn it in on time. These habits should produce excellent marks in literature, or any other course you might take. As a bonus, you might actually learn something in addition to ticking off a grade. But if grades are what you seek, just do your work, follow the instructions on the assignment sheet, syllabus, and course outline, don't phone in your efforts, and be on time. ",

Make sure you go through the assigned texts thoroughly. Shmoop won\u2019t give you an A, nor will skimming through your prose/poems and googling the summaries/cribbing off your friends. Perhaps it might sound inconvenient, but you shouldn\u2019t be doing a subject unless you\u2019re willing to put in the effort required.Read similar books or plays \u2014 ones that share thematic structures or plot lines. Bringing your background reading up in your answer is a great way of coercing your examiner to grant you more marks.Related to the point above \u2014 read texts by the same author/poet. You need to know what their writing styles are and what themes they favour. You also need to know a little about what\u2019re like as people, as that may have a significant influence on the works that they produce.Make sure you conduct some research into the period in which each piece was written and find some way of dropping this info in your answer \u2014 usually in support of some literary idea you are putting forward.Practice writing answers. No two words about it \u2014 this is vital. There\u2019s no way I would have got over an A if I hadn\u2019t kept working on my answers.Once you notice a marked improvement in your answers, time them. You\u2019ll have a time limit at your exam and you don\u2019t want this to throw you.All in all, literature exams tend to be easier than language ones (at least in my opinion), but you\u2019ve got to put in the extra effort. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all improve your grammar. Board exams are generally lengthy and torturous, even good students tend to make a lot of grammatical mistakes making the answer unintelligible and thus resulting in reduced marks..Secondly, read the chapter first every time you study. Make character sketches, solve back exercises and try to position yourself as the protagonist. Might sound bizarre but this one practice made my answering ability improve from nil to a hundred..I won't recommend this but I watched sitcoms and movies to improve my prompt answering skill and it really reflected my performance when it came to writing. It's a distraction? I had PCM with comp. science. I got 93.25% aggregate and 95/100 in English. These things don't really effect your studies until you have everything balanced.. DONT WRITE A LOT TO CONFUSE. Board examiners are pretty well versed and extra long answers just reflect the nervousness and incapability of the student to answer a question. Keep your answer short, compact and rich in content..Last but not the least, jump out of your comfort zone. Read novels, poetry and non-fiction books to get that required flow in English Language. Don't just care about your marks, they're temporary. Try to learn English to better yourself and your personality after all it's just an exam that won't decide your future.Kudos and all the best for your exams :) ",

Then just go through the other works written by the writer. Just try to know a one para summary of his or her works. That much is enough. Now read a few research papers on the work that is in your syllabus. Highlight a few important lines said by the critics. You can use them to quote in your answers. And yes, while reading the text, do the same\u2026.select a few quotes which you can use in your answers. You can also go for a comparative analysis if you're a good reader. Don't mug up.

Frankly, literature to me entails three important things: Perspectives and skills of literary criticism, plus the discipline of using special vocabulary and style of analysis;Personal interpretations and expressions;Special voice in speaking and writing; So from the standpoint of literary pursuits, there are no short cuts in the improvement process. It's has to be a lifestyle! My advice: Read, read, and read widely and deeply;Read alone;Read in print if possible;Make marginal annotations;Take notes and make notes;Read for clarity;Read a aloud;Write, write, and write profusely;Constant rewriting, revision and restructuring come with the territory;Keep a daily journal of your reading and writing experiences;[20160406_Study English Literature] ",

Short stories are easy to score. Poems require you to really understand things on a metaphorical level. Focus on that and try reading between the lines. There can be two things a poet tries to say through a single line. Take note. Learn up the poet and author names well and also character sketches for short stories. Keep your answers descriptive and elaborate but also don't add unnecessary details as it won't get you extra marks.  Coming to Shakespeare, know important bits from each act like where the scene is taking place, who's speaking to whom about what, reference to context, etc. Also, there may be biblical allusions,alliterations and so on. Do those well.  Avoid attempting extra questions and aim to write only what is needed, but perfectly. Don't use incorrect grammar. Do the 20 mark summary only if you're very sure.

If you are in any doubt at all that you have misunderstood, ask your teacher for clarification and keep on asking until you do understand. Students of English often try get carried away with their own ideas and want to show them off for the teacher. That's fine but only if you follow the instructions too. Believe it or not, the teacher assigns essays and gives instructions in order to help you master a skill, so going your own way while writing could leave you high and dry in the marks department. ",
