            "answer_text": "To be honest \u2026 you probably shouldn't just cram everything about physical education . Just understand the matter and learn important facts and terms and then produce an answer in your own words. For example -want to learn about the differently abled? Simple -understand the aim , the objectives , why do we need it? , how can the differently abled carry out various physical activities inspite of their disabilities? etc. Trust me that u don't want to go about cramming everything few days before your exam (I did it and I could remeber nothing ). Just basically get an idea on every aspect and u would be doing just fine . ",
