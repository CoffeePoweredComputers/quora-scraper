            "answer_text": "Be on the safer side by completing chemistry first. Then move on to Physics/Maths . In class 11, do all those chapters which you liked very much and it will take not much time to cover them. Read and jot down all the formulas on a sheet. Now take any standard objective book and start solving them in a limited time. This will increase you speed. Another option is that you can opt for a test series like that of Embibe which will definitely help you in advanced 2018. Another strategy is that Full class 12 syllabus + selected topics of class 11 of your choice. Now you must not ignore mathematical reasoning and statistics in maths portion. Don't focus more on boards if you believe that you can easily score 80% by preparing in February month. Keep in mind that 95%+ will do nothing to you but a seat in IIT-JEE will do wonders. Keep aside all the tension . JUST DO IT NOW!!!!!!! ",
