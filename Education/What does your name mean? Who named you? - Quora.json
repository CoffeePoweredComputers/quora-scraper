            "answer_text": "Depends on who you ask in my family. My mom had two sisters, Lola Eunice, and Lois Frances. My biological father would say they helped her through \u201cme\u201d, since she was sickly all through her pregnancy and until I was nearly a year old. Therefore, he named me after them. My parents divorced before I was 6, I do not know exactly. My grandmother removed me from my father (his mother), and placed me with a family in her church. They became \u201cmom and dad\u201d to me. The summer after I turned 15 my bio dad took my parents to court and got temporary visitation, true to form, he absconded with me and kept me hid for nearly a year! A neighbor reported him because I was not going to school, mostly I was a glorified \u201cmaid\u201d for his new family! I cooked, cleaned, did their laundry in an agitator washing machine with four rinse tubs, ironed, bathed their 7 kids, helped them do homework, the usual \u201c big sister\u201d stuff for a pack of brats that lied on me, took my money (I worked part time at a grocery store)-\u201dyou can work to be able to buy the things YOU need, just give your money to Kay (his wife) with your list and she will get it when we go to town.\u201d Of course, I had to help pay his gas since he was ALLOWING her to shop for ME. Taking her away from \u201cher real family\u201d. By the time my dad got all his paperwork together from our state, I had had enough! When I got my sperm donor his breakfast, his lunch packed, his truck warmed up and he left for work 55 miles away. It was midnight. I waited until I knew he had passed our \u201cright of way\u201d where they set the poles for our electricity. Once I heard the truck go pass that right of way, I packed my army duffel, put it on my back and took off. I got from Winslow, Ark to Greenland, Ark in time to get a 5:30 a.m. bus back to Borger, Tx. However, he had gotten home about noon and went to the police and reported me as a runaway. They showed my photo at the bus station, who told them I bought a ticket to Borger. Bad thing about buses they only travel at about 50 miles per hour, have multiple stops to disembark, board, food and rest. The police picked me up before the state line, took me back, but daddy dearest did NOT get me back! Much to his distress, I had to be seen by a judge. When I was taken in front of the judge I told him he needed to get my grandma there and asked him could I talk to him without \u201c THEM\u201d there. He allowed it. I told him he needed to call my school in Borger where I had gone from kindergarten until the 10th grade. I ALSO told him if by some screwed up legality, I would up going back with \u201cthem\u201d, the back door screen would not hit me in the behind before I would be gone again!! That right now they had not enrolled me in school and I was a National Honor Soceity Merit Scholor, made straight A's, was in drama, debate, had gone to Nationals for the Science Fairs since 6th grade and NOW I am a maid!! NOT going to school, was missing on nearly 4 months so far and my parents came there looking for me but he had locked me in a cupbord in his barn when my parents showed up!! Guess who went to jail for 18 months, and who went HOME to Texas?? I met my bio mother when I was 18, she is the one who was FB Native American, that was how my bio dad was able to get \u201ccustody\u201d of me. Indian women had no rights to their half white children. She gave me my ORIGINAL birth certificate with my name Ravenwalker on it. Lola is a derivative in Spanish of Delores, Frances is French for Frank, I have seen other translations in French it means \u201cfree strong woman\u201d. I like that one very much! Ravenwalker has several \u201cexplanations and derivations\u201d depending on Tribe. My mother was 1/2 Cherokee and 1/2 Choctaw. She was and went to Sequoyah Indian School with Wilma Mankiller. When my mother died unexpectedly, on vacation in Sept. 1989, it was Wilma who organized and executed an Honor Dance and Tribute Powwow at the Cherokee Community Center for my mother. I was very touched by the sheer number of participants, dancers, drummers, singers, PEOPLE packing that center for MY mother. I cherish the memory of two young men coming to get my son, took him to the \u201ccircle\u201d, stood each side of him, and did an Honor Song, and Dance for him as my mother's only grandson able to carry forth HER honored name. Otherwise, her name would've died with her. Names carry a lot of power. When you are born you have two things, your name and your word. If your word is is not honorable then your name is NOT. If you name is not honorable, then neither is your word! People do not seem to understand this concept. I have actually met people who have said to me, \u201cI knew your grandmother, she was a woman of her word.\u201d I have also met people who have said to me \u201cSo you're ***\u2019* daughter? Good thing you are nothing like him!\u201d Your name is your word, honor, and more than what you are known by. It is sort of your personal calling card. In a world where we are asked for \u201creferences\u201d for everything from employment to credit. I feel very good when someone says, \u201cWell you have glowing references. People seem to really like you.\u201d I got some of my best references from a charity I became involved with. This is WHO you are, be proud, make your name MEAN and STAND for something you and your future generations to be proud of! ",

            "answer_text": "This should be fun. Let\u2019s start with Mikah. Chosen by themself, although similar to their birth name. Mikah means \u201cwho is like God\u201d. Now my name, Shadow. Our littles named me after a shadow man who saved us when we were younger. The name Shadow means, well, \u201cshade\u201d. Rose was a name she reclaimed for herself after being called a little rose several times in the past. Rose means \u201crose, flower\u201d. Amber, like Mikah, chose her name. Amber means \u201cjewel\u201d. Nova also chose his name, likely influenced by the fact he broke off when we were fascinated with space. Nova means \u201cnew\u201d, often used in reference to a \u201cnew star\u201d. Astral was the one who was most excited about space and science. They named themself, and Astral means \u201crelating to the stars\u201d. Sam has always had his name, it was always something he just had. Sam means \u201ctold by God\u201d. Griffin was named by the littles because he has a griffin form when comforting them. Griffin means \u201cstrong Lord\u201d. Lilian means \u201cinnocence, purity, beauty\u201d and Amethyst means \u201cpurple gemstone\u201d. Shadow \ud83d\udda4 ",
