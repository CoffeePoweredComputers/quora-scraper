            "answer_text": "I have seen an astronaut\u2019s resume. It was extensive. They are exceptional learners and are always at the top of the class. They have a drive that compels them to stay at the top and to be competitive. They are in a class of their own. That does not mean a person is automatically excluded if they have to repeat a grade. No one knows the requirements future astronauts will need. Christa McAuliffe was not originally an astronaut, she was a teacher and got to be selected for a Space Shuttle mission and became an astronaut, so there is hope. One can assume she had the same qualities it takes to be elite though, because there was tough competition for that coveted spot. Astronauts plan and create a path for themselves to follow. They don\u2019t let life just happen to them. They do their best at all times and create opportunities by doing their best. They are smart in their educational and career path, too. They research and know what classes to take that will put them on the straightest path. Anyone can get closer to what they want to be in life by keeping their goals in mind and continually striving toward them (smartly). Mentors would be helpful for a struggling student. The student should find people who will guide them toward better studying habits and better choices and encourage them when things are tough. A difficult path has the highest rewards. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no law or regulation that prevents it. But realistically? The chances are pretty much zero. Someone who has to repeat a grade in high school is academically struggling to the point where someone needs to repeat an entire use of school. Perhaps that\u2019s for a variety of reasons not entirely related to the students actual ability. You know who don\u2019t academically struggle to the point of failure? Astronauts. When people who eventually become astronauts academically struggle, it\u2019s because the material they are working with is very advanced, and they still do well on their coursework regardless. Someone who just can\u2019t figure out basic algebra or other high school level material is very unlikely to be an astronaut. ",
