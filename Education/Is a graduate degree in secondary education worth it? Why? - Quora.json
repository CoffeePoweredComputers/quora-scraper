            "answer_text": "It depends.  In some areas, having a Master's is the only way to get hired.  In others (places like Florida and Arizona,) having a Master's may PREVENT you from being hired.  The reason for that is that most school districts have to pay more in salary for a teacher that has more completed coursework.  As a matter of fact, many teachers take coursework throughout their careers not only to stay sharp, but also for this reason, they want a raise.  I would be careful to do some investigation into the area you would like to teach prior to pursuing a Master's Degree.  You can do this by phoning a few likely districts and ask what percentage of new teachers they have hired with advanced degrees.  This is a fairly normal question that many parents ask, and you may even be able to find the answer published on the district website. ",
