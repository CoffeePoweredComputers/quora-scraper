            "answer_text": "It depends on what you're looking to gain from acquiring a degree. A chief concern is what field you're interested in pursuing. A desire to pursue finance should result in schools focused on that area. HR is another discipline that is rather institution specific. General management, sales & marketing would indicate a more general search. Second, there's the question of what type of company you're interested in working for. Right, wrong or indifferent, it's a fairly established fact that Fortune 50, and a predominant number of the international 500, look for graduates from top-tier global universities, the equivalent of ivy-league named schools in the US. And the reality is some countries, France for example, rarely have high-level executives from any university other than domestic ones, like ENA. Beyond that, I'd seek a school that best met my personal needs. I matriculated for my PhD in a US program and, having worked in an international environment, found it lacking in the cultural dimensions I knew to be necessary for virtually any international position, so I transferred to a European institution. Finally, it's necessary to add that there is a similar glut of MBA's worldwide, just as there was of BA's by the 1980\u2032s. That's when the trend began that in order to differentiate oneself within the workforce, you needed one more degree than everyone else. There are a flurry of DBA programs out there now, in my opinion basically a marketing ploy by universities to fill seats, but I'm not seeing a great deal if traction in that area with regard to job advancement, as yet. Bottom line, degrees are only as good as the skillsets associated with the individuals obtaining them. I've experienced ivy league scholars who could spreadsheet themselves into a tizzy, but lacked the broad based talents to excel otherwise. Similarly, I've known people with a BA who were excellent in their chosen professions Hope this helps. ",

The school is recognized by corporations throughout the world, for it\u2019s innovative curriculum and graduates that are prepared for immediate overseas employment. Now with the appointment of Sanjeev Khagram as the new director -general of the school, the program will only become more resourceful. ",
