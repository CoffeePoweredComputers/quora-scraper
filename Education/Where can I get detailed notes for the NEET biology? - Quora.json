            "answer_text": "There is this book called biology NCERT. Buy it! Read it. Learn EVERY SINGLE LINE. Learn all the diagrams and there labellings by heart. Draw them multiple times. The most important things are the diagram descriptions. You will find many questions from these labellings. You will get 300+ guaranteed. For 30\u201340 extra marks, studying two times extra is illogical to me but still if you want to do it then go learn the Aakash package. The question doesn't demand it but still I will go on and blabber. Ignore these coaching institutes notes. The biology they teach seems fancy and interesting but it is a big time waste because your motive is to score in NEET, not research in biology. Instead, focus on physics and chemistry by solving N.Avasthi, M.S.Chouhan.,etc. ",
