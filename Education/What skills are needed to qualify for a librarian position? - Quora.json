            "answer_text": "Lu Laverde is spot on about the MLS (now more commonly know as an MIS or LIS) degree. Most Corporate (formerly know as \"Special\") library positions, all K-12 School library positions and even low-level academic jobs require a Master's Degree in Library and Information Science from an accredited school. Many academic positions now also require PhD. degrees. Lu's list is comprehensive, but it's rare for any librarian to need all of those skills. Cataloging positions require cataloging skills, archivist positions require archive skills. A lot of public libraries are looking for people with strong tech/IT skillsets these days. I'm a research librarian for a corporate contract company. I specialize in Business and Competitive Itelligence - and I've been doing that for the last 25+ years. I couldn't catalog if my life depended on it and have no idea th best way to archive anything. OTOH, I have some basic tech skills and excellent grasp of social and new media and the digital environment. When I go to Indeed.com  and look for \"Librarian\" jobs, I'm getting a fairly wide raneg of requirements depending on the actual job. Here's the requirements for a Library Assistant Job at a small college: -Must have an MLS/MLIS from an ALA accredited school-4+ years experience providing reference services-Knowledge of cataloging-Ability to work independentlyPreferred Qualifications:-Experience in an academic library-Experience teaching information literacy-Established relationships with publishers-Experience with recruiting a plus Here's the requirements for an Assistant Archivist with a well-known jewelry company Required Qualifications:  Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History, American History, American Studies or related field.3-5 years of progressively responsible experience in an institutional or business archives including supervisory experience.Knowledge of American decorative artsExcellent writing and presentation skillsDemonstrated ability to work as part of a team.Ability to meet deadlines and work on several projects simultaneously.Ability to travel up to 25% both domestically and internationally. Preferred Qualifications:  Master\u2019s degree in Archives Administration or Library Science with a concentration in Archives.Working knowledge of 19th and 20th century jewelry.Spoken and written fluency in French, Russian, Japanese or Mandarin.*** So you see, the requirements for even \"Assistant\" jobs at this point are fairly specialized. The American Library Association has a list of accredited school with Master's programs in th USA, Puerto Rico and Canada: Directory of ALA-Accredited Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies If you are not in the US, there is probably a Library Association in your country with a similar list.

            "answer_text": "First, I want to clarify that there are many library jobs that do not require a Master's degree from an accredited library school.  It is common for many to refere to anyone on the library staff as a \"librarian.\"  I clarify that because there many library jobs that do not require that Master's degree; these are often para-professional/professional (supervisory) positions.  Example job titles: Library Assistant, Library Supervisor, Administative Assistant, Library Technician, Library page (shelver).  Although a 4-year degree is not required for these jobs, most do have college degrees (with the exception of shelvers, who are often students). To become a librarian you need a bachelors degree, any major will do.  Then a Master's degree from an accredited school.  Each school may give the degree a different name, and this is why I am not being specific.  Many Master's degrees today have a reference to information technology.  I graduated in 1997 with a Masters in Library Service (MLS is the typical acronym for the library master's degree), but my school (Rutgers), no longers calls it that, it might be a Master's in Library & Information Science (I think). At the time I got my Master's it required 36 credits; this number might be slightly higher now.  No Master's thesis was required.  Each school will set it curriculum and required courses.  Each state might also require a certification.  In New Jersey, a librarian must have a Professional Librarian's Certificate issued by the State of New Jersey, which can be obtained by applying for it, paying a fee, and providing proof of successful completion of degree. To work in a school library, that requires another certification, and meeting another set of course requirements to get a School Library Media Specialist Certification, which qualifies you to work in public schools.  This will vary be state, just as the title, \"School Library Media Specialist\" might vary as well. ",
