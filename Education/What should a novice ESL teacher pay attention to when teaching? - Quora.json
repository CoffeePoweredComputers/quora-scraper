            "answer_text": "What city will you be teaching in and how long is your contract with the middle school?  If you're going through an agency you most likely will fall into a double middleman trap. How it works is you go through a teach abroad website that promises to help \"set you up\" with a VISA, a school contract, TEFL certification, free accommodation, etc.  But, the school you are matched with goes through an agency. So the agency pimps you out to the school. Essentially you're getting paid \u00a560 ($10) per hour, or less.  Private tutoring using an agency in the larger cities commands \u00a5200 ($32) per hour. Individual tutoring you find on your own can be \u00a5300-400 per hour. Cash. You should just get a sponsored work VISA and look for a part time job then private tutor. You'll make more \u00a5, work less hours and learn for yourself whether you enjoy teaching or not. Plus you can pursue other things you might be interested in.  All of my friends who taught abroad for the first year endured it. It was a rewarding experience to finish but all the teachers left to go back home because of the way we were treated and how low we were paid.  I wouldn't worry about teaching poorly. It's a learning experience and you get better the more times your teach. Once you put your time in its smooth sailing. Focus on speaking slowly, be patient, use Prezi instead of PPTs, bring media to class, try to be engaging and encouraging. ",
