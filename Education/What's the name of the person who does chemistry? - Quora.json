It should be \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of a person who does chemistry?\u201d Unless, of course, you are under the impression that only one individual does chemistry, which is false\u2014 there are many chemists in the world. And I suppose that also answers the question: one who does chemistry is a chemist. ",

            "answer_text": "A person who has studied chemistry and is working in a chemistry-related job is usually called a chemist. However, at least in the UK and some other countries, a \u2018chemist\u2019 can also be a person in charge of a pharmacy. By extension, a pharmacy is also called (in the UK) a chemist (as in \u201cI\u2019m going to the chemist\u201d). See: What is the difference between a druggist, a pharmacist, and a chemist? ",
