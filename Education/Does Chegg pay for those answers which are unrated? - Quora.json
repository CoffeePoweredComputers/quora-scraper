Though American students are allowed to rate each answer, they might not always opt for it. But that doesn't affect subject payout rates. You must pay attention to the quality of answers and strictly adhere to the guidelines laid down by Chegg. As long as you do this, your earnings won't be affected at all, i.e. you will be paid for every question you answer. ",
