            "answer_text": "I don't see the purpose of your question.  You want to study medicine in Japan in English.  You do realize that your Japanese degree in medicine will not allow you to practice in the US.  You would need to go through the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates to be certified to take the USMLE.   If you plan to practice in Japan, I would suspect learning Japanese would come first.  If you are not racially Japanese it is unlikely that you will be hired. AS a foreigner in Japan their culture says there is no need to hire a foreigner except as an English instructor or computer scientist. ",
