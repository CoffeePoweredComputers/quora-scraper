            "answer_text": "Of course. Why not? NIOS is an educational board just like CBSE & CISCE. It is run by the Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India. A candidate having NIOS certifications can appear in any national level entrance exam conducted by the Center or CBSE, like JEE (Main & Advanced), CLAT and now NEET. Since NEET is an upgraded or changed version of AIPMT & will be conducted by CBSE on behalf of the Central government of India, there should not be a problem for an NIOS student from becoming eligible to sit in the NEET exam.             So one should not worry about the eligibility. Rather, he/she should study hard to crack NEET. All the best...... ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, As per the official notification of CBSE on Feb 28, the candidates from NIOS can appear for the test. However, earlier NIOSA/Open school candidates were barred from appearing in NEET. While 13 NIOS candidates went to Delhi High Court complaining that CBSE has not accepted their NEET application form. On this, the high court on April 16 decided asked CBSE to accept the applications and continue the admission process. Last year, 3000 students from NIOS appeared for the test, of which 864 aspirants passed the test. This is definitely a small number, however, candidates MCi is too unpretentious to see this. Hope this might help you. Thank you. ",

Till now NIOS students are eligible for NEET\u2026 Hope it answers your query.. For more do comment ",
