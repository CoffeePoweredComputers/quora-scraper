            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Cameron Fife, but I was surprised to see you had given a very good answer yourself already - and I was going to add this as a comment to your answer but it became rather longer than made sense to do that. Please read his answer first for context, asker and other readers! I have also probably finished about 20% of the MOOCs I have started, the only difference is that I\u2019ve started over 100. At the time I was most active, I was doing perhaps five per week, and back then it was standard for material to be released each week at a specific time, with either one or two weeks deadline for any exercises. So that made \u201cfocus\u201d very easy, I would watch watch videos late in the afternoon for one course, then the exercises for it early the next afternoon; rinse and repeat. With many courses allowing considerable flexibility, particularly on Coursera which has more MOOCs than EdX, that isn\u2019t quite as easy, but even self-paced courses are usually structured in terms of weeks. One major reason for dropping out of courses is that they are either too easy or too hard. That\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t like courses with steep learning curves. The first week should contain an overview of what will be learned (not necessarily in the videos, but definitely a syllabus of some sorts, somewhere). Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects | Coursera is a MOOC which actually talks about how to focus. It has less than ten hours of material, so could be completed in a week, spending an hour or two per day. Other MOOCs may suggest that they have ten or more hours per week, but that is for the intended audience. My recommendation for most MOOCs is to schedule to start them on a fixed day of the week, and to aim to complete most of the work by the next day at the latest. Leave some time free in the weekend to go back and tie up any loose ends. Self-paced courses on Coursera\u2019s new platform allow you to restart from a previous session. This feature could be used to deliberately plan to take more than seven days for a single \u2018week\u2019 of activity, over two sessions of the course. Alternatively, if you find yourself struggling to keep up with the pace of a course, because the curve is harder than you expected, you could switch into this mode, but repeating some of the earlier exercises second time around (incidentally, a paid-for course on Coursera rolls over at least to the next session). If I were starting MOOCs from scratch again, I would take weeks 1 of the best ten starting a new one every weekday, with the intent to probably drop that down to just five at a time. In the weekend after the second week of this I will have completed ten first weeks and anything from 0\u20135 second weeks, depending on how much I liked my first five choices (and how much they liked me, in terms of completing exercises). Using the estimates from the courses of effort in hours per week expected and my own experience so far (I watch most videos at 2x speed myself, and go back and rewatch if necessary) I would pick about five courses to stick with, adding up to 30\u201340 hours of expected effort per week. If you only have just 10\u201320 hours available per week, still start at least ten different MOOCs and complete at least week 1 (unless doing so takes more than 3 hours). For MOOCs I like 3-hour blocks. They obviously don\u2019t have to be exactly three hours, but you can fit three of them into a day if you don\u2019t have (m)any other commitments, or just one if you do. When I wrote 30\u201340 hours, I meant two 3-hour blocks per day, 5 or 6 days per week; when I wrote 10\u201320 hours, I really meant one 3-hour blocks per day, 3\u20137 days per week. Have at least one block per MOOC, and (at least) one in reserve (if you don\u2019t need it, you can always have a look at a new week 1!) My, I do waffle. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that\u2019s a really great question. I don\u2019t really have much for strategy, but just a general observation. My background: I\u2019ve completed 4 different MOOCs (3 of which I got certificates for). I\u2019ve also dropped out of around 20 other MOOCs. Of the MOOCs I completed, none of them were very long (usually only 4\u20135 weeks with 5\u201310 hours of materials). Furthermore, they were usually in topics that were both interesting and felt pertinent to my career. 3 of my 4 MOOCs were about algorithms because I thought it would really help me prepare for interviewing with software companies. The one\u2019s that I dropped out of were usually outside of my major but I thought were interesting. My opinion is that if you really want to complete a MOOC, it helps a ton if you have a practical reason to complete it. I would even suggest buying a certificate just so you have an incentive to finish it. As a side note: the average completion rate for most Coursera courses is around ~5%. Meaning the vast majority of people drop out. So if you actually do manage to complete a MOOC, you\u2019re in the cool minority. ",

Most MOOC's just don't give a shit if you are doing it or not(I mean obviously they shouldn't. That's not what you get in $50) so try to join some online course with a instructor who talks to you daily, who you can call at any time and chat with. ",
