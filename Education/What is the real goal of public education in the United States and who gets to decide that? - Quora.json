            "answer_text": "A2A My personal answer: The purpose of public education is to help raise next door neighbors. (employable, reasonable, participants in neighborhood and society) History of education classes usually started with the \u201cOld Deluder Satan\u201d laws and the purpose of producing literate adults who could read the truth and not be led astray. John Dewey obviously assumed that it was training to participate in a democratic society as he argued that students logically needed practice in democracy to meet that goal. A lot of the shift to state funding was focused on equalizing funding across varied locations. But people forgot that control always follows money. The same thing happened as federal funding stepped in to provide advancement in education. Over the last half century the goals have increasingly become preparation for employment all the way through the university level. And, there is an observable decline in emphasis on the humanities, even knowing the history of our country as a result. Right now state legislatures and governors mostly \u201cget to decide.\u201d I still propose that the decisions should be made as close to the point of learning (and where most of the taxes are collected) and am a strong proponent of local control. I continue to believe that being employable is only one facet of a well educated adult. I want interesting, informed, civil people to live next door. ",

            "answer_text": "From a teacher\u2019s view, it is to get my students to do the best they can in my class. Teaching within the Career and Technical Education area of high school education our job is to help our students become good technically aware and skilled citizen ready to go to a tech school or college. Outside of my area I am guessing. Administrators are who hold and help us stay to the school board\u2019s guidance, to help us work with students, and parents. The school board are the ones who decide what is going to be paid for, who is going to hired/ fired, what curriculum will be bought, and what is going to be taught. They are elected not for their vast knowledge of education but their viewpoints they shared to the public who agreed with their viewpoint and plans. And put them in office. So theoretically they set the goals for this particular schools district. Each state is in control of SOME of the funding for the schools within that state. In most states funding is divided up by content area. And states do put out some higher level policies. They do some monitoring through state-wide testing. They set some goals via funding criteria and tests. At the federal level, they are still in charge of court ordered desegregation, and some policies which has been mostly political statements of bringing all students up to a certain level. The federal government funding varies greatly from school district to school district based on ethnic makeup of a school district(desegregation money)and economic makeup of a school district(for example - free and reduced lunch programs). Some school districts may receive no federal money at all. Some may get all of their IT equipment for free through a federal library grant. So most of the goal setting is at the school board level at each school district, next the state, and some but not much at the federal level. ",
