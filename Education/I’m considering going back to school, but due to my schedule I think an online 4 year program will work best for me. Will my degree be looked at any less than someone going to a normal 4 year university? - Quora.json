            "answer_text": "A2A. As a hiring manager who often hires many professionals in a year (it won\u2019t be true this year), I consider many of the answers I see here to be dangerously wrong. Online degrees and brick-and-mortar degrees are evaluated by hiring managers in radically different ways. In almost all cases (in fact, in all cases I know), colleges with online programs make it clear that you graduated from an online program. The reason is clear: if there admissions to the brick and mortar program are selective in any way, they don\u2019t want the value of the brick-and-mortar degree to be devalued by the lesser selectivity of the online program. As a consequence, it is very clear to the hiring manager which program (online or brick and mortar) you graduated from. The selectivity of the program you are graduating from, and the quality of the education are both important aspects of your degree. In most cases, online degree programs use very little selectivity. As a consequence, an online program is worth very little in most cases, unless it is considered as an added value to the candidate (for instance, an MBA for someone who already has an MS or ME, in a technical management position). In the end, it is really simple. If your primary degree is an online degree, it will likely be considered lower than any brick and mortar degree. and a brick and mortar degree candidate will almost always be preferred. This will likely not be true fifteen years from now, but, like it or not, this is how it is today. So, if you are considering an online program, make this choice with your eyes wide open and with the understanding that your degree will likely be in no way comparable to a brick and mortar degree.

            "answer_text": "I think the advice that Chris Davis offers is generally valid; choose a school with an overall-strong reputation. However, I\u2019m concerned about the subtext here. I often see this: people who intend to push through a full-time undergraduate degree while also working full time. I have rarely seen this work out; it\u2019s much more common for a student to end up quickly compromising both their employment and their academic work. I\u2019ve also seen students who intended to work full time and go to school part time, and they almost invariably end up dropping out; they always intend to go back - someday - but someday never comes. If you intend to do this, think long and hard about the consequences of failure, and move heaven and Earth if you have to in order to attend school full time, and work part time. I\u2019m not saying that other approaches never work, but realize that they fail more often than not, and everyone thinks they\u2019ll be the exception. ",

Your degree will be evaluated based on the university/college that grants it, which is why you look at accreditations. I only recommend nonprofit or public regionally, AACSB business, and ABET engineering accredited universities/colleges whose online programs are the same, same diploma, as their on-campus programs. Obviously with the same diploma, no one can tell if you took all your courses online. ",
