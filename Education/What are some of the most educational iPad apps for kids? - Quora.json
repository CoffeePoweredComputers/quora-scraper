            "answer_text": "This answer is constantly changing and greatly depends on your kids (their ages, educational backgrounds, learning preferences, etc). Any apps I tell you about today may likely be usurped by other apps next week. So instead, I'll tell you about a service that works like a Consumer Reports for educational apps: Balefire Labs. It is a subscription-based service, so I can't provide a complete list of their top apps right now, since they don't provide one for free. But here is a list of apps that have received their \"TopRated Badge.\" Note: links open to edshelf, which includes links to the apps and a link to the respective Balefire Labs report.
