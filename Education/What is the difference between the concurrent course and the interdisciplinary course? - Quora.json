            "answer_text": "Hi, To start with, let me introduce myself. I am a B.Tech(E&TC), M.Tech(IT) and currently pursuing PhD(Interdisciplinary) where I'm jointly enrolled in the dept. of Electrical engineering and Chemical engineering and my area of research is \"Data Analysis\" (Mathematics). So I feel my career trajectory makes me one of the right person to answer this question and also to indicate that my experience is worth your read time. Interdisciplinary courses requires you to have certain background in some basic areas and the course builds up from there. These courses seem to be little intimidating in the beginning since so many supporting concepts and materials are from various other core subjects.From a researcher's point of view(since I'm one.!!) interdisciplinary courses give you a broader view of the knowledge you have gained so far and helps you understand the real world better and also finds lot of practical usability since you could actually see for yourself how all the discrete concepts from various odd subjects combine elegantly to provide solution for a large class of unsolved mysteries of the universe. As my prof says that no real world problem could be posed as just a physics or chemistry or for that matter any other single area problem but borrows concepts from all of these to make something very beautiful and elegant. And its FUN as well..!! ( well not so in the beginning though :P).Concurrent courses (in my understanding) complements your core courses so that you have a better understanding of your core subjects. So I believe that a right mix of both of them could actually make your academic life really happening and interesting. And I hope I could answer your question to some extent. Regards ",
