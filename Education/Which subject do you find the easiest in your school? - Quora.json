I compare school subjects to food\u2026too much and you lose the taste or get bored with it\u2026as you grow older you find new interesting subjects ( like when you get in college/university you might change your mind to something else ). NOTE: I\u2019m still engaged to Physics\u2026it\u2019s all about the physical world we are living in. ",
