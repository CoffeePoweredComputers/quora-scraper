            "answer_text": "Government, I think. I find it fascinating how people are so attached to their ideas of government, be it conservative, liberal, libertarian etc. How sure they are of their beliefs, based on precisely squat. Even just the idea that some basic, vague ideology like 'conservative' or 'liberal' can possibly be considered a valid solution to the one of the most, if not the most complex problems society has. I find it ridiculous how sure people are about governance, based on knowing nothing of the subject, and how simplistic their ideas are for such difficult issues. It's all so based on emotion too, it's never about what is right, it's about what they so desperately want to to be right. ",

            "answer_text": "Modern Education. I'm constantly amazed at people who tell me with authority what modern schooling is like and the problems with modern education. They're convinced they know exactly what's wrong with every aspect of the education system. When pressed for details they reveal that they're basing their views entirely from their own school memories.  So their views on modern schooling come from their experiences in one school twenty years ago and somehow this makes them aware of what school is like in other parts of the world now.  ",
