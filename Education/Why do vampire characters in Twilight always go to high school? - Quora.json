            "answer_text": "It\u2019s only the Cullen family/coven that does this (because they have teenage vampires in the family and drink animal blood rather human blood, making it relatively safe for them to associate with humans). And even then, they don\u2019t always go to high school, since they also attend college/university. In fact, according to the Twilight Illustrated Guide, all the younger Cullens have more than one college degree, with the exception of Emmett, who just studies whatever interests him at the time and therefore has never completed a degree program. Edward has a medical degree among the degrees that he\u2019s obtained, and Rosalie has also studied medicine as a favor to help Carlisle up-to-date on all the medical advancements. Even Esme, the matriarch of the Cullen/Olympia coven, has gone to college and obtained degrees in architecture and art, and studied photography. Anyway, since the Cullen family is trying to blend in the human world, attending school does help with that to an extent. It also allows them to stay longer in an area, as the younger Cullens can attend the four years of high school and then move on to college without questions being asked about their non-aging. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it allowed Edward to meet Bella. It\u2019s needed for the story. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to go to high school. They\u2019ve already been through this, so they aren\u2019t learning anything new. The Cullens don\u2019t socialize much with the other students, so that\u2019s not a reason to do this. The issue of young-looking people who aren\u2019t in school can be handled with homeschooling or taking the GED. On top of this, going to school imposes risks. A sudden change in weather and they might be exposed to the sun and glitter. Which would immediately be caught on video and nobody would care. But vampires have been hiding for centuries. They did this back in the time when it was nearly impossible for a human to kill a vampire. They are essentially superheroes. It\u2019s almost as if they predicted that humans would eventually develop powerful military weapons that vampires would actually need to care about. ",
