            "answer_text": "The Soviet system had some advantages, in comparison to America\u2019s system: No \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d. American education is focused on teaching the unteachable (or hardest to teach) students, often to the detriment of its brightest students. Ironically, the Soviets despite being Communists, did not have this philosophy. Their focus was to find the smartest kids, put them in special schools, and push their limits. Soviet education was way more elitist than American education. In America, the idea that some kids are smarter than others is taboo in education circles.No capitalism to discourage people from math careers. Being a mathematician has never been an extremely lucrative career it itself, because you need more than math to produce things of actual economic value. That didn\u2019t matter in the Soviet Union, where there was no such thing as entrepreneurship or being \u201cself-made\u201d. To have a nice life in the Soviet Union, you needed political connections. And if you didn\u2019t have that, then the next best thing was to have a job the government considered important, like being a mathematician. In the United States, the lure of getting rich leads plenty of smart people away from dedication to mathematics.Math was taught as actual problem solving, not cook book recipes. I think this is the most important detail. The U.S. education in math remains pitiful. Monkey see monkey do, and drill drill drill does not create a good mathematician. In fact, this kind of education becomes more pointless, the more that computers become prominent. But American educators like \u201cmonkey see monkey do\u201d precisely because you can teach it to pretty much anyone with much the same results (see point #1).In the United States, the people teaching the math classes are not the best. The smartest kids will almost always be smarter than their teachers, because smart kids do not go on to become teachers. Hence, most K-12 math teachers in the United States are not actually that good at math. They are good enough to teach the school curriculum, but only because the school curriculum is dumbed down to the point where math is taught cookbook style.Again, the idea of IQ differences is an unpleasant subject to most American educators, and that probably has to do with the fact that most grade school teachers fall somewhere in the middle of the bell curve. If the United States could somehow convince its IMO gold medalists to become K-12 math teachers, then I\u2019m sure we\u2019d do just as well at teaching math as the Soviet system did. ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure if it changed in the 15 years since I left but at that time yes, it was. First of all, there was a lot of Math per week in school, second of all, if you were able to go to high school, you\u2019d learn in two last years of public school education what is taught here in the US in the first or even second year of college. It\u2019s tough but it has to be done to take the last country-wide examination and graduate. Some people do not proceed to high school just because of Math. There was never one single multiple choice testing on Math during my school studies. Several problems are given to you and you have to use purely mathematical expressions to solve the problems showing the understanding of mathematical processes from the beginning till the end. Then, and only then are you allowed to write the final answer. The final answer without the process was never allowed and useless since it can easily be copied. The mathematical processes to come to the final answer, however, can be different and can\u2019t be easily copied. Beyond 3rd grade, the use of words to explain yourself is not accepted. You speak only through mathematical expressions, numbers, formulae, equations, etc. This one of the main differences that I noticed from the US system. Nowadays, I grade 8th grade Math that is administered to students in California. They make students write a lot of their processes by using words like an essay. Are you kidding me?! I\u2019m not surprised to see almost 80% of students getting a score of 0. There\u2019s absolutely no need to use words in Math, neither can many people do it anyway. Even the best of mathematicians will have hard time talking Math through words. In 8th grade in Russia, students are solving algebraic and trigonometric equations without spitting a single word in the process. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I still remember more than 70% of algebra and calculus just from high school. If forgotten, I can pretty quickly get back on track. That\u2019s how embedded Math was in our brains\u2026 yet again, I hated many subjects in school except for the Math\u2026 It was the only subject where there was not much yapping, if you know what I mean. Literature, history, or social studies, anyone? ;-) ",
