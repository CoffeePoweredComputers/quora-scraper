            "answer_text": "Harder. Granted I am only a rising second year, but studying for IB exams was definitely the epitome of the most difficult exam season I\u2019ve ever endured. Not to mention, the work load of IB is intense. On top of regular quizzes, presentations and homework, there are IAs, oral components, EE, TOK, and CAS activities that have to be completed. Lab work and write ups are much easier and shorter in university. I guess TAs and profs don\u2019t have as much time to read through pages and pages of work from hundreds of students. Plus, you have a lot of components that make up your grade (ie. labs, quizzes, assignments etc.) rather then relying on just an exam and IA. This is not to say university is not hard because it is. It\u2019s still stressful but IB was definitely more intense. Nonetheless it was good preparation. ",
