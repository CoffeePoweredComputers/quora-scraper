So, we can say that personality development is not only important for children but for everyone as because: Personality development grooms an individual and helps him make a mark of his/her own.

It encourages individuals to look at the brighter sides of life. Face even the worst situations with a smile. Trust me, flashing your trillion dollar smile will not only melt half of your problems but also evaporate your stress and worries. There is no point cribbing over minor issues and problems. Personality development helps you develop a positive attitude in life. An individual with a negative attitude finds a problem in every situation. Rather than cribbing and criticizing people around, analyze the whole situation and try to find an appropriate solution for the same. Remember, if there is a problem, there has to be a solution as well. Never lose your cool. It would make the situation worse. It is essential for individuals to behave well with people around. Being polite with others will not only make you popular among other people but also earn you respect and pride. You can\u2019t demand respect by being rude with people around.

Personality development helps you gain recognition and acceptance from the society as well as people around. Personality development plays an essential role not only in an individual\u2019s professional but also personal lives. It makes an individual disciplined, punctual and an asset for his/her organization. An in-disciplined individual finds it difficult to survive in the long run. Personality development teaches you to respect not only your Boss and fellow workers but also family members, friends, neighbours, relatives and so on. Never make fun of anyone at the workplace. Avoid criticizing and making fun of your fellow workers. One should never carry his/her attitude or personal grudges to work. Office is not a place where you can be rude to others just because you had a fight with your friend last night. Personality development sessions help you differentiate between your personal as well as professional life. It is really essential to keep a balance between both the lives to lead a peaceful and stress free life. Personality development helps an individual to inculcate positive qualities like punctuality, flexible attitude, willingness to learn, friendly nature, eagerness to help others and so on. Never hesitate to share information with others. Always reach office on time. Some people have a tendency to work till late.

Personality development makes you a confident individual who is appreciated and respected wherever he goes.  Let\u2019s move a bit further and extend this answer to include some tips for personality development. Here are some tips for enhancing one\u2019s personality: Smile a lot- Nothing works better than a big smile when it comes to interacting with people around. Do not forget to flash your trillion dollar smile quite often. Believe me, it works! As they say \u201ca smile is a curve that sets everything straight\u201d. A smiling face wins even the toughest soul. Wear your smile while interacting with others. Smile not only helps in enhancing an individual\u2019s personality but also winning other\u2019s heart.Think positive- It is really essential to think positive. Remember there is light at the end of every dark tunnel. Do not always think negative as it not only acts as a demotivating factor but also makes an individual dull and frustrated. Don\u2019t get upset over minor things. Be a little flexible and always look at the broader perspectives of life.Dress Sensibly- Dressing sensibly and smartly go a long way in honing one\u2019s personality. One needs to dress according to the occasion. How would a female look if she wears a sari to a discotheque? Obviously ridiculous! No matter how expensive your sari is, you can\u2019t wear it to a night club or a pub where everyone is dressed in smart casuals. Price has nothing to do with smart dressing. An individual who is well dressed is respected and liked by all. No one would take you seriously if you do not wear suitable clothes fitting with occasions. Do take care of the fit of the dress as well. An individual should wear clothes as per his/her body type, height, physique and so on. Someone who is bulky would not look very impressive in body hugging clothes. It is not necessary that something which looks good on your friend would also look good on you. Wear the right make up. You do not have to apply loud make up to look good and attractive. Even minimal make up, if applied sensibly can really make you stand apart from the rest.Be soft-spoken- Do not always find faults in others. Fighting and quarrelling lead to no solution. Be polite with others. Be very careful of what you speak. Avoid being rude and short tempered.Leave your ego behind- An individual needs to hide his ego everywhere he goes. Be it office or workplace you need to leave your ego behind if you wish to win appreciation from others. An individual who is good from within is loved by all.Avoid Backbiting- Backstabbing and criticizing people are negative traits which work against an individual\u2019s personality. Learn to appreciate others. If someone has done some extraordinary task, do not forget to give a pat on his/her back. Believe me; the other person will speak high of you even when you are not around. Do not spread unnecessary rumours about someone. An individual should not try to interfere too much in someone\u2019s personal life. Dishonesty, cheating, lies tarnish your image and people start avoiding you in the long run. If your friend is seeing someone, you have absolutely no rights to make his/her affair national news.Help others- Do not always think of harming others. Share whatever you know. Remember no one can steal your knowledge. Always help others.Confidence- Confidence is the key to a positive personality. Exude confidence and positive aura wherever you go.A Patient listener- Be a patient listener. Never interrupt when others are speaking. Try to imbibe good qualities of others.. OKAY Quorans.

            "answer_text": "Personality Development: Age 2\u20136 The preschool years are associated with major developments in young children's socialization. No longer totally dependent on their parents, preschoolers begin the long road to becoming adept at functioning on their own in the world. During early childhood (ages 2\u20136), children gain some sense of being separate and independent from their parents. According to Erikson, the task of preschoolers is to develop autonomy, or self\u2010direction, (ages 1\u20133), as well as initiative, or enterprise (ages 3\u20136). Personality includes those stable psychological characteristics that define each human being as unique. Both children and adults have personality traits (long\u2010term characteristics, such as temperament) and states (changeable characteristics, such as moodiness). While a variety of explanations are possible, most experts agree that whatever the causes, an individual's personality is solidly established by the end of early childhood. According to Freud, the second year of childhood is the anal stage of psychosexual development, when parents face many new challenges while toilet training their children. Fixations at this stage may give rise to characteristic personality traits that fully emerge in adulthood. These personality traits include anal retention (excessive neatness, organization, and withholding) or anal expulsion (messiness and altruism). Personality theorists after Freud have attempted to explain early childhood personality development. Learning theorists claim that personality develops as a result of classical conditioning (Ivan Pavlov's learning by association), operant conditioning (B. F. Skinner's learning by reinforcement and punishment), and observational learning (Albert Bandura's learning by imitation). This latter category involves identification, or internalization, whereby children observe and adopt the values, ideas, and standards of their significant others. Cognitive psychologists speculate that personality arises, in part, from the attitudes and biases expressed by the adults around them. Gender theorists claim that personality develops from \u201cgender identification\u201d and \u201cgender socialization\u201d. Geneticists speculate that personality arises from \u201cwired in\u201d genetic and biochemical influences rather than psychosocial ones. In the final analysis, no perspective alone can adequately explain the complex processes of personality development. A combination of psychosocial, parental, and biological influences are likely responsible for the ultimate determination of human traits and states. ",
