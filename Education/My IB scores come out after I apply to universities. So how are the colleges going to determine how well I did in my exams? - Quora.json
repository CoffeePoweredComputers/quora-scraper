            "answer_text": "Universities will likely give you one of two offers: The university may choose to give you an unconditional offer based on your grades, the strength of your application, and your teacher references.The university may choose to give you an offer with certain conditions that you must fulfill during final examination in order to be accepted into the university. These conditions are determined based on predictions that your teacher made.So, in short, the universities don't know if you're going to do well. They just set up a barrier that you have to hurdle over in order to get into the university. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're an American, applying to US universities, the score doesn't really end up mattering in most cases. However, if you're an American applying to a foreign university, or an international student applying to (US) universities, it can determine admittance. Many universities have conditional offers. Meaning, if your predicted IB score is X, they will expect you to score X (or higher). If you fail to meet X, they can rescind your admissions. Or, the university may just have a minimum score of Y and you have to earn an IB score of Y (or higher). However, if you're simply an American student staying in the US for school, IB exam scores really only matter in determining college credit. A bad IB exam score is the same as a bad AP score. There usually isn't any penalty. You just don't get credit for it. Good luck. ",
