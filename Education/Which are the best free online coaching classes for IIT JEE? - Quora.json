            "answer_text": "Free coaching is not the thing you should go with because they are in such an unorganized manner that will only waste your time. So pay a little and try to save your carrier and time as online coaching worth paying them. As they are not so much costly as compared to the offline coaching at your city. Online Coaching are the best way to save your time for the preparations of IIT-JEE, as they give you flexibility with the timings and your study syllabus. It gives you knowledge with comfort. As these coaching provide the video lectures of some best teachers they have, knowledge and concepts become easier to grasp there. Its fun learning from them. You can repeat the number of chapters or the topics with these lectures, that can comfort our learning of the harder topics. So there is some of your comfortable companions which can help you out: 1)Bi Ju\u2019s 2)Etoos India 3)Kaysons Educations 4)Embibe There are some more coaching among which you can choose, where the choice lies in your hand. So choose wisely\u2026.. I personally chose Kaysons Educations for my prep in my class 12th,because I was lagging behind in my coaching at my city due to my regular illness for 3 months. So I searched for my options and came up with it, because it has lots of benefits over others.. RESULTS:- The main factor to choose a coaching are its results, this was also my first priority, so I checked out for coaching and found its results very satisfying.  These were a much satisfying numbers to opt for it. PREPARATION STRATEGY: -Then it came about the strategy of preparation i.e. number of hours of lectures, course content in it, and their teachers. I found it from their website, as they have a very good interface at their websites. The thing that fascinates me most that they give you lectures which you can look through for number of times you want. DOUBT CLEARING:- As the main fear of the students opting for online courses is that how they will clear the doubts they will encounter with. So I searched for it too on their website and got satisfying assurance from it. TEACHERS:- Later the major factor comes in mind is of teachers which i think they have ample amount of good teachers and problem solving(doubt solving) assistants too.TEST SERIES:- One of the last things that come in mind is of practicing your ability and testing it, so lately we get concerns about test series, which i think they have arranged well too. Have a better look for it from their website.At last I found worth taking online coaching, I deeply suggest it over local offline coaching, go for it if you can\u2019t reach Kota or any renowned city for prep. I am not telling you to join only Kaysons, you should be open to all, compare all of them and choose for the best. I hope you can take up with my experience. Hope best for you. ALL the best for your preparations then\u2026.. ",
