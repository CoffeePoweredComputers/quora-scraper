            "answer_text": "Based on personal experience and with a small extension, it depends really on your aim: Udemy gives you in most case a very hands-on approach.Coursera will give you a very academic point-of-viewLydia/LinkedIn learning will scratch the surface.Udacity will present a well-curated view of a larger topic. The way I use the 4 platforms is the following: I take Udacity when I have no real clue about a larger topic.I did two nano degrees (Frontend and Fullstack). This allowed me to built my first sites and have a first good idea of how to decide what to learn more.I might do one AI course (if I can find the time) in the futureI look at Udemy when I have a concrete issue which I cannot solve with the usual documentation.The best example would be the programming of a CAD-part viewer. I took a three.js course and done.I have a look at LinkedIn learning when I need a very high-level vision (the courses are really short)It helps me to decide what to do: (i) nothing - and I did not waste my time - (ii) move to Udemy - because I need a fast implementation - (iii) move to Coursera because I need more backgroundCoursera is great when you want knowledge and not know how. Sometimes you need this step to implement fast solutions.If you start an AI or data analytics course, it might good to have a college level refresher in statistics. This is what I did. Conclusion: the platforms address different problems. You need to match their use with your needs. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot say that one is better than others all the platform are of different purpose and offer a different kind of learning experience. So I would recommend to choose the platform based on what you want to learn.  Coursera Coursera has the largest variety of courses. They also provide the freest or low-cost options, including offering financial aid. They have self-paced courses, courses on-demand, and timed classes. The classes usually range between four and twelve weeks. Most of the courses on Coursera are free, and some require a small fee to participate in certificate programs and specializations, or a sequence of classes that include a capstone project. These certificates can also be shared on LinkedIn. You can also apply for financial aid in Coursera. One of Coursera\u2019s unique offerings is the peer assessments. Studies have shown that learning is highest from peer review and add nuance to computer-scored tests. You can expect short lectures and interactive quizzes, allowing you time to engage with instructors and peers. I have found the learning experience in Coursera great in the area that I am focused on which is training and eLearning  Udacity has a vast range of classes, especially in programming and computer science. But compared to other platform it had less number of courses. Their paid programs include coaching, feedback, and verified certificates. Udacity partners with universities to create courses that are credited and also has programs called nano degrees. These nano degree courses are made toward the employment needs of their corporate partners like Google, Facebook, AT&T, and others.
