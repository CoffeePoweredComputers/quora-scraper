            "answer_text": "I would very much like to answer this question in a straight forward manner. If you are of ICSE board then you can find a little difficult question in many different books and that too for each Chapter, However if you are looking for extremely useful and difficult questions, then solve the optional part of NCERT and a question in triangles is my favorite one it's called:Prove that the sum of squares of sides of a parallelogram is equal to the sum of the squares of it's diagonals. Edit : IF YOU HAVE FOUND THIS QUESTION TOO EASY , THEN TRY THIS MORE DIFFICULT ONE : Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with \u2220B = 90\u25e6.Let I be the incentre of ABC. Draw a line perpendicular to AI at I. Let it intersect the line CB at D. Prove that CI is perpendicular to AD and prove that ID =Sqrt(b(b \u2212 a)) ,where BC = a and CA = b. Even though it is a question from RMO, doesn't mean it will be difficult , it can be solved elegantly with using only very basic tools like Pythagoras theorem, similarity ,incenter relation with triangle etc. ",

Still, if you go just by CBSE NCERT Mathematics book of class 10, then the most rated question in terms of difficulty is the question 9 from exercise 4.3 of chapter 4 Quadratic Equations which is \u2018Two water taps together can fill a tank 9 and 3/8 hours. The tap of larger diameter takes 10 hour less than the smaller one to fill the tank separately. Find the time in which each tap can separately fill the tank.\u2019 Though, it is not so difficult but students find hard to understand and make equations to solve it. ",
