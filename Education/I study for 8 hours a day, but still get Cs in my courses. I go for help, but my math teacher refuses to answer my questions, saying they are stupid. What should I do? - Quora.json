            "answer_text": "I had a terrific math teacher for Algebra I in high school and then 3 teachers between poor and downright rotten. In college I had to start over from Algebra and reach the first Calculus course in the second year. The second quarter of Calculus, another magnetic, inspiring professor helped me understand and my grades went really high and stayed there because I followed him through all the following courses of Calculus. Because I waited to take many engineering courses until I had most of the math courses complete, there were a number of good grades on my transcript. Consider the possibility that your being discouraged with one course causes you lower grades in others. There are 2 possible problems for you to consider. Is math a subject that is too hard? If it is not, then do you have the right teacher to help you learn? I can think of a number of subjects that I could spend all day long studying and never pass. Those are simply outside my skills and abilities. It is no sin or shame that there are some things outside what I can do, because there are many other things I can do well. My high school math grades were poor. But my ACT math score was somewhere in the order of 98 percentile and science 99 percentile. If there is such a disagreement with your standardized test results and your school grades, there is a reason. Before you give up, look for the things you can do well. You deserve a peaceful, happy, satisfying and productive life. It is yours if you make it yours. ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like you should make an appointment with the head of the math department at your school, and get an explanation for your teacher\u2019s bad attitude. No teacher should refuse to answer questions related to the material. (If your questions are not related to class material, I can understand your teacher\u2019s reluctance.). You should take some training in study habits, possibly on-line. You may be studying hard, but ineffectively. If you can afford it, you should consider a private tutor. Even another student in your class might help for reasonable amounts. Studying without guidance can be a matter of going around in mental circles. ",

When I was in high school, a tutor who brought my math from 40s to a final test of 92 saved me from repeating Regents Geometry. Picking up some review tests or a textbook with a different approach may help you too. Sometimes one explanation doesn\u2019t make sense but another will. People learn differently. ",
