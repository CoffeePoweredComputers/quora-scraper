            "answer_text": "Mascots\u2014both team names and actual physical costumed mascots\u2014provide a rallying point for a school. They often simplify identity. For example, my middle school was named for a former Premier of Ontario, and my high school was named for a former local school board official and a former longtime local principal. While they were three outstanding men, only the Premier retained relevancy by the time that I attended the school, so we knew ourselves as \u201cBulldogs\u201d and \u201cTrojans\u201d. With physical mascots, it\u2019s may be easier to connect with their spirit. While theoretically it should be easiest to connect with the spirit raised by a cheerleader or spirit team, as a student you might be like \u201cugh, why does Ashley S. get the best part time job at the mall, and I'm stuck at the Burger Barn?\u201d But hide someone under a giant-headed costume, and it\u2019s easier to relate to their outward joviality, and create a remove from the person animating the suit. There\u2019s also a continuity with a costume, someone\u2019s seeing the same rallying point their full four years at the school, as opposed to perhaps even multiple different people in a single year that animate the costume.

            "answer_text": "At first, teams used animals or other symbols as good luck charms (mascotte was a french word for a good luck charm), extra entertainment for the audience or as a means to try and intimidate the other team (you probably notice that most teams are named after predators or warriors), they would even bring live animals to the field. One of the earliest known examples of a mascot being used in sports was with the Chicago Cubs when they used a taxidermy bear in 1908, then graduated to a live cub in 1916. But it seems like the rise of the mascot was in the 1930s which is when we started to see it more at the university level as well as the professional level. Probably as a means to encourage bigger audiences during the Great Depression but that is just speculation on my part. Mascots as we know them started during the 1960s. Supposedly the fuzzy cuteness of the Jim Hanson puppets influenced the change so mascots starting wearing the suits. ",
