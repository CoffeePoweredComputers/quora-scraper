            "answer_text": "For PGs, you\u2019ve got two options. Section 126, which is right next to Amity. Opposite Gate no. 2. Amity is in sector 125. It is also called Raipur Village and is located closest to the campus. A walk of 5 minutes or less. There are nearly 30 PGs, all all types., in Raipur village. For cheaper options you can look for PGs in Sector 44. It\u2019s about 10 mins walk from the campus. You need to cross the foot-over-bridge which connects sector 125 to sector 44. There are many kith-type PGs available in sector 44 and it\u2019s quite a lovely locality to live. I\u2019ve lived for almost two years in PG in Sector 126 Raipur and then I shifted to a flat. ",
