            "answer_text": "If we didn\u2019t have the internet, educational online platforms like LearnCube, virtual classrooms like Blackboard Collaborate, learning management systems (LMS) like Tovuti, or digital tools for distance learning by Kdan, e-learning wouldn\u2019t be possible. This would mean that millions of children around the globe wouldn\u2019t be able to continue education during the ongoing pandemic crisis and thousands and thousands of teachers would stay without jobs for an uncertain period of time. Luckily for us, the technology was there prior to the Covid-19 crisis. We don\u2019t know what may happen tomorrow and how this unexpected and drastic move to online learning will affect the educational format in the long run. What we can be sure of is that further integration of technology in education will be accelerated and we know learning happens best when tasks are personalized, individual progress is tracked and feedback appears right away. That\u2019s why schools around the world are shifting toward more adaptive technology. It\u2019s a field that is developing at a lightning speed, with innovative solutions to e-learning challenges that are springing up everywhere. Therefore, we have acknowledged the presence and use of technology in our educational system, and by embracing technological changes and applying them well, will be able to to see the following benefits while creating a new, safe and stimulating learning environment for our children: Learning will be adaptive. Learning styles will be diverse and educational content will be presented in all possible formats, including those that are all accessible right now - written, audio, video, and virtual;Learning will be interactive. It\u2019s well-known that learners of all ages learn much better from interacting with the subject of their study, comparing to traditional teaching methods;Learning will be available on any device, any location, and to everyone;Students will be supported in exploring knowledge at a pace that fits their needs;Learning will be immersive due to the integration of virtual reality technologies;Learning will be multi-disciplinary and reciprocal for the achievement of better results in shorter periods of time;Learning will be gamified and collaborative.

Technology has revolutionized many facets of life, including the way we live. Technology has impacted education because of using information and communication technology in teaching (Sto\u0161i\u0107, 2015). Technology is a powerful tool for transforming learning because it changes the mode of teaching in classrooms. Education has played a significant role in schools, and this fact cannot be ignored. According to Raja and Nagasubramani (2018), visual images have a greater appeal to students more than words. Technology uses visual images, and this causes students to be engaged in learning, hence making them retain a lot of information. Educational technology does not impair students ability to remember, unlike blackboard teaching (Helen Lee Bouygues, 2019). Students with access to technology perform better compared to students without access to technology. According to a Global Education Census Report by Cambridge Assessment International Education (2018), 48% of K-12 students reported that they use a desktop in school, 42% smartphones, 20% tablets, and 33% interactive whiteboards (Bernstein, 2019). Educational technology also includes using smart devices, robotics, and software applications from education administration to deliver learning content to enhance the students educational outcomes (D\u00fcndar & Ak\u00e7ay\u0131r, 2017). In the past decade, the demand for using educational technology in schools has been increasing due to rapid technological advancements (Tugun, 2016). For this reason, this article will look at the following; importance of technology in education, current state of technology in education, positive and negative effects of technology in education, and future considerations of technology in education. Education is changing due to the rapid changes in the technology landscape. Technology in education is important because educators use technology to aid learning in classrooms. The use of technology in education helps teachers to tailor students needs and assist them with learning (Harris, Al-Bataineh, & Al-Bataineh, 2016). The use of technology in education helps educators to track the mastery of the subjects by the learners (Sto\u0161i\u0107, 2015). According to a report by the U.S. Department of education, the office of educational technology, technology in education helps to affirm the relationships between educators and students (Office of Educational Technology, 2017). Therefore, for the benefits of educational technology to be fully realized, educators should strive to acquire new knowledge, alongside their students (Ghavifekr & Rosdy, 2015). According to Kassymova et al. (2019), education technology interacts with learners' cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal abilities, which acts as a powerful complementary or substitution instrument and resource. Furthermore, education technology enhances or improves traditional learning, systems, and strategies (Dede, 2014). Educational technology has achieved significant progress by increasing the interactivity of learners (Raja & Nagasubramani, 2018). Whenever learning materials are presented to students using technology, they interact more as they exchange ideas (Bond, Zawacki-Richter, & Nichols, 2018). According to the Office of Educational Technology (2017), students need to be given an early exposure to technology to be able to participate in a global economy. Technology-enabled education allows students to learn from any other environment apart from the school environs, hence removing any barriers towards learning. Digital competences have been introduced to assist students master abstract principles and skills through analysis of real-world scenarios using digital content. Educational technology makes teaching easier, economical, and accessible to anyone interested (Burbules, 2018). Educational technology, such as online platforms, allows learners to express themselves without fear or prejudice, and educators are able to assess the students at an individual level. (Papanastasiou et al., 2018). In recent years, class technology has evolved from using traditional learning to technological learning caused by rapid changes in the technology industry (Zakrajsek, 2016). Currently, there have been rapid changes in the educational technology landscape (Office of Educational Technology,2017) Education technology has introduced interactive whiteboards and Chromebooks, helping students to have a firm grasp of the material. According to Zimmerman (2018), over 30 million students in elementary and primary schools use Google education applications. Zimmerman further notes that by 2026, digital learning will replace traditional learning. Various studies have revealed the increasing adoption of educational technology. Technology adoption in schools has not yet achieved a 100% transition, but it is relatively high. Technology in education has achieved a significant impact, especially in the learners. Effective use of educational technology has enhanced the learning experiences of the learners (Sto\u0161i\u0107, 2015). Education technology increases the cognitive characteristics of the learners. Therefore, a learner develops in terms of information processing, skills, and other brain processes. Technology is cost-effective, efficient, and highlights the strengths and capabilities of different students in a general classroom setting (Dede, 2014) . Technology minimizes the distraction of children and boosts their learning curve, hence improving their performance in school. Gamification is an educational and technological tool that promotes students engagement and motivation, which has a strong motivation appeal to gain knowledge. If gamification is applied in the correct educational setting, it enhances students understanding capabilities (Lee, 2019). Gamification can also be used to motivate students with dyslexia since they have fragile self-esteem (Gooch et al., 2016). To enhance educational technology, teachers use gamification, which involves using competitive scenarios to make the class engaging and funny (Connolly & Boyle, 2016). When the classroom is lively, students become livelier and participate in the learning process. Gamification should be designed to include digital storytelling that is exiting, and students can relate (Acquah & Katz, 2020). Gamification reduces passivity and encourages students to be more interactive in the classroom (Elshiekh & Butgerit, 2017). Gamification techniques include role-playing, where students lead arguments as historical figures such as Isaac Newton (Martin & Tyler, 2017). Using technology in the classroom can be useful in gamification. In such cases, the teacher delivers the curriculum partially in digital form, and partly in person. Due to advancement in technology and ICT, cheaper and more effective technological tools have been developed and made accessible (Shalin, 2014). However, most schools have not been able to adopt educational technology due to the initial resistance to change. Most of them are using the wait and see strategy. Gamification helps students to behave better and become fully engaged during the lesson (Homer, Hew, & Tan, 2018). Gamification increases the attention span on students due to the incorporation of games in learning (Ghavifekr & Rosdy, 2015). Despite the positive effects of gamification in education technology, gamification has some adverse effects on education. For instance, when students lack interest in learning traditional approaches, they focus on technological approaches (Lee, 2019) . Lack of interest in learning causes learners to misunderstand the teacher, thereby causing them to fail during exams. Education technology, specifically gamification, requires huge capital investments during incorporation, however, due to insufficient funds in most institutions of learning, adoption of education technology becomes a challenge (King & South, 2016) . Based on the findings of this research, it is evident that technology plays a significant and positive role in education. For that reason, education technology should be adopted by all schools, most importantly, elementary and primary schools. This research has established that educational technology has a positive impact on the cognitive development process of children (Sto\u0161i\u0107, 2015). Therefore, the earlier learners incorporate technology in their studies, the better for them and the schools. To make education technology better, I propose that educators should undergo training regularly to sharpen their skills. Additionally, if educators are well equipped with the latest technological advancement, they will pass that to the learners. References Acquah, E. O., & Katz, H. T. (2020).
