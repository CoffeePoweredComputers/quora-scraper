            "answer_text": "We hate that the first year was filled with stupid seniors telling us that life in NIT is easier if you're a girl. I hated getting through GDs in tech club events only because I was a girl who could throw words together. So, no, we don't enjoy the 'special treatment' - not in first year, not after.We're not spending all our free time gossiping or studying. We watch TV shows, read books, maintain blogs, paint, cook food, empty the night canteen.In first year, most of the guys look downright silly as they're still trying to figure out how to dress. By final year, most of you look quite presentable. Even the girls go through such transformation, obviously.I'll admit that we don't dress very fashionably. But sometimes, when we do, react subtly to it (open mouthed-ness and comments about 'I didn't know NITK had such girls..' will elicit ignorance/dirty looks in response).We prefer our FnH to yours, and are jealous of you for having a fully functional one. I hear the Fresh and Honest outlet near the GB has been closed :/We like the beach a lot, and find it irritating that you would suggest that it is a couples-only place. We like our (yes, \"our\") beach more, because it's cleaner. Some of us sit outside the GB only because we can. We hate the home-guards and find it amusing that most of you are scared of them.Why you think you've to 'drop' us off at the GB gate? It's a little hard to get lost or mugged from the MB to GB, no? Easy with the chivalry :)We would appreciate if you didn't act like morons on the days before elections. I'm often dissuaded from going through the voting process itself due to the inanity that you display. Party politics? Give me a break.Even our mess food sucks. All of us grow fatter because of the mess. Surprised? Maida and oil and lord knows what else! We don't have long queues, so we do go to the mess, and the akkas show us their love by adding buckets of oil in the food they make. Carbs and fat is all we can consume when we eat mess food. GB \"parties\" are fucking over-rated. It's absolute rubbish. Imagine oily haired, sweaty and sleepy girls in faded pajamas jumping and acting like freed inmates from Tihar. But there are also the few very pretty and sincere ones who want to make the parties nice for everyone else, and who show up in heels and nice clothes.A CCD night out is a big deal to many of us.We don't like Manipal all that much. There's better and cheaper food in Mangalore. Some of us hate big groups. All the freshers and farewells lose their charm right after the first experience with them. Not because we find them intimidating, but because conversation in such groups is superficial, always. Inter alia, we don't like the small talk that you come up with to simply be seen to talk to females. We especially dislike your need to have a conversation in front of the GB, and dislike it more when you 'drop' us off, and won't.. go back.Don't even think about doing the fraandship with us.We're never (ever) in want of a boyfriend. Exceptions being stereotyped is the worst thing you could do. Since we aren't in want of a boyfriend, we don't understand why you crib about being friend zoned. Or maybe I don't understand the concept of friend-zoning. Nevertheless, you shouldn't crib about being bro-zoned, because you must be something, if you have been. We are jealous of how much work and group studies (assignments and projects are less painful, right?) goes on in the guys' block.We don't think we are getting placed because we're girls. We believe we have the same right to being recognized for our intellect as you do.Oh, we're eternally jealous of the fact that you don't have block timings.The mega-block has some very valuable technology that the country's defence institutions might find interesting - the building is constructed in such a way that we get no signal at all inside our rooms. EM wave blocking. Mind boggling. Do you know that the library is off limits for girls 45 minutes before the block timing? The swimming pool is not accessible to first years unless they inform the guards at the gate. They have to sprint back to the block from the pool, if they manage to get the guards to let them go, by convincing them that they are indeed using the pool, and aren't just loafing around. Not cool.By convention, we're not supposed to wear shorts. Wardens, from the chief warden to the care-taker, and seniors have  warned us against wearing shorts - shorts invite trouble from 'construction workers' and 'boys' (yes, you too, \"NITK boy\"). Right. Some of us wear shorts anyway. The GB mata is our hero. Even if she does a lot of emotional drama to get us to dance for the (not so) grand GB dance in Crescendo. Some of us are mortified by the GB dogs. I think they're more terrified of us. They usually look like they're drugged, but I don't blame them, they feed on the mess food. Will keep adding more to the list. ",
