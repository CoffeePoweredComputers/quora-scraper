            "answer_text": "Hii Mr. Vaibhav!! First of all if you are actually serious about improvement exam and think that if you'll work hard then you'll get really good result then yes you should go for it or anyone for whom you are asking should go for it\u2026 There aren't any drawbacks as such but yaa few things are there which might bother students..: If a student does not score well in the improvement exam, then he/she will have to produce both the marksheets wherever required/demanded.CBSE improvement exam marksheet has only the subjects in which the student has appeared for improvement, not the previous subjects.The improvement exam marksheet is different from the regular board exam result. \u201cAPPEARED FOR IMPROVEMENT\u201d is mentioned on the CBSE Improvement Exam marksheet.So think wisely and step ahead\u2026 All the best dear!! Stay positive!! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there exists a demerit of sitting for improvement exams. I appeared for improvement exams after 12th boards in CBSE boards. I scored 59% and was taking time for preparing for entrance exams so I decided to sit for improvement in all of the subjects, at first I was too worried as this is not so common that people are sitting for these exams. Inspite of all this uncertainty I wanted to improve my score. I registered as a private candidate followed by a wait of a year for the conduction for these exams. The exam was conducted and grade card was recived by post, the improved score was 69%. I got into an engineering college and studied there it was time for campus placements and as I remember some of the companies have their requirement criteria as \u201cTHERE SHOULD BE NO YEAR GAPS.\u201d It means that some firms don't accept their employees to have a year gap or more in their study timeline, but there exists companies which have different hiring credentials. And that is all. There's always an alternative, if you want to do something. When there is a will, there is a way. ",
