            "answer_text": "For the last two years, I\u2019ve taught elementary school exclusively. This has fortunately meant that I don\u2019t have to worry a lot about this kind of thing. The most I ever have to deal with in this age group is a student saying either that they think I\u2019m handsome or that their friend thinks so. But I\u2019m just as likely to get that from a 2nd- or 3rd- grade boy as I am from a 5th- or 6th-grade girl, and it\u2019s usually blurted out in the middle of class or in a busy hallway where it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m not behaving inappropriately. I tend to think that in the vast majority of these cases (even the girls) there\u2019s not really anything behind the comments. Before that, I spent four and a half years teaching at a couple of after-school language academies that taught elementary-aged students in the afternoons and middle school-aged students in the evenings. The curriculum was built around 3-month course books rather than year-long plans, and student turnover was considerable. When one of the older girls had a crush on me, they were typically discreet enough about it that they didn\u2019t make it clear until they\u2019d quietly hand me a little note (usually something along the lines of \u201cgoodbye teacher, I love you, please don\u2019t forget about me\u201d) as they left on their last day. Look, people have feelings. That\u2019s normal at any age. And at that age, when you add in a flood of hormones that cause all sorts of emotional mayhem, these kinds of crushes are completely understandable. Unless a student acts in a way that puts me at risk, their feelings are their feelings, and I\u2019m not going to try to do anything about them. Even at my age, I know what it\u2019s like to feel a certain way and not be able to act on it. I can empathize enough with kids who are dealing with that to know that as long as they stay on their side of \u201cthe line,\u201d then the kindest thing I can do is to leave it be and treat them as I would any other student. The fact that they\u2019re young does not make their feelings any less valid. That\u2019s a point I thank Dushka Zapata for making. I can respect their feelings without indulging them. ",

            "answer_text": "If the male teacher is single and open for relationship, he will probably feel so great about himself and start to appreciate his job more than he does now . (Think of it as a self ego-booster) If he is currently dating someone/is married, then he will probably try to contain his feelings/minimize his contact with female students whom he thinks kinda of forward & is probably crushing on him (trust me, we can feel it all the time\u2026) He might refrain from his previously open/approachable behaviors in order to save himself from troubles and misunderstandings. Also, you would likely hear more of \u201cmy girlfriend\u2026/my wife agrees \u2026\u201d in his conversations - meaning to address he is taken and those who are interested in him should probably give up by then. Hope this helps! :) Best, L ",
