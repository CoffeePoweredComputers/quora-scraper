            "answer_text": "I was once recommended by a friend who have same interest in React to learn it from survivejs (I can't remember the link, you can Google it). So, survivejs actually is a book and there is also its free online version. This book give me some insights on how React works in a really simple way by following systematic and structured tutorial. You will be guided to make a simple app using react. Moreover, you can discuss problems you would encounter with the author of the book by chatting. He usually respond your chat quickly enough.  I think the only downside is that some parts at the end of the book is can not be accessed because basically it's more like \"trial\" version so you would buy them if you want to know more about react. I really like survivejs and would recommend every people to learn basic of react from it. This free online version book really help me as a first step to dive in JavaScript world. ",
