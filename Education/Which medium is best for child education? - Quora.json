            "answer_text": "Knowing any language doesn't mark out boundary of one\u2019s intelligence. Else knowing a language is part of your intelligence. When it comes to education, knowledge is most important thing, which comes with concept building . So hardly matters, which language i have built my concepts in!!When it comes to express that knowledge, then comes the role of Effective communication. Here knowledge of language plays role, so that you can choose appropriate words.So restricting our child to a specific medium, is restricting their wisdom. Once pillars of building (KNOWLEDGE) are strong enough, you can design walls and interior as per you with confidence.",

Several studies proves that children takes more interest in studies and learning when it comes with entertainment / fun. That\u2019s why pre schoolling has become an order of the day. I have admitted my 3 year old in Nordic International School (Link) and so far I am quite happy with the progress. Its one of the best Pre School in Pakistan in my opinion. ",
