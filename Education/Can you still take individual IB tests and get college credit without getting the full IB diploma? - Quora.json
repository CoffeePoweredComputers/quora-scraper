            "answer_text": "As others have said, you can take IB \u2018certificates\u2019, which are individual courses without the full diploma or the CAS, TOK, or EE, which can be a great option depending on the student. Whether or not you get college credit is up to the university or college that you apply to/end up going to, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of universities give individual credits for your IB certificates and not just the diplomas. Some super elite universities (the Ivies come to mind) don\u2019t seem to take certificate courses (sometimes not even IB or AP courses at all) for credits, but other than that, you should be good for most universities.

Most students who follow this route do not carry out the \u201ccore\u201d elements of CAS, TOK and the Extended Essay. I have known many students who have done this and still gone on to have great university experiences. ",
