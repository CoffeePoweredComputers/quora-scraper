            "answer_text": "well, college where i'm at is secondary school. which is what americans call 8th to 12th grade or whatever. but i'm assuming you mean university, which is further education. 3\u20134 years of your life to get a degree that is mostly useless without backing by another PG? yah. the IB is really hard, and really stressful. like really, really hard. it gives you a laureate and all, but it definitely is not college or university, as we call it here. it kinda prepares you for it - and a lot more than lots of other educational systems. you get used to the long class hours, the tough homework schedules, the painfully and irritatingly long assignments with endless word counts. you get used to balance, and if you did IB in a boarding school like i did, you get used to being independent. the depression is easier to manage from thence, and so is the anxiety. you know what's coming, you've had a glimpse of it. that's what the IB does - it's a peephole into the outside. it's way clearer and bigger a peep hole than other educational systems, but it's harder to see through. because of how tough it is. in conclusion, no the IB is not college. it kind of prepares you for it, makes college less difficult for you. you get credits in america i think. but no it does nothing else, except of course ruin your street cred and make you more nerdy -which is great, really.

            "answer_text": "Not really, but I also don\u2019t think its equivalent to a regular High School diploma. I went through it, and it was a harsh reality check for me. I started thinking the classes were easy, and never developed any good study habits. I\u2019d often study the day before the test, not pay attention in class and just goof around, all the time. User-10512164222233629743 will vouch for me with my goofing. Constant goofing. There was never a class I didn\u2019t goof around. Then came the year 1 exams. Boy, did I get figuratively smacked in the face by them. I did manage to pull it together and graduated with a pretty decent grade (36). All that said, I don\u2019t regret doing it. It is an advanced course, and I find myself at an advantage compared to those who did A-levels (British diploma), and so far, Year 1 of University has been a breeze. You also instantly relate with IB students anywhere in the world by saying things like \u201cTOK, amirite?\u201d ",
