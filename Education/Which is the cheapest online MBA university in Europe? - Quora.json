            "answer_text": "The cheapest online MBA would be independently teaching yourself what you\u2019d get from an MBA program. Pull a syllabus from literally any school, then head over to look at the plethora of options for both MOOCs (EdX, et al) and inexpensive paid (Udemy, et al) and learn everything you need, or want, there. You could probably do everything for between free and a few hundred dollars. If you want connections or the credential, you *do not* want the cheapest, you want the best. If you just want the credential, there are diploma mills that will certify and package your \u201cexperience\u201d into a degree and sell it to you. It will be a worthless credential, but frankly you wouldn\u2019t be the first, and a lot of these folks seem to end up both in academia and industry\u2026 check the news, folks get caught at this all the time.
