I spoke with my teachers and all I need is a grade above a 72 in physics for my second semester to pass the class and do credit recovery in economics. Luckily, I will be graduating in time. I just need to maintain my grades now. My school could be different than yours so I recommend you to email your teachers and ask for their guidance. Just keep in mind that they are rooting for you. They want you to graduate. Good luck. ",

My school allows.failing grades if you pass the state test. They also only require 22 credits so you can fail 4 semesters and still graduate. They recently changed it unfortunately but our seniors still hold true to the 22 credit arrangement while juniors and lower have to pass all 24 classes. Anyways good luck ik sure you're going to graduate. ",

I suppose this holds true in math and social studies as well. Talk to the counselor. ",
