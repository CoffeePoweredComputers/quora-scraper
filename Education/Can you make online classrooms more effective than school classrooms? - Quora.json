            "answer_text": "You'd first have to figure out whether school classrooms are effective in the first place, and if so, why.  A large lecture course is so impersonal that it may as well be projected remotely, but even in a moderately large class there's the possibility that some students will influence the instruction through their questions.  If the online \"classroom\" is a one-way video stream of a live lecture, or a series of individually prepared video clips, there is no actual response to the audience in the lesson, and I see no difference between this and the transcript of said lecture distributed as a textbook. In a smaller course, naturally, it's possible to be creative with the group learning structure that make students less oblivious to each other.  Discussions, group work, presentations, and so on all improve the learning environment.  This is actually much easier to imagine replicating online: even a massive online course could be automatically divided into small groups that communicate among themselves via videoconferencing.  It would still be difficult to do anything that treats the students as individuals on a classwide scale, though. Lastly, personal interaction with the professor or at least with teaching assistants is a big part of what makes a college course more than its textbook.  In an online course of any size you can't have the former, and with sufficient size, not even the latter.  This means that large online classes are inherently limited to being a kind of certification that students have undertaken the process of studying the material, but can't really provide the intellectual depth of real learning.  A small online course of a few dozen (i.e. the size of a section of a normal course) could probably be done the same as an in-person class, as long as it is live. ",

            "answer_text": "Not if you have and value the interaction between the lecturer and the students, if the lecture was a one way street it wouldn't matter. Our daughter when attending med school selectively didn't attend those lectures where it wasn't better than looking over the notes, kindly provided by the lecturer, online (University of Groningen, The Netherlands, around 2005), she felt she could by working by herself be more effective than spending all that time attending the lecture in person. When I was a freshman at med school in the sixties, we had around 300 students attending class, no interactions possible.Still, if the lecturer was able to make the lecture interesting, even memorable, it would be worthwhile to attend.  This is very hard to do teaching basic preclinical stuff which almost nobody can relate to. So taking these classes online would be just as good as live, maybe better because one can take a pause in between. Interesting interactions started when classes in the 4th and 5th (clinical) years at another University had shrunk to \u00b180 students, and a few inspiring Professors would ask random students what they thought about the problems a patient who attended these lectures presented themselves with (by giving their history).  It taught us the thought process a doctor needs, not just memorizing a list of symptoms caused by a disease, but making a synthesis of the facts you have learned to come to a short list of possible diagnosis and how to look further what it could be (= differential diagnosis).  Some Professors only asked the interns who had to attend these lectures, other would first ask for a respond, and if there was none would ask a random student often sitting in the back, hoping (s)he wouldn't get noticed.  For some a bit stressful, but very instructive and enjoyable lectures.  The most popular of these lectures was on Saturday morning (!!) starting at 8:30 am to 1 pm with just a 30 minutes coffee break in between.  This Professor of Internal Medicine inspired me to become an internist myself. EDIT: just listened to a radio program among others on opportunities in the PRC:   A Dutch Professor who was invited to lecture Chinese students asked how he should do it, he was told to just do it \"the Dutch way\", which he didn't understand.  Anyway, he saw how Chinese Professors lectured, reading from their notes for 3 hours without any interaction with the students, after a pause again 3 hours;  so when he gave his lecture after around 10 minutes he asked the students on their reaction to something he had said, they were very much surprised, but later on thawed and were glad he did.  This Dutch Professor then thought about how students participation in The Netherlands is encouraged from Kindergarten level on: all children sitting in a circle telling the class about their small insignificant experiences of the day before, when his child had to do this he didn't think much of it, but after the Chinese experience learned that this early encouragement to participate in class was so valuable.

            "answer_text": "I think we are at a point when this is a must and not a possibility that we have to explore.I am speaking from a perspective of a parent (I have a young school-aged child). Since the previous industrialized model of education has been proven as obsolete in more ways than one, for details, please consult: We simply must make the technology work in a way that allow kids to learn and relate their learning to their age, and allow others to contribute (mostly, here I am referring to the ability of parents/educators to intervene and make corrections if the concept is not clear). Kids learn at different rates and different levels, and kids are interested in different things: if someone wants to learn about insects and another kid is interested in planets, the curriculum can be adjusted for that to make it open-ended in terms of subject matter but sticking to concepts discussed in school. But most importantly, classroom learning must be based on the reality of child's life.Latest technologies in school are great but not all homes have them, and eliminating pen/paper on some assignments while mandating them for other assignments is not practical and very confusing: kids complete assessments online only to bring home paper copies of problems as homework. Really? I'm not advocating gamification but rather changing the separation of school realm and actual life and merge them together: a problem about apples and pebbles is fun but making it more related to the term a child can relate to, such as money is more beneficial. To illustrate, below is a story which happened a couple of years ago, and it suits the dilemma of engaging children into life and making learning practically around the clock since kids absorb information and naturally seek out ways to apply what they've learned.  My child's friend was telling me the details of a movie on life lessons which they saw at school.The story was about ponies or some other cute little animals, and the lesson was to be kind to others, and inspire collaboration as a way of giving a second chance to a friend. A beautiful story and a beautiful lesson, or so I thought until I decided to ask if that child was going to apply the lesson in real life. The response killed me :) That girl rolled her eyes and with an endless patience towards outdated artifact such as myself, she said, \"Of course not! That lesson was just for ponies!\" ",

            "answer_text": "No. Well, let me be more specific, because the world isn\u2019t binary - you can make an online classroom more effective than a bad school classroom, but you cannot make an online classroom more effective than a good school classroom. Learning requires focus, it require action, and it requires coaching. In a face-to-face environment, with an acceptable number of students, a trained instructor can remove distractions, maintain an interactive and engaging environment, and can tell just by looking at a student whether the instruction is effective and if it isn\u2019t, immediately modify their approach. Over the last five months, I\u2019ve had to teach my students online, using Microsoft Teams. It is a soul-sapping experience. All the joy of teaching is taken away by not being in the room with the students. I\u2019ve also, in that time, had to be a student online. It too is a soul-sapping experience. I don\u2019t even remember taking some of the classes. Technology can be a wonderful tool for learning. When used an asynchronous tool to prime the students for learning and as a post-lesson tool to boost retention, learning can prosper. There is even a place for synchronous online instruction, but it has to be used properly and usually isn\u2019t. Any time the students and instructor are online together, it has to be interactive. Until we can figure out how to make that interaction free of internet hiccups and time lags, poor video and audio, and free of household distractions like kids, pets, and lawn mowing neighbors, we won\u2019t have an environment in which high quality interaction can happen.

Online Education\u2019s benefits is comparable to how technology has affected your life in general. Technology will make your life easier if you know how to utilize it. Online education is the same, it has every capability to beat a traditional classroom setting but only if the teacher knows how to make it more effective. Online Education is difficult to conduct. It requires a lot more work, a lot more creativity, and a whole set of other separate skills. You can compare it to what would happen if someone like Kobe Bryant or whoever you NBA fans like, played NBA 2k for the first time and jumped immediately to the hardest level. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you can make them effective, but it certainly depends on the ages of the students.  For elementary level students, the ability of the teacher to see the students is very important. Body posture, direction of attention, the expression that says a child did or did not \"get it.\" The degree of specialized instruction is too great.  For higher level students, online can work well. However there is unlikely to be the level of discussion or interchange that will happen with a collocated group of people. Plus, again, it's more difficult for an instructor to gauge how well the students understand the material.  Purely online instruction will never work for all students; many students require specialized approaches and more active engagement. ",

E-learning has its own list of benefits like: 1. It saves time and money. 2. Offers Access To Updated Content. 3. E-learning leads to better retention. 4. Lectures Can Be Taken Any Number Of Times. 5. E-learning is consistent. 6. E-learning is scalable. But on the other hand, live classrooms education also has its own benefits: 1. Students can ask their doubts in the classroom and clarify them at the same time. 2. Students can counter question the teacher, why this is happening or what is the reason behind this? 3. In-person contact with teachers and fellow classmates are very important for future reference. Live classroom education is not just about subjects and topics, instead, it is an overall education that teaches lessons for life to students. No doubt, e-learning has improved the standard of teaching and education but is still incapable to create live classroom kind of environment. E-learning has made a significant contribution to educate students all over but it should not be seen as a replacement of conventional live classroom education as both the modes of education are different and successful in their own purpose. There are plenty of good content creator tools are available in market like iSpring, Raptivity, Elucidat, Camtasia, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is  yes, you can. But there is much more to it than that. Clearly you would have to define which students, ages, subject and teaching method first because online learning for young children is different from adults so many ways. Looking at the larger issue of effectiveness, what do you consider \"effective\"? High test scores, engagement levels, assignment completion, self-reported satisfaction have all been used as part of this definiton. Some fields of study lend themselves well to the relatively interaction-free way that online learning is famous for. Depending on the design of the course, students could have a lengthy time to answer thus giving thoughtful and well-edited input.If information is the primary reason for taking the course, online might work. Plenty of quality learning happens through face to face interaction, and frankly this can be more expedient and richer. A poor instructor is by definition worthless in person or as an avatar online. I suppose the same can also be said of students because an unmotivated or dull student is impervious to teachers regardless of the mode. ",
