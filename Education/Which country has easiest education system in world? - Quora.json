I went to school on average 3\u20134 days per week until I was about 11 years old. We didn\u2019t have major testing before high school (no state tests) except for high school entrance. And in high school we had major testing twice. Once to graduate, and another time for our advanced studies for graduates who wanted to have a curriculum segueing to university. ",
