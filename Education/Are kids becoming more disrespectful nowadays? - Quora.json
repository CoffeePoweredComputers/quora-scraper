            "answer_text": "Yes, children are ruder and more disrespectful, and have been so for some time. There is a widespread sentiment that such concepts as validating, listening to, giving space, giving freedom of expression and praising the child is uplifting and promotes good, healthy self-esteem. Self-esteem is developed not from \u2018free\u2019 praise, but rather from successfully overcoming difficulties appropriate to age. Children who are being praised simply for showing up are being done a huge disservice. This is bullshit. Teaching children good manners, showing them boundaries, teaching them empathy for others, teaching them to leave their phone in their room when they come down to dinner, teaching them to listen to their parents and obey their rules is seen as a form of \u201cabuse\u201d these days, while coddling the children in the form of validating and praising them for everything they do and say is considered good parenting. Nothing could be further from the truth. Self-expression is a lovely piece of psychobabble, but saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to one\u2019s father or calling one\u2019s mother \u201ca bitch\u201d is NOT self-expression - it\u2019s abuse, ill-mannered, self-centered lack of discipline. Children who run freely in restaurants, disrupting diners and putting themselves and waiters at risk are rude, as are their parents for not giving them guidelines. Children who are permitted to kick the seat in front of them are not being well raised. Children who are permitted to curse their parents or their peers are not given good parenting. There must be consequences for disrespect, such as taking away their privileges. Children who throw tantrums just to get their way should be taught that such behavior will not get them what they want. Listen, parents, children will grow up, and whatever you teach them now will express itself later on. A spoiled child will grow up to be a spoiled adult. Not spoiling a child does NOT mean being punitive or abusive - on the contrary. Please teach your children well; teach them right from wrong - kindness and empathy and consideration for others. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201crespect.\u201d I\u2019ve heard the old saw \u201cchildren should respect their elders.\u201d Oddly, it never includes the obvious second half: \u201cElders should respect their children.\u201d Clearly, most people who say \u201crespect\u201d actually mean \u201cobey without question.\u201d I, like many hundreds of thousands of my fellow rebellious Hippies chose to throw out the \u201crule book\u201d back in the sixties. There seemed to be no justification for most of these rules, it was simply expected, and usually a swift punishment would follow. This was (and remains) just plain WRONG. Children are not lumps of clay, pets, or possessions. They are not here to serve their parents, they are here to be served BY their parents. Obviously, they require a lot of attention, and many don\u2019t get it. I will repeat myself for the thousandth time and say \u201cChildren almost never do what you say, but they almost always do what you do.\u201d If you are disrespectful to them (or anyone else, for that matter,) then that is what they will learn. They will waste no time imitating this disrespectful behavior. If you choose, instead to listen to what they say, and respect their right to speak their truth WHATEVER IT IS, then THAT is what they will learn. They aren\u2019t stupid. They always know when they\u2019re being treated dismissively, and they WILL make you pay. And Pay. And PAY! Our world is full of people walking around who harbor downright prehistoric notions about child-rearing. If I have to hear one more person say \u201cmy parents whipped my ass, and I turned out OK,\u201d I will vomit on them. NO, you did NOT \u201cturn out OK! You still think it\u2019s OK to settle your problems by hitting people who are small and helpless.\u201d Despite the FACTS from a lot of studies showing that spanking not only doesn\u2019t work, but it creates severe problems instead, people fall back on this, apparently out of sheer habit. Or maybe a bit of Stockholm Syndrome? What\u2019s worse, many of these so-called adults are not parents now, and plenty of them probably (hopefully) will never be. They still feel qualified to hold forth at great length on how children \u201cshould\u201d be raised. The word \u201cshould\u201d is always a danger sign - it means that someone is going to try and force me to do something \u201cfor my own good.\u201d I don\u2019t do well with \u201cshould.\u201d I do even worse with \u201cshouldn\u2019t.\u201d Do parents have the right to set the rules for their children? Of course they do. Do they have the right to enforce them like nasty little martinets? Not so much. So I wonder - are children really \u201cmore disrespectful\u201d these days, or are they just waking up a bit? ",

            "answer_text": "Why are children more disrespectful today? That's a great question. I think that a lot of it has to do with the current culture in which we live. I wrote in Quora once that I always treated my parents with respect. Period. Sixty years ago, everybody treated their parents that way. Someone who was relatively young, I assume, commented that I was lying, that there was no one who did that. I'm pretty sure that life as I knew it would end if we called our mom anything even semi-nasty. Disrespecting her would be like spitting on your grandma; you simply did not do it. While we might hate having chores to do, accepting discipline, and having high expectations placed on us, we did what we were told. Another factor is how adults treat each other, yelling at retail clerks and having road rage and shooting cops. As they say, values are caught, not taught. With adults showing such little respect for each other, is it any wonder that these attitudes are passed on to our kids? When I taught, the number one rule in my classroom was to treat others with respect. I explained that treating others with respect is a statement of who you are, and not whether or not the other deserves it. I treated my students with great respect and I expected the same in return.

            "answer_text": "Some might be, but some are really kind. Perhaps I might have observed some of them on a particularly bad or good moment of their day. I also live in a tough blue collar city in New England. Yankee stoicism can be perceived as rude when, really, folks are just minding their own business. Plus, lots of kids have been toId not to talk to strangers; so if I speak to a young person and they don't reply, are they being rude or just doing what their parents told them? I believe there's a general societal perception that civil discourse is falling by the wayside. However, I'm not sure it's not quite that simple. Kids might be less developed as humans, but I wouldn't consider them any less complex than us bigger folks. People are a bit like New England's weather. A few minutes may reveal a completely different attitude and behavior. There are a lot of psychological, political, geographic, economic, environmental and many other variables to consider. But my unscientific opinion of my own observations? Yeah, there seems to be a lot more disrespectful people in the world - at least here in Springfield. Yet, while my opinion MIGHT be somewhat accurate, I'm working on keeping a more neutral mindset and doing what I can to be respectful of others. What they do is up to them. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a couple of theories, but they are only theories. We raising kids over 50 years gave us a strange vision into the households of other children over those years. During that time, a lot changed in our country. First, women went back to college and got high powered jobs. A lot of divorces happened also. Before that, my neighborhood women were powerful, educated, but chose to stay at home with their children until they were a bit older. We got together often to share stories, observe the children, and most important, we opened a coop nursery school that was the best school for miles. We were involved with our children, and they were able to see first hand what we did during the day that made our community better. These kids did a lot of things, but they were community minded. They saw first hand how a society functioned and they weren\u2019t afraid to contribute. After the divorces, children had less supervision and parents were glad to let them have what they saw and wanted to keep them quiet and occupied inside. Secondly, nannies appeared on the scene, followed by take out menus, in house food deliveries, electronic devices like cell phones, video games, and entertainment of every kind. I saw children eating junk instead of cooked meals, and the friends of my children stayed inside instead of playing outside using their own imaginations and getting dirty. Children began to want designer clothing, high priced toys, and special food, mostly processed and easy. They became demanding and unhappy, and parents felt guilty and indulged them the way they had indulged themselves. Children stated to see themselves as separate from their parents, with their own culture to the extent that parents felt the need to push them into myriad of activities.People began to hire drivers for their kids to fill in when the parents were at work. The children had their own phones, and some parents actually tolerated a last minute text for any change of plans without expecting their children to talk to them. We saw families existing side by side, with everyone\u2019s phone in their face, and without the need for conversation. Then we saw vacations taken over by the same thing We refused to go along with it, even fighting for our children\u2019s spouses to put away their phones at our table. We heard a lot of \u201cI told you so\u2019s\u201d from our children to their partners. Life really changed, and everyone claims they are too busy. For me they are too busy missing out on their own lives. Children aren\u2019t being inducted into a family, a community, a nation, they are a nation of their own, like little idols. As one of our foreign foster daughters who baby sat neighbor\u2019s kids said it, \u201cMom, they all like little eggs, you carry in our hand, so they won\u2019t break. Why, Mom.\u201d ",

Even before learning ABCD, children should be taught discipline. They should be taught to respect all and do not expect anything in return, be humble and tolerant like a tree. At a tender age they should start this. Prahalada was a great devotee of the Lord. But his father was a demon named Hiranyakasipu who disliked his son being a devotee and devised several means to kill him. He tried to poison him, tried to burn him, threw him from mountain top, put him in a pit of posiouness snakes, had an elephant trample him, tried to drown him in a river \u2013 but failed miserably because he was under the full protection of the Lord. Ultimately the Lord appeared as Lord Narasimha and killed the demon father. Non-devotees always try to give trouble to the devotees but fail miserably. A small child, while being cared for by his mother, does not know how the needs of the body for eating, sleeping, lying down, passing water and evacuating are being fulfilled. He is simply satisfied to be on the lap of his mother. Similarly, Prahlada Maharaja was exactly like a small child, being cared for by Govinda. The necessary activities of his body were performed without his knowledge. As a father and mother care for their child, Govinda cared for Prahlada Maharaja, who remained always absorbed in thoughts of Govinda. This is Krishna consciousness. ",

Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.\u201d Shows you that some things never change. Socrates, the Greek philosopher, wrote that. He lived from 469 to 399 BC! Children are not more disrespectful, obviously. ",

They are exposed earlier to everything out there like the internet, which often celebrates kids with attitudes and crude behavior. Influence from parents, older siblings or older friends also could play a part in this. If you want to bring your kids up with the same respect as previous generations, I would teach them the proper way to act around adults, but when they are among children, they no longer will be sheltered. They\u2019re going to act and speak in ways that might be shocking to you to hear it come out of your precious child\u2019s mouth. That\u2019s growing up. ",

Kids have to be taught manners as well as the reason for manners and by the time they understand not just to have good manners but why they become adults. I live in an area with lots of kids, don\u2019t know one that is any less respectful that kids were when I was growing up in the early 1950s. I will say a lot depends on what kids you interact with. A child who is not taught good manners on a consistent basis isn\u2019t likely to exhibit them. ",

The kids I do know that are rude either seem to have trouble with their parents or friendships, maybe that plays a part. Sometimes my friends and I act out if we feel threatened or offended. I personally get upset when someone calls me a child, as it makes me think that they believe I\u2019m a 9 year old and are incapable of thinking my own opinions or don\u2019t know enough for it to be valid. I do not respect anyone who disrespects me, so it just goes back and forth after that, for starters, someone I found here recently began mocking me for my age and said I was throwing a temper tantrum (I haven\u2019t done that since I was 7? Maybe 8 at oldest?) I was trying to be civil, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. We do want to be respected back, not just we respect you. Hope this helps. ",
