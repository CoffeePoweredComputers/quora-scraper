            "answer_text": "We start with letters, sounds and sight words. Then we start blending sounds to start students on the path to reading. Our goal is for kids to leave kindergarten reading. We expect our students to write 3 cohesive sentences on the same topic. Uppercase at the beginning of the sentence, lowercase for the rest of the letters, spaces between words and a period. We expect students to write properly on the lines. We have a huge math program that covers all the basics, including addition and subtraction. We also teach science, social studies and character development. All this in a half-day program. We keep the kids busy. Students learn so much in kindergarten it is incredible. ",
