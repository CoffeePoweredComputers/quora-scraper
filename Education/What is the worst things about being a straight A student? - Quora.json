            "answer_text": "Being expected to always get those A\u2019s. I have had a total of 6 B\u2019s in my 9 week grade checks between 3nd grade (when things actually began to be graded) and now (winter break of my eighth grade year) with the lowest at an 85 in 3rd grade reading. When things began to be graded, I began to hold myself at an extremely high standard, deeming anything under a 90 \u201cfailing\u201d and started having anxiety attacks starting in 3rd grade that only got worse until they stopped in 6th grade. Until I started 3rd grade, I hadn't really been graded on much of anything but all my teachers could tell that I was different so they put me into a program called the Gifted and Talent Program which is somewhat like LEAP if anyone reading this knows what that is. The Gifted and Talented (GT) Program was a pull out program that pulled the group of students that were enrolled out of their class for an hour to an hour and a half once a week to work on special projects and basically kept all us bored elementary schoolers from disrupting class too much. Being in this program made the expectations for me even higher. So when grades started coming out, everyone expected a lot out of me. I don't think I really realized it too much though until I got those first B\u2019s. I started freaking out because I wanted to please everyone and I figured I wasn't doing that by getting B\u2019s. I started working really hard and didn't let myself slip again until after I switched schools following my 3rd grade year. A new school in our district had opened up closer to our house so I was transferred there and I had to leave most of my friends at my old school and had what seemed like only a few friends at my new school making me even more stressed out. My grades were good, but not fulfilling my extremely high standards. Nobody was really surprised when my grades dropped to B\u2019s 3 more times during my 4th grade year. After that I worked 10 times as hard as I did before in order to never let my grades slip again. I didn't have a problem until this previous semester. I was fortunate enough to get probably the best English teacher I or almost anyone else could ever have. I've never been amazing at English so when I failed my first test in his class the first nine weeks I got extremely worried. It didn't help my confidence when the kid that transferred into our class 4 or 5 days before we took the test got an 100 on it. I retook it for a 70 and had 90\u2019s and had good major grades so I skated by with an 89.77 which counts as a 90 in the gradebook. Everything was better the second nine weeks except that I had mid to low 80\u2019s on the major grades and low 90\u2019s on all my minor grades so I had an ending grade of 89.4, .1 points away from it rounding up to an A in the grade book. It was close enough that I wasn't too disappointed and my semester grade was an A so that helped. Being a stressed out kid is no fun, and when you're expected to get A\u2019s all the time because you have always gotten them in the past is even worse. These are what my grades were when I got all my B\u2019s   This is from this previous semester  ",

            "answer_text": "Expectations from myself that I would get straight As or be a failure.The complete lack of support from my friends and family. Never being congratulated for my good grades from anyone I cared about other than a teacher.The jeering from the other students and their expressed desires that I stop ruining the curve as well as their random insults and outright bullying.The dilemma of knowing that you need the grades to get out of your house and escape, so you have to achieve the highest possible scores, but that you\u2019re also soul-crushingly lonely and you\u2019d almost let someone cheat off you if they\u2019d only be your friend. But only almost. Because, if you can\u2019t have friends or family to give you approval, you need the approval of the teachers like you need air.Always being expected to do the majority of the work whenever the teacher put us in teams. And even when I wasn\u2019t expected to, forced to by my own nature to do so to earn the A I needed.No one wanting to talk to me, much less date me.Learning to hate the people who weren\u2019t getting As because they could never understand and because they were my greatest obstacles and greatest foes. Learning to hate people because even the \u201cgood\u201d ones didn\u2019t like me.",
