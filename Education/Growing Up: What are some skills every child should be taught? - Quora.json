            "answer_text": "1. Problem solving. I mean for anything. Being able to look at something from multiple angles will help them immensely with adapting to situations.2. Kindness and giving, because nobody knows how hard it is until they themselves are in a situations where they need help. These are also the keys to learning humility, something we lack greatly these days.3. Money and savings. This should start around the time they hit elementary and not from just selling lemonade. If they have an allowance, they need to be sure to know \"saving for a rainy day\". 4. Respect. If they have no respect for others it most likely means they also have little to no self-respect. The \"whatever\" attitude won't cut it in the real world.5. Love. Not the stuff they see on TV but love they see displayed by us adults, ya know the role models they have all around all the time. Kids watch and mimic everything we do even when we don't know it. If they feel like we aren't interested in showing love to our spouses and our neighbors, then they won't have that same value when they are grown. Remember to love and be kind.6. Slow down. The world is so fast we miss so much, don't make them suffer that same fate. Plus haste makes waste of both time and values. 7. Breathe. Anxiety= tension= frustration = aggression = sadness. Sometimes when we get mad or anxious we need to sit and breathe and teach our kids to also. Breathe...8. Everyone has an opinion, but that doesn't make them right or wrong. Opinions are like bottoms, everyone has one. Your opinions are valuable to who you are but it doesn't mean you force it on someone else. Always be the disciple, not the know it all.9. Eyes open. No matter what age you are there is always something new you can learn, so why not try at least once.10. Friendship. Family may be blood but it doesn't mean you will always get along but good friends can be the best thing for when family just doesn't understand. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing children need to learn is that they are loved, respected as people\u2014whole people even though undeveloped as yet. Children and young people need to be taught about boundaries\u2014their own, and those of others. The trick is knowing when a child is open to learning about personal space, about appropriate and acceptible behaviors in company with others. It is frustrating and damaging to demand understanding from a child too young to be capable of it. (See my first statement.) Children need to learn compassion and how to care for the needs of others, how to put the needs of others ahead of their own\u2014but also to know when it\u2019s good to put their own needs first. Teaching this starts with the parent demonstrating it. Not lecturing, but showing. We who interact with children of any age must realize that we are all and always role-models: They learn from us both the positive and negative lessons we act out. Of course there are simple living skills that children should be allowed to learn, allowing them to experience the process of learning, too. The first handkerchief I ever ironed\u2014I was 7 or 8 at the time, I think\u2014came out not exactly square, but it was wonderfully flat! Kids need to learn that they don\u2019t have to be perfect on their first try, that no one starts out perfect, and that is okay. I think children should learn to do their own laundry as soon as they are tall enough to use the machines. They should learn to cook simple things, to open a can, to clean up after whatever they do. I don\u2019t think they need to learn to iron. ",
