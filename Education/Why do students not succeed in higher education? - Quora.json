            "answer_text": "Lets start with the exceptional high 90 average student. Many will still succeed but will drop to mid 60\u2019s. Mostly because high school was too easy for them. They could still memorize enough without understanding what they were doing. The kids that managed to get into university with just 70\u2019s are the ones that do well because they have always had to work hard for every mark they get. They learned good learning skills. They learned to listen and sort and use time management. They only had so much time because they know how much time it took them to learn things and worked out ways to help them succeed. The ones that memorized and didn\u2019t understand what they were dong in science and math are the ones that failed those subjects and had to switch to a general Arts program. Sometimes it\u2019s about the ego. The ego is bigger than the ability and that can work in high school but it won\u2019t in university. Those who have a learning disability going into high school and university have learned coping strategies to help them learn and work with their disability. So they are usually very successful if they listen to the people that are trying to help them. Those who do not succeed are ones whose egos are too big and think that they are smart and don\u2019t do any work or studying. They are the party hard guys. They are also the people who didn\u2019t learn about study skills or listening to the lecturer and had the attitude that they know better than the profs. Time management is essential at University. If you don\u2019t acquire that skill before you enter university then you will have a very hard time in your 1st year. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to take it that by \u201chigher education\u201d you mean four-year college. There are six major reasons young people don\u2019t succeed in college: Misidentification of the Objective A quarter century ago Stephen Covey came up with his famous seven habits. Habit #2 is \u201cBegin with the end in mind.\u201d For too many parents \u201cthe end\u201d is getting Johnny through college. For too many Johnny\u2019s \u201cthe end\u201d is getting accepted at \u201cElite U.\u201d With tuition up 200% in twenty years and wages flat only a \u201cOne Percent\u201d family has the luxury of sending Little Joanie to college to \u201cfind\u201d herself. Investing in a four-year education is about ending up with a well-paying career. You should be approaching college with the idea that you are creating a resume for that well-paying career. Your four-year degree is just part of that resume. You need to demonstrate you have the necessary skills in writing, reading, coding, math, creativity, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, entrepreneurship and improvisation, while you have developed the habits of grit, self-motivation, and lifelong learning. Inappropriate Post-secondary Education Choices In the US many parents and students suffer from CMM\u2014\u201dcollege mania mentality.\u201d There aren\u2019t anywhere near enough suitable jobs available for potential graduates. In general the economy rewards the brightest and most highly motivated. Half of graduates are going to end up under employed or unemployed. I see this all the time on Quora: \u201cI have an SAT score of 1000. What schools will accept me?\u201d Just because a school will admit you and cash your parents\u2019 checks doesn\u2019t mean it is a wise idea to matriculate there. With that SAT score more than half of your competitors for that well-paying career are stronger than you academically. You might graduate, but you are likely to end up selling Nikes at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Too many kids are going to college. many would be better served going to community college and earning marketable certifications that can translate into good jobs. Wrong College Decision Making Paradigm Dr. Kevin Fleming describes the \u201cCollege Decision Making Paradigm.\u201d Typically high school graduates choose a college and then a major. Then, at some point near graduation, they start thinking about a career. Dr. Fleming recommends flipping that paradigm by choosing a tentative career first, followed by a major, and, lastly, the college. This is the sequence that makes sense when it comes to financial planning. Inadequate Academic Planning Students choose unmarketable majors. Parents and students fail to recognize the need to incorporate experiential learning activities. Deadlines for key classes or programs are ignored. The importance of high school performance, e.g. standardized test scores and GPA, are not given appropriate emphasis. Inadequate Financial Planning Too often the post-secondary choice (and school if that choice is college) are selected without regard to \u201caffordability. It is not uncommon for parents to ignore the need for a financially \u201csafe\u201d school/plan. Financial plans are only prepared for one year, not the term of the degree. Any failures in financial planning can spawn excessive student loan debt. Poor Academic Performance The title speaks for itself. Matriculating at a four-year college is a risky business. ",
