            "answer_text": "A big NO!!! As I am in the first year of my medical course in AIIMS RAIPUR,so I find myself eligible to answer the question. As soon as you get admission to the college you become a part of its medical fraternity. As far as I could remember there was no ragging sort of things but they just use to call us for 5\u201310 minutes to know our names or our hometowns and to know us better.This even helps you to know them And sometimes it opens a door of treat by the seniors. Many a times if you happen to meet them in market,not to worry, all they will do is ask you if you want to eat anything. They are even very helpful during our terminals for marking the important questions and if you get into any trouble yes they act as big brothers. I could remember that once I seriously needed their help and many of our super seniors came for my help. But there are the things you must care like never forget to wish them(not compulsory or forced but its always better to maintain the hierarchy) nor you should show arrogance or rude behaviour to them which surely won't be tolerated. Also you are expected to know key things like the name of respected Director sir, Dean sir, HODs of your departments etc Finally, the sum and the substance, is AIIMS RAIPUR is absolutely ragging free college .All you are expected is to show little respect which will make you to enjoy whole of your college life to the fullest extent.
