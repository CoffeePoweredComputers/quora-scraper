            "answer_text": "Not for me.  Being a mascot was some of the most fun I had during college. The only reward of any sort I was given were letter gifts since we qualified as athletes. I got a Letterman's jacket and a school watch. The soft benefits though are many - lighting up kids faces was the most consistent fun, but other memories like taunting Bobby Knight, getting the whole Michigan Big House to boo me, and getting within earshot of Joe Paterno berating Curtis Enis on the field will always stick with me.  If you ever have the chance, do it. I could be in the worst mood, but putting on that hot, smelly, sweaty suit for a few hours would change my perspective on life every time. ",

They could certainly gt one for academics, being involved in an activity such as band or debate, based on gender or minority status or any of a number of other reasons. But they don't get an athletic scholarship and, while they may be valued BY the team, they aren't embers OF the team. ",
