            "answer_text": "I was not at home for the Diwali weekend. I was at Phoenix having fun with friends. I did not really celebrate Diwali. I came home yesterday to see the whole house had beautiful lights and was decorated with diyas . When I asked who did all of these, I came to know that it was my Pakistani Muslim friend who did that . Along with that she also prepared some kheer for all us. I felt really bad for forgetting my culture, while she embraced it. It is a very personal choice but I have a lot of friends who enjoy Diwali and Christmas as much as they enjoy Ramzan. ",

We light diyas, eat sweets, wish friends and relatives(who are Muslims too), burn crackers and what have you. My happiest memories are of childhood when Diwali preparations would start at home days in advance. I'd wait for crackers most. As it is also new business year in india, my father would have new business books started on the day for which we would all dress up and go. All the rituals would be followed. Sweets would be distributed to all. Also Diwali bonus would be given to the staff. So yes, Diwali is indeed celebrated by Muslims too with great gusto :) ",

However they do not distribute sweets or buy new clothes. I have a Muslim friend (not a pat of the slum that I mentioned) who bursts crackers with us, plays Holi and eats sweets. However they do not distribute sweets. However both him and his parents say happy Diwali to everyone they meet. I however knew a Christian family where the kids were hyper excited to burst crackers. While their parents would not be very happy over it, their grandparents were extremely angry when the kids burst crackers. I even remember instances when they would buy crackers during Diwali but chose to burst them on other Christian festivals. ",

Just like Hindus participate in Eid celebrations also, or like pretty much all Indians celebrate Christmas. Also, Diwali and Holi are not just religious. They are cultural things and Indian Muslims OWN them every bit as much as Hindus do. In other words, they are not so much participating in another community\u2019s thing as they are the direct owners or co-owners of them. It is an inalienable part of their own 5000 year old personal cultural patrimony. Much like Nauroz is a part of an Iranian Muslim\u2019s cultural patrimony. Some people are more cautious about participating in other people\u2019s stuff but they are increasingly seen as cranky outliers in India. Extremists get upset about these things too. ",

This holiday wouldn't seem to have any bearing on Muslim beliefs, so my guess is no, they don't need to celebrate Diwali. But to be fair, I'm not a Christian and I celebrate Christmas. Why? Because it's fun and a commonly celebrated holiday in my region. A Muslim in an Indian dominated area therefore might celebrate Diwali, while others may not. It depends on religious adherence and region. ",

            "answer_text": "Diwali is a Hindu festival of lights. In Nepal, diwali (dipawali) is linked with five days tihar festival (second most favored festival). Tihar has religious as well as cultural significance. Factually, it is mix of Hindu and Kirat culture. Tihar has five days- the third evening is dipawali. Being a multi-religious and multi-cultural country, Nepal has numerous ethnic and religious groups. Hindu celebrates all five days programs, however each religious group or ethnic group celebrate dipawali commonly. Apart from dipawali, most people involve in deusi and bhailo programs too. In the conclusion, we can say, most of non-hindus celebrate dipawali, deusi and bhailo. Remaining part of tihar- kagpuja, kukurpuja, gaipuja, gobardhan puja (mhapuja by Newars only) and bhitika by Hindus alone. ",
