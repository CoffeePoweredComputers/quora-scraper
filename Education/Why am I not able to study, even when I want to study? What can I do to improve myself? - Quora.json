            "answer_text": "First identify the reason why you actually want to study. When you really have a strong desire for doing something you do it without making excuses. Secondly , what are the reasons you are not able to study? Is it because of the distractions in your environment? If yes , switch off your phone ,go to the library or close the door of your room while studying and let everyone know that you are studying. Is it because you are tensed about something or your mind wanders whenever you start studying? If yes then do this: Express all the things that are cluttering your mind on a piece of paper. Keep the paper aside and tell yourself that you will get back to those things written on the piece of paper once you get over with studying. Hope This Helps! ",
