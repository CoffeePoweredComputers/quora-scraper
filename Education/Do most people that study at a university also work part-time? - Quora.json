            "answer_text": "All graduate students work (especially science and engineering) as that is what pays for their graduate education.   They perform research for a professor and in turn get free tuition and a stipend for living expenses. For undergraduates, it depends upon whether they need spending money.  I worked as a referee for intramural sports (soccer, flag football, softball, basketball, volleyball, etc.)  I could make twice the minimum wage as a decent referee and that put spending money in my pocket and was fun and physically challenging.   Others will work in the library etc.   Some students, like my two sons, will work off campus.One son worked a jewelry store near his apartment as a senior.   He was a business major and this provided him a different view of business. The other was a mechanical engineer, and as a senior he worked at a local company for experience.   Helped him get a job after he graduated. At community colleges, most of the students live at home and work part time or almost full time jobs to pay for school and living expenses. But part time jobs are pretty standard.  Almost everyone that I went to college with as an undergraduate at MIT had a part time job on campus. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Tom's answer is pretty comprehensive. Thirty years ago, I knew relatively few students who worked at college (full-time residential campus), except for the engineering or business school internships during senior year. Some had campus work-duty jobs as part of their financial aid package and a lot worked during the summer (and even breaks). My parents wanted me to focus on school work and that suited me. My sister really wanted to work, and had a bookkeeping job at a retail store off-campus, and worked as a nursing home aide on her breaks. I can imagine with the significant increase in college costs that the need to work has increased, but the type of jobs seems similar. ",

Also I have a full time job,  I'm trying to launch a startup and incredibly I got a girl friend! I don't know how I get time for it! I like my lifestyle now. I'm moving fast, almost all of my college friends are in internships, I can come in 4 hours of work what they make in one week. ",
