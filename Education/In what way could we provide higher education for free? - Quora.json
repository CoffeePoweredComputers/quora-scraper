            "answer_text": "Norway is now one of the last countries of Europe that practice free higher education for everyone, so they could be used as a pretty good example in this case. The short answer to the question 'what would it take' is taxation. The longer answer is a shift in costs from those who undergo higher education to those that benefit from it (e.g. high earners and companies that employ people with higher education). Because education doesn't give the same rewards to everyone that studies it stands to reason that you shouldn't pay the same amount. But the only way to ensure this is by taxation post-fact - we have to see what you earn before we 'charge' you for the education through the tax system. In addition, the access to both stipends and cheap student loans are essential. In Norway this is done through a national program, but this is just one way of organizing it. One could just as easily have private, though highly regulated, alternatives (although I personally prefer the national model. The down-side is that you probably will never have institutions like Harvard in such a system because every institution has approximately the same resources (they become evenly spread because it is difficult to differentiate income between institutions). On the other hand, almost none get 'bad education' because institutions are more or less in the same position, but with different strenghts. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to provide a free, world-class university education: 1. Taxation; 2. Philanthropy. That's it. #1 works great if a society is prepared to accept the massive cost. The US is not even close to that mind set, so this will probably never happen. #2 is fantastic. Olin, Cooper Union, Rice, even prep schools with significant financial assistance finds such as Andover and Groton all have done it through endownment. In a decent economy, the rule of thumb is that you can draw cash equal to a 4-4.5% interest on your endownment and you use this for whatever you need to in operations. Sure, you can say it goes to scholarships, but who cares as operations is just a bottom line and how you slice and dice it doesn't matter much. So if you were starting a great university from scratch and you wanted every student to go for free, endow it to the necessary level and you're all set. Of course, we're talking about a serious amount of money. And universities in the US love to compete. As one of the answers above points out, this kind of system gives you uniform excellence. There's still room for competition (\"We are the top science university and they excel in laws and history.\") but there won't be the delineation between the Stanfords and the Samfords. ",
