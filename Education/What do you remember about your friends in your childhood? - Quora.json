            "answer_text": "My childhood friends and I didn\u2019t have deep relationships. We never talked about our families, with a couple of exceptions with one friend. We kept our lives private. We\u2019d talk about school or which boys we liked. I remember hanging out with three other girls, and I started to feel as though I was on the fringes of the group. I didn\u2019t feel in sync with them anymore. Then I met an Austrian immigrant girl whom I felt close to. I needed a one-on-one friendship. So she filled the bill for a while. But she transferred to a different high school after a year because she didn\u2019t like the atmosphere in our school\u2014too many bullies. However, I stuck it out despite the bullies, but I didn\u2019t make another friend I liked as well (I still saw her on weekends sometimes). After I started working, I met another girl who became a good friend, and then the other one came back into the picture when I got her a job in my office. The memory that stands out in my mind is how happy I felt when I drifted away from my group of three other girls and started hanging out with the Austrian girl. It was a wonderful feeling to finally be one-on-one again. I\u2019d had a rather superficial friendship with a girl who lived across the street from the time I was 5, but it least it was one-on-one. But then she moved, and I had some fun times with the group of three, but I knew what I\u2019d been missing when I started hanging out with the Austrian girl. I\u2019m not saying it was a deep friendship, but she certainly filled a void in my life. The only friend I\u2019m still in touch with is one of the group of three. We email occasionally. I saw the Austrian girl at a grammar school reunion, and that was the last time. I wouldn\u2019t know how to find her. The friend from my office died five years ago. We\u2019d had a falling out a few months before she became ill. She was a needy person who wanted to vent when we were talking on the phone but wasn\u2019t interested in my life. I got tired of doing free therapy. When she called to say that she had cancer, I gave her my sympathy and told her that she could call if she needed to talk with someone, but she said no. After a while, I called her home, and her husband told me that she\u2019d died. I would have felt guilty if I hadn\u2019t given her the opportunity to call me if she felt the need, but since I did, I felt at peace. Her husband never responded to my sympathy card and letter. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThere are friendships imprinted in our hearts that will never be diminished by time and distance\u201d I had a big group of friends at my old house in Mumbai with whom I spent my whole day for about 7 years. But the best friends I ever made were at my paternal house in Udaipur. We were a bevy of adventurous and crazy kids. I met them only once a year and sometimes twice but the time spent with them are the ones I cherish the most. Being the only girl among a huge lot of boys (later I met my childhood friend and got a company who shifted back to Udaipur and now we are like sisters and our bond is unbreakable), I learnt some really amazing games and felt like a free bird who was carefree and didn't really bothered to put my hand in the gutter to pick the cricket ball or play in the mud and swing on trees, jumping from terrace to terrace, getting caught by police once (No we didn't get locked up, yet I was scared to death) and many more, unlike here in Mumbai where the only games we played were ghar-ghar and singing competitions. The last time I visited them was last year, it was only for two days. Everyone has become quite busy now. Yet somehow we made time for each other and recollected our old memories. That was my last visit, now nobody knows if we'll ever meet again, and even if we do then after how many years? Thanks to social media and smartphones though, we managed to be in touch for quite sometime. But no matter what, distance was and never will be a reason to separate us apart. Thanks Keerthi M for letting me have a walk down the memory lane. ",
