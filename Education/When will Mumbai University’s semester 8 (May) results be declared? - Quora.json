            "answer_text": "The results will be declared online somewhere around mid August. Then accordingly gazetted copies and marksheets will be sent to your college. Then in January you will be having your convocation ceremony in your respective colleges where you will get your degree. However with your marksheets you can still apply to jobs and all. Some even let you apply even if your final year result isn't declared. P.S. For your convocation, I have heard that there comes a form from the university. You fill it and you will be invited to the university convocation ceremony and the Dean will hand you the degree by himself. However the dates may change. Please don't take my answer as any kind of confirmation. And the university convocation thing is. What I have heard from the colleagues. I don't know how much of that is true. ",
