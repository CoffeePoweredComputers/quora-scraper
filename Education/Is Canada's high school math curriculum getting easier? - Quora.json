            "answer_text": "Depends from what time period. In the late 1960\u2019s we did trigonometry in grade 8 in Quebec. I then moved to the UK for a year and then finished high school in a German school. The math levels were comparable to Quebec. However there were a couple other Canadians and Americans who were quite a bit behind the students of the same ages in Germany. I then went to University back in Montreal and we had students from across Canada. They were still doing first year of calculus whereas those of us from Europe were in our third year of it. Today? No comparison . We have summer students helping with research and they are woefully lacking in math skills. Not sure which is worse their inability to write a cohesive research paper or the inability to use basic skills to analyze data collected in the field. It\u2019s not the lack of intelligence but the lack of basic skills and focus. I have no idea what they do for 12 years in school. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the Province. I teach in Ontario which used to have an extra year of high school known as the OAC Year (once upon a time this was called Grade 13). The OAC year was removed in 2003 so that the province aligned with the other Canadian provinces (not including Quebec which has its own CEGEP system) in having four as opposed to five years of high school. As a consequence of this change the high school math curriculum was altered. Changes undertaken included the removal of both the more rigorous Euclidean Geometry units as well as Integral Calculus. The net effect in my opinion is that the curriculum has been made substantially easier. Nevertheless students in various high schools can choose to supplement their mathematics (at least as far as Integral calculus is concerned) by electing to take an AP Calculus course. Many do. ",
