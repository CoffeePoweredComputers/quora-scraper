            "answer_text": "I actually interestingly enough have just watched a program that said they covid-19 is an airborne virus now. Now I believe that both of us know that we can exactly believe everything that's written in the news considering in all honesty we don't know enough about the covid-19 virus if we did we would be much further along and helping cure our society instead of being in my opinion behind in the race so to speak. Now and I believe it was Wuhan China or wuhang China I am not positive is where the disease supposedly originated they have made extremelyaps and bounds in their progress of curing the disease however I don't believe that they are actually giving their input, studies and test nor if they have a vaccine with the WHO or world health order,nor has any of this information been obtained by the CDC in the United States the center for disease control it just seems to me that in the leaps and bounds that we have made in many different issues especially concerning viruses and developing vaccines that we should be a lot further along in this process than we are. Now I have also read many articles and watched many programs that have stated that Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical division has developed a vaccine in our government has personally purchased 100,000 units of this vaccine there is actually also another company which I do not know if it's private or a public company but it's called Maduro and they also have a vaccine that is in the cost range of $40 American currency. And the last basically I've heard of what's going on now with this is the stages have been passed and finalized however this is where it gets complicating they are looking for humans to actually take the vaccination so to me that's actually stating they're not as far as they are stating they are. I'm sure both of us know that our government basically only tells us what they want us to know or divulges information that has been at least what seems to me around the 25 to 35-year range after completion being available to the public but that being beside the point,I personally cannot understand why they need to basically test these vaccines that have been developed and have passed the stages that they need to although it needs to still be tested on humans??? As I said before that tells me that they're not exactly divulging all the information that is known or they know about the progress they've made with a successful vaccination. My apologies for the past rent and not exactly answering your question however covid-19 can be contracted through contact with another person who is positive for the virus through bodily contact or exchange of bodily fluids or being close enough in a breathing space that it can be carried in the air to the other person I don't believe they know all of the ways that it can be contracted personally although that is only my opinion but this stated information that's been given out on how it can be contracted is basically the ways I have been told you although there are new things popping up every day so the news does change constantly so there may be things that I'm missing but as far as I know those are the ways that you can personally contract the disease. I hope this helps answer your question and once again I apologize for the rant it just seems that you may possibly be able to understand where I'm coming from trying to explain how our government operates especially in situations like this. Now I'm not taking sides personally between the presidential elects however blaming anybody other than where this virus originated from is definitely not their fault meaning I have seen and I'm sure you have also the commercial that shows that it's president Trump's personally responsible for the virus, I believe that to be very incorrect because as everyone knows he is not the reason nor did he create this virus however possibly the reason that this virus came about was actually not divulged to us in full considering that China knew about covid-19 for a full year before it was openly notifying the rest of the world as it started to become a pandemic and spreading rapidly. I personally believe that this was developed for biological warfare and basically for lack of a better term backfired on them and somehow was leaked out probably as to which someone was just contaminated and may or may not have known with hopes of it being controllable by their personal laboratory. As you may or may not know our country has a place called plum island where there are many unknown and known things developed along with biological warfare agents and experimentations are done on animals with many different substances ranging anywhere from makeups to pharmaceutical grade products which they are paid for by these companies, this is not something that's typically discussed by our government and admitted to nor denied it is just what I believe they consider is called a black site. In the government's terms a black site is an area where many things take place that are held under the strictest of confidentiality such as area 51 people believe that they see UFOs or unidentified flying objects and in all actuality the majority of the time I personally believe and it has been proven although it's not admitted to that these are aircraft vehicles which are used to defend our country although we do not want to let anybody know about how they're built or what they are capable of in order to defend us which is understandable if you think about it. No I could personally go on and on about these type of things but as I said before this was not part of your question and I apologize again although I do like to let people know about information that is not typically given to the public very easily so to speak. Although I hope you found some of this information interesting and it possibly may have made you think of the way things are done by our government in a different way they are not necessarily trying to hide anything from us it's basically just the less people know about certain things that are made to defend our country the less possible problems may arise with the wrong people finding out about it.But like I said before I do hope you found this information to be of some benefit and I hope that I answered your question in more or less words even though this was quite a long rant and I apologize for that I also apologize for the punctuation because I have my phone set up on talk and text so that I may answer questions quickly although I don't believe I have it set up properly for punctuation some things tend to come out correctly others it's just seems like a big long sentence and I apologize for that. But I wish you all of the luck in the world in achieving your goals and remember that your mind and body are stronger than you think! ",

Bread can be frozen, so can be meat, many vegetables will last for 2\u20133 weeks in a fridge, so will fruits. With canned food, potatos, rice and pasta you can easily stretch it for even more. Then go to a hospital and try to help out where they treat Covid-19 patients and hopefully do something useful among them.Without a mask, without washing hands, rubbing your nose or eyes, of course also eating without washing hands.If they will let you, continue to repeat it for multiple days, but I don\u2019t think that it will take more than 3\u20135 days until you will have symptoms as well. Now, since you know which virus you got, you won\u2019t need any testing.Stay at home, self-isolate since other people don\u2019t want to get infected.Stay there until you won\u2019t have any symptoms (fever, caugh, etc.) at all. Hopefully you won\u2019 have any permanent lung damage or even anything worse, but if you will - well, you\u2019ve asked for it. Oh, I assume you have your own apartment, of course. You don\u2019t want to make other people to be a part of your experiment, do you? ",

In the US the survival rate is 97%+.[3] Treat COVID-19 like a nasty flu[4] and act just like you want it. Still, it takes about to 2 weeks to recover, unless it is serious then it is about 6 weeks.[5] This something to think about when planning your recovery. As mentioned, like the flu, SARS-CoV-2 can kill you, therefore getting your affairs in order and final expenses may be considerations prior to your adventure in illness. However, how do you go about trying to contract COVID-19 is to expose yourself to it. Wear one of those ineffective kerchief masks,[6] then find some sick people and have them cough on you while you deep breath.. You can also deep kiss a COVID-19 patient. Still be aware, it might be nothing much if you do contract it. Then again, it might be your death. Decisions, decisions, try for a Darwin Award,[7] or not.

Learn what to do if you are sick. Covering coughs and sneezes Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.Throw used tissues in the trash.Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Wearing a facemask if you are sick If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider\u2019s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers. Cleaning and disinfecting Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.

You then either inhale them or by touching introduce them to vulnerable areas namely nose, mouth or eyes. Fluid particles occur with normal respiration, talking, coughing, sneezing. They can stay in the air for a period of time. Wearing a mask stops most of them from getting farther than the mask and thus provides some protection for those around you. It doesn\u2019t stop all of them but it also reduces the distance that those particles can travel by slowing the particles that do escape the mask. The particles can remain on surfaces for a period of time (depends on the surface) and touching those surfaces and then those vulnerable areas can cause infection. The other assumption I could have made was you want to get the disease so you can get over it and help by knowing you could work in an essential job with the public after full recovery without concern of infecting them.

Don't get to excited, relax. Covid isn't shy, you'll have it soon. Get up real close to your friends in hugs and kisses. Pay no attention to any of the requested measure on prevention protection stated by the (CDC) guide lines. Rob your fingers on your eyelids, it's a great sensation feeling. Enjoy it. If someone is walking a head of you and they sneeze or coughs, just keep walking, and breath in the line of their possibly discharge pathogens. It's your lucky day. How nice.:) You might be fortunate to find what you're searching. That will do it. Good luck. ",
