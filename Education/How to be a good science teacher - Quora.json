            "answer_text": "Well I may not be the right person to answer this question because I have not became a teacher but really wish to be one some day. These are some of the qualities I wish a teacher should have in my opinion. 1.Never consider that some of your students know things and pretend to teach only those students only. Inspite consider that none of your student have got any knowledge about the topic and teach all of them equally with a mindset of imparting knowledge about every basic concept of the topic. 2. A teacher should always have a mindset of not only giving knowledge but also getting some in return and one should never think that he knows everything and they cannot be wrong at any point of time. Always believe teaching is learning. 3.Students should be taught with an aim of giving knowledge for life and not just for getting good marks in exam. 4.Never guide the students to crame bookish knowledge for answering questions. Make them understand the basic reason behind every concept and let them answer in their own words. 5.Try to be a friend of your students. Being a student myself I know that we in this age have a tendency to rely on our friends opinions in every aspect of life including studies. We have more tendency to understand if our friend is explaining any topic. Try to grab that position in a student's mind so that he may feel free to ask anything from you without any hesitation. 6.Never tell your students that marks are the only measurement of success rather the knowledge you gained is more important. 7.You should have good communication skills. Teach with confidence but never ever be overconfident. If your students sense your overconfidence they will never be interested in what you are teaching. 8.Don\u2019t teach your students with your level rather go to there level of understanding things and try to bring them at your level slowly and efficiently. 9.Try to give more and more examples from you daily life to understand complex things. Everyone have more tendency to remember things what they see than what they listen and read. 10.You should know the reason behind each and every concept which you are teaching and never tell your students to memorise concepts. These are some basic things I feel that a teacher should have in mind while teaching. These things are from a student's point of view what he/she feels should be in a teacher. These points are meant for all teachers and not only for science teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m fairly qualified to answer this question. The key to being an effective teacher is to remember that you teach students first, your subject second. So, always put yourself in their shoes and try to see what they are learning from their perspective. Second, science is best learned through experience. Simply explaining science ideas is not enough\u2014we know from research that students sometimes don\u2019t believe what you are telling them or form misconceptions from limited information. A good science teacher helps students to learn the concepts for themselves through experience. For example, I used to teach cell theory to students\u2014about half way through my teaching career I switched to a week of activities all using microscopes where students looked at cells, living and prepared. THEN then finally understood that cells are diverse in shape and size and that this diversity related to cell function. They always had trouble with this concept when I simply lectured. So, a good science teacher helps students learn science by letting students DO science. Finally, to go from good to excellent, make science relevant to students\u2019 lives. Show your students how what they are learning is important to them, both now and in the future. Keep these three bits of advice in mind as you prepare your lessons and I can almost guarantee that you will be a good science teacher. ",

Further, unless you have a need/desire to know, you\u2019re not paying attention. And if it\u2019s a process of any complexity (thinking scientifically!) practice is needed. Watching an instructor be brilliant can be entertaining and impressive, but it doesn\u2019t make the student more brilliant. They need to be guided to discover in their way whenever possible. Sure, you cannot think without something to think ABOUT, and the oral tradition of inspirational stories and examples can be fruitful. It\u2019s very, very hard to create situations where students can actually develop important ideas, and so the guides (\u2018scaffolding\u2019) need to be well thought out and likely developed through much trial and error on instructor\u2019s part.

I\u2019m not sure if this question is actually about the different styles of learning (visual,auditory etc). What i can say is that the teacher should attempt to cover them all. To help the people who learn by doing, there should probably be at least one practical exercise in the lab each topic whenever possible ",

My Chemistry teacher had a wonderful grasp of explaining things, a bit like James Burke or Brian May, he could capture our attention as he described molecules and reactions like they were real things you could see in the beaker in front of you. My physics teacher was quite different, he was more methodical, plodding through the syllabus, chapter by chapter. He explained things adequately, but not in a very exciting way, an voltmeter is just a voltmeter, nothing to get fired up about. I guess the physics syllabus wasn\u2019t so exiting, still based upon the traditional material of heat, light, electricity and mechanics. We had lots of homework and regular tests. And he was strict! So I guess, some kind of hybrid - somebody that has that passion for the subject to draw students in and still have the discipline to take care of the basics of learning, regular exercises & tests, labs.

We are all consumed by it whether we like it or not. That\u2019s what makes reality so special. Because of YOU. You live in this world, with others around you. YOUR actions help determine what goes on in the classroom, in your home, in your city, your country, your planet. To understand the explanation of reality through science is to understand how you can change it for the better. Poetry. The greater your understanding of science, the greater your ability to manipulate the forces of nature. Much like poetry in language studies, wherein a larger vocabulary, a larger bank of ideas and experiences, science can be used just like poetry. You synthesise ideas, you put them together and you have, innovation. Don\u2019t feel you can\u2019t do it. Every modern scientist in history started off as a student, learning atoms and molecules, the periodic table, onto chemical reactions, then greatness. Sagan? Hawking? Tyson? Dawkins? Lawrence? Kaku?

Plants do give off oxygen, but not as much as your lab technician pumped in from the O2 tank on the morning of the lesson. ",
