            "answer_text": "You know, I asked myself the same thing as I prepared to enter my MLIS program. I thought I knew what it meant to be a librarian (largely guarding against censorship, in my mind at the time). I figured that the MLIS degree was just the rubber stamp that said, \"This person is serious about this career.\" Then I entered the program, and boy howdy, was I wrong. There was so much more to learn than I ever knew existed --- things like information behavior (e.g., how do people realize their need for information, choose their information resources, access those resources, express their need in ways the resource understands, sift good information from bad, and use that information?), and metadata, and faceting, and the ethics of fair use. I learned about special libraries (which I'd never even heard of before), and cataloging schemes (which I thought I'd hate, but actually loved for its complexity), and embedded librarianship (still haven't made up my mind on that one). We learned the history and theories of library science, which have proved to be a very valuable bedrock in these times of constantly changing technologies and usage patterns. If I had to choose the most valuable thing I got from my MLIS program, it would be the emphasis and deep training on ethics. We shared a building with an information management program (which I like to characterize as a cross between computer science and marketing), and while we studied many of the same concepts, I was constantly struck by the difference in our conversations' tone. They were all about how to reach an audience and harness their behaviors and study their data for future use, whereas the library students were constantly saying, \"But what about patron privacy?\" Our program gave us a mission to be well-informed, calm, and vigilant watchdogs for digital rights. I couldn't have gotten that without an MLIS. That said, I definitely don't think all MLIS programs are created equal. There are definitely programs out there (even ALA-accredited programs) that are failing to prepare their students for librarianship in the digital era. If I can go out on a limb here, I'd like to note that I feel especially antsy about online MLIS degree programs. The flexibility they offer is admirable, but I have yet to see how they foster the kind of networking and volunteering/internship/job ops that most residential programs offer. As a general rule, I'm a big supporter of people who decide to pursue a degree program while still working full-time, but in a career field as driven by relevant work experience and professional contacts as librarianship, I feel like those degree programs are often just setting up their students for failure. So would I recommend an MLIS degree for aspiring librarians? Definitely, but I'd also recommend the following: Vet the program thoroughly beforehand. Make sure it's on the cutting edge of teaching methods, learning/outreach technologies, and digital ethics. Ask what networking opportunities it creates for its students. Ask about its graduates' employment rates, and what kinds of jobs they enter.Don't enter the program until you have at least a few years of library work under your belt. While you're in the program, seek out as much library work experience as you can.The degree means very little without relevant work experience and professional contacts. If you enter a distance program, you're going to have to work extra hard to create the same access your residential classmates have to those things. on campus.I know this isn't always possible, but consider waiting to enroll until you're working for an employer who offers tuition subsidies. (This could overlap nicely with #2, if you're working at a library.)Be aware that a large number of MLIS graduates have a terrible time finding full-time library jobs. Study the market. See what skills are in short supply. Make a plan for how you're going to acquire those skills. Be prepared to move.I'm sorry to be such a Debbie Downer --- it can be a lovely and fulfilling career, I promise! Mostly these are just things I wish I'd known before I entered the program. [There's a happy ending, though: After working in four libraries during the program and networking like a madwoman, I had a full-time professional library job lined up by graduation, as did several of my comrades. So it can be done. :)] ",

            "answer_text": "I worked in public libraries (with an MLIS) for eight years before changing over to academic libraries. In addition to the well-articulated responses I've seen, I want to add a few points. If you work in a public library, a lot of your job is actually social work. Calls to DCFS, interviews with police, interventions with the homeless. I've been assaulted and threatened. I've been sued for letting a child into an arts and crafts program. I've had people follow my car home. At three different public libraries, we have found someone dead in the bathroom from drug overdoses. A friend of mine, who is a children's librarian, was threatened with a gun and forcibly raped. A children's librarian makes about 12 dollars an hour in my area. We often have children asking us for food because they haven't eaten in a few days. As an academic librarian, I have adult students coming in who can't Google or pull up their assignments so I can help. I sit with them and painfully extract information about \u201ctheir topic\u201d or what they actually need help with. This takes tact and a huge amount of patience. Not everyone can do this. When I'm not helping someone, I'm doing HTML coding, teaching a class, teaching a coworker without an MLIS how to access a database, recording a YouTube tutorial, etc. I got my degree online (plus trips to campus) from one of the best library schools in the country. I had internships and still see people from my cohort\u2014we guest lecture for one another. In this field, you DO need an MLIS and I am happy I have one. It also takes time in the trenches to learn things like \u201chow to handle a mom who ODed while her kid is in story time\u201d. That said, I have used my MLIS to take other jobs. I curated an exclusive holography museum. I worked as a private investigator. I can easily find any information I need. ",
