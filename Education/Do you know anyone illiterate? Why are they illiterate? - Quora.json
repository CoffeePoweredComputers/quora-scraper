            "answer_text": "No I don't know anyone who cannot read. (Infants and mentally handicapped people notwithstanding) If there are people I know who can't read, then they hide it very well. My mum used to assist in teaching adults who lacked basic literacy skills. These people were adept at hiding it. They learned other skills instead, like making the excuse they'd forgotten their glasses, or doing shopping in small amounts so they could remember the shopping list. Mind you, this was 30 years ago. Before the internet and smartphones. You could get through life fairly well with never having to read or write. There were plenty of manual labour jobs where you never had to read or write anything. It often didn't matter. Lack of numeracy was a bigger issue. Not being able to read numbers, or add up, meant you could easily get ripped off financially. Numeracy skills develop in infants before literacy. A 3-year-old should be able to count to 10, whereas it's not unusual to get to 5 before reciting the full alphabet, or writing their own name. Even the slowest of learners till manages to grasp basic numeracy. ",

            "answer_text": "Not completely illiterate but functionally illiterate - mainly recent immigrants from Latin America who had to quit school and go to work at very young ages. I know a few older Cuban exiles (70\u2019s, 80\u2019s in age) who never properly learned to read or write. The interesting thread among these people is their enduring work ethic. They just work really hard and don\u2019t complain. Clearly, if you can\u2019t read and write, you have to work a little harder than your neighbor, but I wonder if being illiterate is a driver\u2026 Working hard, buying a house, a car and other nice things is good distraction from your inabilities.

It is a sad fact that in my country, there are many adults who never progressed far enough at school to acquire literacy. She can sign her name but that is all. ",
