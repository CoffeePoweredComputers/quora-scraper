            "answer_text": "Here we go: Thinking difficulty level is same as class 10th.Thinking difficulty level has risen up to some rocket science level.Thinking you need motivation to study. Trust me, you can be all broken apart and still studying, if you are consistent enough.Thinking every chapter is equally important.Thinking 11th class is not as important, we\u2019ll study in 12th only.Thinking rote memorization will help them score 100% marks, like upto class 10th.Not focusing concepts, running behind marks.Needless habits and addictions like PubG etc.These are some the thinks that I and some of my friends experienced in class 11th [2018]. If you have anything to add, please refer to the comment section, I\u2019ll be glad to make an edit, with credits of course. Thank you and all the best! ",
