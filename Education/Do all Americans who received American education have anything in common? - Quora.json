            "answer_text": "The one thing we have in common is that we were educated in the U.S. Other than that there will be quite a bit of variation, both in the quality of education and in options outside the core curriculum. In the U.S. each state sets core standards for educational attainment. The individual schools, districts (or homeschooling families) must meet those standards, but outside of that they will set their own curriculum. Some schools are more academically rigorous. Some only barely meet the basic standards. Some offer a wide array of classes in many subjects. Some have more limited options focused on the core. Some state standards will be regionally specific. For example I studied Ohio history in 8th grade. If I had been raised in New York I probably would have learned New York history. I was lucky to have been raised in a community with good schools. They had a sufficient budget to pay their teachers well while also being able to offer an array of classes. They did not have to eliminate arts and sports due to budget constraints although that has happened in some districts. In the U.S. there are still many schools that don\u2019t offer foreign language classes. At my former elementary (primary) school they begin teaching Mandarin in first grade. When I was there we started French in fourth grade. Students in the U.S. will be taught math, science, history/social studies, English and physical education. Some will also have additional options in foreign languages, social sciences, humanities, arts, computer science and athletics as well as the opportunity to take more advanced classes. How much any particular student learns will depend on their particular abilities, the schools in which they studied and most importantly the educational background of their parents. Students with well educated parents (including those who are self-educated), who care about academics, tend to have the most successful outcomes\u2014no matter which schools they attend. ",

            "answer_text": "There are basic commonalities in their education like allegiance to the country and the Declaration of Independence. American history but not the civil war. The South and North still have their differences. So their accounts of that war will be different. Education is ruled by politicians and by state governance as well as by school districts. That means each region and city will have its regional peculiarities to that area. ",

            "answer_text": "Americans who received American educations can almost certainly speak, read, and write in the English language, regardless of what ever their original language before they started. The American public education systems offer language training in other languages (Spanish, French and German are typical, Latin is offered in some schools), but these are often single courses while the rest of the school day content is provided in English\u2026 there is an active and ongoing debate about whether some students in some districts might benefit from an education presented predominantly in Spanish.
