            "answer_text": "Role of Psychology in Education. The word psychology relates to the relationship of mind and behaviour of different individuals. This behaviour is not static and is constantly in a flux. It is almost impossible to predict as to how a particular individual will behave in certain circumstances. Scientists have studied behaviours of large populations and have generalized the outcomes. We all develop a mind set for certain situations but it can change with time. Certain chemicals called \u201cNarcotics\u201d from different origins can temporarily alter our conscious behaviours and induce feelings of higher bliss. But they are addictive and can damage the normal functions of brain and cause mental illnesses. Usually people after suffering serious losses in life seek out these narcotics and then the downward spiral begins. They end up becoming costly social burden. Now let us strictly focus on the field of Psychology as applicable to education. Education is a knowledge which is acquired formally or informally in order to lead a normal social life. It is a life long activity from cradle to casket. Every organized society expects its members to show behaviours which are considered to be the norms of the society. Serious deviations lead to trouble and legal consequences. A child explores the world around him through the senses of touch, taste, sight, sound, smell, and stores that information in his mind. He picks up the language skills without learning its alphabets or grammar. He is educating himself and is being educated by the people who come into contact with him. In his mind he figures out that to taste an apple, he needs to bite, chew and swallow. There is a relationship between his thinking mind and the behaviour outcome of feeling not hungry. The parents are his primary teachers before he goes to school. A child\u2019s brain takes quite a while to grow and develop. Before the age of 19, he is considered a child and his undesirable social behaviours are condoned. But after that age, he is treated as an adult and faces sanctions which may not be pleasant. School or college education is a formal education where teachers are involved in imparting knowledge in different subject areas to enable him to become a professional to earn a living and serve the society in which he is growing. Teachers have to have a good knowledge of human psychology in order to avoid the conflicting behaviours of students. Some students may be constant disturbance in the smooth running of a course. Teachers learn educational psychology in their training and use it to their advantage. If the disturbing students are given a role to lead others in some ways, they settle down and become allies to the teachers. The contribution of distinguished students are also recognized by awarding them prizes and special honours. This encourages positive behaviours for the groups. In the industrial world, a large amount of money is spent on advertisements to change the mind set of the consumers to buy their products. They use the psychology that by repetition and beautiful presentation of their goods will encourage the behaviours of the masses to purchase what they want to sell. It is obvious that both formal and informal education is a psychological approach to control the behaviour of the masses. ",
