Look at it as a chance to acquire as much knowledgte as you can cram into that lump on your shoulders. Won\u2019t you feel superior to your peers when you can explain to them why the Civil War was fought? Or why millions of people moved to California during the Great Depression while others scrambled around to feed their families. Learn how to study smart. Not everyone learns in the same way. Try several techniques until you find the one that works for you. Then use it religiously. Have a certain place set aside for studying so your brain will automatically register \u201cstudy time\u201d because I am sitting at my desk. Study for about 40\u201345 minutes and then take a 10 minute break. Some are auditory learners and some are visual learners. Some are a combination of both. Whatever works for you is fine. Read the assignment, out loud if you need to hear it and see it. Take notes. Read it again, this time in more depth. Answer questions at end of chapter or unit. Reread. Study notes. Pay attention to major headings and minor headings. Go over any words that are new to you. Learn what they mean and how to use them. They may be on the test. Summarize if it helps you remember. Turn in all your assignments, all your homework, pay attention in class, take notes and actually show up for class. Night before the big test take the night off from studying. Get plenty of sleep, eat healthy foods, drink plenty of water, (not soda, water), wake up refreshed and ready to start the day. Eat a light breakfast and get ready to change the world. ",

            "answer_text": "How to get good grades is a common question asked by the students at any level of education. The reason is everyone wants to score good grades in their examinations. It just not provide mental happiness to the students but also play a crucial role in the success of the students. Get higher grades in school can be a lot easier than getting high grades in college. Getting good grades is also helpful in winning competitive scholarships. Today I am going to share with you the best and most effective tips on how to get good grades in exams. Just studying is not enough for getting good grades. You need to have a solid strategy and plan that will help you to regain your focus and help you to achieve good grades. Tips on how to get good grades 1. Motivate yourself Self-motivation is the key to success for every student. It is pretty often that the students lose their confidence when they don\u2019t get good grades. But you should not make the same mistakes as other students do. You may not get satisfied with your grades sometimes, but at that moment, you should maintain your self-confidence to be in the game of getting good grades. You should believe in yourself to stay focused on your work. The best way to motivate yourself is to create some milestones for yourself. You can create a series of milestones. When you start working to achieve those milestones than in every achievement, you will boost your self-confidence. And this confidence will lead you to get good grades in your exams. 2. Listen and participate in the class A student who does participate in the class always gets more grades than the students who don\u2019t. But listen and participate in the class is not easy for any students, especially for the shy one. But it showcases the teacher that you care about the topic and you want to score high grades. The teacher gives the grades based on various factors. Apart from that if you participate in the class, then you may get more awareness about the topic. Along with that if you listen to your mentor or teacher carefully, then you can learn a lot more than the self-study. It will help you to prepare for the exams more effectively. Thus it helps you to get good grades in your exams. Besides, if you\u2019re a weak student, then you can sit closer to the teacher so that the teacher can know more about you and find your weakness. Apart from that, you can also write down some questions before the class and then ask them to the teacher to clear your doubts. 3. Take thorough notes during a class Notes are quite helpful in getting high grades. You should make notes during the class. Notes help you to cover the important information about the topic. You can create the notes by listening to your teacher. Apart from that, you can also create the notes of the important topic with the help of some reference book of your topic. It will help you to prepare for the exams more efficiently. Sometimes the students just need to have a look at the notes, and then they prepare for the exams within a few hours. Apart from that, these notes are also helpful just before the last few minutes of the exams. 4. Do not hesitate to ask for help Majority of students does this mistake. I don\u2019t why they always have hesitation while asking the help from the teacher. The students need to take help from the teacher. Even intelligent students also look for help from the teacher. Because the students can\u2019t cover everything about the topic without taking help from the teacher. It is quite common for tough subjects. You should ask for help from your teachers and your peers in the class. It helps you to learn more about the topic and clear your doubts without much effort. Apart from that, you can also ask your parents for help if they can help you with the topic. Along with that, you can also ask them for the private tutor, who will help you to learn more about the topic. 5. Stay focused during your homework Focus is the key factor in how to get good grades. Lack of focus will not help you to good core grades; You need to be well focused during your homework. Did you know homework plays a crucial role in your academic scores? Homework helps you to get ready for the exams and learn more deeply about the topic. That\u2019s why you need to stay focused during your homework. Now the question is, how we can do that? The best answer to this question is to find a quiet place to do your homework. Remember that the place should be located in a distraction-free environment. There are some other factors too that create the distraction during your homework writing. Mobile devices are a major distraction for that. You should put your mobile phone aside. You can also put it into the silent or mute mode. Moreover, You can also use some apps that will lock your phone for a certain period. You can also do your homework with the help of some experts. Suppose that you need to have the statistics homework help. Then you can take the statistics homework help from the experts. They will help you to clear all your doubts more effectively. 6. Reward Yourself by taking the short breaks Majority of students don\u2019t give the importance to the breaks between the study. But remember that breaks work as an amplifier for your brain. If you do continuous study, then you may not get the good grades. Because continue study usually tied up the brain. That\u2019s why taking the short break always help you to refresh your body and brain. You should take a break within every 45 minutes during your study. The break should be as long as 15 minutes. During your break, you can walk around your house to get some fresh air. You should also drink some water to regain energy. Apart from that, you can also eat some snacks to fuel your body. It works as a reward for yourself and makes you more productive by doing something that you enjoy. 7. Prefer group study (If Possible) Sometimes group study works better than the self-study. The reason is in group study the members of the group help each other to motivate themselves and make them more productive. It also helps you to clear the doubts of each other if you find any trouble within the topic. Moreover, you can be sure that how much you have prepared for the exams. Because most of the time we assume that we study enough and get ready for the exams. But in reality, we may not be ready for the exams. On the other hand, in the self-study, there may not be any motivation for you. You need to motivate yourself. If the group study style suits you, then you should organize such groups. You can also do group study after class or on weekends. 8. Organize your study space In most of the cases, the students don\u2019t organize their study space. It is a common thing that perfect planning leads you to perfect achievement. You should organize your study space efficiently. You can do this manage all your books and stationery in one place. Don\u2019t you ever try to do not let your desk become cluttered with papers and stationery? Apart from that, you should also make separate notebooks for the separate subjects. Don\u2019t you ever try to make the notes on the same notebook for every topic? Because during the exam sessions, it will be overwhelming for you to study from that notebook. Also, remember that when you prepare for the exams. You should always have your notes and your books along with you at the same time. In this topic, I also talked about planning. You should plan your entire day and divided into small parts. Along with that, you can also write down the important dates for tests. 9. Develop a study schedule Scheduling your study is crucial to get good grades in your exams. Whenever you decide to study. Then you should divide your time into small chunks. Small chunks help you to prepare for the topic more effectively. Suppose that if you\u2019re preparing for the test, then you should divide your time into small chunks and put the small topic into these chunks. You should also manage the time as per the topic hardness. If the topic is hard enough, then you should give it more time, if the topic is easy enough then you should give it a little time. Majority of students were waiting for the last night to get prepared for the exams, but it is the worst strategy. Because no one can get good grades with a one-night study. 10. Take Care of Your health and stay fit Health is wealth for everyone, whether it is a student or a professional. Health is a crucial factor behind how to get good grades. You should take care of your health during the study. Don\u2019t you ever try to avoid food during the study? Because your mind and body need nutrients for study. Therefore you need to make sure that your meals are nutritious, balanced, and varied. Because It works as a fuel for your brain and makes it more productive. Never miss breakfast before school because breakfast provides you the necessary nutrients for study longer. 11. Sleep well It is often that the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep while studying for their exams. It is proven that sleep plays a crucial role in the performance of students. If the students don\u2019t get the proper sleep, then they may not be able to keep their focus during the class study and self-study. Our brain needs proper rest. Therefore sleep helps the brain to relax for a couple of hours. Moreover, it also recharges our body and makes it ready for the study. It has been proven that the students should take at least 8 hours of sleep each night. It also helps them to stay fit and active during their study. 12. Utilize Your Textbook Textbooks are quite helpful in getting good grades. Professors and teachers assign textbooks based on some reasons. The crucial reason behind this is, textbooks works as a supplement to the lectures and discussions of the class. You should buy all your textbooks to study about the topic.Read all the material of the assignment topic it will help you to get deep knowledge of the topic. You should read everything about the topic from opening vignettes to the case studies. Also, try to figure out which topic is most critical. Also, try to highlight the most important materials in the text. It will help you to prepare for the exams. Conclusion Getting good grades in exams is not an easy task. There are some other ways too that will help you to get good grades in your exams. If you will follow these tips on how to get good grades in exams. You should not only follow these tips to get good grades. But you should also try your best to get good grades. All these tips provided by the academics help experts.

If I had a question, it was usually very specific and I would find the teacher after class and ask it (2) I was very interested in the subject, especially Science and Math, so I would often read ahead in the textbook. (3) Sometimes the class was taught in a way that just \u201cclicked\u201d with me. I would hear something and the result would be obvious. That still happens to this day - I work in IT and when something goes wrong I can generally tell what it is and how to fix it before anyone else even knows what is wrong. (4) My daughter, reading over my shoulder has suggested an \u201cX for Dummies\u201d book. She is also annoyingly good at learning. (She says \u201cYes, fair.\u201d) If classes do not come naturally to you, I have to recommend that whole reading ahead in the textbook thing, You cannot imagine how much easier it is to learn something when you have already read the material and after listening to the lecture, know what still does not click. It makes it easy to ask the right questions of the teacher while you are still discussing the subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Not knowing how to study is fixable, so let me start there. I was summa cum laude at a top -twenty college and then grad school, after being a co-valedictorian in high school. My tricks included: 1. doing all classwork asap after it was assigned rather than right before it's due. Often I'd go directly to the library after class and knock it out. You never know what distractions could come up before your work is due. 2. Getting a part time job that allows for quiet study time like as a student security guard ( in addition to internships) 3. Writing notes in a notebook or note document during every lecture. It helps you pay attention 4. Sitting in the front row of class\u2026helps the Prof get to know you better (good for class participation points and may influence grading your papers\u2026unproven but reasonable). Also go the prof\u2019s office hours for the same reason. 5. Scheduling classes as early in the morning as possible when you are alert and the day's distractions are minimized 6. When reading textbooks, highlighting EVERYTHING that could conceivably become a test question on your first pass. For the remaining passes leading up to an exam, just read those highlights. And to study extra difficult topics, physically write out the facts from those notes on a couple note cards and study those a few more times. During this step, turn any short lists into acronyms to memorize. 7. In group projects, always \u201doffering\u201d to be the one who merges the writings of each group member and edits it into a single voice. Don't trust anyone else with your grade. If someone else insists on this role, then insists on doing a final edit. 8. Joining or starting a study group. Include some students who don't get as good grades as you. Nothing is better for practice than explaining concepts to others to ensure you can explain them on a test. ",

As for not knowing how to study, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to learn. But you also have to recognize that there is no one size fits all method. What works for one student won\u2019t necessarily work for another. Some students have to write the material down in order to retain it. Others have to say it out loud. Some have to walk around while reviewing it. Still others have to be doing something, anything in order to focus (one of my daughter\u2019s teachers used to give out squares of that blue sticky putty that\u2019s used to mount posters on walls - that gave her something to do with her hands while she was listening in class). Do you want absolute quiet? Or do you need music playing in the background?So you do have to figure out what works best for you. In terms of how much to study that varies but the important thing about studying is quality, not quantity. Corny as it sounds, \u201cIt\u2019s not the hours you put in but what you put in the hours\u201d. ",

I hope your teachers are helpful and compassionate enough to teach you how to study. I\u2019m sure they have techniques to tell you. If you don\u2019t want to study, let me tell you this: humans must learn things to survive. Especially nowadays that it\u2019s more difficult to get jobs because of overpopulation, our edge against others is our knowledge. We are paid based on our skills. If we don\u2019t know anything, how can we get jobs? With regards to having good grades: the grading system is put there to \u201cmeasure\u201d our learnings. Having high grades doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019d be successful later in life, though. Real-life problems are not taught in school. Still, having high grades also mean that you actually learned what was taught to you. Here\u2019s my advice: do your best to finish school. That\u2019s the safest way. If you don\u2019t want to go to school but make a living instead, it\u2019s your choice. I know some people who didn\u2019t finish high school but are millionaires now because they are genius in managing businesses. This might be true to you, who knows? Know where your strength at and focus on nurturing that. ",

Most classes are heavily segmented with only 1\u20132 important parts per segment. Just remember those parts and the segments and viola. Instead having to remember the whole class, you just remember the 5 or so segments and relevant equations On the homework end, having access to khan academy or other people does wonders for scores. Being able to use resources and see the process that\u2019s been bugging you can feel like melting the soft outer crust of teacher fluff and leave you with the actually useful parts There\u2019s no magic to it.

Some people have a strong gift for retaining information - they often are good readers who read rapidly snd absorb what they've read and are good listeners and retain what they've heard. Such people are sponges - and the sponges don't need to sit and try to cram information. They read it, they heard it, they understood it and they remember it. ",

Like if you wanna be an artist or movie director or musician or whatever, you actually want to study those subjects related to your profession. You can be good at your job and people cant do what you can do. Jack of all trade is a master of none. You dont have to study for everything, you just gotta find one that you can enjoy and focus without even knowing the time passing. Thats what you will be good at and that what you are born for. Just have a goal. You can do it since you have at least concern about yourself. Just keep persisting to find yourself. i believe you can find it, something you feel like you meant to do. ",
