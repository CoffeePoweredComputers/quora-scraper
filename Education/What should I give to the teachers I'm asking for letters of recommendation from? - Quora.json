I have written very few (mainly for fellowships). You give them your transcript and things like where you were born, outside interests and things not on the transcript that you think are useful. Go easy on the good citizenship, community works and sport nonsense. Ask to see it when they have written it. ",

If it's the type of information, they need to know where the letter is going, what it's being used for, and what kind of information you want them to put in the letter. If you're talking about a gift, those aren't necessary. I always thought it was an honor to have a student ask me to write them a letter of recommendation. ",
