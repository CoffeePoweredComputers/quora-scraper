            "answer_text": "I would say the two biggest consequences are poverty and oppression. The girl will be much, much more easily exploited and at a very high risk of having violent relationships with men. There should be NO difference between educating a boy or a girl. If it\u2019s good enough to educate a boy, it is certainly good enough to educate a girl. I wanted my daughter to be the best she could be so of course she went to school. I want her to have any and every opportunity to be a magnificent human so I will do everything I can to help her achieve this. A bit part of this is education. Education opens doors. ",

            "answer_text": "As a father, I dont feel the need to educate a girl/daughter in India though i love to and will give my heart for it., because in spite of educating my wife she is a full time house wife taking care of kids, and has no interest in working though given the option. if this is the same option my daughter want\u2019s to follow then what is the point in educating them, also more to even letting my wife loose her career and fulltime take care of them and help them in studies. I find it pointless till the time India or society keeps making motherhood as by itself a greatest work a women can do and not giving focus on asking a women to take a career. Almost 90% women in India prefer motherhood and are a stay at home mom. ",
