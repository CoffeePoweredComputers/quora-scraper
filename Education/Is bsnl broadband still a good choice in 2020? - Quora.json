            "answer_text": "I am using it for 1.5 years and its best if you compare it with other broadband. For every uploading user go with airtel SIM in dehradun .. But if you like to watch youtube whole day or video chat whole day.. even BSNL smallest plant(what i am using) will handle it. for other steaming OTT like netflix, amazon prime you can try their 729 plan with 5gb per day 10MBPS.. as your video will be smoothly play. Choose their plans according to daily usage . Even with my 351rs plan 1.5 gb per day its sufficient for me. coz i don\u2019t watch OTT streaming like netflix. youtube is now information source and entertainment nowadays or websites. ",
