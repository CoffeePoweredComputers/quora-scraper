            "answer_text": "I am afraid that you DO NOT get the EXACT probabilities given only the mean and the variance. In fact, there can exist more than one distribution with the same mean and variance. See the moment problem Moment problem - Wikipedia for the exact statement. You can, however, do some approximations using, for example, the Chebychev\u2019s inequality Chebyshev's inequality - Wikipedia. So, for example, if the mean is 2 and the standard deviation is 1 for a distribution whose exact form is unknown then on has the inequality that P(|X - 2| <= 3) >= 1 - 1/(3^2) = 8/9. This means that for this distribution the probability is at least 8/9 that the r.v. lies between -1 to 5 is 8/9. Note that this is true irrespective of the distribution. Stronger inequalities also exist, see, for example, Chernoff bound - Wikipedia. ",

            "answer_text": "Mean and variance of a random variable (if they exist) are both determined by its distribution. But backwards its distribution is not determined by its mean and variance. So in principle you cannot find \u201cprobability given mean and variance\u201d. Often we know more than mean and variance. For instance what \u201ckind\u201d of distribution we are dealing with (e.g. normal, binomial, et cetera). Then mean and variance can be looked at as parameters and in many cases (not always) they determine the distribution. ",

In Binomial Distribution Mean=np and variance = npq now Where n=total sample, p= probability of success and q = probability of failure. From this is mean and variance is given you can obtain q I.e. q=(npq)/np And from this get the p I.e. p+q=1 which implies p=1-q I hope it will be helpful ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot determine probability if mean and variance is known. Mean and variance calculation includes a set of observations while probability calculation includes type of sample and no of sample. But if in case you are asking for Normal distribution then If mean = 5 and sigma = 10 Then you can find the probability using the formula for Z and then compare that value in the normal table. Hope so i have cleared your question at least to some extent. ",
