            "answer_text": "For monthly investment- Let us assume your salary is 35000\u201340000. I think everyone should invest minimum of 20% of their salary for future. 20% of 35000\u201340000 is 7000\u20138000. You should invest monthly a minimum of 7000\u20138000 rupees. Let's say your son needs money for education at the age of 20. If u invest 7000\u20138000 per month in nifty 50 index stocks you would get 15\u201320% return per annum. And after 10 years you would get a sum of 3058908 rupees.For lumpsum investment- if u invest 5 lakh rupees in nifty 50 index you will get a sum of 3098868 after 10 years.If you calculate the total of these two returns amount it is around 62 lakh. That is enough for your son's education even he can study outside India in a very excellent university",
