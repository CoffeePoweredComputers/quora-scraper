            "answer_text": "In general, passing on to the next grade in high school works differently than in the earlier grades. To pass on to your sophomore year, you have to have a certain amount of credits. The amount of credits needed depends on your particular high school\u2019s criteria. With that being said, 4 Fs in most high schools would mean you don\u2019t have enough credits to advance to being a sophomore. Check with your counselor and see what are your options\u2026summer school, evening school, online, etc. If school is too difficult for you, talk to your counselor about switching into different classes or an alternative program that could give you more support. I would also recommend coming in for tutoring and asking your teachers questions. I have never failed a student that came in for tutoring on a regular basis. They were always able to get good enough grades to pass. If you just didn\u2019t do your work, try to sign up for classes that interests you. Remember that you\u2019ll need at least a high school diploma for most jobs, so see this an investment into your future. If you were having problems in your home life, speak to your parents or counselor to see what they can do to help, so you have a better chance at success. Whatever you do, just remember you can still recover from this and be successful. ",

            "answer_text": "In our local high school you would need to attend and pass summer school to replace the four F\u2019s with passing grades in order to move to the next grade because grades are locked in at end of each semester. In fact, depending on the course in our school they often make failing students retake the first semester portion of the class second semester, and then the second half of the course is completed over the summer (usually math or courses where skills build on what\u2019s been previously taught.) I\u2019m very surprised this has not happened already, but it sounds like you and, if possible, your parents need to schedule a meeting with the school to discuss their policies and also what programs are in place to support your academic and/or executive functioning skills (being organized, time management, focus, etc.) If you have a diagnosed learning disability, adjustment may be needed on your IEP. If there is a suspected learning challenge, you should be tested. No matter what the situation, it would be best to all be on the same page on what needs to be done and available resouces to ensure you are able to be more successful moving forward. ",
