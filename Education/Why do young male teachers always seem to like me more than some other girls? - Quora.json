            "answer_text": "I recently caught up with some old school friends of mine, and teachers also. We are all in our fifties now - what\u2019s that, your grandparents age? - and we found out the reason why one of the young male teachers seemed to like one of the girls more than the others. She worked hard and gave that teacher respect, and in turn he gave her more focus and attention, helped her and a couple of her studious friends after school. It was very much a two-way arrangement, with no \u201cfunny business\u201d. Are you studious and conscientious? Do you truly listen when your teachers - male or otherwise - are speaking? Teachers need to know their efforts are worthwhile and will give more encouragement to those who are willing to pay attention to classes. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a young male teacher and he was extremely nice because he was happy with his job. He thought chemistry which meant he could have been a doctor or something but he chose to be a teacher because he loves teaching kids and also being young adds an extra boost of happiness. This might be the case with your teacher teacher as well. ",
