            "answer_text": "There aren\u2019t enough well-paid jobs in NZ for the people who are already here. International students are charged large fees, and the idea is that they are coming to NZ for full-time study, and should not need to find jobs. There are a number of private training establishments, working with dubious recruiters and migration consultants, who are operating schemes over or around the borderline of legality, and certainly contrary to the intention of international study; these schemes amount to a way of getting round normal employment visa requirements. Anyone thinking about this should know that people who use this method tend to end up in very low-paid jobs, some of which are highly exploitative. There have been a few cases in which some of the worst of this exploitation has been successfully prosecuted, and in most of these cases the exploiters are themselves migrants. If you are fed information about pay rates in NZ, you need to remember two things. First, the people telling you this are probably lying, if they have a financial interest in the business. Second, when comparing pay rates, you need to think of the Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate. NZ pay rates may look high compared with those of a really low-wage economy at bank exchange rates, but a lot of goods, and especially services, are a lot more expensive than in, say for sake of example, India. It\u2019s still possible to get a pretty good education in NZ, if you chose carefully and put your whole time into it. NZ is still accepting migrants, but if you want to come for work, apply for a work visa: the dodgy shortcuts through fake education are likely to leave people very unhappy. ",
