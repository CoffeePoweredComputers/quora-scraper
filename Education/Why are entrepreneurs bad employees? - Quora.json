            "answer_text": "The same traits that often make entrepreneurs terrible employees, help them succeed at entrepreneurship. I was a terrible emloyee. I argued with bosses, asked for special privileges like working from home, hated corporate processes like meetings, made unsolicited and often undesired suggestions to my superiors on ways to improve processes among other things. In some cases, my work and suggestions were welcomed. In most cases though, they were either met with indifference or in some cases received with umbrage. These work environments were predicated on compartmentalized roles and teams. My suggestions stepped on other people's areas of responsibilities and could be perceived as being critical and stepping outside of my own boundaries. In my first job interview out of college, the founder of the company asked me if I was an \"MIH\" or \"CYA\" person. I'd never heard the terms before. He explained that there exactly two types of people in the world. Make It Happen and Cover Your Ass. The Make It Happen type of people don't care of roles and responsibilities or corporate politics. They see an opportunity, improvement or way to streamline things, and they go do it. They can be brash and bold, and hence run the risk of being perceived as naive, arrogant, cocky among other things. But they're driven by action and view their initiatives as necessity and won't tolerate anyone getting in the way. Most corporations are not initiative driven, and can run anti-thetical to an MIH person's action driven philosophy. The rest of the world are the CYA's type. They're not looking to rock the boat, ruffle any feathers, or commit any sort of unforced career error. Their way to the top is playing the game as best they can and at the game's pace. In most established companies, this works perfectly. These are the exact organizations where the budding entrepreneurs rub against the grain. Although it's hard to divide the world as such a complete dichotomy; the longer I've worked, the more this seems to be the case. Corporate politics in particular are the anathema of the budding entrepreneurs. Politics go against everything that entrepreneurship values. Entrepreneurship is a pure meritocracy that values great ideas and those with the gumption of those to execute them. Here are some of the ways entrepreneurs make terrible employees. Entrepreneurs tend have a problem with authority. They crave independence. They worked best unfettered and without boundaries. They thrive when they are encouraged and supported by the organization rather than confined and restricted. In the right work environment, they can be enormously productive. In the wrong one, they are the problem children.Entrepreneurs are impatient. They can't wait. Yesterday is not soon enough for them to get their goals accomplished. Many people in the corporate organizations don't want to feel rushed or pressured; but this impatience is the immediacy the budding entrepreneur flourishes from.They strive for excellence. This might seem like an odd one, but there are plenty of organizations and people within organizations that are striving for mediocrity. They're looking to work as little as possible. Any new idea means more work which is to be completely avoided.They're not going to follow the rules. If your group has to file a weekly report or has regular meetings, you can bet the entrepreneur in the group is going to demand why, and because it's always done that way won't be a good enough answer.They're going to cut out the unnecessary or the redundant. Great entrepreneurs are ruthless adherents to efficiency. Often efficiency is not doing at all the things that ought not to be done. And often large organizations are not efficient, riddled with beaucracy and meetings, and with a culture that supports the inefficient corporate processes.And worse of all, they won't play politics.In most organizations, entrepreneurs make terrible employees. These are the bureaucratic, traditional organizations with strict management hierarchy. In the right organizations, where the management can get out of the way of and support and encourage these future entrepreneurs, they can make exceptional employees. Google, Facebook and other fast growth start ups are among those that covet these types of employees and try to give them free rein. Instead of trying to tame the tiger, they try to harness it. Eventually, most of these employees are bound to recognize the freedom and challenge entrepreneurship offers and follow their calling; but if you give them the right support, rewards and compensation, you can delay this and they can have enormous positive impacts on companies.

            "answer_text": "As Auren Hoffman has said, there are entrepreneurs that simply aren\u2019t good employees. Like most types of people, the bad ones aren\u2019t overly common. Below is my reflection on a rather short-lived position I once held, which I believe reflects the experience that is all too common for entrepreneurs in the workplace: My first full-time job was at a local sawmill. Within my first week, I identified several areas of inefficiency, and even offered to help source some computer parts which their own IT department was having difficulty finding - these were parts that I had sourced on a regular basis, so I knew how easily I could locate them. My boss shut me down without even considering that I might actually be able to help. My first alarm bell. Like many entrepreneurs, I spend most of my free time looking for problems that need solving - inefficiencies in the process, any kind of problem to be solved - that is, after all, the lifeblood of the entrepreneurial lifestyle. When an entrepreneur feels under-utilised (or simply is under-utilised) he/she will spend a lot of time mentally finding ways that they can be more useful. The worst thing companies can do to entrepreneurs is keep them bored. Naturally then, I spent much of my time in the office thinking about ways to improve processes and procedures (using it as a way to ensure that I was properly familiar with the way things worked around here), or, more often, about how productive I could be working for myself in something revolutionary compared to working at THIS place! When introduced to a co-worker in another area of the mill, my boss told him that his boss had plans for me to do all kinds of things that I had never even heard about. Most of these were not discussed at the interview, were not in my job description, and weren\u2019t even within my department. It seems that his boss had a much better sense of who he had employed, but he had had no conversations with me about that, and he didn\u2019t even talk to me directly to see how I was finding the work environment. If he had, I may still be there. My boss relayed every little grumbling people had about me - apparently I was antisocial, coming off as a snob, it looked like I wasn\u2019t doing much when people walked past my desk (a bit of a moot point since he almost never gave me anything to do, but anyway), the list goes on. Almost all stupid complaints when we boiled it down - I was coming off as an antisocial snob because I didn\u2019t say \u201cHello\u201d to somebody in the hallway, or because somebody didn\u2019t hear me saying it. He had misunderstood one of the most fundamental things about his new employee - he had employed an entrepreneur. The events described in the past four paragraphs; they happened in the first week. When an employer does this to an entrepreneur, it can lead to what I did in response to being made to feel like the avatar in a video game - I resigned. Effective immediately. First day of the second week. After I had given my resignation verbally, only then did my boss tell me that he was actually quite satisfied with my work, and that he really wanted me to stay. Doing that to an entrepreneur is another big no-no. If it took my resignation to find out that they were satisfied with my work, then they were not an employer worth working for. I would rather be in the unemployment line receiving just enough to survive than hold a well-paying salaried position at a major company. This is the tragic story of how a major company ruined their chances at having a potentially very valuable employee. I sometimes think about where I would be if I hadn\u2019t resigned - the only positive thing I see is that I would be significantly more financially stable. An entrepreneur naturally likes to make a difference to the world they live in, and sees business as a tool to make that happen. They understand that profit can fund improvement, and that work time should be spent working to make that difference. They never settle for the status quo, and have only as much regard for procedure is necessary for the business to operate smoothly. If procedure fails, then they must improvise. In the case of my short-lived sawmill job, that wasn\u2019t allowed. Any break from procedure was cause for trouble; taking initiative on something was allowed, but within almost prohibitively restrictive guidelines. You can sometimes spot an entrepreneur by their response to the kind of treatment described above. Many people that I know would have shrugged it off and accepted it as \u201cthe done thing\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t settle for it. My co-workers were concerned with maintaining that status quo, and my boss had even told me that everybody was high-strung due to the environment of constant change that the mill had developed over the past few years. The deadly sin employers commit against an entrepreneur is, as you probably guessed by now, to bog them down with needless complaints and ignore that way that they are benefiting, or could benefit, the company. This is very similar to what constitutes a bad employer for a non-entrepreneur - they do not make them feel appreciated or valued at the company. A good employee wants to satisfy their job description and do the best for their department. An entrepreneur wants to not only satisfy the job description, but to exceed its requirements, and add value to the company. This can mean taking on another area of responsibility, doing something for another department, taking initiative in doing things that really, really need to be done, it could mean finding ways to simplify existing procedures, the list is extensive, and mostly forbidden. Another example from my sawmill job: I was asked to write an instruction manual on how to use a particular piece of software. My boss gave me my instructions, and, drawing on my experience as both a freelance designer and a volunteer magazine editor, I immediately knew that what he had requested wasn\u2019t going to appeal to the people that needed to read it. So I took some artistic license, and made sure to use attractive typefaces, clean images, and a quality layout, so as to ensure that people would be engaged and actually read it. When my boss came back to me (about an hour later) he asked me if I was finished yet (to which I said no), and, looking at my computer screen, told me he didn\u2019t want anything fancy. I proceeded to explain to him why I was doing it that way, and how it would be considerably more productive to make it something that people actually want to look at. He dismissed all of it, telling me that nobody at the mill actually cared how it looked. I graciously accepted that response, and continued as before when he went back to his desk. Why did I do that? Although people don\u2019t realise it, design has a lot to do with the way something is received by it\u2019s target audience; you don\u2019t expect to walk into a 5-star restaurant and find the menu printed on ordinary copy paper with ill-fitting typefaces and a colour palette that is reminiscent of a children\u2019s book. It should always look attractive to the relevant audience. Had he accepted my explanation, he may well have found that stress levels in the office reduced significantly, since I was designing the manual in such a way as to be both aesthetically pleasing, and stress-reducing. An entrepreneur knows how their expertise can benefit others, and uses it accordingly. A bad employer stifles this, or tries to control it. If they would simply learn to harness this in their employees, rather than try to control it, that whole work environment would change, and may even cause entrepreneurial thinking to become infectious in the workplace. Entrepreneurs would make extraordinary employees, if only we weren\u2019t persecuted by our employers. That is why many of us go out and start our own companies instead of using our entrepreneurial minds to the benefit of our employers. I recommend Eric Ries\u2019 book The Lean Startup, which explores entrepreneurial thinking in depth. In it, you will encounter the word intrapreneur, which means an entrepreneur that functions within an existing corporate hierarchy. It is entirely possible, and most of the world\u2019s largest companies actually have entrepreneurs, functioning as entrepreneurs, on their payroll. ",
