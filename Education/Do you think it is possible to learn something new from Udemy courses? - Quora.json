If it ticks these boxes, then I am pretty optimistic to learn something new from that course -;) ",

The question sounds like it comes from somebody who\u2019s heard about Udemy and wonders whether it might be a good idea to enroll in classes. But it isn\u2019t the case, as you are a Udemy instructor! You should be able to answer your own question quite nicely! As for my answer, yes you can. I have enrolled in many courses and learned A LOT. And if you want to learn German, you can learn a lot from my courses \u263a ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there is always something new that one can learn from online courses on Udemy. However, it is not true for every instructor. While enrolling to a course, look for the instructor's credentials. There are a lot of people talking about a lot of things on Udemy. But I feel that instructors from a specific background, with specialization, would do better than a jack of all trades. Again, it is up to the individual. But if the student is smart, she will learn from everywhere and everything. Thanks for asking. Let me know if you have more questions. I blog at www.TheIndianFreelancer.com ",

With technology penetrating into our daily lives, the way we learn is also evolving rapidly.Udemy and other such portals offer a wide variety of online tutorials.A person can choose his area of interest and start the learning journey. I\u2019m a Software Professional and currently I\u2019m learning Statistics from Udemy.Last week I completed one course and this week enrolled into another one.The same can be learned from books as well, but because of time constraints I prefer such tutorials. Hope this clarified your doubt! ",
