            "answer_text": "In a student-centered classroom, a teacher\u2019s role is to cater to the needs of a student. It is a teacher\u2019s job to provide the student with certain material and things to create a stimulation for the student. A teacher\u2019s role would be to supervise the students, see what they need, guide them if they ask for help, provide any necessary material, be there so students know they can rely and trust you, interfere only when required. We should let the students be free and independent so it will create a sense of independency and autonomy. This will also help students to gain self confidence and they\u2019ll be able to trust their actions more and more. The classroom is student centered, therefore the teacher should not come up with her or his own ideas, but let the students decide the main idea and provide them with suggestions if they need a sense of direction, so they can incorporate it according to their thought process. Thank you. Love, peace and blessings \ud83d\ude07 ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this will depend on many factors. In my mathematics classroom students are given novel problems to attempt, present, and discuss in order to develop new knowledge. To me the role of the teacher to provide the right set of experiences for this learning to occur, which consists of problem selection and sequencing, creating the safe and supportive environment, steering the conversations when necessary, and pointing out any key points that may have been overlooked. Giving quality feedback on levels of learning would also be a vital task for the instructor. Hope this helps! ",
