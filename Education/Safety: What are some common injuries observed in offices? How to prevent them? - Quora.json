            "answer_text": "Office environments are generally considered low-risk workplaces, but this doesn\u2019t mean you should neglect your health and safety duties. Injuries and illness that usually occur from office work are usually musculoskeletal disorders. These injuries are often due to use over a prolonged period of time. Other injuries such as cuts, lacerations, slips/trips/falls, burns, acoustic shock, and stress (to name a few) can also occur in the office environment. An ergonomic survey of the workstation could help in finding issues with work place ergonomics. Awareness of the potential hazards  and adherence to some simple principles and risk control measures will virtually eliminate any risk to safety and health. Good housekeeping practices protect people from a variety of possible injuries and illnesses, including injuries from manual handling, electrical and tripping hazards. Good housekeeping also provides a pleasant and clean workplace \u2013 and a safe one! Housekeeping extends beyond a consistent approach to office tidiness. ",
