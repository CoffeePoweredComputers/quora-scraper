            "answer_text": "There are multiple platforms for online tutors. Every platform has various features and some limitations. You have to choose the platform according to your needs. I am a tutor from Chandigarh. I used many applications like Zoom, Google Meet, Classroom, Whatsapp and Google Drive for managing my academy but all these apps got limited tools and features. I fixed some metrics to decide which app to use like - Live classes, easy-to-use, document submission, attendance record, fees management, and Cost. So keeping all these points in mind I found an app: Classplus Lite on Play Store which had all the tools I needed. This app is specially designed for Tutors. It made managing my academy very easy and hassle free. The sign up is Simple and Free. This app is like the combination of popular applications like Meet, Classroom, Whatsapp, Drive and Hangouts.The feature which I loved the most is 'Live Class'. I was able to conduct live classes from my home without compromising the safety of my students and myself. Also, their help and support system is just one tap away, so you can easily communicate with the help and support team. The best part is that this app is available for Free. You should try this app too. Have a nice day. Thank you for reading. ",
