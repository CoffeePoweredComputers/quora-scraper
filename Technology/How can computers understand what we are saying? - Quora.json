            "answer_text": "Google and other companies are trying to reach this goal in a relatively short term (3 - 5 years) using the World Wide Web and other data sources to train very large, very complex AI systems. This would probably give us a first, usable system that will give us the \u201cillusion\u201d of a real conversation. The current (very fine) version of Google Assistant can give you an idea of the possible results. To have a REAL understanding of human communication, we will have to wait a lot longer, probably 30 to 50 years, maybe even 70 to 100. This because you cannot have real understanding without a real \u201cmind\u201d. ",
