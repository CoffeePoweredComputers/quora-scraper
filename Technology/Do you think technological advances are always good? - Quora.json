            "answer_text": "Okay, \u201calways good\u201d is pretty vague. Good for a singular person? No, of course not. Many people have lost jobs and money due to advances in technology. People have lost their lives fighting against superior technology. For a single person in the present\u2014no, technological advances are not always good. Good for society? Usually. Sure, more people died in the Great Wars than in many other earlier wars due to technology, but medicinal advances have saved many times that number\u2014transportation, food cultivation, etc. have also saved and improved countless lives. So for society\u2014no, but usually good. Good for Homo Sapiens? Yes, definitely. Technological advances have done nothing but increase our chances of species survival. From an evolutionary standpoint, technology is the biggest boon to ever exist. It\u2019s ridiculous how many things we can control\u2014and as technology advances we only achieve more control over our environment. From an evolutionary standpoint? Yes, technology is always good. You see, based on your point of view, technology can be bad (factory worker losing his job) or good (new medical procedure to fix your heart problems). This is subjective \u201cgoodness\u201d. Objectively, though, technology has a pretty good track record. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Often the more technologically advanced way leads to products which aren't not nearly as good as those produced in a simpler manner. For example cows milk, technologically advanced methods of production necessitate huge level of efficiency. So they cram millions of cows who produce tons of low quality milk into shit living conditions. Impart this to a family cow. And the milk you get literally has 1/2 the milk fat of the milk you get at home while also being pasteurized which destroys most of the vitamins. At which point they replace a couple of those vitamins with less bioavailable versions. If you have a single family milk cow there is no real need to pasteurized as the risk is so incredibly minimal, that and most of the risk is based around your own level of cleanliness and is no more dangerous than cooking with poultry. The more technologically advanced things tend to be less reliable due to numerous unnecessary features and functions. The increased complexity means decreased reliability. In the end it is the rare occasion where I prefer the more technologically advanced solution. I literally try to buy older less \u201cadvanced\u201d stuff because the simpler design tends to be more reliable and in the end more cost effective and less wasteful. ",

The same was true in the early days of Japan, after the war, until they learned and grew to today\u2019s high quality. Another example is when the technology gets so complicated that the average user cannot, or will not learn enough to take advantage of it. Ask older people what they do with their smart phone, if they even have one. ",

But technologies are advanced after research and development and proper thought of the uses and benefits we will get after the advancement. I just came across one product recently and thought we are still not very aware of it but the article grew my interest. One of the company innovated the product called Deskpod. It is the replacement of desktop CPU with many more advanced technology and many other benefits like small in size, very less power consumption , no SMPS Failure and data recovery issue which is quite common in Desktop CPU.  And hence such advancement in technologies are required and important to solve many issues and to save electricity. ",
