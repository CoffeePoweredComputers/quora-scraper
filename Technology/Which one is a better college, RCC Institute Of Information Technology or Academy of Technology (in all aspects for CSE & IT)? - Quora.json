However the attendence criteria(i.e about 75%) is very strictly followed. I have tried to the give the answer keeping in mind what I was going through when I was about to gave admission, All the best whichever college you choose remember it's you who counts, ALL the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Tanusri, In would suggest you to choose a college which would be comfortable for you to travel on everyday basis. AOT or RCC as an institution is a moderate institute on the list of institutes in MAKAUT. Maybe you can say that some faculties in both the colleges are par level and very good. But in general, faculties are also moderate. As per a faculty be is considered, it's his interest that when he/she entertains your problems and doubts. ( Girls get a visible advantage ). And the rest is up to you to manage. Placements were good in RCC when I graduated. Lately hear a downfall, but i suppose that's the same with almost al collages. What will keep you is the bonding and environment, which is very nice in RCC. THANKS. ",
