            "answer_text": "AI as of now (and for a foreseeable future) is not cognizant, its just a tool like computers, shovels and engines are. So AI cannot really \u201ccontrol\u201d humans. This is question on line of \u201cDo guns kill people ?\u201d or \u201cDo crazy people kill other people ?\u201d. The answer to that can be inferred by asking, \u201cWas there no homicide before guns ?\u201d or \u201cwill there be no homicide if there are no guns ?\u201d. IMO, guns just make killers more efficient, making them better than killers who do not use guns. You might have a different opinion. Similarly, tech giants are just using algorithms for the same thing elites before them have been using for a long time to control the window of discourse. Humans are hardly able to understand environment beyond their immediate surroundings and will form an opinion based on how is information conveyed to them. The trick to control window of discourse is selective flow of information. You can change society\u2019s view on things by showing the same thing from different perspectives. Fortunately/Unfortunately, that is how human societies are structured. What tech giants can do however is instead of building general narratives which they need to hammer down into everyone\u2019s mind, they have started personalizing flow of information to individuals using algorithms. This makes them much better at bending and shaping opinion as compared to older methods like Newspapers, TV, Books and Public Announcements. Social Media/Other bigtech just gives a more efficient method for creative destruction of previous ways to control discourse. That is why you find traditional guardians of public discourse who have not been able to master bigtech blaming it for everything like misinformation to destroying society. Truth is an old guard is slowly vanishing and new one is taking its place. ",
