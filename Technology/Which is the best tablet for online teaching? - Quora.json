            "answer_text": "There is nothing like one best tablet for online teaching. Your choice of tablet can be very unique to you and it may not be the best for someone else. Secondly, while the choice of hardware is one important decision to make, an even more important thing to consider is what\u2019s inside the tablets. Access to a device is one thing, but ensuring that the tablets are proactively and happily used by the students is a totally different thing. Since, the question talks only about online teaching and merely from that perspective, I am sharing my thoughts below. There are high end brands like Acer, Samsung, mid range brand like Lenovo and affordable brands like Domo and Wishtel. To be able to decide the best tablet, following are the things to be considered: What is the size you want - 7inch or 10inch? If the purpose is to use the device only for 1.5 - 2 hours every day, 7inch is best. If the usage time is much more, I would suggest to go for a 10inch tabletWhat is the speed you aspire for - If you want just a basic tablet meant only for Learning, you can go for tablets with 1GB ROM. But if you want a high speed device capable of handling multiple applications simultaneously, you can go for a 2G device. There are also 3G and 4G devices available, but they are very costly and I would not recommend themDo you want a wifi only or a 4g enabled device - If at your home, you have a decent wifi connection, you can save some money and go for only a Wifi tablet. Only in the case, where no internet is available, should you go for a 4g device. There is a clear price difference of Rs 1,500\u20132,000 between the two and for high end brands, this difference is even moreWhat is the internal memory you want - There are devices with 8GB, 16GB and 32GB internal memory available. I would advice to strike a balance and go for a 16GB device. Not too much and not too less. And if more space is needed, you can always add a SD Card.An ideal configuration of an online learning tablet would be - 7inch, 2G+16GB. Depending on the internet you can go for either Wifi Only or a 4g enabled device. Remember one thing. Please do not make cost the only consideration while buying tablets for your kid at home or your students. We need to ensure that students continue to love the idea of learning, more so now than ever before. A bad device can affect this process considerably. It can put off students from learning. And we do not want that. While affordability is important, it is still wise to perhaps spend a few thousands extra and enable students to use a device which has a good touch, is decently fast, gives good performance and is durable. Because this will ensure that every day, the child picks up the tablet and uses it for learning. Else it will be a waste of money. Lastly, I would recommend that whichever device you buy, make sure you also buy a screen guard and a protective cover. The biggest fear that students would have when they start using the tablets at home or in school is what would happen if it falls down or if the screen breaks. We need to ensure that this fear is eliminated. Accessories like a screen guard and a cover that we take the first steps towards it. ",

            "answer_text": "My father is a chemistry teacher and picked up an iPad for this same purpose. I have one as well and I absolutely love it for taking notes. I've owned XP-Pen Deco 01 Digital Writing tablet in the past (though I used them mostly for drawing) and I would honestly recommend you get an iPad. I personally found it much easier to get used to writing and drawing on the iPad's screen than on my Deco 01 tablet, though I believe that's down to mostly personal preference. You could also use the iPad for much more than a Deco 01 . If your PC is a desktop, the iPad makes a pretty great portable machine for web browsing and document creation when you don't wanna sit down at your desk. I have a first gen 9.7-inch iPad Pro and I'd highly recommend it. ",
