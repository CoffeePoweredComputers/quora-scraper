During my lifetime, technology has given us many lifesaving devices, everything from artificial hearts to collision avoidance systems, with more being added all of the time. And anyway, as long as any one single person out of the billions on this planet dies of natural causes, then your answer is no, they won't kill \u201call\" of us. ",
