            "answer_text": "Salary.com says the average Patent Attorney makes $223,222 a year.  This profession is No. 4 in CNN Money's list of Top-paying jobs with a range of $175K to $260K per year.  The field is growing at little more than 10% annually.  The lifestyle is pretty good, too:  Personal satisfaction: CBenefit to society: BFlexibility: ALow stress: A Law360's Andrew Strickler reported two years ago that Intellectual Property Associate Pay Stays High Above Peers, concluding that 8th year Biglaw associates working in an IP Department make  a median base of $270,000 \u2014 16 percent more than the industrywide median for that group of $225,000. In the South, the eight-year IP associate median stands at $268,636, nearly $89,000 more than the median salary for eighth-years at all firms in the region. Within firms of more than 250 lawyers, senior IP associates make a median salary of about $50,000 a year more than their colleagues overall, according to the survey, which included responses from 665 law offices and reflects data current through April. The survey did not include bonus data. He adds: \"There is no doubt that IP, specifically patent litigation, is in the highest rate band across all attorneys working on those matters, including the associates,\" said David Moran, director of data management at TyMetrix Legal Analytics, who analyzed data compiled by the company's MatterAnalyzer tool. TyMetrix's 2013 Real Rate Report Snapshot shows a mean hourly rate for IP associate litigators of $342, the highest for all associate litigation categories. \"These kinds of litigations have lots of hours that go into them,\" Moran said. \"It correlates to more spending per matter and to higher rates, comparable to those for mergers and acquisitions and regulatory and SEC-type work.\" Advanced degrees in engineering, computer science and physics are needed to command those kinds of fees, says Strickler. The Biglaw IP attorneys I know were billed out at twice that rate for international patent litigation that required their presence in European courts.  The best associate -- one who did not make partner -- had a PhD from Columbia in biochemistry.  He does consulting work these days.  He was making the usual $250K by the time he left.  Not too shabby. ",
