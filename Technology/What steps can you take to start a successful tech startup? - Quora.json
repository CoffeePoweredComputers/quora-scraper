            "answer_text": "My advice is to finish college.  You have the rest of your life to start companies but if you don't finish now you probably won't.  No matter what people say, there is a lot of value in a degree.  It shows people that you can follow through and get it done.  Your backers will look at your degree, your employees will respect you more, lenders will be more favorable toward you, and you will be more satisfied with yourself.   Feel free to start a company while you are in college, but make your studies the priority until you have the degree.  If you start a company and let someone else run it you will learn a lot about management and delegation.  They can't teach that in school because you really need to learn for yourself. At SystemD we're always looking for people who want to write apps for hardware add-ons.  That could be a good company for you because we'd be doing the physical work of building a product while you could just support the app.  An example of this is a cooking thermometer that plugs into the headphone jack of an android or IOS device.  We started one of those but our app stunk, our marketing stunk, and the project bombed on Kickstarter, but it is a good idea!  Anyway - there are no end of good ideas so don't think any one is the only one you'll ever find. My son started a company over the summer while he was in High School.  You could do this in your spare time.  His product was a device but you could just as easily do an app and a device, or just an app.  I'll go ahead and copy here how he promoted and started his company. This link is to my son's campaign on Kickstarter:  O3 System - Clean Water!   Here is a list of how he promoted it prior to the launch:  Spent some time and money on a video and good product shots.  We were lucky on this and had a professional help us, but I've seen people do it themselves and come up with something OK.Buy hosting service & domains - He built a website for the project:  O3 System by SystemD Manufacturing, a facebook page, and a twitter page.  If he was going to do it over he would also do Pinterest, Tumblr, possibly others.Friends & Family outreach:  He sent an email and facebook post to all family and friends.  In the email he said he was going to launch, and invited them to comment on his preview page on Kickstarter.Pre-Launch Exposure:  We posted the project on Prefundia - Set up a \"coming soon\" page in minutes , this builds interest.Press Kit:  He wrote up a press release and made a \"press kit\" with photos of the product, mugshot (Bio) photos, a short blurb about the product, and bios of himself and the key team members (me and the manufacturing manager).  The press kit introductory email had links to the website, the prefundia campaign, the kickstarter preview, and the social media as well as links to the manufacturer (SystemD).Media Outreach:  Together we developed a list of bloggers and reporters who had written about similar products, and a longer list of news outlets to send blind emails to.  We developed a very short 2 sentence email telling them we are launching this cool product and do they want a press kit.We split this effort up, each of us taking about 1/3 of the emails to send.  We sent out the emails, personalizing each one by reading the reporter's latest or most relevant article and saying something about it, and then followed up in a couple of days with another short email. We use a CRM called \"Buzzstream\" for this, it is $29 per month.Paid Press (may not be needed if you get articles going with regular press outreach):  we used paid press plus free press.  The press kit went out to any reporter who asked for it, but some of the reporters promise to write an article and put it in their sites for $100 - $200.  Only a few of these are worth it but we paid some just to get some buzz going.Prior to the campaign we also contacted all our local news media, which generated a few stories.We edited the campaign with all the advice we got, but should have waited until the right critical mass was built to launch.  You only get one shot at the launch.  We shouldn't have launched until we knew we had an article coming out.Launched - then hit the social media-  Reddit (made a catchy and controversial post and got buzz going)-  Twitter our followers and groups-  Facebook posts, actually we sent individual facebook messages to all of our friends asking them to support us-  LinkedIn - same as aboveFinally we hit all the reporters again who did not write about us to let them know they missed the launch date, but we are getting so much buzz that they are going to want their readers to know about it. This resulted in a couple more articles and some blog interviews.After launch - you need to follow up with all of this outreach to get more buzz during the campaign.  I discuss a lot of this on our websitesystemdmfg.comand on my blog  http:. ",

            "answer_text": "You need four things to make your startup work and if you figure out these four things, no one can stop you from becoming a world class entrepreneur.   1. Idea : The first thing you need to start a company is a good idea. In recent years people have started thinking that ideas don't matter that much for a startup. They think that they will try out different ideas and if they do not work they will pivot. But that does not work most of the times.  You need to attack a problem that really needs a solution. People do not need a social network for pets. John Collison founded Stripe as he was not able to integrate PayPal in his prototype in a hackathon, Brian Chesky could not pay his rent so came up with the idea of Airbnb, Drew Houston just wanted to make the process of putting your things in the cloud simple. All these successful founders had an idea that solved a definite pain point of their customers. Their ideas seemed small in the beginning. But as their companies grew their ideas evolved and started addressing a lot of other problems.Convert yourself into an Idea machine. Just keep your eyes and ears open and observe your surroundings each day. Ask yourself what problems you or others around you are facing every day and write down some ideas to solve those problems. If you practice your mental muscles every day, your ideas will keep becoming better.Great execution of a terrible idea never works. In addition to a good idea you need a lot of passion for the problem you are trying to solve. Do not jump into a startup just because the idea looks cool or others are pursuing the same. Startups take a lot of time out of your life. If your startup is successful ,it will take at least five years to become into a great company. In those five years you need to stay committed to your idea. The idea becomes the mission statement for your company and everyone works towards fulfilling the mission. That being said it can be hard to find good ideas. The best ideas look terrible in the beginning. Google was the thirteenth search engine, everyone thought nobody wanted Facebook after Myspace, and AirBnb looked like privacy intrusion. There is no hard guideline to find great ideas. The important thing is that you must have conviction in your ideas and a market in mind where your idea might work. 2. Product :  You have figured out your idea. You have completed a big step of your journey towards being an entrepreneur and now it is time to think about your product. A great product is very necessary to build a great company. Nothing else matters if you do not have a great product. You can have all the media coverage and advertisements you like but no one will give a shit unless you provide them something valuable.   You have to build something that people love. It should be something that they cannot wait their friends to tell about. Even if your product is loved by a small number of users, it is much better than being liked by a lot of users. It is much easier to expand from something that a small  number of users love. Don't worry if your competition gets ahead in delivering a product ahead of you in the market. Just continue to deliver on your promise of a product that your customers will love. A great product will not need much marketing or growth hacking. It will spread by word of mouth. In order to build a great product you will need to get a constant feedback from your customers.  You cannot spend months building a product and figure out later that the customer thinks it is crap. You need to show your product to your customer at each iteration and ask them what changes would they like in the product.    You need to iterate through the above loop again and again to come up with a great product. Once you have a great product in hand, everything else will start to become easier. 3. Team : The importance of a great team cannot be overlooked in a startup. You need a team that is as committed to the mission of your company as you are. You need to build good relationships with everyone in your team in order for your startup to succeed.  The most important relationship is with your cofounder. Choosing a bad cofounder can be a death blow for your startup. It is one of the most important decisions you would have to take before starting out on your journey. You cannot choose someone randomly to be your cofounder. You must choose someone who is friends with you from quite some time and you must have worked with that person some point in the past, so that even if things go haywire you can figure out a solution. Your cofounder needs to be mentally tough and should know what to do in every situation.He must be decisive, creative and completely committed towards the mission of your company. Once you have found a great cofounder, it is time to build up the rest of your team.You must set up very high bars for hiring new people. Do not rush into hiring large number of people. It's good to have a small great team than a large mediocre team. If you compromise and hire someone mediocre you will always regret it.    You must take into account the following points before making a new hire. Is he smart?Can he get things done?Do I want to spend a lot of time around him?Does he possess good communication skills?If the answer to all these questions is yes than you can think of making an offer. Once you have hired a great person you must make every effort to keep him around. Give him some challenging work and good equity options. Have frequents 1:1 with him so that you get to know what is no working for him and how can you help him. The success of your startup depends a lot on your team. So do not take this step lightly and devote sufficient time to build a great team. 4. Execution : Execution is one of the most critical part for running a great company. If you want your company to execute well ever day, you have to execute well yourself first. You have to build a culture where people work hard, take ownership of products and are paranoid about customer support. You can build such a culture only if you do all these things yourself.  The team always looks at founders as role models. So it is important to show that you are hundred percent committed towards making the company successful.The first thing you require to succeed is focus. You have to narrow down the two or three most important things for the company and  well on those things. Spend your time and money on these important things. You will need to say no to a lot of other things.You have to keep account of the growth and momentum of your startup. You must look into your growth metrics every day and communicate that to your team.You have to get things done quickly. If your team can get new things done in a pretty short period of time, it is a huge predictor of the success of your startup.You must obsess yourself with the execution quality and ship new features everyday.You must become courageous and never give up even if your company goes through a little slump.You must take charge of the sales and marketing for your startup. Try to generate some revenue early on. That can act as a boost for your startup. Develop good relationships with journalists and learn about consumer behavior.   The path of operating a startup is not easy. There are difficulties at each and every corner. Startups are damn hard and can affect your life in ways you do not want. But if you follow the above points honestly you will be able to make it big in the world of entrepreneurship .     =================================================== Edit: If you liked this answer check out some of my other stuff at Nikant Vohra References:How to Start a StartupQuotes About Execution ",

            "answer_text": "You saw the movie. Mark Zuckerberg scribbles a couple of things on his window, codes for a few hours, meets Justin Timberlake and then he starts counting his billions. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going to work for you. You\u2019re not Mark Zuckerberg. And you shouldn\u2019t try to be. But you can be a successful startup founder and builder. I\u2019ve been there and done that and had a couple of exits. More importantly, I\u2019ve seen it dozens of times as an advisor and recruiter. It\u2019s not rocket science. The world already has a Mark Zuckerberg. The world doesn\u2019t need you to try and be someone else. You are the only person in the world who\u2019s capable of being yourself. The world needs you to be awesome at being you. Too many young people want to head straight for the glory, fame and riches of being a successful entrepreneur. They\u2019ve equated being an entrepreneur with sure success. But in fact, most start-ups fail. Success is more than just ambition. If you want to do this right, you must choose the right career path. Here\u2019s my blueprint\u2026 Optimize for learningDevelop insightsLearn financial disciplineChoose the people with whom you surround yourself wiselyWork harder than everybodyOptimize for Learning Early in your career, what\u2019s most important is to learn. Learn how to do something. Learn how to make tradeoffs. Learn how to prioritize. Learn what is important. Learn a craft. Learn how to play on a team. Learn how to lead a team. And learn all of this by working with the best founders and entrepreneurs you can find. A truly great boss is an invaluable asset; you can learn how to be a leader by being effectively led. Startups are a great platform for learning because of their disproportionate growth. Disproportionate growth leads to disproportionate learning. Disproportionate learning leads to everything that\u2019s good in life. The ability to learn in 3 years what might otherwise take 10 years\u200a\u2014\u200athis is what startups are about. Think of your early jobs at start-ups as a post-graduate education.Learning and growth happen in phases. Develop technical mastery (and self-mastery). Learn to manage a team and/or function. Learn how to lead leaders by working with great leaders. Take on as much responsibility as you can handle in those roles. Learn to lead a meritocracy. Develop Insights Technological advances in the past decade have lowered the cost of computing so much that they\u2019ve created an abundance of opportunity to start an app and immediately have a global audience as an entrepreneur. The opportunity seems tempting. But not every opportunity is made for you to take. Choose your opportunities wisely. Choose to maximize your learning early in your career rather than going straight for the entrepreneurial Promised Land. Again: If you found a start-up without any prior work experience, the odds are high that the company will fail. Well, you might say, failure is a great teacher. You know what is a better teacher? An actual teacher! Think of yourself as Luke Skywalker: He became a hero, but only because he had other heroes willing to teach him the ropes. You need an Obi-Wan or a Yoda, a master from whom you can learn how to do stuff, before you can take on the universe by yourself. Develop insights. Insight comes from applying experience to knowledge. Knowledge comes from analyzing information. Information comes from organizing data. Learn to organize, analyze and develop insights. Insights are the basis of all business decisions and the important work that advances effort towards outcomes. All progress is made by working on the \u201cimportant\u201d versus the \u201curgent\u201d. Learn to develop your own wisdom, your own insights. And, execute the important work with thought leadership and insights. Create a vision for a better world. Learn Financial Discipline Once you have your vision in place, it\u2019s easy to assume you\u2019re ready. But you must also learn the day-to-day habits and behaviors that go into successfully running your business. Managing burn rate is one of the most important of these skills. Keep your operating costs low, and remember that expenses rise to meet income. You may be frustrated because your early jobs don\u2019t pay as much as you want\u200a\u2014\u200abut as an entrepreneur, you will need to know how to manage costs and prioritize tradeoffs for an organization. Hone these skills by learning to efficiently manage your personal finances and budget.Resourcefulness can be your greatest resource. Learn how to fully exercise your muscles of resourcefulness. Become a capable manager of resources. Knowing how to create value with scarce resources is the magic of entrepreneurship. Beginning Your Entrepreneurial Career Success is not just a matter of ambition. It\u2019s a process: Roll up your sleeves. Do something. Do anything. Do everything. Throw yourself at projects that interest you and learn. Find the inefficiencies and learn how to do things better. Learn how to create value. Gain insights. These insights will give you the ability to lead. Learn to discriminate between good people who are skilled and people who are skilled but not nice. Develop and learn to exercise the full capacity of your horsepower.  THEN, go out and be an entrepreneur!  By all means, disrupt an entire industry! Drive creative destruction. Make your Momma proud. Buy her a house! But, rather than launching a startup right now just because you can, follow a better plan: Learn, master, found a startup, then work hard and create a great product. Then, when you are successful, give back. Give other young people the ability to learn through your leadership, your mentorship, your guidance. The best professionals\u200a\u2014\u200athose that are the top 1% of A+ executive talent\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t care about the social status of working for this company versus that company. They\u2019re not worried about building a resume or designing a career. They are busy maximizing their learning. They are busy solving problems, implementing solutions, developing the insights on creating maximum value and making the distinctions that accelerate performance. They are leading. You cannot be king of the world if you are a slave to the grind. If you find the work you are doing to be a grind\u200a\u2014\u200aget out! Do everyone a favor and figure out what you are most passionate about. Decide & commit upon your true dreams and goals. Rise up and make it happen! Every millennial saw the Facebook movie. Every millennial spends time on Facebook. Every millennial already has parents and/or grandparents on Facebook. The world doesn\u2019t need another Facebook. The world needs you to be the best that you can be. ",

            "answer_text": "Tech is one thing. A startup is another thing. And \"successful\" is a completely different matter. And you need to break it down a little further than that. Fortune cookie logic: \"Whoever has any urgency to close a negotiation, looses\". You are in college, chill out. Keep coding. Keep learning.  You got electives to take? Take all the accounting classes you can. Accounting is not mathematics, its its own logical structure. Our decimal system comes from Fibonacci, our accounting system from Pacioli. Just learning a diverse logical system will expand your comprehension as a programmer. Most businesses fail because they are not paying attention to the books. If you see sloppy accounting, run.  Then take all the marketing classes you can stomach. There is absolutely nothing more loathsome to a well structured mind than marketing. Until such time as you realize that shit don't sell itself. Great marketing is the difference between success and failure. If you are selling techy to tecky you need to be techy. You are selling to yourself. Now try selling something to Honey Boo Boo.  I know allot of people who struggled to get 30k people to download their app. I know a very smart guy who spent the better part of six months working on an app that got a glorious 2000 downloads. I told him his market was small. And he immediately turned around and told me I was a \"commodity hoe\". Fair enough, he's right. So back to the point: Congratulations, 300k is a fantastic number. Now the bad news: 200$. That does not even cover dinner. Which leads to the most important point. You need to make money. Because the spirit moves you, but the spirit needs to manifest materially. As in $$$$. What you need to do next, is see if you can come up with new graphics and some interesting tweaks. And call it version 2.0. And charge 2$ for each download. Because 99c is weak. And I can't tell if the product justifies $4.99. And if the next best alternative is $99, then you might be justified in charging $19.99. Point: what is the competitive landscape? How much value add is in the product? Who's buying? Figure out how to program in a 30 day free trial, after which the software disables itself. It will also give some exposure to payment systems (the accounting will horrify you). Then do some accurate statistics.  You did take a statistics class right??? Do you know what a complete pain in the ass investors can be if they don't see the statistics?  You can also try a fully featured version, and a smaller feature set freebee. Or leave v1.0 as a freebie and v2.0 as payment. Experiment. Then you can do product extensions. Build new tools that will appeal to the same customer base. After all you got 300k emails on your database. You have a captive market for your next product. Can you build the next tool? Can you get paid for it? The only true validation is market validation, and the only validation worth writing about is the money that is coming in. If you want to go solo, you need to figure out how to pay the bills. Keep tweaking it until such time as you get payment traction. Payment is everything. Getting to cash flow is everything. If you don't want to go that way then you are left with another route: raising money. Have you taken some finance classes? Can you model a business plan 3 years forward? Which of course is all made up numbers. But investors want them. Their money their rules. So unless you want to dilute your self out to get that skill, take the finance classes. Now an eye opener: you work for the investor. If you had taken the accounting classes and the finance intro you would know that.  You see why getting financial traction is so important? Because cash flow is the cheapest form of capital. If you don't spend it, the tax man cometh.  If you work \"corporate\", accounting, finance, marketing, and sales are all departmental functions. If you work startup you need to know all those fields well enough to be able to pull the function off while growing the business.  The way I see it, you got a 300k download hit. Congratulations. Now you got two years in skool to learn what you need to learn to be an entrepreneur. If you take all the above mentioned classes, you have an opportunity to meet people with completely different skill sets. A successful venture is always a team. Start building all those connections. Five years from now you might have a pressing question you cannot answer. And the solution will only be as good as your inner network.  You might not want to hear this but here it goes. You need to work at least 3 years in a large corporate environment in the area of the country where you will eventually build your professional network. There is no substitute. You will work on multiple projects. You will meet and interact with hundreds of people. Some people you will like, some you will not. Some people you will respect for their intelligence, some you will not. Some you will admire for their leadership abilities other you will not. The connections you make in those 3 years will make or break your next twenty years. Take the opportunity if you can. Once you have been an entrepreneur for 2-3 years, the corporate world will shut you out permanently unless you got some 'wow' skills. Better to have that experience up front. Last point: Having a  great idea is completely useless unless:1) You can technically execute2) You can run a business and pay the bills3) You can market the product4) You can \"close a deal\"5) You can collect on that contract6) You can do all the above at a sufficient profit to keep working on your next idea. So learn as much as you can so you don't get blind sighted by what you don't know. And keep working at it. And if you cannot wrap your mind around a subject matter, make sure you make friends with the smartest guy in the room. ",

            "answer_text": "I will give you one bit of advice. Current start up thinking is over simplistic and there is no mystical and magical way to build a startup. DON'T Build, measure, learn.  You have to learn, measure, build. Learn from the world, understand users and what they do. Then when you've learnt enough you can test and support what you have learnt and the potential ideas you have by measuring what people think through quantitive research.  Once you idea has been validated (and keep the whole process light) then you are in a position to build some kind of artefact. There are countless traps with rushing to a solution and I see a lot of startups build ideas that are, at best, half an idea. Often talking to a few users about what they do would have prevented huge mistakes later on.  Also, in terms of understanding what users want, feedback and site stats tell you very little. Up front research and then user research once you have something to show (it doesn't have to be a complete built thing) mean you hopefully can avoid the idea of create something fully working and, if it doesn't work, do a random pivot.  On the other hand lots of money is thrown at these bad ideas. This happened in the first dot com bubble and it is happening with this bubble. The lack of good User Experience folks in startups is a very telling thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has left great advice, so I will just add. The entrepreneurial struggle is always forming the initial idea. In the advice below, I will use examples of how to find phenomenal ideas.   Carry a notebook around titled \"Sh!t That Pisses Me Off. \" I prefer to keep a moleskin around, but if you're not around it, you can keep notes in your phone. (Example: \"I've been waiting at this corner for 20 f'ing minutes for a d*mn taxi!). Or Elon Musk was pissed because he wanted to retire on Mars. Get customer-based evidence. Everyone thinks they have the greatest idea because of their natural biological ego. Most people want to go build it, and then it fails. It wastes both your time and your money. So now you decide to read about lean startups. I did a \"Lean Startup Machine\" weekend to learn about the thought process and realized that you have a product in your head, but maybe the product could be improved, adjusted, and completely  changed. (Example: \"So I talked to my friends about also hating waiting for cabs too, but would cab drivers actually pick my friends up?... [Later] Oh I found that drivers actually love being on demand and not sitting around for an hour and not making money.\")Conclusion: I didn't start Uber, but that's how you come up with your company. Determine what pisses you off, and what can you find out from conversations from potential users... before you build a product. ",

You already seek to have some good traction with some of your previous apps so if I were you, continue to build apps that incorporate numerous UX patterns with viral loops and surely, one of them will break through the roof.  When you get about a million downloads (or close to it), approach Angels for funding. In fact, before this, you should have a \"business\" cofounder who knows SEO optimization and content marketing really well. Then, try and approach a senior Silicon Valley executive in the consumer space (preferably CMO/VP of Marketing level) and ask him/her to be an advisor.  At this point you are ready to approach Angel VCs for funding. Hopefully you close the deal (make sure to ask your advisor about protecting yourself and your) and get funding.  You can then begin to hire 3-4 backend and front end engineers to iterate on the product. Don't move to Silicon Valley to hire these engineers as you will face high turnover. Hire these engineers in a humble, Midwestern city with a good college. ",
