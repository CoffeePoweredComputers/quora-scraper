            "answer_text": "SAP and Salesforce are two very different systems. I'm not an SAP guru but SAP is an ERP system and it does have its own SAP CRM package which is seperately sold. On the contrary, Salesforce is a cloud based CRM tool (The best out there for sure if an org can afford it!) Most prominent companies have both. i.e. SAP for ERP and Salesforce for CRM (Like my company does!) SAP again is a costly beast. So you would see one only in prominent companies. Both are surely here to stay. And if you're good at either, You will lead a financially secure life. There are people who know both but then again these professionals have lots of years under their belt. Firstly, You need to understand the difference between an ERP and a CRM. Then get into the nitty gritties. FYI, Starting with Salesforce is easier and a lot cheaper. And, I'm a Salesforce guy! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I can attest to the fact that SAP is an outstanding ERP tool and have huge opportunities in the market. But those opportunities comes with a bage of huge competition in the market. There are chances that you may need to compete with 5 to 25 years of experienced guys. And it's really tough for a newbie to survive in this much competetive environment. Same about Salesforce it's an emerging company with the vision of innovation. It has a very bright future in the IT industry and has been listed as the No. 1 cloud CRM tool. This also has huge number of opportunities in the market and less competetive in comparison to SAP.  All big brands are behind this technology and trying to excel as one of the high ranking service provider of this tool. So this is the reason why they are giving chances to the skilled guys to start there career in SFDC.   gwt certified and boom you will be demanded. I wish you all the good luck. ",
