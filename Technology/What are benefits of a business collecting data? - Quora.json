            "answer_text": "Businesses deal with a humongous amount of data from various sources in varied formats. The heterogeneity gets even more complicated with hard copy manual files which are often bulky to handle. In almost all situations, the data from these hard-copy files have to be put into a digital system to analyze it and generate reports.

            "answer_text": "To quote from my employer's website: \"In today's marketplace, unless you can build deep, meaningful relationships with your customers, they'll always treat you as just a vendor, buying solely on price, leaving you wide open to rival pricing strategies. However, if you treat your customers with a little bit of care & respect, and not only listen to what they have to say, but act on it, then studies show up to 76% of them will stay with you regardless of your competition.\"  Having an email list and being able to directly message clients doesn't guarantee that you will build these deep meaningful relationships, but it helps. It's much easier to build a relationship if you have data about them than if you don't. It is, however, a two-edged sword. Having a list and being able to directly message clients also introduces the possibility of spamming them and turning them rapidly into ex-clients. To avoid that, you need to always make sure that you have permission to contact them, and you must never abuse that permission. Careful, gradual leveraging of permission is what is needed to convert casual contacts into committed long-term customers. See Seth Godin's \"Permission Marketing\" for more details about that. ",
