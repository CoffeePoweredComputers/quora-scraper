An ATS is a one stop solution for all activities related to the recruiting process; right from job posting tools to on-boarding the selected candidates. There are few human resource management apps available in the market which makes life easier for the recruiters. Let\u2019s look at the features of some of the most common and popular hr software.  Today social media or multi channel hiring is one of the most important methods of finding and fulfilling the talent requirements of any organization. The power and reach of social media cannot be ignored. It has the ability to reach out to a vast audience in a short span of time. An hr software should be able to reach out to multiple job boards with a simple click of a button. The recruiter need not post manually. Once the job description is created and submitted the system should be able to broadcast it to anywhere on earth. It should be able to fine tune the audience for premium job boards, customized for the role. It should create an engaging email campaign with possible candidates. The system should be user friendly with a drag and drop option for changing candidate status throughout the hiring process. This should help trigger automated notifications thus cutting down on the manual work. Another important feature in best hr software is reports. Spending time on generating reports is a tedious task for hr departments. The system should be able to generated automated reports and track the best candidates for your open positions till the time they are on-boarded.  Nowadays recruitment process has become truly global. The right candidate may be in a different part of the world. The HR technology solution should be able to connect you with candidates from a distant part of the world. Not only that, it should be able to connect all interviewers in a conference with the candidate and they should be able to view the candidate, ask him questions, view his resume and take notes which can be shared amongst other interviewers later. The experience should be as close to a real face to face interview as possible. The tool should provide complete interview kit and scorecards to enable the interviewers to make the right hiring decisions. Once the decision is made the tool should be able to send out department wise customized offer letters to the selected candidates and store all communication regarding the hiring process in a database. Probably the most important feature of an HR technology solution is ease of use and customization as per the organizations needs. The tool should have a simple interface so that anyone with a basic understanding of the human resources processes in the organization could use it to recruit talent, view reports and communicate with other stakeholders. Companies who face challenges in attracting top talent and retaining them should definitely use the best hr software to streamline their recruitment process. ",
