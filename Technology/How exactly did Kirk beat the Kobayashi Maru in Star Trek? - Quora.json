            "answer_text": "\u201cHow exactly did Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek?\u201d There is no way to know for certain, since we only see what the Cadets see of the Kobayashi Maru. While there have been many interpretations they are non-canon. (I haven\u2019t watched many of the later (and rather abysmal) variants so it may have come up there too.) I make my own assumption based upon what we actually see - it is the ONLY time we see the Kobayashi Maru simulation being played out. So let us look at the incident.  This is the one time we see the ACTUAL Kobayashi Maru test. Forget all the supposition, assumptions and theories: let\u2019s look at what ACTUALLY happens. First - note the great speed Enterprise is flying at. Yes, it is just a bridge simulation in Starfleet Academy, but it would be programmed with the actual speed and performance of the real ship. In the encounter, Saavik orders a parabolic course around the Romulan Neutral Zone. Note that this is the SAME region Enterprise had prosecuted a battle with a cloaked Romulan ship many years before. With her upgrades, the Cruiser can now speed past the immense region, passing it in minutes rather than crossing it in hours. Note also: In the simulation the Kobayashi Maru - a 3rd Class Neutronic fuel carrier (basically a tanker) violated the Neutral Zone. The simulated Captain Kojiro Vance is directly responsible for taking the 381 lives aboard his vessel into a prohibited area. Saavik FAILED the test because she moved to rescue the ship and thus violated the Zone herself. Her ONLY legal move was to contact Starfleet and inform them, while staying outside the Zone.  (A picture of Saavik - because I\u2019m male and she is one yummy Vulcan.) But that would be unsatisfying, stressful, and meagre. It would leave the candidate feeling they should have done more, and THAT\u2019S THE POINT. An inexperienced Cadet would WANT to engage, to take the risk, to rescue the people because at their point, they still think in terms of success and glory. Even Saavik - a Vulcan - feels the urge to take greater action. This is what we KNOW about the Kobayashi Maru: the ship doesn\u2019t actually exist. We know that for a FACT based upon the situation. It was, in fact, a trap laid by the Klingons and Saavik got sucked right into it.  Why were KLINGON K\u2019t\u2019ingas present in Romulan space? Well, we KNOW the Romulans and Klingons had entered into an uneasy partnership, trading Cloaks for Cruisers to offset the Federation threat. Also, it\u2019s safe to assume that given their insular nature, the Romulans were not highly active at patrolling their borders. Klingons could - and would - take advantage by claiming alliance and marauding within Romulan space, so the scenario is NOT unrealistic. Also, this kind of trap is common in wartime. Send a friendly distress message, lure an enemy in, then destroy the enemy. The Klingon Cruisers were K\u2019t\u2019ingas - the best Klingon cruiser in space and at the time replacing the backbone of the Red Fleet, the D-7. Enterprise MIGHT have fought off, outrun or evaded 3 D-7\u2019s with Kirk in Command. K\u2019t\u2019inga\u2019s? No chance in Hell. It was an ambush, plain and simple - seen when, as soon as Enterprise flies into the trap, the distress signal is lost. (1:45 in the video) Saavik got her ship blown away because she was inexperienced enough to get sucked into a Klingon ambush by a fake distress signal. That is the whole POINT of the Kobayashi Maru test. Saavik states - rightly - that there was no way to win, but she is ONLY thinking of what happened once the Enterprise flew into the trap. She does not realize that despite there being no way to win, there WAS one way not to lose. Admiral Kirk is not ready to go easy on her and directly challenges her Vulcan thinking. She had fallen into the trap of emotional action - saving the crew - while using logic to explain her actions. What he did NOT say is what she should have done: stay outside the zone and contact Starfleet. That is for her actual evaluators post-mission. But\u2026what did Kirk do? We\u2019ve seen now what the Kobayashi Maru test actually is. It is a no-win situation because it is a planned ambush, and if the Cadet falls into the trap there is no escape. We know that in TOS, Kirk was NOT impulsive, not a hothead as portrayed in the JJ Abrams catastrophe of a film. He was smart, studious, and had earned a TON of respect for his intelligence, quick thinking and knowledge, even as a Starfleet Cadet. He was one of the youngest Officers to be given a ship and before THAT, had returned to Starfleet Academy as a teacher - and was known for being a stern and unforgiving disciplinarian. We ALSO know that when he decides to bend the rules, Kirk bends them good and hard; doing his best to succeed so that he can explain his actions later. Based upon his personality while at the Academy, it is entirely possible that Cadet Kirk followed the correct procedure: staying outside the Zone and contacting Starfleet when receiving the distress message. But we know he DIDN\u2019T (at least in some of his attempts), because he took the test three times and, according to Spock, his final solution was \u2018interesting\u2019. Kirk quips \u201cIt had the virtue of never having been tried.\u201d So we know he did NOT take the safe option - on his third try at least. I personally think young Kirk DID take the safe option on his first try. He was graded, given the nod and went back to his schoolwork. But he was unsatisfied - he wanted a better resolution. As smart and competent as Kirk is, he is also intensely competitive and wanted to WIN. He tried a second time, went into the zone and got his ass handed to him. (I do not believe Academy instructors would allow him to retake the test unless he\u2019d either passed or failed convincingly.) McCoy tells Saavik that Kirk is \u201c\u2026the only Starfleet Cadet that ever BEAT the no-win scenario.\u201d That means he won by going into the Neutral zone and resolving the situation. But there was nothing to resolve! It was a fake message! There is only ONE way he could have done it. We know he re-programmed the simulation, but how did he change it? I believe there is only one way that makes sense: He added the Kobayashi Maru to the simulation. Remember that in the scenario, the ship wasn\u2019t actually there - it was a trap. Remember also that Federation ships are FAR faster than Klingon vessels. Kirk changed the conditions of the test. He added the ship, making it a real distress signal, then raced around the Klingons, dropped shields out of weapons range and conducted an emergency transport; beaming the crew on board then racing away before the Klingons could close to attack range. I\u2019ve no idea which ship he would have been commanding (when Kirk was in the Academy the Constitution was just being built) but if he put all energy into engines, he could have done it. It is just the kind of solution the Academy might recognize with a commendation for original thinking - especially if he\u2019d already done the right thing on the test. You see, fighting the Klingons (and thus cheating by weakening their stats) would be the first thought of a Cadet trying to beat the system. Upgrading your own ship would still be following the same thinking. Academy instructors would take a dim view on that; there is a difference between finding a creative solution and outright cheating. Kirk is legendary for lateral thinking - unique ideas to problems\u2026the classic example being his encounter with the Fesarius. He thinks around a problem - not through it.  Thus, I believe he reprogrammed the simulation by putting the Kobayashi Maru into it - and then rescuing its crew. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "HE CHEATED. And got a commendation for doing it!  The 2009 J.J. Abrams movie does an awful job downplaying this moment in history, so I\u2019m just going to stick to what was originally said about it during the events of the film, \u201cThe Wrath of Khan\u201d. The whole point of bringing up this test at the start with Saavik, having it in the script, and showing that Kirk cheated when he took the same exam is to REINFORCE what we see Kirk do as a Captain when he faces Khan\u2026 and when he faces LIFE. He cheats. It\u2019s implied that he did it in such a way that was extremely clever, and was only actually caught because he did in fact, win. And since McCoy backs up that Kirk\u2019s win stands, \u201cLt., you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario.\u201d it stands to reason that Starfleet was very impressed indeed for Kirk\u2019s \u201coutside-the-box\u201d thinking. Based on what we see in this film with Kirk\u2019s knowledge of how things work on a Starship and his coaching to Saavik about why it\u2019s important to learn how things work, you can infer that Kirk went the extra mile as a cadet. He figured out what the test was about, how they tested it, and then used some pretty wily skills to get access to the test code. He changed it without anyone noticing, and put it all back together in such a way that no one was the wiser until he beat the simulation. That\u2019s pretty impressive. I think it showed more skill and ingenuity to beat all of those security measures so succinctly, which is why he is TEACHING that lesson now at the academy! As for how he beat the test, in his words, he changed the parameters of the test so that it was possible to win.  The 2009 version pretty shows the exact\u2026 OPPOSITE\u2026 of what is implied in the Wrath of Khan. Here, it\u2019s extremely obvious that Kirk is cheating, and that test has been manipulated. What we see with Kirk in \u201cKhan\u201d, though, is that Kirk knows how to play games. I think his test looked picture perfect\u2026 right up until he did something the instructors had never seen. A \u201cunique\u201d solution. Something more like this:  This is probably closer to what Kirk\u2019s Kobayashi Maru test looked like. In this particular fight, the Enterprise is at Khan\u2019s mercy. So Kirk buys a little time, and EXPLOITS Khan\u2019s lack of knowledge about command consoles. He essentially ordered the Reliant to drop it\u2019s shields, and then he pummels Khan\u2019s ship while it\u2019s helpless. That\u2019s EXACTLY the kind scenario I think he imagied up for his own Kobayashi Maru\u2026 because it\u2019s Kirk\u2019s FIRST THOUGHT here. I\u2019m not saying it was the exact same trick\u2026 but something in the same vein. In crisis, people tend to lean on their first impulses and instincts, (thank you, Deanna Troi!), and I believe it to be true here. Kirk\u2019s first impulse isn\u2019t to run or hide, but to quickly analyze and find the one solution that Khan, even with his superior intellect, wouldn\u2019t have considered. In the Kobayashi Maru test that Kirk took, it was probably something that appeared clever enough that the examiners DOUBTED THEMSELVES as to whether they accurately designed the test to conceive of Kirk\u2019s solution. \u201cOh crap\u2026 did we think of that when we programmed the test? We might have to write that in!\u201d - And of course, when doing so, realize that Kirk reprogrammed the test. Kirk is one slippery bastard. Orders the Reliant to drop it\u2019s shield by using their command codes against themGoads Khan into the nebula to even the odds between the ships and beats him with superior knowledge of starship combat in spaceUses the self-destruct on the Enterprise to take out almost all enemy Klingons in Star Trek III.Imitates the Klingon leader well enough for the captain\u2019s subordinate to think it\u2019s him and beam him upUses time travel to save Earth in Star Trek IV.Uses Checkov and Uhura as distractions to covertly sneak up and into Paradise City, surprising even the tactically minded Sybok in Star Trek V.Uses a heat-seeking photon torpedo to find and destroy a prototype Klingon bird of preyFor me, it\u2019s hard to believe that Kirk would write-in such an obviously incriminating way to beat the test, based of what we see his character to be. Kirk (and his crew), prove time and time again that surviving in space isn\u2019t just survival of the fittest, but survival of the smartest.  But everything catches up to you. I think we need to note that despite cheating on the Kobayashi Maru, Kirk really is an exceptional Captain who has indeed faced death on countless occasions. If he has a weakness that we see in The Wrath of Khan, it\u2019s that he\u2019s SO USED TO ESCAPING, he\u2019s not actually ready to deal with true LOSS. This film plays with Kirk\u2019s growing sense of mortality. He\u2019s made a career of patting himself on the back for making clever decisions that keep him moving forward, one step ahead of serious consequences or the grim reaper. In this film though, everything is catching up to him. He has to face that he is getting older; getting \u2018caught with his pants down\u2019 against Khan in what SHOULD have been a very one-sided confrontation. He has to confront his ex and his son, and reconcile what it means to have left them behind\u2026 especially now that he\u2019s getting to a point in his life where he is lonely. He has to confront Khan, who is the physical manifestation of all Kirk\u2019s past sins, where he played with fate like a God and forgot about it. But you can\u2019t play God and not have consequences. And finally, he has to face TRUE death. Kirk doesn\u2019t have many people he truly loves, and every time he slipped away from death, it was one more notch in the belt, one more assurance that he\u2019d keep doing it. But this time\u2026 it takes the sacrifice of one of his best and oldest friends, who gives up his life so that Kirk may keep going on. This time, Kirk feels the consequences KEENLY. It\u2019s deciding who he wants to be in light of Spock\u2019s death that is Kirk\u2019s real Kobayashi Maru. It\u2019s here he has to decide not just to live, but that he WANTS to live, and has something to live for.  Spock\u2019s death bring that into focus for him. ",
