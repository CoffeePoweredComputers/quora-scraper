            "answer_text": "I have used my Chromebook for about 16 months now. I find it very useful. I am guessing that I can accomplish 95% of my personal activities on it. Some of that is due to my situation in life which probably will not apply to everyone. First, I am retired. I do not have any requirements to make my technology compatible to anyone else. I do not need to interface with any corporate or educational facilities. Second, my Chromebook is a secondary device to me. I own quite a bit of computing devices including a gaming desktop, a smart phone, a tablet (hardly used these days) as well as a Windows laptop (again hardly used). I do not need a device for challenging workloads such as editing video. I use it for email, forums such Quora, web browsing, reading periodicals, YouTube, all pretty light stuff. For gaming, I have my desktop. And I have two stand alone Windows programs that have no equivalent web or Android substitutions. I also have a small (tiny!) woodworking business that sometimes uses a laser engraver. The drivers and software for the engraver were available only for Windows, hence the hardly used Windows laptop. If it were not for those two Windows apps and the engraver, I could easily hook the Chromebook up to my 32\u2033 UHD monitor to meet almost all my needs. Like I said, not everyone is in my position but there are a lot of people for whom a Chromebook would be perfect. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. I use a Windows 10 desktop and a MacOS laptop. I find that the applications I use are much more efficient directly on these platforms. Some of my work has, in the past been supported using Google Docs and other apps. It would be possible to use a Chromebook for those. Some of the other work I could accomplish using Google remote desktop however it would be more cumbersome and less efficient. While Google and Android apps have come a long way they still do not approach the efficiency of using a native system. My experience with Chromebooks is limited to buying and setting up a Chromebook for my 12 yo granddaughter. While doing this I played around with the functionality and determined it wouldn\u2019t work for me as a full time system. My granddaughter uses her Chromebook every day for school and recreation..
