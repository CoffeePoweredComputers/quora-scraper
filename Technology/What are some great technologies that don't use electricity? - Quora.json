            "answer_text": "SpareOne Plus emergency mobile phone :Even if you're without power for an extended period of time and all of your other electronics have failed you, the SpareOne Plus will be ready to assist.This phone contains a special battery-isolator tab that keeps its single AA battery from draining, allowing the phone to offer 10 hours of talk time without electricity.If unused, it can survive up to an impressive 15 years.Also included is a built-in LED flash light for 24 hours of continuous light, a panic siren and an SOS torchlight on top that flashes Morse code. Sun & Cloud self-generating digital camera :Capable of shooting both videos and stills, \u2018sun & cloud\u2019 camera is the world\u2019s first to self-generate energy for a full charge.Equipped with a solar panel on top of the device, the camera induces electricity automatically. Additionally, the unit can be manually charged with a hand crank via kinetic energy or through a USB cable.Its 3.0 megapixel sensor is capable of capturing images in three different modes \u2013 normal (150cm range), portrait (60 ~ 150cm range), and even macro (25 ~ 35cm range). EcoXPower bike headlight :It is another take on a concept which harness the kinetic energy produced while one pedals a bicycle in order to convert it into electricity and charge a smartphone or similar device.The EcoXPower sets itself apart by charging your smartphone or GPS and providing electricity to front and rear lights at the same time. BioLite CampStove :Going camping? Enjoy the great outdoors? Hungry? Bring along the BioLite CampStove and you'll be all set.This portable stove combines the benefits of a backpacking stove and an off-grid power charger so you can work the grill while charging your electronics.All you need are a few twigs to start a small fire and the BioLite CampStove will generate electricity from the heat created by the flames.Some of the electricity is used to power a fan in order to improve airflow and combustion, and the excess energy can be used to charge devices via a USB port. Candles : Match-sticksBicycleGravity Lamp :The invention is called GravityLight and it only needs gravity force to run.The way it works is simple. The lamp has a bead cord at the end, and all you need to do is add 12 kg of weight to it. It can be anything, from rocks to a bag of sand. Then, by pulling the lamp down and placing the weight up, the light will start to work.The potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy subsequently powers the gear to light up the LED. Once the weight has completely touched the floor, you\u2019ll need to repeat the process but each pull will give you about 20-30 minutes of light.Pedal Powered Washer :This washing machine is operated by a push pedal. All you need to do is add detergent, water and the clothing, and then sit on the lid, which will seal the container and is also padded as a seat.Then, thanks to a spring-loaded pedal moving at a high velocity, the materials inside start spinning, washing the clothes.

            "answer_text": "Currently this guy Keshav Kabra answer is the best in the twenty 1st. centenary. But from it beginning in world that didn\u2019t use electricity. It the wheel follow by the bearing and the multiply type and style they come in. And remember this, if the day comes when when we no longer have electricity the wheel will always be there pull by human or animals. Just look at what the what the Roman build without electricity. Take a look at how useful the the pulley is.. Farmer use it and horse to move hay up to their hay loft. They cut hay with mechanical grass cutter/hay draw by horse. So one could argue that the domestication of the horse and the breeding of the horse to make for difference model like say the Clydesdale, the Morgan, etc. And the candle, before oil lamp/gas lamp came along. The oar to a boat. Follow by the sail to travel on water. The hand pump and the pump that draw water from a well by attaching it to animal that walk around the well in a circular follow by the wind mill and wind driven pump.. But wheel trump all, as it was the 1st to make man life easier. ",
