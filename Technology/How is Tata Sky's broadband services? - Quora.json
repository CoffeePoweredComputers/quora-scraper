            "answer_text": "in terms of speed, it is very good.I have a 100 mbps offer, and i am getting exactly that :  If you talk about customer support, the above speed that you see is after just 1 complaint when my speed went to about 50 mbps. they were obsessed with that complained, and closed it only when the speed was back to 100 Regardin breakdowns, i got this broadband a year back. back then breakdown was frequent. but they have come a long way, and there are very few breakdowns. and for most of them they send an sms informing before hand. So summary, i like the services. although I'm a fan and loyal customer of airtel overall, i am impressed by tata sky broadband ",
