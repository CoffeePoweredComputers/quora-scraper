            "answer_text": "You can obviously start learning any programming language from scratch, ABAP is no different! It is only a matter of how easily you can pick up. 1. If you already know C &  C++, you can pick up ABAP easily. That is because you don't have to learn the basic definitions for data types, conditions, loops and cases etc.  2. If you have mathematics background, if you love solving puzzles, Any language will be easy to pick up. (Logical approach is important ). 3. If you don't have both the above, you should spend a little more time in understanding basic concepts and try to code as much as possible from the day one you start learning. Basically, ABAP as a language is easy since it is high level language and you don't design very complex apps like you do with Java language. ABAP is specific to SAP and its scope is very limited compared to other languages. So never take a step back because you do not have programming skills. If you are really interested you should and you will work hard. All the best :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, To learn SAP ABAP for a non-programming background person is no need to worry. Because In ABAP we have basic ABAP and advance ABAP. In Basic ABAP if you are not aware of programming language like C,C+\u2026 also no problem because not depend on programming language\u2019s . Coding can easily understand. For Advance ABAP if we have knowledge on programming language\u2019s also fine if they don\u2019t know coding part also fine , because coding part is different from other Programming language\u2019s. if you\u2019re interested to do SAP ABAP better learn in Gensoft Technologies in hyderabad and they provide online classes also if you\u2019re outside the hyderabad and Faculty Sridhar sir teach\u2019s from basic level if you\u2019re not aware of programming language\u2019s like Object Oriented topic,. Hopefully my answer will helpful to you. ",
