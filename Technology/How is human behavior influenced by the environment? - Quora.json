            "answer_text": "One\u2019s surrounding environment can significantly change one\u2019s mental health and physical health. For example, humans have an innate instinct to seek safety. Being physically comfortable will allow us to be more efficient as we work and willing to work at full potential. There are different types of environmental factors that can change a person. Economically speaking, if one is dealing with economic distress, a parent will portray this distress to a child. If the child is developing, they tend to grow angrier, depressed, or even aggressive to others. When parents are visibly angry, or any of those traits above, the result is often inconsistent parenting and withdrawal. The child that is living under these parents will often have an increase in risky behavior and a lack of development for competencies that will stop them from taking risks. An increase of stress or challenge for the parents will affect family functioning and compatibility of the child. Now, let\u2019s look deeper into family influence on one\u2019s behavior. An effective parenting environment will stop negative behaviors and promote social values. A family that is full of conflict and emotional tearing will negate a child\u2019s emotional security and increase aggression among peers. Parents who have loving and warm relationships with their children will have less conflict, with the right amount of monitoring and supervision, they will also have a substantially smaller chance of abusing substances. Vise versa, a lack of love and relationship will induce collaboration with deviant peers, which will increase drug abuse as well as independence from the parents - often times ruining the child\u2019s future. A family environment is crucial in the development of a child. Speaking of friend groups, another intervention on one\u2019s behavior is the friends they surround themselves with. Since peers are a source of satisfaction and social identification. One that surrounds themselves with people that emanate bad influences will indeed be more likely to follow these peers for attention. In today\u2019s society, we tend to segregate these socially inadequate or deviant peers together, which only increases aberrant actions. So to summarize, your surrounding environment can increase or decrease interactions among others. Influences others to act upon each other or even change motivation levels. And lastly, affect the mood of a person. The environment we find ourselves in is extremely hypnotic. ",

            "answer_text": "How does your environment influence your behavior?  Kelly McGonigal,a neuroscientist from Stanford University, gives series of lecture on the topic \"The Science of Willpower\", which are extremely popular. In addition, she has written a book titled \u201cThe Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More\u201d, summarizing the results of the latest neurological and psychological research and using her experience as a specialist and an instructor of health psychology. Kelly McGonigal, in particular, expounds how our personal decisions depend on actions and opinions of other people. Society may lead us along the wrong ways of temptations and laziness, because our environment may lower our willpower. On the other hand, it may also help us to achieve our goals by intensifying self-control. Two scientists, Nicholas Christakis from Harvard Medical School and James Fowler from the University of California, studied the causes of obesity. They tried to understand whether obesity may be transmitted from one person to another, just as infectious diseases such as influenza. The researchers have discovered that obesity is similar to an epidemic. Moreover, they have determined that if the people have personal or family relationships towards each other, then the possibility of contraction \u201csuch infection\u201d increases. In addition, they have concluded that, like microbes, good and bad habits may be transmitted from one person to another and nobody has complete immunity from this. But how does this happen? Our brain has special neurons, named the mirror neurons, that examine what other people think, do or feel. For example, if you are among people who are happy and joyful, your mirror neurons read emotions of these people, causing you to feel the same. Furthermore, the mirror neurons can automatically form a conjecture of \u200b\u200bwhat is the purpose of other people. For instance, imagine that we are sitting in the kitchen, and suddenly you see that I want to grab a knife with my right hand. Like a criminal detective, your mirror neurons recreate the movement, trying to rationalize what is happening and why. Your brain allows you to guess why I am reaching for the knife suddenly, and what will be my next move. Am I going to attack you? Or is the cake on the table my alleged victim? This unconscious physical reflection helps people understand each other better, and creates a sense of unity and harmony. When we observe others, our brain activates these mirror neurons, allowing us to guess other people\u2019s purposes. In addition, the automatic reading of thoughts has a side effect for self-control: our brain may focus on identifying what is the purpose of other peole that we see. Psychologists call such effect the contamination of purpose. For example, as your friend eats a cake and enjoys it, your brain reads a positive emotion linked with this act and may urge you to eat the cake too, in order to get the same similar pleasure. Corporate managers may use this ability of the brain to motivate company employees to work as a united team toward achieving a common goal. However, this same effect may also be used to manipulate people and to subject their minds. Kelly McGonigal claims that you can catch only those goals that resonate with your existing ones. A completely new idea will hardly win your attention during a short term contact, if it can\u2019t find fertile soil in your brain. The brain is likely to perceive an extirely foreign idea as alien. We can consider such brain behavior to be an immune response to the threat of willpower. Perhaps, the best way to strengthen the immune response to the actions of other people is to spend a few minutes at the beginning of the day thinking about your goal enforcing plans and your temptations to compromise them. As a vaccine that protects against germs, these thoughts will strengthen your willpower and will help you avoid an undesirable target. Social epidemics, such as obesity and smoking, are usually transmitted among people who trust each other or are friends or relatives. In these cases, our physiological immune system doesn\u2019t perceive these actions as alien and thus does not inhibit them. Our brain rejects the objectives and actions of other people only if it detects these individuals as strangers. The brain refers to such actions as threats, isolates them and even destroys them as virus or bacterium in order to prevent sickness. Society influences our self-control, so willpower and temptation are subjects to contamination. For this reason, we should carefully analyze our social networks. How many people from our social environment are our \"fellow sufferers\"? Whom do you copy? From whom are we more likely to pick up something? What kind of behavior - good or bad - have we acquired from them or what have they borrowed from us to strengthen their immunity?
