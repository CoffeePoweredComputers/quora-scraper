Smoke alarm, using smoke resistance to measure the smoke concentration so as to achieve the purpose of the alarm; 3. Mobile phones, digital camera cameras, using optical sensors to capture images; 4. Electronic scale, making use of mechanical sensors (conductor strain gauge technology) to measure the pressure of the object corresponding to the variable in order to measuring weight; 5.Water level alarm, temperature alarm, humidity alarm, optical alarm, etc. ",
