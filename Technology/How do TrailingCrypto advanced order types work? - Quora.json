            "answer_text": "A sell trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price with an attached \"trailing\" amount. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. This technique is designed to allow an investor to specify a limit on the maximum possible loss, without setting a limit on the maximum possible gain. \"Buy\" trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell trailing stop orders, and are most appropriate for use in falling markets.
