Simply put, my Grandmother\u2026who has already gone\u2026no pain ever compares to that of the loss of losing someone so special\u2026she was 85 when we lost her in June 2019. Dementia had taken her over, & radiation for a spot of cancer in hed spine. She was, still is in fact, the most wonderful, kind, caring, loving, special person in my life! I know I'm lucky as I turned 42 in December, and not many people my age still has their grandparents, so I've beem truly blessed\u2026but by god do I miss her, so much so, not 1 single day goes by that I don't cry\u2026it's honestly the worst pain ever\u2026 ",
