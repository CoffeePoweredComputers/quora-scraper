            "answer_text": "Well, the carrier wave itself goes at near the speed of light.  But the carrier carries no information by itself, all the information is encoded in sidebands, a spread of frequencies.   Generally we're more interested in how fast a certain amount of information takes to get somewhere, and that's limited by the width of the sidebands.  For Wifi signals there is about 40 million hertz of bandwidth, so the data speeds run about 5 to 20 million bits per second, maximum. ",
