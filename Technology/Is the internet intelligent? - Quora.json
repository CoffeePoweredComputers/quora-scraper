            "answer_text": "You know most people would start with the incredulous look at you for saying this. Their knowledge of the Internet extends largely to the initial model of flat pages, combination of HTML and jpegs that may have been the initial first phase of the internet.  Gradually over the years state was recorded with cookies and the backend became data driven.  But wait that's just nice organised tech. No big deal so far yeah? That was then. This is now. With Google going from being just a search engine with clean results to predictive results, tracking searches and compiled nodes of data for the individual the question whether the Internet is intelligent is not so far from what is now capable. To create a sentient reactionary megacomputer that compiles it's own scripting based on large nodes of compiled data to correlate with actionable outcomes, that is getting pretty close to the intelligence you might be seeking in a self composing Artificial intelligence. So the answer is almost certainly that in the near future a large compilation of previously accumulated data MAY be used as a core knowledge base for a self scripting semi intelligent platform. So thank you for the question its a very interesting possibility. ",

Distributed System, otherwise for the network we have today, the centered computer system will have a size of the America. 2. Packet Switching.  If you don't pack you items in a package and hand it over to an UPS driver, guess how much they could load in a truck and your friends may receive a broken item, although sometime they still receive one for now. 3. TCP/IP. This is like the UPS truck and your door code, without them, who knows where were your packages.  Last thing: they got this about 40 years ago... Ref [1]  Footnotes[1] Internet",
