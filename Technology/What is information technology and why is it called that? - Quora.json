            "answer_text": "Information technology is literally the technology involved with the storage, retrieval, manipulation, and transmission of information. Most people probably never actually consider that. When they hear IT, the first thing that comes to mind is likely some guy in a polo shirt plugging cables into a server rack. IT is primarily concerned with information. Servers, databases, websites, etc. \u2013 it all pertains to information. While most people associate IT with computers, the field long predates the electronic age, and even the mechanical age. In fact, IT traces its roots back to tens of thousands of years ago, when some of the first petroglyphs were discovered. These were eventually superseded by the Sumerians, who developed writing around 3000 B.C., which was then complemented by the Phoenician alphabet, which gave rise to other alphabets. From there emerged pen and paper, books, and other forms of media. Technology kept evolving and eventually the slide rule and Pascaline were replaced with digital calculators and computers. When you access a website, you are concerned with the information on that website. If there were none, you probably wouldn't be very interested in accessing it. When you shop online, the information about products is stored on databases, which is relayed to a website by a server-side language such as PHP. Information security, which is closely associated with information technology, is the protection of this information. So, whenever you hear the term \"information technology,\" remember that it is much more than just some guy in a polo talking about CAT5 cables and megabits per second. ",

            "answer_text": "While I enjoyed reading many of the posts on this topic (and most if not all) touch on a glimmer of the IT I worked in for 20+ years), nearly all of them missed a few key points. First, the areas in which many of these \u201cdefinitions\u201d fell down \u2014 (A) \u201cInformation\u201d is NOT \u201cdata.\u201d When I first started out, this was common knowledge \u2014 the field had its origins in ADP (Automated Data Processing). Previously you had people sitting around a large table, sorting through forms; ordering them, pulling out ones that contained certain entries (or lacked them), and then putting them in piles for further attention of a particular variety. This was Data Processing in its barest essentials. Automated Data Processing went further \u2014 it rendered the data into a form machines could access, it validated it (to make sure it wasn\u2019t merely gibberish), sorted it, stored it, and gave it some sense of order. It was now processed data, or information. In the earliest incarnation, the raw data (the forms) were pieces of paper with numbered rows of bubbles in which each column (keyed to an accompanying entry selection) would be blacked out by a #2 pencil if it was applicable. The entries in turn were explained to the user (the person with the pencil) by a helpful instruction booklet. Everything that followed used information as its origin. To illustrate, consider \u201c5.\u201d By itself, it tells you absolutely nothing \u2014 it is data. However, if it occurs in a field \u201cage\u201d within a form belonging to a student application for kindergarten on behalf of a child whose name-field is \u201cJason Smith\u201d that data is now in context, and has been magically rendered into information. That particular 5 is now different from every other five in the world. However, even in context, the information has limited utility. What do you do with it? Well, presumably the folks that made the forms, printed the instruction guides, and paid for the forms to be processed had some overarching reasons for doing so: (a) how many new and continuing students were in kindergarten? (b) how many were boys? (c) how many were girls? (d) how many were special-needs students? (e) how many required foreign language assistance? (f) how many were 5 years old? . . . and so forth. To answer these questions, we move on to the next key topic. (B) Information only has value in an application suited to interpret it in useful ways. Simply storing the information in a database does nobody any lasting good \u2014 it must be applied (hence the name). Putting it into a database, pulling it out of the database, moving it to the running application; these are all I/O (input/output) operations. If the storage medium is physically attached to the computer where the running application, well-and-good; it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. If the application is resident in a remote server, then various network components (switches, LANs, routers, VPNs, and so forth) may then be necessary to convey the information to the application(s) that need it, and convey the results back to the intended storage locations. Typically these are files. (C) Anything that physically touches the information (or the electrons/photons that may convey it) is Information Technology. Programs are not (strictly speaking) IT; nor are operating systems \u2014 they are not physical entities. I\u2019ve seen counter-arguments; I\u2019m not sure I buy their logic. Don\u2019t get me wrong; these software tools are necessary, just not IT. There\u2019s an entirely different area of concern that governs these \u2014 it is operations. I\u2019m sure there are folks who would argue that these definitions are too simplistic; but that\u2019s what a definition is supposed to be. If it takes a 50-page summary to convey what you mean when you use the phrase, then somebody dropped the ball. ",
