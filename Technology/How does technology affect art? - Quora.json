            "answer_text": "There will no doubt be many varied answers. One thing to remember is technology in the form of materials and developing skills to work with them is nothing new. It started in the caves with the very first paintings. As each succeeding innovation came along, that innovation forced the image making to change (ultimately). It was different and the differences are always suspect as they tend to call into question that which is established. Other cultures can have the same kind of impact. Both new technologies to work with new media, and an emerging world culture are raising questions. You asked about technology. As I see it. the new technologies are just that- new technologies and tools. Art has always been about the idea and how best to express it. The new digital technology has been designed to extend what we know from the renaissance is an illusion of 3 dimensions into 2. It required projective geometry. What is required for these emerging technologies is the means to manipulate them. Technicians have a grasp of that. As an artist, I use a graphics program that allows me to build my images. I do not know the details, except when I choose a menu tool to use, I know from playing with it what it basically produces. Most images that I have seen that try to use the technology as a medium seem tot be gravitating to the Post- World War 1 (20th century) world of Surrealism. This is quite interesting as a concept. The affect that technology has on art images is dependent upon the artist\u2019s ability to produce work that can only be accomplished with the technological medium. It is not about saving time or cutting skill corners but rather allowing for the medium and the idea to speak together. It is for this reason that I work with vectors and ancient geometries. I hope this has some benefit as an answer, Luke. Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has changed art in a lot of ways and in others not at all. The term technology is rather broad, but I\u2019m assuming this question is looking for an answer about digital media and electronics in particular. Some of the ways it has changed art is in the creation of photography, video art and new genre, the creation of websites as art pieces or even the use of social media \u2013 like in the case of Ai Weiwei who uses Instagram as a platform to spam feeds with pictures of his projects with refugees as an art form. Sharing and accessibility of art has also created more dialogue, 3D printing has made for some interesting new sculptural and design products, and many fine artists are using a composite approach like Farideh Lashai\u2019s video work currently at the Prado which brings Goya\u2019s \u201cDisasters of War\u201d prints to life. Videography is now a well established medium of fine arts. Almost all modern and contemporary art museums now have at least one projector and a couch where it can be enjoyed, but content and quality vary widely. For many people, videography doesn\u2019t seem as accessible as a concrete object and it is difficult to really own as the context of where it is places in the museum and the setup are usually very important. There are several hugely famous photographers like JR (check out his \u201cWomen are Heroes\u201d project) who use both photography and prints for their work, but amateur photography is also on the rise. It can be difficult to distinguish what counts as a good photograph solely by the skill of the photographer \u2013 usually it needs some content to be truly appreciated. Along with all of these changes, however, there is a gap that is being created between graphic and industrial design, illustration, and fine art. In fine art, simple oil paint, marble, and metal will never go out of style no matter the technologies that come. These were popular before the advent of the camera and I think will always be respected media. The biggest change that technology has offered art is accessibility. Creators now have a wide range of media to explore and express themselves, viewers can find at least something they interests them across the broad spectrum of offerings. Like with any art, though, digital art is best appreciated when background about the artist, movement, and current situation is offered. It is also always better in person. Videography on Youtube pales in comparison to sitting in the ambiance of a gallery (unless it was specifically created for Youtube that is). Likewise viewers can now have accessibility to millions of art pieces via Google and other databases, but again it is always better in person. This is by no means a complete answer to a complex topic, so I hope others have more to offer on it! ",
