            "answer_text": "What is the difference and comparison between modern technology and traditional technology? The differences? Speed, size, storage or load, or just plain work-load, between \u2018modern,\u2019 and trad. technology is probably easiest to compare. We tend to think of communication tech, and computation tech when we say \u2018modern,\u2019 but traditional? Lets define that just a bit. Are we talking machines and devices, or the uses themselves, like fire from rubbing two sticks together to fire from an \u2018electronic,\u2019 cigarette lighter?Some things are just novelties. There are times when cheap, non electronic devices provide practical and very necessary service in places where an electronic device is too high-maintenance to be equally practical. There is no need to put a computer on a well pump if you\u2019re in a back-water where electronic replacement parts are hard to come by. You just hand pump the thing and it works fine and at your convenience. Certain \u2018Green,\u2019 tech, like solar ovens, are a far cry from a fire pit, or even a gas barbecue, and though it\u2019s marketed as \u2018new\u2019 technology, depending of course on design and materials used, it is very low-tech. Useful technology seems really only cosmetically changed, with new clothes over old bones, so-to-speak. A different package, a different color, but it\u2019s the job it does that matters. The best comparison between \u2018modern,\u2019 tech and \u2018traditional,\u2019 tech that springs to mind though, is that modern tech is very modular and if it breaks it\u2019s often disposable, rather than fixable, for most of us.

            "answer_text": "A vast oversimplification - as both terms are commonly but wrongly used (interchangeably) as euphemisms for \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 by those who like oversimplification the words modern and technology actually have meanings: At their core, traditions are what we did, and may still do\u2026 but they are firmly anchored in the past (however defined).Modernity means contemporary - however defined - and implies that it is happening now (for good or ill).The \u2018difference\u2019 - which exists almost entirely in the minds of people who have \u2018opinions\u2019 (AKA obsessions or hobbyhorses if sincerely held, contrarians, intellectuals, pundits, journalists, politicians, etc., etc if just a pose for professional reasons of intelligent self-interest) regarding whats \u2018right' or \u2018wrong', is more often one in the sense of an argument. Such arguments, not necessarily politely framed (or even entirely rational) often engaged in by argumentative and impolite people are little more than an excuse to start a fight, either online or public forum (but sometimes in public, and involve actual bodily harm, see references, below). In the same spirit the word \u2018comparisons\u2019 really ought be prefixed by \u2018invidious'. That leaves the last part: what counts as technology but that's the easiest to divine as it often takes physical form. Technology is defined as the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry \u2014but from then on it goes downhill (and fast), again because of often strongly-held but not necessarily entirely rational opinions. While these manifest themselves in superficial ways, many deceptively calm, rational-seeming people ritually pay lip service to concepts while so distorting their application that simple, common labels take on an entirely new meaning, generally so they can be misused for propaganda purposes. (One such is \u2018technology' - which a certain British politician was overly fond of saying but whose actual opinion isn't so clear cut - as phrases like \u2018the white heat of a technological revolution' sound wonderful but unless backed up by policies are worthless, or very nearly so.) In that case the term technology was being used as a substitute for \u2018modernity', but coming out of the mouth of a traditionalist, probably means something other than when spoken by either a scientist or an industrialist.. In short, in argument it - like many omnibus terms - is often just another substitute for nebulous concepts like \u2018good' or \u2018bad', entirely dependent on the speaker's personal emotional stake in any particular argument, even if it is one of their own making. When used in this way the reasoning is often so entirely personal, so absolutely subjective, it is not only unavailable for rational analysis by others, the holder may not even be aware of the mental gymnastics being performed in the background to defend their cherished - or \u2018traditional\u2019 - scientific opinions: There are numerous cases of towering figures who, when confronted by new theories that explain incontrovertible facts their own favoured theories avoided addressing for whatever reason - religious conviction, lack of imagination, social snobbery - they choose to metaphorically destroy the messenger rather than revisit the work that allowed them to rise to their positions of power and influence and retain them. Objectively clinging onto the inadequate scientific explanations they espoused, and which made the respectable - if not necessarily famous - is deranged, but subjectively? On a personal basis some unknown nobody who threatens the ststus quo isn't another scientist, they are a threat, perhaps even a class enemy, who must be defeated. This sort of thing has occurred again and again, sometimes requiring a complete generational shift in a particular discipline, such medicine, or geology, before a new theory gains general acceptance, in the process becoming the new orthodoxy who some exponents will, in their turn, defend literally to the death. The germ theory of disease (and hence disinfection) was ridiculed by the general mefical profession, while and anaesthesia in medicine, but particularly in obstetrics, a battleground. The theories regarding glaciation, continental drift and even the age of the earth were the Hundred Years War of the science of geology, where religious authority was substituted for analysis of readily available evidence, from the six thousand year old Earth to the biblical flood used to explain geological phenomena that could be better explained by glaciation. (At the time this was provable by observing glaciers in action but not if the geological authorities not to travel, instead studying samples, and consulting scholarly works, in what might be best described as a scholarly tradition, rather than modern science.) On that basis there is good reason to suppose that even today, when there is overwhelming evidence that is, for the most part, overwhelmingly ignored or flatly dismissed if it is at all uncomfortable, if one were to invite several thousand randomly selected laypersons to answer the Question As Asked in a public forum it would soon degenerate into a vulgar brawl. And further, that if one invited several thousand randomly-selected scientists to the same purpose it wouldn't be much better, though probably less physically violent. (Unless one or more was a practising psychiatrist and they participated fully, honestly and openly. In which case I suspect they would be lucky to get out alive.) By contrast a couple of thousand randomly-selected technologists would probably hold an orientation session, break into groups to encourage creativity, workshop the resulting ideas and publish an online manifesto on the conference website, set up on the fly\u2026 which would then be utterly ignored except by technologists who missed the conference because of pressure of work. Because, sadly, boring, sensible, purposeful activity is of no interest to the generality of mankind\u2026 unless it suddenly stops happening. In which case they suddenly become very interested indeed\u2026 if only to work out whose fault it was. Surprisingly, after much thought I concluded that's definitely not one for psychiatrists. Unless they also dabble in politics. Or write serious op-ed pieces. Or have a regular slot on TV. (But I bet it will interest evolutionary biologists, if we last that long.)

But, here goes: For me, after 55 years of software development work, traditional computing meant mainframes, punched cards, and batch jobs. That view changed substantially when I started working on 8-bit minicomputers in 1970. They were still built out of a lot of integrated circuit chips, but the usage model was completely novel to me: I had my own machine, it sat on a workbench, and it had a teletype connected to it. I had to program it in a very primitive assembly language. But it was modern. A few years later, the Intel 8008 microprocessor came along, and that was modern, even though it was slow and didn\u2019t have much of an instruction set. Modern enough that I quit my job and went to work at Intel on the 8080 microprocessor project, as a software development engineer. ",
