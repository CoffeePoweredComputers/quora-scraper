            "answer_text": "There are pros and cons to both human and robotic teachers. It\u2019s been proven that babies learn their language funtimentals at nine months (even though they don\u2019t start talking till later). Exposing them to other languages during that ninth month makes them twice as able to learn those other languages later in life. However this doesn\u2019t seem to work with recorded, transmitted or synthesized voices (IOW voices from machines). Machines have an advantage in that they are more likely to believed to be somewhat impartial and infallible. I remember when taking typing in high school I felt that the teacher would often incorrectly predict why I typo\u2019d something. I never got my typing speed above 100 wpm. When the computer typing tutors came out in the early 90\u2019s they were much more accurate in detecting typos and then teaching me how to break bad habits by specifically coming up with exercises for that purpose. It never occurred to me that they could be wrong (or biased). I very quickly boosted my speeds above 150 wpm. I\u2019ve heard similar stories from piano students. There\u2019s a certain stigma associated with being called out by a (human) teacher that doesn\u2019t seem to happen with computers. There\u2019s a certain advantage to being dispassionate. OTOH a human teacher can inspire students with their passion for their subject. From my personal experience and from talking to some really smart people (ok, mostly engineers and scientists I worked with) I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that high school is almost a complete waste of time. Almost without exception they agreed that they wish that they could have started college in the 10th grade. (Some actually said 9th; a few said 6th!) Part of the problem is that teachers teach to the slowest student in the class (no idiot left behind). This pretty much guarantees that smarter students are going to be bored. Most have said that they would have learned the material faster from reading a written course (with computer quizzes) than from a lecturer. I remember reading about a teacher in Chicago that assigned reading and homework each night and then started each class with a quiz to determine what the students learned on their own. They then only taught what the students are having problems with (didn\u2019t learn on their own). \u2014 All the above said, the best teacher is a combination of humans and computers. A student could take computer courses and be quizzed on the material and if they\u2019re having problems be referred to a human teacher for them to try to explain the material better. I imagine that an AI could engage students (individually) in Socratic dialogue to teach critical thinking skills. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that they are and I am not sure that they ever will be. Your average teacher has a class full of students. The teacher-attention time for each student may be small or zero - because of the nature of any problem it will take time for that interaction to complete - so in a class situation teachers are fire-fighting problems or broadcasting to all. Broadcasts are rarely 100% succesful so problem management is essential. A robot looking after 1 person is not a comparable solution. The robot may be successful at broadcast at even a higher rate (proportionally) but then it must be spread over a total number of interactions of there must be many instances of that robot (ie just a computer program on a personal laptop). So if we do the sums across a whole class you may find that even if it is better it will be slower. Then we get to problems - the robot does not handle the sometimes bizarre nature of misunderstanding that can arise - the robot has no common basis unless we are talking of a non-existing real AI system - so it will need a human to do the problem resolution. Some teachers use programs to occupy the more able so that they can attend to the less able\u2019s problem - that can work, but only if the work load is maintained throughout and the numbers needing help are limited. You do the same with a text book and excercises. So I believe that the jury is still out on whether computers (or robots) are valuable in a classroom situation. The main point is that it is the one-to-one bottleneck that is essential to manage, and robots are inadequate for that task. I believe that key to good teaching is those few moments of one-to-one teaching in which an understanding of a student\u2019s confusion can make or break that topic for that student. ",
