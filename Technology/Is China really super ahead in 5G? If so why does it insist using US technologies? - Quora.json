            "answer_text": "Yes, China controls more than 30% of all 5G standards and patents. US companies actually invented telecommunications since the early Bell days, but squandered it all away. Companies like Harris Telecommunication, Motorola, AT&T\u2026 Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs and a lot more have either gone bankrupt or bought over, today there are no American telecommunication company left. HuaWei is the only True 5G manufacturer, the rest (Ericsson, ZTE, Nokia) need other companies to partner in order to provide 5G solutions. HuaWei is also more than 2 years ahead of her nearest competitor in term of technologies. In the technology ecosystem, there are various global companies providing certain bits and pieces to certain solutions. These companies derive from USA, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan (China), Europe, South East Asia. That is the reason why anyone offering certain solutions need American technologies\u2026.. likewise if Americans are offering a certain solutions then they need other countries to collaborate. In the 5G space there are components made by American companies that HuaWei and ZTE are using. But with the recent turn of events (trump), the Chinese are looking at reinventing the wheel or specifically saying only the Americans portion (HuaWei has started building their own chipsets instead of buying them from Intel, Qualcomm or Broadcom).
