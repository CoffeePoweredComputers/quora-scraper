            "answer_text": "God created the Five Elements; Water, Earth, Air, Fire, and Aether. Man \u201cmakes\u201d other \u201chuman-created Elements.\u201d One may define God in many ways. Today, the supreme Gods are called Science, Wealth, and Superstition. Humans perceive that technology is a benefit. There are 2 functional technologies with a third technology in the making. The First Technology is Fire. Fire was the only technology for 3 million years. There were many products made from Fire; improvements to nourishment, a habitable environment, and infant survival, aka, reproduction. By-product technology and manufacturing included turning small amounts of the Four Elements of Earth into stone and metal, Air into gases, Water into liquids, and Fire into hotter and colder Fire. All are products that benefit humans but have changed them into artificial animals at the expense of all life forms on Earth. Another human-made by-product technology is war, violence, and destruction that may be part of the last Element Aether; another name is extinction. In the last 15,000 years humans began a successful campaign for dominance of the World. Fire was slow but the Second Technology has accomplished more global dominance and destruction in the last 160 years that the previous 10\u201312,000 years. This is the Second Technology, Electron Technology. Its by-product technology and manufacturing includes electricity, transportation, artificial climate, medicine, overpopulation with reduced needs for human labor. Overpopulation has led to the devolution of the human into an animal that cannot function without Fire and Electron Technology. Humans took Fire Technology and made good use of it since the last ice age about 12,000 years ago. The limits of Fire had been reached about 120 years ago. The human had dominance of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. Electron technology has reached it limit in 60 years. The Third technology, Atom Technology, has been perfected . By-product and manufacturing technology have not gained control and use of Atom Technology but are making inroads into medicine and power generation. We look at Fire as the foundation of humanity. The by-products from Fire to Electron have been a nearly unimaginable. The change from Electron to Atom is nearly unimaginable today. If the next ice age doesn\u2019t get us first. ",

            "answer_text": "With technology humans become super-humans. Benefit asides, technology has become basic need for humans to lead a decent lifestyle in the present era. Possibilities are always pushed and the life keeps on upgrading. Could you ever have just imagined a world with technology like Internet of Things, driverless cars, augmented/ virtual reality, gesture control, machine learning, limitless radar with unlimited power, eco-friendly electricity all over the world, a technically advanced status quo, advanced medical applications, education to the underpreviliged and many such wonders, But just like there is always a satan where there is a god, Technology is misused by certain people which is also prone to hacking for quicker personal benefits and lame satisfactions out of greed, ignorance, hunger for money, power and sex. This has always been a challenge for the control and monitoring of technology. In fact researchers already have prototypes of next century\u2019s revolutionary tech gadgets but it requires lot of work on security breach and application rules for them to get in to the market. Technology adds some more life to life if directed in a constructive way with a dynamic upgrade of security systems and a user-friendly manual with a definite set of strictures. ",
