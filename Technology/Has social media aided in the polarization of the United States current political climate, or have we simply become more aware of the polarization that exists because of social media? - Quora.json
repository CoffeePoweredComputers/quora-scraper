            "answer_text": "I think it has definitely added to the polarization. People will type things to each other that they would never say in person. It is much easier to demonize a login ID than a real person. Now we are learning that some are not, in fact, associated with \u201creal\u201d persons. The infowarfare escalation by the Russians has already and will continue to damage the social mores around online personal interactions. As if it wasn\u2019t already easy enough to lash out at Libtards and Wingnuts. Now one can ridicule any sound argument by calling the author a Libtard Soros-funded Bot. The 2016 Presidential election established a precedent that will shape things for decades to come. Now we have \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cdeplorables\u201d. Any fact can be assaulted now with the fake news tag. That tag has come into common use without the benefit of any expectation that it be applied accurately. The POTUS doesn\u2019t make any effort to cover the fact that he applies it to any story he doesn\u2019t like. It is, in essence, no more than a thumbs down comment in terms of the rigor applied to its application but it has become a bludgeon in terms of the power of its application. The Presidency has been redefined as a reality TV show, where policy has taken a back seat to entertainment and ratings. Before Trump we knew that \u201cthere is no such thing as bad publicity\u201d didn\u2019t apply to senior leaders. Trump has shown us otherwise. It is quite obvious where this leads. I expect the 2020 Republican primary to be 20 screaming demagogues trying to out-Trump Trump. Eventually people will catch on that the circuses are just a distraction while they take away even the bread. It is going to get worse before it gets better though. We have weaponized a generation of deplorables with the idea that facts and knowledge are trivial next to an opinion, if you believe in your opinion and shout that opinion loudly enough. They are not about to make up the education gap that is central to their economic demise. Their only choice will be to shout even louder. ",

            "answer_text": "Social media brings people together\u2026right?... \u2026but its profits come from segmenting (synonyms: dividing, cutting up, carving, separating, breaking up, splitting) and selling its audiences. Polarization is a more extreme form of segmentation. The answer is that social media is both aiding (mostly as a side effect of its business model) and increasing the awareness of polarization. This is not always intentional. Some sites cater especially to ideological extremists, but many attract the entire spectrum of voters. Sites such as Facebook and Quora have no ideology, but offer a customized experience specific to the user\u2019s tastes. I conclude that polarization is indeed part of the business model for some sites, but in most cases it is simply a side effect of the rational incentive to maximize profits. Let me explain. Imagine I am a bar owner. I like beer, barbecue and classic rock and roll. My bar offers the same. Who comes to my bar? Hint: it is not usually jazz fans. My brother owns a bar too. He drinks wine, listens to jazz and is a vegetarian. His bar reflects his tastes. The jazz fans love his place. The barbecue lovers avoid it like the plague. Social media experiences are just like bars. They are customized to attract customers with specific tastes and predispositions. Sites attract visitors by lovingly catering to their needs, wishes and unspoken desires. A social media user is a busy bee, working for free, visiting favorite flowers, following the traces of other like-thinking bees, with all of them creating buzz and cross-pollinating along the way. A social media site\u2019s job is to keep the bees fat and happy\u2026 to follow them wherever they go\u2026 and finally to assign them behavioral profiles which will be sold to other companies that want to know how certain worker bees behave. Doing this well increases their profits. The create flowers for every taste. Even better, they lead you to exactly the flowers you and your friends like most. They already know your tastes in advance. Social media companies know (or make very good guesses about) your age, income, education, ideology, marital status, taste in clothes and much more. When you go to the social media bar, they always serve the meal you want and the beverage you love. They play the music that makes you feel good. They seat you at tables near your long lost friends and introduce you to wonderful and comfortable people who think just like you. They treat you special on your birthday and offer you exclusive deals only for a VIP like you. Social media will never teach or preach, it will never prescribe what you need, and it will always give you what you want. Debate and conflict are on offer, but only with the bias programmed in to ensure you always feel your side is winning.. So children, do you prefer a movie and popcorn or a walk in the woods? Of course what people want often differs from what is good for them, their neighbors and the environment. We were all selfish children once. Some parents mediated well, others less so. Later in life, government and politics exist to mediate between the often conflicting interests of the individual and the society. But this mediation depends upon common cause, science, logic, analysis, understanding (empathy) and compromise. Who wants to deal with all that complicated shit when social media lets us live in a comforting world of our own choosing? Our fish bowl has programmable walls. We follow the lives of friends, but other people are off the map. Disturbances are allowed only if we want them. Enemies are seen slain or bleeding through the protective glass. We love it. When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride Social media profits by segmenting (synonyms: dividing, cutting up, carving, separating, breaking up, splitting) audiences. Their strategy is working brilliantly. Ka-Ching! ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Has social media aided in the polarization of the United States current political climate, or have we simply become more aware of the polarization that exists because of social media? No Original Question Details  Social media, like every other development in human history, has had its benefits and its drawbacks\u2014and often both the benefits and the drawbacks come from the same feature or trait of that development. In this case, social media allows people to connect in a way we never have before. On the positive side, this has allowed persons who were previously isolated to come together in communities in ways we never could before. Also on the positive side, this has allowed people to communicate easily across the globe like we never could before. On the dark side, however, it makes it much easier for us to exclude opinions and views we find objectionable. And that is dangerous because it allows us to more easily alienate those with whom we disagree. So yes, social media has definitely aided to the polarization. The differences existed prior to social media. Because of self-selection via social media we can more easily avoid the hard work of learning to get along with one another. ",

I believe polarization has become more pervasive in recent decades but I believe it is more related to certain ideological groups and individuals encouraging polarization as it is conducive to accomplishing the fundamental transformation of our society they so desire. Of course, they readily recognize the value of social media as a primary tool in their tool box. ",
