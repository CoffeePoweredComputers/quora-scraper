            "answer_text": "There really isn\u2019t an alternative to the iPad Pro 12.9\u2033, but that doesn\u2019t mean I think it\u2019s that great. If you need a tablet with a huge screen, then that really is your only choice with good software support. But, a few things to consider, it doesn\u2019t have a headphone jack, it really is big, and it isn\u2019t that light. To give you an idea, it is heavier than my Apple MacBook, which is a full computer with 12\u2033 retina screen. It can only run apps published to the app store, or if you want to do down the route of getting an Apple Developer Program enrollment, you could theoretically write your own software for the iPad Pro. Handling the iPad Pro is not as easy as handling the 9.7\u2033 iPad. I have a first gen iPad Pro in 9.7\u2033 size, and I will grab that before I grab the 12.9\u2033 iPad Pro. It\u2019s smaller, lighter, and the cases for the 9.7\u2033 model can be found with non folding screens or single fold screens. The iPad Pro case I have has a three fold screen and it takes just a second longer to open it up. The screen is huge, which is great for using it to view big art work or book elements. Webpages look a little better. The pencil is nice. But for real work I still grab the MacBook or a Dell XPS13. I really hate Bluetooth keyboards. ",

            "answer_text": "There really isn\u2019t outside of the iPad range. Android tablets are no where near the quality that iPads are at. You could say something like the surface however it is not as powerful and compact as the iPad. If money is the issue maybe look into the new iPad Air or the previous generation of iPad pros both of which are pencil (1st gen) compatible. ",
