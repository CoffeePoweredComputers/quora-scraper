            "answer_text": "While there are some differences between Lithium Ion and Lithium Polymer batteries, the charging algorithm for the two battery types is the same. That means that there\u2019s no inherent charge speed advantage to either Lithium battery type. So what ARE the differences between Lithium Ion (LI) and Lithium Polymer (LP) batteries? LI batteries are a little bit cheaper to manufacture than LP batteries, and have a higher energy density. They must be a rectangular shape, and they suffer from aging, even when sitting on a shelf or switched-off in a device. LP batteries are a little bit more expensive to manufacture, with a slightly lower energy density than LP batteries. They can be any shape at all, so can fit into whatever remains of oddly-shaped product cases. Speaking of the shape, they can be super-thin and still work well\u2014this is probably the single biggest reason why they are gaining so much popularity over LI batteries. Lastly, LP batteries tend to be lighter-weight than LI batteries. ",

            "answer_text": "Lithium-ion polymer recargeable batteries is a subgroup of litium-ion batteries with similar chemistries but packed in a soft pouch instead of metal can. Mainstream Li-ion batteries in average can withstand higher charging currents, albeit there are LiPo batteries that are designed for high currents, for example for RC applications. High-power Li-ion and LiPo batteries have significantly lower energy density than their high-energy counterparts, for example 2.5 Ah for Samsung 25R instead of 3.5 Ah for Samsung 35E, both in standard 18650 cylindrical cans.
