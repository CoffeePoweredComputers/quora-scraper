            "answer_text": "The scenario what I came to know from my junior batch is that, Grifeo conducted campus placement in one of Engineering university in Telangana in April-2018. They conducted below tests for around 300 members of the college. Out of 300 candidates it released offer letters for 21 students, saying it would offer up to 22,000/- along with others once they finish required training & necessary process. The test were 1) Aptitude tests 2) Group discussion3)HR Then they asked to submit profile Report like background analysis report , expert review & necessary , where 60% of the entire cost would spend by Grifeo & 40% would spend by student. Perhaps, nice deal of any company, I ever see to do for fresher. Anyway, our 11 candidates among 21 selected choose to go & nominated Octave Consultancy to make the report without any influence of Grifeo. Paid 4442 INR for profile making (to octave consultancy) from each of these 11 candidates (after releasing conditional approach letter). once the profile verification is done 5 candidates are rejected because they cannot complete work for incomplete documents or they did not show proper interest. And rest 6 candidates are asked to continue with that. They sent MOU with complete terms for approval & MOU to be registered at any court in Odisha as Grifeo HQ in Odisha , the cost must spent by the candidates , where Grifeo categorically explain cost on training program & which is conditional refundable. Where only 5 candidates shown interest to pay 24780/- in instalment , where 2 \u2013 6 months will be paid industry training program & stipend is between 8000 to 22000/-, Once successfully complete Phase-I , they will join the project & salary will be at per 22000/- along with the refund of training charge. Nice & fair deal. Even when my juniors visited their Bhubaneswar office and asked what is the type of work, who is the exact client and place of work before accepting the offer letter, GRIFEO explained very categorically along with the brief the client details and also they confirmed , when did send the JD except the client name , because they said, people recruited by them so they will continue the process. As per MOU , it is true ,because people know Grifeo & it will take care rest. Only we need to see our purpose should be taken care. If further question them ,they replied it is confidential information as part of tri-party contract and cannot share the client or work details before training , when client send the confirmation letter , than automatically candidate will able to see. When i called to their Bhubaneswar office to know more about jobs they are offering and help my juniors, I got the same categorical response. Grifeo does the right process , by making profile analysis then place to right position so a fresher able to start its journey with right manner. Also, if anyone does not have any monetary involvement than all feel all too cheap & easily available. GRIFEO released approach letter by conveying the exact process including approx. expenditure, their contribution at each step before hand instead without luring students with categorical approach letter first (clearly saying they will offer 22000 inr per month with accommodation which is conditional after completion of all incumbents) and spending money by itself & from each candidate at each and every step of the process. Right today,05-11-2018, all the juniors are confirmed in a Swedish MNC @ Jaipur & Gurgaon , , what they were dreaming of good opportunity and 2.28 /CTC within the time limit they mentioned on MOU. Most of their placement process are very much categorical & transparent. I do not want anyone suggest or reject Grifeo because neither I am a social worker nor any public leader or paid by Grifeo but eventually I want to say I have been passed from the university 2017 , directly contact with Grifeo & has been working since in USA based MNC as technical trouble-shooter in Jaipur being ECE, recently got an increment from 2.28 to 2.60 within almost one year.I do feel right place to spend to get right career.If have money then keep 40k & jump here at Grifeo but read terms carefully , ",

            "answer_text": "Being female profile , I belonged from Indore but unfortunately I got my PP @ Gurgaon-NCR with 2.20 CTC.Grifeo , also offered me 1.75 CTC in Bhopal but staying at NCR , I could do several future study while working. I think best place to get proper profile analysis & start career through Grifeo because , profile analysis organizations are many but 70% are fake but Grifeo does right thus they charge exact amount .I cud find such organization in MP but it would not be right because they were charging 9k or 5k.But expenditure for Grifeo I made almost 40k , feel right because better to invest in right may cost more. My work place is nice, Swedish MNC, safe for female , right for fresher. Being ECE , background & from an ins of NCR, I do feel , Grifeo charges more but genuine service , people need to read their terms properly & keep patient for right service ",
