            "answer_text": "There is no easy way, there\u2019s no sweet shortcut, success isn\u2019t going to come overnight. At the start you have to work hard and make some sacrifices. I'm by no means an \"expert\" on youtube, but I do have a YouTube channel with over 250k subscribers. I'm only sharing what I've learned so far, and maybe you can get some value from it. Networking is 50% of successBe a constructive member of your community! It seems like the majority of people doesn\u2019t know or just they don\u2019t want to know what that means. It doesn\u2019t mean to annoy people and spam your channel link on people\u2019s videos, messages. It doesn\u2019t mean sub4sub. It doesn\u2019t mean promoting your videos in inappropriate places. Member of the community means TALKING TO PEOPLE! Now go at YouTube browse random SMALL channels, find them in the comment sections of other videos, or in featured channels of other channels. Watch one or several of their videos, watch the whole video, and then leave a POSITIVE comment, write something you liked about it, or suggest improvement if you think it\u2019ll help.Then move to another video, to another channel and repeat. The channel owner WILL respond back because everyone at that stage loves comments, actually it is in human nature we like to be NOTICED. ConsistencyThis one is obvious. People won't subscribe to a one time wonder. They want consistency. Stick with it no matter what. As long as you have other people who want to watch your stuff, even if it's like 2 people, keep making stuff. Interacting with your viewersReply back to every comment on your videos because it builds a community that keeps viewers coming back for more and entices new viewers to become subscribers. This used to be standard advice for blogs, and for some reason, people don't follow it on youtube. If someone takes time out of their day to comment on your tiny youtube channel, you owe it to them to at least thank them. Humans are visual creaturesI have heard people on the Internet suggest that as far as your channel is great, your branding doesn\u2019t matter. This is wrong and dangerous. We are attracted to aesthetically pleasing views and we will always favor something beautiful to something ugly. Now take a look at your channel art and profile icon - can you improve them? Same goes for thumbnails of every new video - check them twice before posting. Timing uploadsThis really works. Upload when the majority of your subscribers are online. I learned that by uploading at peak hours (Fri and Saturday mid to late mornings) I was able to instantly increase my viewership. It's easy to do this with the \"schedule\" feature when you upload on YouTube. I didn't know about this until a couple weeks ago, but I'm sure this is probably common knowledge for most of you. Focus On Quality TrafficYou must know who is your target audience. Quality Traffic comprises of people you want to target who watch complete or most of your video. They find your content purposeful and engaging. These are the people who are likely to share and like your videos. You will get subscribers only by driving quality traffic to your channel. Personal benefitI used to not be able to speak for 10 seconds uninterrupted on camera without getting shy and starting to stutter. Now, I feel more confident on camera and in my day to day life. If there's a single way to force yourself to become a better, more confident speaker- it's through making videos. This is HUGE. Above all, YouTube is a second largest social media network and second largest search engine in the world. Go there interact with other people like on any other social platform and make sure you have optimized your videos for search engines.

            "answer_text": "Hello Well, growing YouTube is not easy as it requires time and hardworking. I think the easiest way to do this is to love what you do. As you enjoy working on your channel, developing it, eventually you\u2019ll notice that you gained more subscribers and more views. So, here are some strategies, that will help to promote your videos and thus get more views. You certainly should start with SEO. Titles are #1 SEO tool. Add correct keywords to your titles and it\u2019ll be easier for people to find your video.#2 SEO tool for YouTube is the correct description. You don't have to write a long and boring description of your video. Make it short, informative and catchy. But when doing this don\u2019t forget to add keywords and URLs in the description box.#3 SEO crucial technique is a relevant tag. Pay attention to your tags. Again add keywords and words related to your video\u2019s content.Next important point, in my opinion, is making high-quality videos. Get a nice camera to be able to shoot high-quality videos. The quality you provide is of huge importance. if your content doesn\u2019t look professional, every viewer simply won\u2019t take you seriously, and this is especially crucial if you\u2019re launching the channel for business purposes. Also, take your time to edit your videos. Editing is important and it\u2019s not just about cutting and adding scenes.Video thumbnails are just anther important point. YouTube will always scan any video you upload in order to develop three unique frames that can be used as thumbnails. But it would be better if you create your own thumbnail and upload it rather than leaving it to YouTube to do it for you. Thumbnails do matter, as some people might not even click on your video as your thumbnail does not match to your titles or else your thumbnail is something absolutely irrelevant.Concentrate more on the beginning of your video. Making an impression within the first few seconds of your video is essential because most people would stop the video after first few seconds. You might as well start with a nice intro that will be inspiring and catchy. A short video intro is almost a necessity YouTube videos and it does not require more than a few seconds. Make sure the intro is on point and not one those that plays a musical track for about 90 seconds. If it is too long most people will lose interest and skip it or even close your video altogether.And finally, don\u2019t forget to share your video on other websites. Social media can be really helpful at this point. Just use relevant tags, write something inspiring and you\u2019re good to go. Each time you produce new videos endeavor to share it on other social networks. Because Twitter conversation moves quicker than other social networks, you can get away with promoting your video a couple times. Facebook, on the other hand, can see success from a single post.Enjoy what you do and the work will be way easier. ",

            "answer_text": " To grow your Youtube channel you have to upload interesting and great content. Content Is The King. Yes, that's your answer in simple words. To make your content great you have to do the following : 1. Build Videos Around a Single Keyword/Topic It\u2019s important to pick your keyword before you even build your video content because it helps you construct the best information around that specific topic. It also helps you remember to include your keyword naturally throughout the content so YouTube picks it up when closed captions are added. Once you\u2019ve chosen your keyword, check out the videos that are currently ranking for that topic to make sure you\u2019re on the right track in terms of intent, and don\u2019t forget to optimize your title and descriptions. Despite popular myths, the most successful videos on YouTube are typically less than 5 minutes long, so don\u2019t feel you have to make a film or write a novel. Keep it short and sweet. 2. Reformat Existing Quality Content Of course, the easiest way to grow your channel is to build great content. But that content doesn\u2019t always have to be built from scratch. Some of your best videos can be built from engaging, valuable, useful and actionable content you\u2019ve already created. Many people go to YouTube to find answers and how-to tutorials for the issues they\u2019re facing, so content that solves problems is a great fit. Look at the blogs, guides, and other high-performing pieces you currently have and think about how to make them into cool videos. 3. Engage with Your Audience  It's important not to overlook the fact that YouTube is a social media channel, and therefore demands social interaction. If you\u2019re just posting videos without encouraging comments and discussion, you\u2019re missing a trick. YouTube rewards channels with great engagement, including overall time spent on channel, watch time, likes and dislikes, and most importantly, comments. Try to respond to every comment you receive (if possible!) and ask users to engage with audio/visual prompts. 4. Get Branded  So your content is great. But is your channel itself visually appealing? If you want visitors to take your YouTube channel seriously and subscribe to your channel, you need to look professional. Branding your channel will also help users immediately recognize your content. If you have a blog or website, you probably already have some sort of look and feel you use to differentiate yourself from other individuals and/or companies, so it only makes sense to carry over that branding to your YouTube channel as well 5. Promote Your YouTube Videos on Other Social Channels One of the beautiful things about social media is that you can cross-promote content on different channels. Promoting your YouTube videos on your other social channels is the easiest way to grow your audience. What channels are you on? Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Pinterest? There are many from which to choose. And if there\u2019s a channel (such as Facebook) on which you want to post videos directly, you can always do a teaser for the full-length video on YouTube so that you have optimum engagement on all channels. Don\u2019t forget about your blog; you can post your videos there as well! 6. Show Up If you\u2019re running YouTube by yourself or as part of a small organization, it can be extremely beneficial to put your own face on screen. When you put a face to a brand, your audience can more easily connect with you as an individual. This is especially important for bloggers; fitness, life, or business coaches; and solopreneurs. Every video you make doesn\u2019t need to include your face, but you should reach out personally to your audience every few videos or so. 7. Post-Great Thumbnails They may seem like a small thing (because they are), but thumbnails can have a big impact. YouTube advertises other videos via thumbnail in its sidebar, so you want yours to stand out among the pack. The same goes for YouTube search. 8. Leverage YouTube Cards We\u2019ve already discussed the fact that YouTube rewards channels that keep viewers on their pages longer. These longer average watch times mean people are truly engaged with your content. (You can see how long people are staying on your videos by using YouTube analytics). 9. Push for Subscriptions One of the ways you know for sure that viewers are engaged with your channel is when they \u201csubscribe\u2019 to see any new videos that are posted. Ask viewers to subscribe to your channel in each video that you upload, and keep engaged with your existing subscribed users. 10. Increase Your Uploading Frequency This tip may sound intimidating at first, but to grow your audience, you need to increase your posting frequency to at least one video a week. Don\u2019t worry; you don\u2019t need a design firm or fancy advertising budget to get this done. Today\u2019s smartphones offer excellent video recording ability, and tools such as Animoto make editing videos easy for anyone. Consistency is of the utmost importance. Try to post at the same time each day or week (depending on your frequency), and keep your subscribers updated about when new videos will arrive. Then stick to your schedule. PRO TIP: The Easiest way is to grow is by buying subscriber, likes, and views. I There are few websites that provide the service but finding the reliable one is the key. if you ask me which one then I would recommend socialrankPRO, they have a great support team and have plans for every budget.

            "answer_text": "There are ways to get more views and subscribers for your channel. All you need is hard work, time, and dedication to improving your channel. There are basic guides to help you get more subscribers and views naturally, and here are some of them. You should use a distinct content \u201cniche\u201d that is interesting for you, and with others too. Your theme would entice more people to view your videos and subscribe to your channel. Keep yourself and your audience happy. If the video fails to deliver an enjoyable experience, then they\u2019re off to watch someone else video. On your \u2018About\u2019 share your passion with your audience. This is your Introduction. You can share a brief story of why you created the channel. And make an intriguing and entertaining trailer for your video, so your audience will know more a lot about you. An effective thumbnail image can help your videos stand out. Think of it as a book cover. Use an excellent image from your emotionally compelling video. This will make your audience want to open and view your video. Be creative and original on picking a title for your video. It needs to be engaging to catch the viewer\u2019s attention. Think of a catchy title that will make your audience tick on your video. Compose a catchy phrase or short but entertaining narrative to describe what your video about is. This will inspire your viewers to know more about what is inside. Pick tags about your video. Because this is the keyword when searching for a video, and it will help your new audience to search for your video. Promote your channel and videos with your relatives and buddies. Tell them to promote and share it further! You can also use social media to post your link so more people can reach your channel. Gaining subscribers and views on YouTube may seem slow, and daunting but you can purchase them. There are a lot of people using this kind of tactic to gain them more easily. However, as simple as it may sound you should look for a legitimate provider. There are a lot of fraud sellers out there so beware! I used GetFans service personally for all my YouTube needs. All of their promotional services are from genuine YouTube users\u2019 accounts, so my account is secured. They delivered my subscribers in a slow drip manner and gradually. The views have a high retention rate, and my watch time had improved. They provide high-quality service, and I can guarantee that. ",

Engaging consistently As you begin to understand that YouTube is a community, not just a place to host your videos, you'll start to see more results as you interact with other members of this community.  One of the best ways to build the following subscribers is to assist others in their YouTube marketing efforts. Spend a few minutes each day looking for some new and relevant YouTube channels, paying close attention to their content, and leaving true, true comments. Stop hacking. Start advertising. Do not waste your time looking for YouTube shortcuts. Instead, build a plan to promote your YouTube channel. Get started with manual actions. And after you have some traction, free YouTube subscribers and organic traffic will begin to appear. Start with your Facebook friends and shameless (but still with some layers) asking them to share your video. Then find out where your audience is hanging out and start targeting those sites. Access blogs related to your content and share your videos. Or reply in the comment section of the related video.

Access blogs related to your content and share your videos. Or reply in the comment section of the related video. Annotation match YouTube has a great feature that allows captions to pop up on videos. Annotations are a type of link that appears at the beginning of a video as the video plays and in the course of specific points are determined by the timestamp. Once you've created an annotation, you can personalize the color or font. You can make captions stand out or mix. Then you can select the points that you want the caption to start and end. If you want the annotation to appear only at the bottom of the video, you can start capturing later in the video. Regularly post new content The beauty of social media is that you have a lot of flexibility with the content you can publish.  However, this does not mean that you should not only use promotional video content. Building useful video case studies is a great way to give your prospects a reason to work with you.

You can try any or all of the following methods to increase your views and subscriber fan-base: Try asking your friends to watch your videos and request them to subscribe to your channel, in order to support you. Just send them links and ask them nicely, I am sure that they will help you out.Try joining groups on Facebook, where people like the same thing, related to your videos. Not only Facebook, other social media sites can be used to share your videos and request views and subscribers.Also, what most new YouTube channels lack is an appropriate title name. Adding click-bait titles may help you get more views. Also use attractive thumb nails and don\u2019t forget to add loads of Tags to your videos, as it\u2019s chances of being shown to people will increase drastically.Once you are set and confidently know that you are going to get a few viewers for sure, you can start asking them in your videos to Subscribe to your channel and also like your videos. Also request them to kindly share your videos with their friends and family.Whatever happens, do not pay for shady sites that sell you views and subscribers. Try promotion via advertisement instead. Try collaborating with other YouTubers; ask other YouTube Entertainers to recommend your channel to their viewers (you should do the same for them) and even ask people on other sites (like Quora) to spread your channel to their followers.Lastly, if you need any help, I might be able to give you a boost for a few favours that benefits us mutually. Just message me on Quora. Thank you, Arun Tam for requesting my answer for this question. ",

So, I want to give you step by step guides on how to get more people to your channel who can become subscribers! Give them quality and value  No problem uploading videos just for the purpose of uploading them. Videos must have a quality and the content of the video must be valid for the viewer. Invest in YouTube Ads Internet is a crowded space and money talks, so it is important to invest some of your marketing budget behind your channel.  YouTube makes your channel ad very customizable with a variety of ad formats. Similar to platforms like Facebook and Twitter, YouTube also allows targeting videos based on interests, demographics, and / or in-market audiences. Edit as a perfectionist You have to spend a reasonable amount of time post-production to cut your mediocre video into a kickass vlog. Remember, the more creative your video is, the more likely it is to get subscribers. Video feedback It's easy and can bring you a significant number of clicks, if you're lucky and post on the right video. Go to the video you want to post a video about. You'll notice that beside the comment box, you can click \"Create a video response.\" Click and you will be redirected to a page that lists all your videos. Click on the video you want to use as a response to your video. It takes two seconds and can be a great way to get some additional video views. Use tools to increase YouTube traffic Some of the more popular versions are Adobe, YouTube Editor and iMovie (both Sony Vegas and even Windows Movie Maker). But editing software is not the only tool useful for YouTube. Anyone serious about developing their channel should see Boost socials, a tool specifically designed to handle some of the smaller tasks involved in running the channel. ",

If you're less interested in promoting your channel and want to invest only in the quality of your videos (Photo quality, interesting content, new video ideas, etc) without investing around it - channel advertising, asking people to subscribe and watch the videos and beyond, buying YouTube services like buying views and subscriptions is the easiest way for you. So how do you do this? Straight to the point, write in Google the search words you're interested in - buy YouTube subscriptions/views, and start looking which providers are available, what prices are offering, reviews of people who bought and whether there are packages or discounts. After you look and see what really exists on the net, I would suggest that you contact some providers to see how quickly they respond to you, how much they are interested in giving you their services and by that deciding which provider to choose. When I did my search, I wrote to some providers and the source I like his answers the most was getfans,io except that I saw positive reviews on the Internet on his services, he answered me quickly and to the point, his price is decent and his services are given in the right way - gradually (so my fear that YouTube will suspect my clients will drop). If you are looking for the easiest way, there is no doubt that this is the way. ",

            "answer_text": " Share useful and valuable information Customers want more bangs to make more money. Today they are looking for information they can use to improve their lifestyle or to overcome problems. Make sure your content follows this golden rule to attract the audience's trust so that when they encounter a problem they can not solve, they will come to you. Create a compelling channel trailer. YouTube offers a great feature called channel trailer that lets you auto-play videos when you open a YouTube channel. Your channel trailer is something you have to be careful about working on and constantly improving to retain visitors. You'll need to provide a reason for your potential subscribers as to why they must stay on your channel and what you must provide for that channel. If you're in front of the camera, take a quick, informative and engaging introduction (with a well-structured scenario). Make sure your video is under 5 minutes No matter how complex the product you are marketing, your video will never exceed 5 minutes. Why? Yes, science. Research after study demonstrates that online video viewers have a short attention span. I mean, did you forget earlier when I told you how many percentage of viewers left in the first 10 seconds? In fact, HubSpot has found that the ideal length for a YouTube video is 2 minutes great and concise. So, edit those long webinars and turn them into short, short clips. Use custom thumbnails for videos These images are used in place of specific screenshots of your video. If you do not use custom thumbnails, you may end up with poor and unedited photos. This is even worse when pictures capture you while you are talking. A little effort in a thumbnail image can make your YouTube channel look credible and industry-savvy. Employ Annotations  For example, you might refer to a recent blog post in your video. Using the annotation feature, you can include a link to a blog post in the video. Annotations serve many other purposes. You can include a link to another related video, add text to clarify a point you're creating, use text to fix bugs in your speech, or add a fun overlay. The point here is to maximize every video to have the greatest potential. Although annotations do not appear on mobile devices, they are accessible from larger gadgets. ",

Make your channel look professional - The way your channel looks can make or break the success of your video, so be sure it adds to the allure! Create a catchy channel name and add channel art to get things started. Add a short description to your channel to give viewers a glimpse of the kind of content you\u2019re offering.2. Always add Tags on your videos - This part is important. Without the right tags, no one\u2019s going to find your videos. When you upload a video to your channel, choose tags that are descriptive and specific. You don\u2019t want to use the exact same tags as everyone else, because your video will get buried that way. 3. Offer something to your viewers - If you look through the most popular YouTube videos, you\u2019ll see that each one offers something interesting. Some offer amazing music, others offer thoughtful advice, and still others offer a few minutes of hilarious entertainment. What are you going to offer to people watching your video? Keep this in mind with every video you make. Keep in mind that this is just a jumpstart for your YouTube goal. Just be consistent and keep your drive high to achieve your goals. You can learn more about this from reading this blog that I found on the internet. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "YouTube is the number one marketing channel which is being used for business marketing and learning purpose by over a million people.  When I researched about how many users do use YouTube in a day, I got the state as 1,300,000,000 who use YouTube in a day. This is an incredible numeral but it is fact. Here is the proof with a screenshot.  Think of how many users will be your targeted subscribers and viewers of them. Certainly, you may have a question like how to convert viewers into subscribers. It\u2019s easy to get views fast on your video but difficult is how to convert them into your subscribers. Having over 1000 subscribers is a small success for you. I want to share significant tips which will surely help you get viewers as well as subscribers too. Content is The King  Do not focus on content quantity but your focus should be on delivering a quality content to your users because the quality content is your huge engagement and to be preferred as well. People always want information with quality content when they come to search on YouTube. So always make a quality video by which users get inspired to subscribe to your channel. Reaching out to Targeted Viewers and Subscribers Your aim always should be for reaching out to targeted audiences who are willing to watch your video.  For that. Title, Description and Keywords are key to get views and subscribers organically on YouTube. So first of, make list out of search queries which are most searched. First time do not go with high volume keywords, take such keywords which have the medium volume as you will be able to rank your video fast with those keywords. You will also start seeing views on your video in a few days. So you need to use an effective title using the most searched keyword. Besides the keyword, you can use some other keywords in a description and 10 keywords in tags. Take a Cooperate of Social Media Networks Social media networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and G+ are a great platform to spread YouTube video up to more and more users who are your special audience.  So keep sharing in communities which are regarding your service and field. Never do this \"sub for sub\" as it will waste your time and you will not get the audience as per your expectation either. Hope these mentioned tactics which I am following, will surely help you too. ",

There are thousands of videos that people have already seen, and tens of thousands of such videos with different techniques are uploaded daily. So giving your content a good quality, something unnatural, is no bad. The first thing you need to do is to make a good video. You don't need a DSLR for a good quality. Your 16MP camera can do it enough for you.Secondly see the audio type. If your voice isn't that loud, try to give CCs, (captions) on the screen. Don't add external music unnecessarily. You aren't Dhinchak Pooja, so that people would come to your video again and again for a good content.See the timing. No one likes a very long video of very small context. Don't elaborate out just everything. Keep something for next video.Share your video with everyone in your phone contact and Facebook. Share it more and more and ask them to watch even more. Some will laugh at you but later they'll regret, don't worry !Ask for Like, Share and Subscribe either as the start or at the end of the video. This is create a wish in the viewer for subscribes.Most importantly \u201cSEARCH AND GO FOR AN ATTRACTIVE TITLE\u201d because without that, no one is going to see your video. Ex. \u201cHow To Use \u2026\u201d is better than \u201cVID2000678WA.MP4\u201d. Right?These are the most important things to consider if you're interested in making money. But if you're going only to make money, you're going to get frustrated soon. Because 10K views and 400 watch hours, aren't a small thing to consider. That's all, if you need more help, just comment below. I'm always available. Thank You Edit 1 I watched your video, but you just have written the words like blog. Man no one likes that. And you've typed the sentences in not a normal style, that a person will be interested to read. Sorry man. I'm just liking it because I saw it. ",

Use Descriptive and Keyword Rich TitlesA descriptive and interesting title will do two things: provide keywords for the algorithm to sort for relevancy purposes and attract users and inform them about what the video is about. To conduct keyword research, you can use typical SEO methods like using keyword planner or other keyword research tools.To check keyword popularity on YouTube, go to keyword planner and select YouTube search 2. Have Quality and Keyword Rich DescriptionsThe video description is where you can better inform the search engines and users just what exactly your video is about. This will help increase the click-through-rate and thus the views, as users will know what to expect in your video. 3. Use TagsYouTube video tags further help distinguish what your video content about and helps the algorithm understand what users will view when they see your video. These, along with your description and title, should reflect the core of what your video is about. Think short-tail SEO again. 4.

Good content will result in better behavioral analytics that YouTube\u2019s algorithm will recognize and reward your video with better organic search positioning. 6. Provide Content that Educates or Entertains or BothYour video content should provide value to the viewer; whether it\u2019s teaching them how to do or understand something, or simply keeping them engaged and entertained. When users find your content valuable, they\u2019ll return for more and increase the views on your other future video content. 7.

The following article will reveal six simple\u2014yet highly effective\u2014methods for getting more subscribers to your channel and your existing videos. However, before you follow these simple action steps, you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019re already following these three principles for marketing success in your business: Be consistent: The \u201cone-and-done\u201d approach does not work on YouTube. If you want the views and the traffic, you need to be posting and updating your content consistently for the best results. Upload new videos and share them with your list and sphere of influence as frequently as possible.Provide value: If your video fails to provide any real value to the end-user, don\u2019t be surprised when it doesn\u2019t get any real views. Each video needs to deliver your best content, your best-kept secrets, and your most effective strategies. How can you raise the bar and provide more value in your videos?Be remarkable: Today, it\u2019s not enough to be posting weekly videos with your tips and content. Using your creative \u201cright-brain marketing approach,\u201d you need to convey your content in an engaging and entertaining format that separates you from the rest. In short, your videos need to be remarkable. The biggest sin in marketing is to be boring.

Clean Your YouTube Channel It's important to do some housekeeping before we get into the good stuff. While you may think that everything your business does is flawless, you're not Beyonc\u00e9, so maybe your audience doesn't think so ... I know, I know, it's hard to swallow, but it's important to move away from yourself and away from outsiders' shoes from time to time. Only Build and Post Highly Watchable Content Yeah, I know this tip can seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it's easy to feel like you can get away with sub-par content uploading. Well, you can't do it! The only way to stand out from the pack and develop your subscriber is to make the best of the best content in your room. Run Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this lovely feature for advertisers seeking to increase their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just like short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the ideal opportunity to develop a subscription base if, and only if, you produce insanely compelling material. Post Frequently and Consistent Yeah, at first, I understand why this may be hard to fathom. Not every marketing team has a full-time videographer to grind out content after all.

See my recent equipment video on a shoestring budget I did. Then think of the following. The biggest thing of course is compelling content. Content, content, content! It of course starts with working hard, making outstanding content, great editing, compelling visuals, proper tags, descriptions and great thumbnails. HAVE A GREAT TITLE! Do a search on the subject you are doing and see what pops up in the search bar, this will give you some idea of titles to use. Then post on ALL THE SOCIAL media from the SHARE link, TALK to people, get on forums and post links to your channel in the appropriate discussion, find like minded people and network. have business cards with your channel on it. LEAVE THEM every where! You need to make sure that you are posting to at least 50 high volume threads a week, on multiple sites, you need to INTERACT with the viewers who post on your channel and OTHER social media sites too.

Here are some of my personal experiences: Focus on video content Content that works best is content that is either entertaining or informative. Whatever you do, before you hit the publish button, make sure your videos are highly engaging and will have value to your audience.  Post videos regularly If viewers know you post new videos a few times a week, at certain times they will actively watch your new video. The more often you watch your channel, the more likely they are to click \"Subscriber\" to get updates. Make titles that are appealing to your videos Setting a unique name for your product will impress your viewers as they pass. Imagine, in the midst of a lot of videos uploaded every day, if your video has a strange and engaging title, it can not be ignored! Add captions to videos You can either opt for paid translating services or choose to upload your own translations. You can use Google Translate to get free translations though it might contain some errors. Use trustworthy boost services It is the most highly recommended way to do. In my experience Boost Socials is a trusted provider. They offers the highest quality views, excellent customer support, and refund guarantees you will get some enormous benefits. ",

Include an incoming call, \"Share your video\" in your introduction or outward orientation. Remind them to SHARE your video with their friends when you share it on social pages or in email. Share your own videos with share buttons! Your title If you have REAL K video any title is About Us You do not make yourself any incentives. Take the time to choose the correct KEYWORD PHRASE and add it to your title. Make sure it's a RELIABLE keyword that you know your audience is REALLY looking for when they visit YouTube & Google. Create a public playlist Annotations are a clear way to link videos, but if you ask me, the playlist will be less distracting, more organized, and ultimately more useful for your video viewers. In addition, viewers tend to disable YouTube annotations. If you are producing a series of tutorials or you have split a large video into several smaller segments, the playlist will keep them all in the same place in the correct order. Viewers find a video that can easily watch the remaining videos and if they jump in the middle, they can move to the first video with just one click. Video limit is less than 5 minutes  If you create long videos just by repeating yourself, it has won the help. People need a good reason to care about your video. You can test the video length to find out what works best for maximum interaction. Create high quality content in each video. Optimize your video under 5 minutes. Make them interesting, informative and short. Create a channel trailer. Write a channel description. Generally a good idea, but remember, YouTubers are around for videos, not text. Create a unique video that introduces your content style. AKA a channel introduction. Use a popular video or recently as your channel trailer, like Miranda Sings. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the way to get millions of subscribers to your YouTube channel. SponsoredShow SponsoredShow is a marketplace for YouTubers and marketers. Marketers pay for YouTubers to include ads in their videos, or buy a channel outright. YouTubers themselves can find advertisers or sponsors for their their channel, orsell the channel right away. Basically the inverse of the marketers. It's a prettylucrative place, as you might imagine. YouTube is prime ad space nowadays! Of course, you're probably wondering how you, the affiliate marketer, fit in. Let's introduce the Affiliate Program of SponsoredShow! - The SponsoredShow Affiliate Program Like all affiliate programs, this one is totally free to join. And of course, you get a link. So what makes this program so much better than the others? Well, to sum it up in one word: commissions! More specifically, 100% commissions! Yep, that's no joke. SponsoredShow pays you full commissions for every referralyou make. And all you have to do is get people to sign up! OK, maybe 100% commissions isn't convincing for you. That's understandable. Most 100% products are only a couple dollars. Maybe $10. Even $20 is a bit of a stretch. But the thing that makes SponsoredShow so special is it's $49 payouts! We should probably explain what's going on here. SponsoredShow charges members (YouTubers) a fee for making a listing: presently $5 for a sponsored listing (to put their channel on the marketplace) and $0 for a \"for sale\" listing (to sell their channel, obviously). So you'll get $5 for a sponsored listing (which is by far the more common one). Admittedly, that's not much, but as mentioned above, very soon SponsoredShow is revising their prices! Sponsored and \"for sale\" listings will each become $49. In other words, every time one of your referral makes a listing (read: a listing, notsigning up), you get a whopping $49! The YouTuber is practically paying you with every listing, whether it's a sponsored or \"for sale\" one. With those rates, a mere 10 listings everyday will get you nearly $500 daily. How great would that be? But even if you manage to get 1 listing a day, you'll get $1500 monthly. That's still a great source of income. -Why it Works ? Videos are a great way to reach a target audience, and the niche nature of many YouTube channels makes it so that the viewers will most likely be interested in the product advertised. Plus, the YouTubers themselves have a dedicated following, Their subscribers trust them. If they're advertising a product related to their niche, you can bet the conversion rates will be high. Remember, to be able to make a listing on SponsoredShow, a channel needs to have at least 1000 subscribers. So an audience is there. Don't forget that marketers are always looking for new ways to reach that audience, so you, the affiliate, are in a comfortable position. It's clear Buy & Sell YouTube Channels is a can't-miss opportunity. You'll have a great chance to make some high commissions, and with the advertising industry relying more and more on video content to reach an audience, the demand for affiliates to spread the word of a marketplace like this is very high.

Bo what, you're getting subscribers right? Make the first 10 seconds of the video most memorable  To make a great first impression, do not start your video by introducing bland, but instead be the highest peak in your video. If you start with a state audience will not want to leave. This is why you need to make the most of the first few seconds. Take advantage of playlist URLs to increase the time on your channel When your video ends, YouTube usually shows a list of suggested videos for your next watch. Some of these videos are yours and others belong to different channels. The lesser known secret about playlists is that you can activate them from anywhere with a special URL. You can see YouTube Users add relevant video tags at the bottom of each video. Instead of just adding a video link, I recommends directing the user to a playlist instead. Select category Make sure your videos show up in relevant categories on YouTube. Otherwise, Google (and everyone else) will assume that it is something that does not relate to this topic. For example, let's say you create a tutorial video for everyone. YouTube can automatically put it in the DIY category, but it may get more views. User notes Videos can be interactive as well as entertaining and educational. If you use annotations, you can communicate more easily with your audience and provide resources that they can use to get more information. Annotations serve many other purposes. You can include a link to another related video, add text to clarify a point you're creating, use text to fix bugs in your speech, or add a fun overlay. The point here is to maximize every video to have the greatest potential. Although annotations do not appear on mobile devices, they are accessible from larger gadgets. Make long videos to improve watch time  Although you want to keep your credits short, make your video content real as long as it makes sense for your topic. Making long videos seem counterintuitive, due to the famous short attention span that extends online. Indeed, shorter videos are considered better. But today, longer videos are equivalent to more watch time, helping to boost your content in the algorithm. ",

So you want to get many YouTube views, but you do not know where to start? Today I have a few tips to help you promote your you tube channel: 1. Make a playlist. That's a great way to increase your video views. Playlists are lists or groups of videos that will play in order, another group. The good thing about playlists is that they appear individually in the search results. That means, if you have frog videos or playlists for pets including frog videos, viewers will have more opportunities to search your videos. They can choose to watch your playlists or they can choose to watch your video. 2. Reply video. It's easy and can help you get a significant amount of clicks, if you're lucky and be sent to the video right away. Optimizing Video Include the following steps: Title: Creating a very stimulating title, but not too \"tit\", contains keywords that are beneficial to SEO. I mentioned above Thumbnail: Create a nice, high-stimulating HD thumbnail Video Description: In order to describe profitable keywords for SEO, description is also one of the elements for You tube to make your Video a relevant video for other videos. You can also write some calls for video sharing viewers, subscribe to the channel. 3. Get subscribers. Getting subscribers is an excellent way of guaranteeing that more viewers will watch your videos. If someone subscribes to you, then they will see all of your newly-uploaded videos on their homepage, and they can even email you whenever you post a new video. If you want to get more subscribers, you can ask people to subscribe at the end of a video, including an annotation that encourages people to subscribe to your video, or even ask people to subscribe to you over email.

I have had some extremely popular videos that have helped a lot, but it starts with consistency and builds a channel that people want to subscribe to. Things like thumbnails, channel art, call to action, and playlists all help! And here are some other ways you can also use.  Add the YouTube Automatic Subscription link in your video description I have a customer who has used this technique to increase the number of subscribers to 40% in the past month. I will leave a link for this specific channel so that you can see exactly how your channel is performing, and if you prefer, you can simply copy and paste the channel and place it on all of your videos. Share interesting information Sharing is concerned and sharing will grow your subscriber base because this is the issue. As I mentioned before, if people do not know and they can not find your video, how will they sign up?  A quick example of sharing is sharing your videos on social platforms first and foremost, but also find people to collaborate with people who are similar in size to you. You can promote each other's channels. It could be in the form of a video that collaborates with them and approaches and provides value to their audience. Then, they can provide value to you. You can also collaborate on other platforms. You may want to make a story on Instagram take over and motivate your audience to subscribe to your YouTube channel. There are many ways to get more impressions for your YouTube channel, and the great way to do it right from the start is through collaboration. Name your video according to the strategy One of the hardest things is to name your video. You have a name in your head, but it can be something complicated or too long. My rule is to stay current and use YouTube's auto-complete feature to name your video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something that is close to the popular video, as long as the video is relevant. Make the most of the channel customization. Make yourself professional and viewers will certainly respect and trust you. If you've run a blog a little bit here, use the same branding elements for your YouTube channel. This will make it easy for you to recognize on all platforms. Having some custom handmade channel art for YouTube will help you establish yourself as a brand. You can use this service  to let you create your own optimized YouTube channel image. Use a customizable background header that includes a number of design elements from your blog. Get the most out of your YouTube channel profile and custom URL to complete your channel customizations. Keep your profile short and to the point. You can always link to the blog's URL in the video description for a more detailed profile. ",

To turn your video\u2019s description box into a traffic-getting machine, here\u2019s all you need to do:Add a 5-6 word call to action at the beginning with your complete website URL Although this is a great start, I also recommend adding a paragraph or two of text to describe the content of your video.

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of useful suggestions in previous answers. I will add the way to grow your Youtube channel that I\u2019m expert in: live streaming.  Image source: Reach wider audiences with a YouTube broadcast You can easily grow your channel using live streaming. According to YouTube statistics, channels that broadcast a weekly live stream get up to 40% more subscribers. Furthermore, the viewers spend up to 70% more time watching the content. Also, live broadcasts are typically accompanied by chat that provides direct communication with viewers. It gives you a great opportunity to interact with your audience for a highly engaging experience. To start live streaming on YouTube, you need to verify your account. It also gives you the ability to upload videos longer than 15 minutes. If you want to embed your stream on your website, or some other external location, you need to have an AdSense account that you can link to your Google account. This also allows you to monetize your stream. If you\u2019re new to creating live video content, then I suggest you read more in Tips for live streaming video on YouTube. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is pretty simple, create good and interesting contents. I've a pretty small YT channel, with 600+ subscribers. Here are a few things you can consider: - Never create spam\u2019y content, or give misleading titles/thumbnails. - You might see sites claiming to increase your subscribe count. Never opt for one. Most of them are bots, which google eventually identifies; plus google doesn't pay on the basis of number of subscribers. You create engaging content, people follow your channel and watch your videos and then you get paid. Hope you understand my point here. - Create a fb page and share it. Ask people to engage with your YT page. - Create contents that would interest the age group ( 18-30). I feel most of my subscribers are in that range, - Create contents that are current affairs. It helps you a lot. Last year Indian Govt. decided to launch new 2000 Rs currency, I remember within 24 hours, a video with a title 'Un-boxing 2000 rs note' got around 1000k hits. I would guess atleast 30% would have subscribed to the channel. - Sharing your content on social media helps a lot There are other things like, usage of keywords, channel name which you are aware of. If not, go through google support pages for an overview. Hope it helps. Thank you ",

It\u2019s important to find something that works and try to be consistent with it. You will build trust and people will get accustomed to seeing you. Tent pole. - Use current subjects and public events eg Xmas, Valentine\u2019s Day or the olympics in your content to boost exposure. Name your title something. Catchy and intriguing, but avoid click baiting. Tags- use unique relevant tags, YouTube algorithms will penalise your videos for using generic tags.

(There are lots of different brands and models you can get, and they all have their pros and cons: some turn really fast, but the pieces pop out when you solve it too roughly; some are really inexpensive but need to be aligned perfectly to turn without locking up; etc, etc.) Being the 9-10 year old kid that he was, he didn't get more than 30 views per video. Then a new cube came out called the KungFu LongYuan, and not many people bought it, but he got it right away so he could be one of the first people to make a video about it. As it turned out, by the time he published his video, not a single other person has made one yet, not even the popular sponsored people. That video got thousands of views very quickly, and it's still one of the first things that turns up if you search for a KungFu LongYuan Unboxing on YouTube.Moral of the story: do something unique, but also that people actually want to see. People looked for an unboxing of the cube well before he got it, but he was the first person to actually make one. ",

That is: Imagine your Ideal Subscriber. Once you have found your ideal Subscriber, you have more insights into what they want and how they interact with your content. This will be a very valuable thing to help you grow your YouTube channel. But how do you find that Subscriber? Your SuperFan Try to \u201cimagine your subscriber that is most likely to consume and interact with your content. Make it as specific as possible. With some simple questions, you can create a very detailed image of your best subscriber and superfan. Who are they? Their gender, their age, hobbies, work, relations, education, country, language, but probably the most important for you in this stage, what social networks are they on, are they on any fora or (concurrent) channels. You get the idea. Once you have a couple of customers created, say 5, give them a name. Make it fun, like Creative Cindy or Sportsman Sam. Create for them Once you have these personas (as they are called with this technique) created, make all your content with them in mind. Imagine yourself creating the next video for THEM only. Not only will your content be more aligned with their needs and interest, but you also have a much higher chance of connecting with them, thus changing them into viewers, subscribers and much more. Have fun and keep creating awesome content! Maurice from Music-Mindset.com ",

            "answer_text": "The best answer I can give for this is \u201cactively share it with the ones who care about your content\u201d. Don\u2019t just share it with friends and family because they generally might not be interested in your channel\u2019s subject matter. The easiest way to find people that care about your type of content is to tap into that community both online and in real life. What I mean by that is, if you produce gaming content, share it with gaming groups on Facebook, especially groups based on the game you\u2019re playing. Also, hosting giveaways to provide incentive to keep watching your content helps. In real life, a great strategy would be to host a public gaming tournament based on the game you are playing. Make sure the entry fee is super cheap and the prize(s) are strongly desired (trophies/medals, or a custom designed logo and shirt for their team, etc) Make sure that on all posters promoting your tournaments, that you mention your YouTube name \u2014 so that people know how to find you. The many strategies you could use is endless, but the bottom line is to get involved and to be innovative. ",

So if your content could be thought of as unseemly by an advertiser, your videos or channel could be removed from their partner program. A lack of earning potential, and tighter restrictions on creativity and content, has been a key factor in driving video creators away from YouTube - the small business owners and content creators who are moving away from the platform to make their money elsewhere. Youtube competitors, modern OTT and SVOD video platforms enable users to create entire businesses around their videos, even in developing countries worldwide - people can pay online to watch, view and download their content, like they pay for Netflix in US: Is YouTube Being Threatened By OTT Services? Consider your Youtube channel just as a storytelling tool for internet, that expresses your opinion and promotes your premium video content hosted on a VOD platform. Describe your goal for each of these your video (or series). Write some script for each video before creating it.

Here are my suggestion on how to get more views and subscribers 1.\tCreate spin-off videos to capitalize on trending content. Take advantage of popular and trending searches by creating videos that will rank for these trending keywords. Google Trends can help you figure out which ones to target. 2.\tInclude an intro for all your videos. Your intro is where you have a captive audience. Use it to present the content of your video while also reminding viewers they can subscribe to your channel. 3.\tInclude your YouTube video URL when embedding it on you blog. Adding the URL manually may increase clicks to your YouTube channel\u2026.and may just lead to your visitors sticking around to check out your other videos. 4.\tUse a strong call to action in your annotations. Near the end of your video, encourage viewers to subscribe to your channel. 5.\tInclude subscribe buttons on your blog, especially next to your embedded videos. 6.\tPromote your videos to your email subscribers. Direct them to embedded videos on your site to increase both video views and pageviews. 7.\tAim to write video descriptions that are between 300-500 words. This is long enough to provide a detailed description of your video, but short enough that it won\u2019t be overly burdensome to read. Hope everyone could learn something from my sharing. Best! ",

It takes one year to get 4,000 watch hours (240,000 minutes) if you maintain 20,000 minutes of watch time per month. Your watch time is divided across your entire YouTube channel. So you can achieve 4,000 watch hours with a few great videos. Go to my Profile and you can find all about YouTube Monetization material there... ",

I was just doing it because I was having enough internet available to post a video a day. I was playing some games so I recorded them and without much edit, just posted them. But actually , a YouTube video should not be a normal video just you talking or playing game. Like in my case I didn't even record my voice most of the time. And the games on which I was making videos were already taken my many youtubers. So the solution is that take a topic which have less videos related to it on YouTube also create a video which no one else on YouTube did but actually the audience want it. Choose a good topic be punctual on uploading videos regularly and you will get success for sure. I hope this answer helped you. Please upvote and follow for motivating me. ",

But I also know it can be very discouraging when you are starting out. I have found promoting each video within 24 hours of launch is almost imperative to a videos success. This includes FB, Twitter, Instagram, Quora, Mailchimp, Whatsapp and an accompanying \u2018listicle\u2019 on local websites and press offices. I have managed to get a top ranked video (Whatsapp for Business focused) doing this so I would say it works pretty well! I have also recently made a video which unpacks some other things which help when starting out. Hope that helps you!
