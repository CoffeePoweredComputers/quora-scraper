            "answer_text": " Have you noticed it? When it comes to success, the little things make all the difference. They are often bad habits that do it. You are the sum of your habits. When you allow bad habits to take over, they dramatically impede your success. The challenge is bad habits are insidious. They creep up on you slowly until you don\u2019t even notice the damage. Breaking bad habits requires self-control -- and lots of it. Research indicates that it\u2019s worth the effort, as self-control has huge implications for success. Quit sabotaging success with bad habits. Here are several I focus on continuously: Letting the bad guys get to you There are always going to be toxic people who have a way of getting under your skin and staying there. Each time you find yourself thinking about a coworker or person who makes your blood boil, don\u2019t give in. Instead, practice being grateful for someone else in your life. There are plenty of people out there who deserve your attention. The last thing you want to do is think about the people who don\u2019t matter when there are people who do. Some happy ones: Successful Leaders ... 12 Habits Happy People Share Wandering around the internet It takes you 15 consecutive minutes of focus before you can fully engage in a task. Once you do, you fall into a euphoric state of increased productivity called flow. Research shows that people in a flow state are five times more productive than they otherwise would be. When you click out of your work because you get an itch to check the news or Facebook, this pulls you out of the flow. This means you have to go through another 15 minutes of continuous focus to reenter the flow state. Click in and out of your work enough times, and you can go through an entire day without experiencing flow. Not a good thing, is it? Not able to say no Research conducted at the University of California in San Francisco shows that the more difficulty that you have to say no, the more likely you are to experience stress. This includes burnout and even depression, all of which erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. \u201cNo\u201d is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it\u2019s time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like \u201cI don\u2019t think I can\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not certain.\u201d Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments. It also gives you the opportunity to fulfill them successfully. Just remind yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will increase your future self-control. It does this by preventing the negative effects of over-commitment. Billionaire Warren Buffet once said, \u201cThe difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say \u2018no\u2019 to almost everything.\u201d Remember, you only have 1,440 minutes in a day. Don\u2019t give them away easily. Teamwork habits: Importance of Teamwork ... Develop Teamwork With 10 Habits Multitasking You should never give anything half of your attention, especially meetings. If a meeting isn\u2019t worth your full attention, then you shouldn\u2019t be attending it in the first place. If the meeting is worth your full attention, then you need to get everything you can out of it. Multitasking during meetings hurts you by creating the impression that you believe you are more important than everyone else.

            "answer_text": "Be Positive - be Happy I feel single most important trait of a positive human being is HUMILITY & EMPATHY. This dissolves our EGO which is the root cause of most of our ills by making us negative. One must have empathy towards those below us and regard for those above us. Not taking a over simplistic view I want to mention some more points for a positive and happy human being 1. Our thoughts control our emotions. Stop focusing on the negative aspects of life. 2. Stop trying to impress others with your things and careers. Be content with who you are first, and everything else will fall into place. 3. Act the way you WANT to feel. Act happy even if you\u2019re feeling low. You can trick your mind into feeling better. 4. When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us. For all you know, something better might lie around the corner. 5. There may be one or two people who silently resent your achievements. Ignore them. 6. Don\u2019t cry because it\u2019s over, smile because it happened. We can learn a lot from our past. Experiences may cause temporary pain and sadness but the past can make us stronger and a bit wiser. 7. \u201cThere are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more. The other is to desire less.\u201d The less you desire, the more content you\u2019ll feel. 8. Go for a long walk, or even better a run. A dose of fresh air and endorphin sure clears the head and gives most a buzz like nothing else. 10. Dissociate from negative people. 11. Mingling with people with a positive outlook sure brings a breath of fresh air into life. 12. Dabble with a new genre of music. 13. Travel to a place you have never visited before. It does not have to be insanely exotic, or across the five oceans. It could be the town next door that you have never got round to exploring. 14. Express your creativity. It could be anything from trying out a new a recipe to painting with water colours. Life is full of possibilities. Live it fully. Believe you won\u2019t get this life again. \u201cYEH ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA\u201d ",
