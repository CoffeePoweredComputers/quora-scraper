            "answer_text": "The year 2020 will be remembered as the year the proverbial sh*t hit the fan, but every now and then, there are bits of positive outcomes due to the need for social distancing. The DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) centers in my state have slowly been re-opening since July. They are no longer operating on a \u201cfirst come-first served\u201d basis, instead appointment are scheduled on-line in 15 minute intervals. Well, I was one of the lucky ones to log in early enough last month and snag an appointment for this morning at 10:15. I needed to renew my driver\u2019s license with a Real ID. I pulled into the parking lot at 10:10, put on my face mask and walked towards the door. A masked woman seated at a folding table outside the front entrance asked me for my name and checked it off on the printed list she had in front of her. Another masked woman opened the door for me and directed me to a service window. I greeted the masked rep with a \u201cGood morning\u201d and handed over my completed application and 2 forms of ID, plus 2 proofs of residency and my current driver\u2019s license. The DMV rep checked all the documents, took my photo, had me sign here and there, I paid the fee, then she handed me back my documents and I was out the door in 8 minutes! It was like a small miracle just happened, I tell you! Pre-pandemic the typical amount of time spent waiting at a DMV was about 2 hours \u2014 TWO HOURS minimum. Gotta be thankful for all the little positive things during these trying times. ",
