            "answer_text": "I haven't personally taken any product launching courses and can't endorse one over the other. I'm just going to leave a bit of advice and link to a couple that have been well-reviewed online. Advice (What you didn't ask for): Most of the successful products you see? Their creators didn't go through a product launch course. Learning how to do it like \"everyone else\" will get you the results of \"everyone else\": Namely, failure. I'm not saying you shouldn't be learning. By all means, learn! Find books and blogs. Even better, find a mentor. Identify someone who has launched a product similar to yours and reach out to them. Offer to buy them coffee, ask how you can be valuable to them, and ask if they'd be willing to answer a few questions for you. You'll get much more tailored results through a mentor than you would a blanket course. And you'll get much more out of just starting, and learning the right questions to ask, than you would sitting in a classroom or in front of a computer watching a lecture.  Recommendations (What you originally asked for): That being said, I'm a huge fan of courses. Trying to be less of one, because I've realized that I'm much more efficient if I stop trying to learn, and start doing. But I still rely on courses from time to time. In honor of your original request, here are some that are very well rated online.

            "answer_text": " A course is a course. Of course, of course. In this topic, we're going to talk about the top 10 things that you have to do to have a successful course launch. Let's start from the top with number 1and go down to number 10. 1 - DECIDE TO WIN! Number one is you've got to decide to win. Now, you might be puzzled. You're, like, what does it have to do with course creation? Here's the deal. To create a course takes time. It takes dedication. It takes knowledge. It might even take a bit of research to know from topic to topic how things are going to flow, what are the best ways to navigate it and kind of have that little road map in your head. But it starts with what's in your head. Not just the knowledge, but that positive can-do, can-win attitude. So number one, decide to win. 2 - ANALYZE THE PROBLEM! Number two is you want to analyze the topics. A lot of times, people have questions and really will stutter or freeze when it comes to choosing their course topic. They sit there and they ponder and they ponder and they think some more. Then sometimes their course is never created because they stop at the Analyze Step. They got lost and they get confused. Go with the topic, stick with it and run with it. Run like the wind. 3 - TEST YOUR IDEAS! Once you've got that idea in mind, I want you to test that idea. The third step is to take that idea and test it with your friends. Test it with your prospects. Test it with the people that you are hoping to bring into your business. See what their reaction is. Search online for that topic. Is that an up-and-coming topic? Is that something that the entire market is flooded with, or is it something that people are just starting to search for? 4 - OUTLINE THE HEIRARCHY! Once you decide on a topic and you know firsthand that that is a great topic, all your friends are staying behind you, you've tested that out, the fourth step is to create that outline. You want to make sure that you've got A, B, C ... Maybe your Roman numeral is going down and you're going to decide from top to bottom what topics, just the topics so far, are going to be included in your course, the topics and the subheadings. You can also decide the order. When you create your outline, you can kind of juxtapose your topics one after another. You can trade places, you can change the order. 5 - STORYBOARD & TEST! Then after that, you're going to move on to step number five, which is creating your storyboard. Now, your storyboard is your visual element. The storyboard says this is how it's going to be developed. Here are the graphics. This is the amount of information that I want to visually display on every single page. Sometimes that text is different than what the user hears in the audio. Is there audio or is there no audio? Does the audio follow what's on the page or is it different? Sometimes you're going to have bullet fly in. But either way, your storyboard is going to let you know exactly how much content can fit on that page depending upon your layout. So you want to think in terms of chunking the information to that visual concept. If you overload the page you're going to overload the mind of the user. 6 - CREATE COURSEWARE! Once you got that storyboard created, you want to go ahead and actually create the course itself. Is that going to be a modular interface? Is it going to be linked movies? Is it going to be PowerPoint style? What is the interface of that course going to look like? Creating your course is step number six. 7 - QUIZ & INTERACT! Step number seven is not only taking your quiz questions that you've probably already thought about, but then creating the interactions, creating the actions. How is that going to be scored? Is it going to be a self-assessment? Is it even going to be scored at all? Number seven is scoring your quizzes. 8 - PRICE ON VALUE! Number eight, if you are working as an entrepreneur, you're probably going to be pricing your offerings. Maybe you have a course that's on athletic wear, maybe it's upon exercises, maybe it's about how to create a course. Whatever that is, you've got to price that offering. Of course, if you're working for the corporate space, it may be for internal customers, but you may still have a project budget that you have to stick within. Maybe it's a number of man hours, maybe it's a number of weeks, maybe it's a number of months. Whatever that is, it's something that is quantifiable and measurable. If you are pricing your course, maybe you're doing as an entrepreneur for your own business, you want to make sure that you're pricing on value. There's a lot of algorithms that are out there that can help. You can say, \"Okay, if it's this many hour, then it should be this much per hour.\" Whatever algorithm you use, make sure that you're pricing on value. Is that something that you would find value? Is that something that you would pay for the amount of content and the amount of value that you are giving? Number eight is pricing your offering or pricing your course. 9 - MARKET THE HECK OUT OF YOUR OFFERING! Number nine is you want to market that course. You've got to get it out there so that everybody knows it exists, especially if you're at it as an entrepreneur. Of course, if you're doing this in a corporate space, it may be going through a learning management system or an LMS. In which case, then that course might get pushed out to your audience. If you are doing this as an entrepreneur for your own business, however, you're probably going to have to depend upon who's hosting that course do your own marketing, your own advertising. We've got a lot of resources that are available through our blog that tell you about marketing. We've got a course on branding. I'm not going to focus too much on that, but I want to let you know that those resources exist. You've got some electronic means of advertising and you've got many, many, almost countless ways that you can do non-electronic means of advertising as well. That's number nine. 10 - LAUNCH & ENGAGE! Number 10 is to actually launch. Have that go-live party, have that go-live day and then circle around and evaluate your training. You want to make sure to communicate with your customers, staying in contact with them, following up with them, making sure that they come back to you and bring them back into your business for repeat business. Maybe you've got another course that you can upsell. Maybe you've got another path or another stream that they can learn about from you so that you become the resource. Now you've got kind of a quick glance at some of the information that we cover both in our books and our upcoming courses as well. Be sure to check out our blog. Here's something that I want you to do. If you are already contemplating creating a course, tell me about that topic. Tell me about the deadline. Help me help you in terms of accountability. As always, upvote this content, give it a thumb's up, share it around to all your friends and, as always, make today great, guys. ",
