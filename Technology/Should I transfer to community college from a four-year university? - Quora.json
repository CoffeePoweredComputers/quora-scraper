            "answer_text": "Fifty years ago attending college was pretty much a sure fire path to (at minimum) middle class financial success. College in America does not work the way it used to. Department of Labor data shows that three out of four college enrollees are just wasting their time and money. There is a huge supply vs demand imbalance. Too many young people are going to college given the number of suitable jobs available. Many majors have a poor ROI. Then there is the issue of student debt. Bad financial planning can ruin you financially for life. However you are probably going to need a credential. Community college can get you certified in any number of fields, and many of these certifications lead to pretty good jobs, e.g. invest two years and $10,000 and be a candidate for a full time job at $25/hour plus benefits. (The potential employers are waiting eagerly for qualified graduates.)  Community college doesn't have to be the end of your post-secondary education. Pick the right employer and get a tuition free ride to a bachelor's degree while you are earning $50K/year. Another benefit of community college is the low cost--about $150/hour. (Complete your FAFSA and try for a Pell grant.) You are much less likely to get into trouble financially. Check my blog and website (iscollegereallytherightchoice.com) for more info.  ",

            "answer_text": "I do not believe you transfer to a community college.If you have a high school diploma or a GED certificate you may take courses at a community college.You could withdraw from your current college, enroll in courses at a local community college, get your act together, and then apply for re-admission to your current college.   You may be granted credit for some of the CC courses.   I know a MIT student who did that for one year.  Worked out fine. ",
