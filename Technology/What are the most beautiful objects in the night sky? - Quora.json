            "answer_text": "Visible in an 8\u2033 telescope? Why, the Local Group\u2019s other two major galaxies, Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33), of course. Here\u2019s Andromeda:  And here\u2019s Triangulum.  And there\u2019s more. How about M51a, the Whirlpool?  Or, in the constellation Virgo, M104, the Sombrero galaxy?  None of these should be a problem with an 8\u2033 telescope, especially Andromeda and the Whirlpool (in the constellation Canes Venatici, the Hunting Dogs) which can, with good visual acuity, be viewed in binoculars! NB: yes, these are space telescope images. Well, except the first one, which was taken with an Earthbound telescope. They are for illustrative purposes only\u2026 and let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re all very nice to look at. ",
