            "answer_text": "In my opinion, not per se. There are avenues of scientific exploration being done here, in conjunction with the University of Hawaii, within fields such as marine biology, astronomy, meteorology, and a few other specialties for which Hawaii provides an environment conducive to research. However, I suspect you are alluding to something more like Silicon Valley - some kind of \u201cengineering alley?\u201d Hawaii has actually tried to lure tech companies here with tax incentives for start-ups. But the whole socialistic leaning of our State government made that brief period of reaching out to the tech world obsolete in a few years, and it never really went anywhere. It was too short-sighted, and companies just took advantage of it, with no real intention of the long-term commitment that would have benefited Hawaii. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on one\u2019s perspective), Hawaii just doesn\u2019t have a mentality that would foster a tech industry. :-) The University of Hawaii would have to be revamped or overhauled into a place where cutting edge technology is taught. Which means it would have to lure world class teachers and researchers. There would have to be a Stanford/Berkeley-Silicon Valley type of symbiosis connection to UH here, even if we could lure tech companies with a longer term perspective. Not gonna happen, imo. Our politics just doesn\u2019t lend itself to business. :-( ",
