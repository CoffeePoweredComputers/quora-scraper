            "answer_text": "The iPhone SE launched in March 2016, to mixed reviews. While it is essentially an iPhone 6s crammed into the body of the iPhone 5s, it revisits the classy old design.  (Image Courtesy : CDN) On paper, it is the iPhone 6s, minus a few features. It is definitely an upgrade over the iPhone 6, but not on all aspects. The iPhone SE packs a 4-inch Retina Display, and has the feel of an iPhone 5s. But the iPhone 6 sports a better 4.7-inch Retina HD Display, which is way better than the SE\u2019s. The extra screen real estate also appeals, given the fact that the consumption of media on smartphones have gone up significantly. Having said that, watching videos and playing games on the iPhone 6 has a great experience compared to the iPhone SE. The performance is rock solid on the iPhone SE, but the experience is different. The camera on the iPhone SE is 12MP, but the iPhone 6\u2019s 8MP doesn't fall far behind. To a naked eye, the difference is barely noticeable. The single advantage with the iPhone SE is that it has the ability to shoot live photos, 4K video, and Slo-Mo at 240fps. The front facing Retina Flash is an enhancement with the iPhone SE, but camera performance is nearly identical. For the professional shooters though, the iPhone SE makes more sense. With performance as a comparison, the iPhone SE\u2019s A9/M9 is double the speed of an iPhone 6\u2019s A8/M8 combo. With iOS 9.3 as a benchmark, a layman wouldn't notice difference in performance between the two. High octane apps like iMovie would benefit a lot from the iPhone SE\u2019s chipset. For a normal day to day use, it is not a big deal. Battery life on both of them is nearly identical on heavy usage, but the iPhone SE dishes out about 15\u201320 minutes of usage on a normal use. Currently, these two iPhones perform nearly the same. Of course, two years down the line we would get to see a drastic change in performance with iOS 11 on it (if they name it that way). The iPhone SE would perform better, but hey, don't we upgrade our smartphones every two years? Putting it into a single sentence, the iPhone SE boasts better performance, but the iPhone 6 gives you a better experience. Again, this is subjective. If you have been using an iPhone 5s or below, the iPhone SE would make you feel at home. The iPhone 6 would be a much better one, but it would take some time to get used to it. Mind you, once you get used to the Retina HD display of the iPhone 6, you wouldn't use any other phone. If you are coming from an Android, probably a bigger sized display, I\u2019d recommend you go for the iPhone 6. Once you have used a bigger phone, you cannot go back to the 4-inch display. Even with it\u2019s classy design, it would feel like a toy. I\u2019m currently using an iPhone 6, and the iPhone 4/5/5c/5s/SE feels extremely tiny, like a toy phone. I had used my iPhone 4 for 3 years before upgrading to the iPhone 6, but it took me just 2 days of usage to deem the iPhone 4 tiny. If you are someone who wants a mix of everything and is not a hardcore user, go for the iPhone 6. You certainly won\u2019t be disappointed. If you could flex your budget a bit more, go for the iPhone 6s; it is the ideal iPhone for you. I had the same confusion, whether to go for the iPhone 6 or the iPhone SE. I opted for the iPhone 6. I do not regret this option. Whatever choice you make, please go for the 64GB model. 16GB is just not enough. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "iPhone 6s and iPhone SE are both great, less-expensive phones. Diminished screen returns:The main difference between these two phones is the screen size. The iPhone SE marks a return to the 4-inch form factor that Apple abandoned with the arrival of the iPhone 6 in 2014. Some people still hanker for the days of true one-handed usage, which even the hardly-massive iPhone 6S and its 4.7-inch screen can\u2019t quite cater for. At least, not if you have Donald Trump-sized, tiny hands. Same great camera :It\u2019s a stunning one-two iPhone 6S-matching punch for the iPhone SE. Just as the two phones share a processor, so too they have the same camera. That translates to a 12-megapixel unit that\u2019s as fast as it is reliable, and which is capable of taking some truly excellent shots in decent lighting. Size :iPhone SE has a 4-inch screen with 1136x640 pixels at 326 ppi. That's the same size as the old iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s. It means everything from apps to games to the web will look smaller, including text and pictures. iPhone 6s has a 4.7-inch screen with 1336x750 pixels at 326 ppi, and the iPhone 6s Plus has a 5.5-inch screen with a 1920x1080-pixel screen at 401 ppi. That means, with iPhone 6s, you get more of everything, and with iPhone 6s Plus you get much more, including the ability to run iPad-style (two column) apps in landscape mode. If you want the smallest iPhone available, one that will fit into the smallest pocket or pouch, but still has a fairly recent processor and camera, you want iPhone SE. If you want an iPhone that's still a phone, with all the power but not all of the bulk, then you want iPhone 6s. ",
