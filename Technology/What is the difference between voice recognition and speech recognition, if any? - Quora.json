            "answer_text": "Voice Recognition is a process by which a system recognizes the individual characteristics of one\u2019s voice. Mac OS 9 had a feature where you could unlock your computer using your voice. The key difference between voice recognition and speech recognition is the computer doesn\u2019t know what you said, but it knows it\u2019s you. It\u2019s sort of an audible fingerprint. Speech Recognition is a broadly applied term that generally means a system that recognizes one\u2019s speech patterns and turns those patterns into something else, such as an action (commands) or words on the screen (dictation). Some speech recognition systems have a limited vocabulary, and thus can recognize speech from just about anyone. Such low level speech recognition systems are common in corporate phone trees. But when you want to dictate and have the words translated to text, it gets a lot harder. The larger the vocabulary, the less accurate the system. While today\u2019s systems are a lot more accurate than they were just a few years ago, they still benefit from the user training the system to recognize the unique way they pronounce things and to capture any other vocal characteristics unique to that particular individual. The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably by people who don\u2019t actually know the difference, so pay attention to the context in which each term is used and swap them accordingly if necessary.

            "answer_text": "Easy. Speech recognition focuses on the vocabulary- the words used. Voice recognition goes for the biometric aspect. Every voice is different. There are hundreds of markers such as tempo, tembre, pitch that make your voice unique. Voice recognition captures all theese markers to provide services like voice ID. Both, speech and voice analytics can provide insight about the mood of the speaker(s). Speech analytics is used to decipher SENTIMENT based on positive / negative words used. Voice analytics uses accustic cues to provide information about EMOTION. Both come in a lot of variations depending on the technology/engines behind each solution. ",
