            "answer_text": "A Masters in IT is a wide spectrum of options. I went to the University of Chicago for an MBA. I considered a joint degree with IT since I was a systems programmer at the time. In my opinion, personal performance will be more important in advancement than a degree. A degree is a good competitive attribute in applying for a role. Presenting yourself and your accomplishments is always the trump play. If you have a particular field of interest your choice of schools may play into that too. If you have didactic qualities, you can always accomplish more. Think of the degree as one set of stepping stones along the path. The choice is not about the quality of the stones. It is about the direction of the path and the opportunities on that path. ",

            "answer_text": "If your ambition is to become a CIO, it\u2019s definitely worth the investment. As a chief information officer, you are responsible for all the technical areas of a company, budgeting, forecasting, and several other tasks that you will learn in the master\u2019s classes. With your master\u2019s degree, it\u2019s also beneficial to obtain some technical certifications depending on the area of business you\u2019re wanting to be. ITIL certifications are in high demand right now. Check on job sites such as Dice and look at the job descriptions. Those usually have the certifications that employers are looking for. Good luck in your future endeavors. ",
