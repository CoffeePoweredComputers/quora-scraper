These will tell a True HR professional in short order whether he is interviewing a professional go-getter or someone who just intends to skate through doing as little as possible. Learn the signs! \u201cBody language tells the truth. Body language in a job interview gives the interviewer a great deal of information that is not conveyed by the spoken word alone.
