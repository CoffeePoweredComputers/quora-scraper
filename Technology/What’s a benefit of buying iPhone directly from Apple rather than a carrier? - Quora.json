            "answer_text": "It all depends what country you\u2019re talking about. In Canada, from December 1st, 2017 all cellular service providers have to provide unlocked cell phones to every customer on a contract. CRTC bans cellphone unlocking fees, orders all new devices be unlocked In my opinion buying an iPhone directly from Apple has always been expensive here since on a 2 years contract the phone price is heavily subsidized. For example: My monthly cell phone plan is C$70 with Rogers for Unlimited Canada wide calling & text, 6GB data and VM service on a 2 years contract for a premium smartphone. I started my 2 years contract in December 2015 and picked iPhone 6S, I paid Rogers C$99 for the phone upfront and the remaining amount (called flex balance) on the phone will be taken from my monthly plan. Now, I don\u2019t have to worry about anything. I just pay my service provider fixed C$70 X 24 months (I own the phone from day 1) One important thing when iPhone 6S was released in September, 2015 the 64GB model on a 2 years contract was $299 upfront payment and rest on 24 months equal installment from your monthly plan. I got the same phone on boxing day sale for $99, so my monthly installment was priced even better for the same C$70 plan. Every service provider here in Canada has a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) scheme. Assume, If I had buy my iPhone 6S 64GB from Apple directly I would have paid them around C$900 approx. Rogers, under BYOD would only offer $10 monthly discount on my plan. The discount remains the same irrespective of the plan I had chosen. Also, a tier lower plan, which is C$60/month only offers 1GB data instead of 6GB so it makes absolutely no sense to me to choose this one because data overage charges in Canada is insanely expensive. Every Canadian service provider charges somewhat similar price for data overages and my service provider charges C$7 per 100 megabytes for exceeding monthly data consumption. Rogers defends data overage fee increases Now, if you do the maths under BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) scheme, I would have only saved C$10 X 24 months = C$240. That\u2019s C$900 - C$240 = C$660 more money I would have spent if I have bought the phone directly from Apple. Lastly, all service provider here will unlock your phone after 3 months into contract for approx C$50 fees (however this will change on December 1st, 2017). I got my iPhone unlocked thru ebay for only C$8, the next month I got it. Some people say this will void my manufacture\u2019s warranty but the reality is Apple doesn\u2019t check whether your phone is locked or unlocked they will just either replace or repair your phone depending on the kind of warranty your phone carries. It\u2019s safe to say, in North America buying iPhones directly from Apple is expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reason: you can buy an unlocked model that isn\u2019t attached to any one carrier. If you travel often enough or think you might switch providers, you don\u2019t have to ask for an unlock or deal with your carrier\u2019s roaming plans \u2014 you just get a local SIM and you\u2019re off to the races. This makes selling your phone easier, too, since you don\u2019t have to limit your audience to people on one network. The other perk: minimizing your interaction with carriers. You don\u2019t have to wade through the carrier\u2019s website or talk to reps in the store; you just order your phone, wait a little while and set it up. I haven\u2019t had to get help in a carrier store for a long time (the last time was to get a nano-SIM), and I\u2019m happier that way. ",
