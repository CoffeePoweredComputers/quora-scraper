            "answer_text": "I use both Google and Amazon, starting back in the 1990s. It has become partly an addiction to convenience, or habit, and partly the realization that the cost to me, in terms of my time, of finding equally-performing alternatives is somewhat high. But I do not like the arrogance and political postures and associations of these companies. So I am starting to use Mozilla Firefoz and DuckDuckGo,com as a slow start on disengaging. Monopolies are stimied when people use alternatives. Cost is not just about money. It is also time, privacy, security, and about thwarting an ever-encroaching government and corporate oligarchies. Those may seem like hidden costs, but they grow insidiously, and we need to oppose them. ",

            "answer_text": "That begs the question, Are Google and Amazon Internet monopolies? They are not. If you are going to go around politicizing, at least understand the words that you are using. First of all, Amazon is nowhere near market saturation. And Google is not preventing anyone from offering competing services. Being really good at something is not the same as being a monopoly. Monopoly - Wikipedia Also, it\u2019s \u201cInternet\u201d, not \u201cinternet\u201d. An \u201cinternet\u201d is any network that implements the TCP/IP network protocol. The \u201cInternet\u201d is the big world-wide internet that evolved out of ARPAnet and NSFnet. There. Now you know two new words. ",
