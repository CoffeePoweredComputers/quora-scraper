To dethrone Google you\u2019d need to invest a ton into products (search, ads, mail, cloud, etc.) to try to beat them. And you\u2019d need to spend a lot on sales and marketing to even get close. There is no \u201cdecentralized app\u201d that will even come close. The people that spread the tall tales about how \u201cdecentralized apps are better\u201d don\u2019t really understand applications. Or centralized vs. decentralized. Or how to run a business. They have bought into a crazy idea. 40 years ago these guys would have been telling you that someone invented a car that runs on water but Detroit had them bumped off. Stay clear. ",
