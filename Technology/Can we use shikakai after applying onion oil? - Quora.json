            "answer_text": "Yes To prepare the fruit pods for use as a shampoo, the bark and leaves of the plant are first dried. Then the bark and leaves are ground into a fine powder and made into a creamy paste. Shikakai shampoo will not lather like shampoo containing sulfates. Although, it is considered an excellent cleanser. Shikakai shampoo has mild ingredients and a naturally low pH (potential hydrogen). It won\u2019t strip the hair of natural oils like a clarifying shampoo. Since shikakai shampoo doesn\u2019t strip the hair of natural oils during the washing process, it\u2019s usually not necessary to use a conditioner after use. The shampoo can also be used as an effective detangler. Also, the infusion of plant leaves has been used in fighting dandruff. Or if you can not use shikaki try sulphate free shampoo.  Take care ",
