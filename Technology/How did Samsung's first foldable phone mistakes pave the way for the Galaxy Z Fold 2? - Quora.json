            "answer_text": "It has a modern design with a punch hole design rather than an abnormal notch that was on the last fold.   Better screen technology with a 120 herts refresh rate, a better hinge mechanism with better brushes for better dust resistance and tighterand sturdier hinge which allows for a fixed angle placement like Z Flip.  A bigger screen on the outside is a huge improvement over the last years Fold it has improved dramatically and now feels much like a real, usable screen.   Now the inner screen comes with a screen protector over the plastic screen that even when peeled doesn\u2019t effect the main screen unlike last year (But i do not suggest peeling that also). Overall its a newer design with a 2020 exterior that matches with other flagships. ",

            "answer_text": "The major flaws the first gen fold had was the hinge and the screen had a layer that looked like a screen protector but it was part of the screen. On the fold 2 the hinge was greatly improved not as flimsy and tighter fitting to keep dust and dirt out. The screen now has the layer hidden without looking like a screen protector. So overall those two where the big flaws the Z fold had now is it still worth the price I don\u2019t know. ",
