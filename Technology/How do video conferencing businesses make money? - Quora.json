            "answer_text": "If you are referring to Freemium platforms that don\u2019t charge for versions with limited functionality, they are counting on you to upgrade to paid versions. We are Pro users of JoinMe, who started out as free users, now likely to move to Premium users. If the application is good and useful, you find more ways to employ it. That has proven true for us. Although I\u2019ve created multiple video conferencing apps, they have never been free. They\u2019ve been custom designed for a specific client and usually a very specific type of video meeting, such as meetings of new drug researchers discussing clinical protocols. As for Google Hangouts, the Google monetization model depends on determining the interests of each user and then selling that interest profile to the highest bidder. If you are going to a Hangout where the optimization of alpaca wool is the topic, it\u2019s safe to assume that they\u2019ll sell that intelligence to wool harvesting vendors. ",
