            "answer_text": "Children are using the tools and toys of the times. Technology has become ubiquitous in all of our lives. Not just theirs. You could go outside and look up at the sky, waive your hands around and try to figure out if it is humid and might rain. You could listen to the radio and wait for the weather forecast to come on. You might think the radio low tech but the meteorologist is using a weather satellite to get that info to you anyway. You could also watch TV. Same satellite but now you\u2019ve added digitally compressed data being sent over cable or internet. But we all know most people just use their smartphones which grab that info from the closest cellular tower and put it on screen because our AI helper knows we want it. To pose this question without also looking at the parent\u2019s dependency on technology is hypocritical unless you are Amish. I say dependency rather than addiction because these ARE the tools available to use. Average people no longer own a small weather station unless it is a hobby but they wouldn\u2019t rely on that if they were traveling anyway. They also wouldn\u2019t pull out a paper road map. They would just use the built in GPS that searches for 4 of the 24 satellites in orbit that were launched via rocket just for the purpose of global positioning. ",

            "answer_text": "Brieftly we all need dompamine/reward to feel good. Whether we click on a screen with our fingertips and get a rich reward with the requirement we just keep clicking or if we get that thru socializing which is sustainable is a huge difference. Adults sometimes use other addictive ways to get that dopamine. If tech people don\u2019t allow their kids near tech we shoudl be wary as well ",
