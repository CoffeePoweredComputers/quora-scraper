            "answer_text": "Scientists studied it. Results are sparse, but they got some comfirmation. Scientifically checking astral projection is equivalent to checking the ESP which happen in theses situation, against the physical fact. I could do that once myself, and some science studies did. Astral projection (scientifically called OBE, Out of Body Experience) happen as an extension of sleep paralysis (the so-called \u00abalien abduction\u00bb) and it is a common occurence in the first stage of the NDE. Check my page on scientific evidences of parapsychology, for more links to experiments and groups. Maintream science does not study or recognise parapsychology. Yet there are some units here and there, like in the Universi\u00e9 du Mirail in Toulouse. Some extremists, that I call scientistists (scientistes in French), deny parapsychology, and spam wikipedia with false science like the scandium fires in Hessdalen, or the NDE being neuromediator fireworks.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but it is not easy to study because the energy/particles that project is not observable at this time, not all people have OBE\u2019s at near death some just dream and some have a mixture so experiences differ a lot. REVENANT: GERMAN SCIENTISTS This article is a biased towards supernatural heaven but one can tell some of the experiences were true OBE\u2019s the consciousness projecting while interacting with the brain, there is no body, real time and limited sensation. EGMi fully explains OBE\u2019s and re-hosting using energy theory, I have best guessed some of the energy that science is now looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "No. All attempts to prove anything like astral travel is happening have yielded no conclusive results. Keep in mind this isn't failure to understand how astral projection works, it is a fundamental failure to prove in any meaningful way that the experience is not entirely in the heads of the claimants. No part of their claims align with reality. ",
