            "answer_text": "I am by no means an expert on the subject. But I would say that the short answer is \"yes\", to some extent. As of right now, there is the large MOOC movement and many of the organizations running these MOOCs are pushing to get college-level accreditation. I, personally, think MOOCs are incredible tools for self learning, but in general they are just not university-caliber classes yet. Even if they were properly accredited, I would still choose to take them without credit just to learn any particular subject I wanted/needed to for my own benefit. But that issue of quality is more of a short time issue than a structural one. The real question is whether e-learning will one day entirely replace schools. For this question, I'd say yes (but not ALL schools). Currently, most students only attend college because they \"need to\" in order to get a job. If hiring managers ever started weighing self-gained knowledge as equal to diplomas, then we would likely see people choosing the cheaper alternative of e-learning. There would still be students who attend real schools for interests in academia and research and/or sports teams, etc , but you would no longer have a catch-all of EVERY student going to college. Assuming that model seems sustainable once underway, the question becomes how do we get the ball rolling? We'd need hiring managers to trust in MOOCs with the same confidence that they trust in college diplomas. That's why I don't think such a change will come anytime soon, necessarily. However, for many fields (Computer Science, for instance) students can demonstrate their knowledge by building projects from courses they've learned. Similarly, there could potentially be certification programs for less project-based fields where a student can learn the material on their own and then sign-up for a test to prove their knowledge. A system like that would have to be gradually introduced. First, employers would like the projects and certifications as happy little additions to a student's diploma. But as time goes on and the certification programs develop legitimacy and credibility, that could cause hiring managers to decide to have faith in students who can clearly demonstrate their requisite knowledge via customized portfolios. Granted, this is all a largely hypothetical of how a friend of mine and I thought e-learning could really \"disrupt\" schools. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it won\u2019t totally replace it, but there will be a lot more of it! For primary school or children aged 4\u201312. The answer is no, they need structure and routine, their parents might work and they need a place they can go to get out of the house. In short, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to be left home by themselves and make sure they would do a good job. For Secondary school 12\u201316 years, again, I don\u2019t think they will be allowed until they possibly reach the final year and if then! Again the obvious reasons are that parents need to have childcare in place if they are to learn from home! As they reach their final years I expect they will offer greater flexibility with the option to do a lesson or two at home. I don\u2019t think they could move solely to online only. It will help in instances where they might only have 1 lesson in a day. This would reduce their commute, cut emissions and save everyone's time. When currently learning in the classroom, I think they will be utilising a lot more online tools, whether that would be YouTube, official content or educational websites and using a lot more learning CRMs where they can track learners, submit homework and upload evidence all in one place. This means that teachers don\u2019t have to mark 30 separate books! For College - I think yes, online learning will take over from a lot of classes. This is the transition to becoming an independent learner. Many are already implementing the learning CRM system but not yet teaching classes that way. I think after COVID-19, I think they will try more classes online so that they can create efficiencies within the college and reduce commutes and time spent travelling. University - This is where they will use it the most. However, the problem here is would you pay 9K for the tuition fee to be educated online? This is where they will balance between online and classroom teaching. I think it is a useful tool to have, and can mean a lot more contact time with students on a personal level or 1\u20131 for their dissertation, support in the labs and assignments. ",

            "answer_text": " E-learning tools provide educators and students with access to resources they couldn\u2019t have had otherwise, no matter their status or location. A philosophy student in England can learn from the top professor a continent away, and can do so in their own time while balancing a full-time job and a family at home. But even though e-learning has become an education equalizer, it\u2019s still not a replacement for the traditional classroom. Sure, the technology is advancing, but it\u2019s not flawless. Just like any new, burgeoning innovation, e-learning faces its own challenges. This, to me, is where e-learning and the traditional classroom will one day form a union: compensating for one where the other lacks. Here\u2019s what I mean. The State of The Traditional Classroom In a traditional classroom, educators will tell you they need to be on their toes, trying to engage their students at every moment. But students don\u2019t always cooperate\u2014maybe they\u2019re bored, zoned out, or too focused on the sun outside to pay attention to math. That lack of engagement is a challenge for the student as well. They can\u2019t hit pause on a teacher and rewind back to the part where they stopped paying attention, which means they\u2019re going to miss out. Accounting for a student\u2019s individual attention span is also an issue in traditional classrooms. Some students fatigue after 50 minutes, others after 15, and there\u2019s no way to adjust for that in a real-time environment. Despite these problems, once the teacher and the student meet in the middle and find that engagement, it\u2019s magic. Being surrounded by like-minded people, actively participating with peers, and seeing students come alive once things click is a social energy you can\u2019t replace\u2014even with AI. The Emergence of E-Learning One of the ways e-learning has tried to mimic the social aspects of a classroom is with tools like messaging boards, Facebook groups, and yes, sometimes chatbots. They give students the sense they aren\u2019t just staring at an empty message board, but they are talking with real people about their homework. Of course, this doesn\u2019t replace talking with peers or having a teacher know your name. Students naturally learn from one another while solving problems and working collaboratively in a traditional classroom. They\u2019re validated and encouraged by face-to-face time with a teacher that doesn\u2019t come from a pre-recorded video. E-learning has yet to find a way to truly imitate that. From the teacher\u2019s perspective, e-learning tools give them precise, clear-cut feedback on how a student is engaging with material. They can see where students get lost in a lesson and grade assignments with the click of a button. A reduced workload allows teachers to flex their skills in other ways\u2014ways that are more beneficial to the students and the classroom. Less hours spent grading workbooks means more time spent engaging each student on an individual level. It\u2019s this combination of customized content and resource management that will allow teachers to lead our classrooms into the future. What The Future Classroom Looks Like These days, more and more students are being driven to self-instruction\u2014either because they can\u2019t afford tuition or are simply excited about a topic. This is where e-learning comes in. If a platform could actually cater content and interaction around the individual user\u2014their speed, their interests, their location\u2014then e-learning could give them the ability to learn whatever they want, from wherever they want. If a student wants to attend Harvard business lectures but lives halfway across the country, then e-learning puts them in the room. True mobility and access to education is the future. But that doesn\u2019t mean we stop empowering our classrooms and teachers. While e-learning won\u2019t replace traditional classrooms, it will change the way we know them today. With improved resources and reduced teacher workloads, classrooms can shift to co-learning spaces. Students can arrive, learn, engage\u2014all at their own pace in a collaborative environment. And that\u2019s the true goal of education: to create the best environment for students to learn. ",

Even if we could force that to happen, would that really be what we want? The folks I\u2019ve met who champion some computer-based system for all students don\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d all students. They\u2019re imagining students of average-to-above average performance and attention who do well to sit for greater or lesser times in front of a computer, be that researching, creating, or even just listening to a teacher. This idea ignores the diversity of learners. I\u2019ve had students who: Have experienced trauma in such a way that online activities are, for whatever reason, a trigger leading to emotional explosions and breakdowns.Are too fidgety and/or distracted to sit in front of a computer for the time needed to do a lesson.Simply learn better with something more concrete than even the cutest and cleverest online manipulative.Need a greater and more immediate back-and-forth communication than online learning can generally give.Do not live in a household that works for online learning. Doesn\u2019t matter what devices the school might provide\u2014it\u2019s just not going to happen in that household.Simply prefer face-to-face interaction.One might argue that ever-evolving online methods could solve these problems, but to what end? Simply to prove that online learning can take over? To dismiss the enjoyment of being present with other humans? To solve a supposed problem? To make all students the same? Some of the best minds in the world still prefer to get together in person to learn and discuss. What\u2019s wrong with that? I do predict a happier, more organic blend of the traditional-enough classroom and online learning, but I don\u2019t think pure online learning will ever become the absolute only. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that our academic institutions will still exist due to our systems of employment. However, those who have studied or taught online realize that it is a better system than the traditional classroom. Learning online is incredibly efficient. In fact, working online, learning online, teaching online, etc. is currently the most efficient method to compartmentalize aspects of your life IF you are willing to stay motivated and be honest with yourself (and your teacher!). You cannot get lazy if you\u2019re shifting your life online: be responsible and self-motivated and enjoy the rewards and convenience. Online learning is not for those who are completing a course because it ismandatory. It is for those who are truly inspired and motivated.  Some advantages of learning online over the traditional classroom: Personal assessment before learning. A good online company or teacher should be able to test your status and pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses, helping to define your study plan and curriculum.Personal attention and feedback. In most online learning situations, it\u2019s just you and the teacher. No distractions, no repeating your classmates\u2019 errors and mistakes, no waiting for others. You get feedback with each step of the journey.Convenience. No, online learning doesn\u2019t mean you can be lazy, or watching TV in the background, it means that you can attend your class regardless of the weather, your vehicle\u2019s condition, traffic and so many other factors. If you travel for work or leisure, you can take classes from the comfort of a hotel or quiet cafe.Record and Replay. This is an advantage that many learners don\u2019t realize or take advantage of. Learning online, students can replay their lesson as many times as they\u2019d like, pausing and re-watching as they wish.Affordability! Many personal teachers and tutors charge high rates as they factor in travel time and lesson preparation. With online learning, you don\u2019t have to pay London, New York or Sydney hourly rates if your teacher is located in another part of the world. Online lessons are very often cheaper, as was in my case. My Own Story Before arriving in China and enrolling in a Mandarin Chinese language course here, I had began my Chinese learning at a community college in the USA. Unfortunately, it was too easy for me to fade into the background. I wasn\u2019t being forced to speak with the teacher each step of the way and I wasn\u2019t getting the personalized feedback that I needed. The speaking tones of Mandarin Chinese were difficult and I was repeating the mistakes of my classmates. I decided to enroll in online lessons. I first took a free online assessment test with a teacher in China. The test pinpointed my strengths and weaknesses and helped me develop a study plan. In just 30 minutes I felt like I\u2019d already make great progress. You asked about efficiency? That 30 minutes was the same as my commute to school. That intro college course I took in the classroom ended up being my last. I was making such good progress with the online lessons that I wasn\u2019t getting enough from the course to continue. Since I was saving some time, I focused on self-study through apps, websites, blogs and textbook. I took additional Mandarin Chinese classes online to help with all levels of my HSK tests. I made such great progress that I changed my life plan and moved to China to finish my degree here. Being a somewhat shy student, online learning really brought me out of my shell and got me speaking. Not just for efficiency, but also effectiveness, I can certainly recommend online learning.  ",

            "answer_text": "A blended model will emerge offering the best of both worlds to the students. And I think that\u2019s how it should be. Moving exclusively to just one model of learning is not desirable from the point of view of a child\u2019s growth. And we don\u2019t need to create a competition between online and offline teaching. And neither do we want to threaten either the teachers or the organisations which provide online learning solutions. They should complement. Let me tell you how. A teacher walks into her class and spends 30 mins in teaching Newton\u2019s third law of motion to a class of say 25 students. After the class, she opens up her Teacher\u2019s app and allocates a small 20 question test to all her students on the same topic. When the students reach home, there is a notification on their parent\u2019s phone. The notification says that their teacher had today taught Newton\u2019s third law of motion and that they have to do a test. So, as guided, the students take the test. Instantly the reports go to the teacher where she sees that out of 25 students, 5 are at 100% mastery, 10 are around 70\u201390%, 5 are at 60\u201370% and the rest are less than 50%. She immediately allocates additional tasks or video lessons to the students depending on their mastery level which students are expected to do in the next 2 days. While the teacher in the class moves on to the next task but she is continuously tracking and guiding her students via the app to build mastery over every single topic. Some students do it in 2 days, some take 5. But eventually everyone reaches a level of 100% mastery. Would this have been possible with just the offline mode of teaching? Never. The existing school ecosystem does not allow a teacher the time or the mind space to personalise learning for every child. But an in-home supplemental learning solution can genuinely complement her efforts in the class. In one of the responses, there is a mention about rural students and that they would be left behind. Rather I feel they are the one\u2019s who can benefit the most and hence come up. Yes, we will have to bridge the digital divide and I think the speed at which it is happening, days are not far when even the rural most kid in the country will be able to use digital for learning and growth. So to summarise, as a part of education ecosystem, we should derive the best of both forms of learning and build a process where online learning can support our teacher\u2019s efforts inside the classroom.

            "answer_text": "Though online learning is making in roads into our learning system yet I think even if it replaces the classroom learning it can\u2019t actually replace it. The classroom learning helps create an aura around teacher which has a magnetic effect to attract students which is not possible in online learning. Let me share one of my blogs which has some semblance with the question asked.  Over the last 10 years, since I started teaching, I came to realize the fact that we can understand abstract realities of life through creating analogies and the fascinating part of making these analogies is that they are very logical to understand. This blog is the outcome of such an analogy. I don\u2019t know why, but once in my class, I told the students to learn the art of relating two things 180 degrees out of phase (i.e. on face even if there is no logical relationship existing, try to make that relationship in order to understand the hidden meanings behind various objects) and over the years, I have started realizing the fact that if I am unable to see the relationship that does not mean that the relationship does not exist (like if I am unable to see the air that does not mean that the air does not exist). In order to see that invisible, I have to develop in myself the \u2018vision\u2019 so that I am able to see the invisible. Once in my office, one of my team member came to me and asked me to teach him management (he was MBA degree holder), I asked him to come to me the day after with few similarities and difference between donkey and magnet. He didn\u2019t turn up but I on my part thought over it and came up with the analogy, which I am sharing here with you. See for yourself how amazing it is. Both magnet and donkey pull.Donkey pulls everything, whereas magnet pulls only what is its own material.Donkey pulls double its own weight, whereas magnet pulls half of its own weight.We never hear people saying he is a donkey personality, whereas we always hear people saying has is a magnetic personality.So in order to be a Leader one needs to have the charisma of a magnetic personality to attract followers. Instead of him going to the people, people should come to him. ",

            "answer_text": "I have attended online courses which have been great and others which have had a large amount of students not finishing the course. Online studying is a great supplement for traditional learning with a teacher and live interaction between students and the teacher. For a motivated student, online courses are mostly really good. I know a lot of young people who have studied a language by internet with a great determination. Replacing schools with online courses has problems. There are a lot of students who need the help of the teacher to keep themselves motivated and to grasp the content. So, I don\u2019t believe in the total collapse of the educational system. I think the system may need to develop to become more efficient and motivating for contemporary learners, though. The digitally \u201csavant\u201d generation is very diverse and the education system needs to be able to serve all of the students: those fluent in digital literacy, those lacking the basic reading and comprehension skills, those struggling to find a place in this complex and frightening world, those talented in peculiar fields. Technology in the classroom may help in individualising the tasks and in making the lessons more interesting. But what the young people really need is interaction with caring and competent adults and with their peers. That is a key to mediate not only facts or theories but also the core of human culture as a developing, living, existentially meaningful entity. The reason for a long education years lies in the human evolution. Learning takes time. The more complex our culture the more the students need time to really learn both the tradition and the technologically new human tools and knowledge. If they are to develop a sense of character and moral integrity, most of the students need adult guidance. I am not saying some children or teens could not learn without schools. But I argue, that online education (while being necessary and important) can\u2019t replace real life connections and human interaction which I see at the heart of a fulky functional school for any age.

Over 300 lecture hours at Berkeley, Harvard and MIT are available, for free, on YouTube. MOOCs are designed to be free for participants and open to anyone, and other online learning platforms are made inexpensive for the end user. The online medium is scalable because of its reduced overhead compared with brick-and-mortar schools. Despite a record high in online enrollment, the EdX analysis conducted by MIT and Harvard revealed some surprising attrition rates. Of the learners in the study, 95 percent of students dropped their online class before getting a completion certificate. The Babson Research Study revealed that academic leaders are undecided about MOOCs as a sustainable method for offering courses, with most (45.2 percent) being neutral, and the remainder evenly split between the two opposing opinions. Less than three percent of higher education institutions currently offer a MOOC. While 69.1 percent of chief academic officers claim that online learning represents a critical part of their long-term strategy, only 9.4 percent are in the planning stages of implementing a MOOC, suggesting that other types of online education are expected to emerge in colleges and universities. You decide. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not think that everything can be taught or learned from sitting in front of a computer screen. Sometimes technology statistics and forecasted numbers would make us think that technology will someday take over the world, but there will always be a place for the classroom. The statistics that we read always give a slightly off-centered reason why e-learning, or online training or instructional design is the way of the future. That is not to say that technology-based solutions are not the way to future success, but that they are not the only means of achieving successful student learning and mastery of the content. Whilst there are many, many credible sites and resources that boast well-backed studies, there always seems to be an audience for classroom studies, students that would rather learn from a teacher they can physically watch present the materials and there will always be a vast following for things that are not electronic. For instance, I am part of a 50s pinup group. This group supports veterans as they are coming home from a war or tour. That is, I am part of a group of woman that dress in attire from the 40s and 50s and greet our veterans after a flight home. The men and women love reminiscing about \u2018those days.\u2019 It always brings a smile to their faces. Could we greet the service men and women, especially the decorated war heroes in current fashions? Of course, but oftentimes, the WW1 and WW2 vets get a chance to \u2018remember the good ole days.\u2019 Do you remember those days? What made \u2018those days\u2019 so special? I use that as an illustration because sometimes what is in someone\u2019s mind can help them recover or cope\u2026or learn. That said, there will always be a place for stand-up teaching by where there is a teacher in front of a classroom. In fact, some subjects are just better off taught or learned in-person. For instance, have you ever tried to take a pole dancing class online? How about kickboxing? How about a (boring) topic like network computing or a complex topic like biology, or animal dissection? Some subjects are too interactive to be fully grasped online. At least the basics are better off learned from an instructor that can help you physically or gauge based on your facial expressions or responses. In summary, even in the age of Youtube, Quora and many other interactive sites, thee will still be a need for and a love of that of which can be taught by a classroom instructor \u2013 regardless of the number of students or size of the classroom or facility.

One online speech class requires the kids to do public speaking in front of a group. My son's friend does this by asking a bunch of family into her living room and taking some shots and video of them sitting there. They leave. She then does her speech alone, starting, stopping, deleting, and redoing when she messes up, and turns it in. What skill are you learning about public speaking by completely avoiding actually public speaking?? My son is currently taking online physics and biochemistry. He has to take pretend beakers on the screens of fake chemicals and put them into each other. The experiments are all done on a screen, and then he has to pretend to clean up his workspace. How are you to actually see, feel, resonate with an experiment when you are playacting and cannot actually experience what it's like to add too much acid or heat up something too fast. Additonally, on a social level\u2026 much of learning is relating to peers, discussing with teachers in class, developing thoughts off what others discussed. I think classroom teaching is far superior to online in almost every instance. Online learning is like the shortcut\u2026 they way to get there without enjoying the ride or getting to see the scenery. ",

            "answer_text": "IMO, e-learning MUST displace classroom learning, and quickly.  This is most important in high school and college education.  As in any discipline, there is a scarcity of top practitioners with the skill to make topics understandable, engaging and lasting.  With exceptions, these stars understandably gravitate to school districts or colleges with the most innovative or supportive environments, generous compensation and prestigious brands.  Few budget-strapped urban schools can attract such educators, which degrades the education received by those of lesser means. To de-couple education quality from the learners' financial means, we have to make the best instructors in the world available to all who wish to learn.  That means virtualizing them or otherwise making them scalable online. The medical profession is already going down this road, enabling doctors to collaborate with specialists anywhere in the world -- in real-time.  The legal profession is taking steps in this direction, too, automating much of litigation support to enable experts in small firms to manage cases that previously would have had to been led by huge firms with armies of lawyers to do the document management. E-learning makes knowledge universally available, asynchronous, and inexpensive.   One final driver is the fact that many universities' growth is constrained by the lack of urban real estate.  A couple of years ago, Business Week's cover story was about how universities in densely-populated cities, such as Columbia (NYC), Stanford (SF) and Georgetown (DC), not otherwise known for their technical innovation but unable to grow physically, were forced to embrace e-learning because of this imperative.

This year UCLA, Stanford and Berkeley. We have published a full report (87 pages) on this tour in French. The English version will be available in February (a Japanese too) and I will let you know. Nowhere people imagine a full online education and there are two main reasons for that: Students as well as professors believe that the campus experience is important both for study as well as for the social aspects for everybody experience to grow up. They agree about online courses but in a blended form.Online study is too expensive. It costs more to build online courses than to deliver the course in front of an audience. To decrease its price it would be necessary to standardize courses and to deliver the same ones in many universities. This might be a solution for third class for profit colleges but will never be accepted by a vast majority of students and teachers.Study has a cost. The point is to accept that, at least, a part of the cost must be paid by the nation because the nation profits from the education of its citizens. Otherwise why would the US so easily invite foreigners to pursue a PhD in the US? Big providers such as Coursera wanted to become a virtual university. They failed and now work in the different direction together with the universities. Without them Coursera would bee nothing. Udacity turned towards permanent education which is an other field and know they may complement but not replace university education. ",

But considering e-learning as a replacement of live classroom would not be correct to say. E-learning has its own list of benefits like: It saves time and money.Offers Access To Updated Content.E-learning leads to better retention.Lectures Can Be Taken Any Number Of Times.E-learning is consistent.E-learning is scalable.But on the other hand live classrooms education also has a long list of benefits: Students can ask their doubts in classroom and clarify them at the same time.Students can counter question the teacher, why this is happening or what is the reason behind this?Live classrooms develop a regularity in studies.Apart from concept students learn punctuality and understand their responsibility in class.Students learn to live in mixed environment of classroom.In person contact with teachers and fellow classmates are very important for future reference.Live classrooms education is not just about subjects and topics, instead it is an overall education which teach lessons for life to students. No doubt, e-learning has improved the standard of teaching and education but is still incapable to create live classroom kind of environment. E-learning has made a significant contribution to educate students all over but it should not be seen as a replacement of conventional live classroom education as both the modes of education are different and successful in their own purpose.

            "answer_text": "Ever since the pandemic prevailed, the Education system has taken every precautionary measure to keep education and learning going. With the ongoing situation, it seems that the online education system might remain our savior for some time in future. Although, there are reasons that it cannot fully replace physical entities of schools, colleges and universities. -\tStudents are not in favor What is the point of delivering something when your audience is not interested in it? Students have been reported not in favor of the online education system. They are of the view that they do not fully grasp lectures through online mediums and fail to perform well in tests and examinations. -\tCost of courses are still the same Although everything has gone online and faculties can now deliver lectures at the convenience of their home, education institutes still do not budge at all. They are firm in keeping the cost same as before which can be the major reason for the online education system to crash. -\tLesser supervision Teachers are unable to supervise everyone on online mediums. If we talk about primary schools, we know there are always few kids in the class who need more attention to keep them on track. This is becoming harder to do through online schooling. -\tRemote area\u2019s students are being deprived of many facilities As much charm as there is to an online education system, it is not an equal opportunity for everyone. In many countries, there are students living in remote areas and are surviving without internet facilities. No internet means no online schooling. This could lead to a lower literacy rate in countries. -\tInternet interruptions In our daily life, we face issues with the internet several times. This causes interruptions in learning and attending classes. Even if you have a high-speed internet connection, you still face technical issues form your internet provider\u2019s end. This could cause online learning system to fail. With these ongoing problems that students face, it is hard to say that online schooling can take over the offline schooling system. However, if these get worked on for the betterment of students and learning systems, it might do wonders in future. ",

            "answer_text": "Not yet. Online learning has a lot of advantages. It's convenient, it's at worst cheap and often free, and you can listen as many times to a section until you understand it. You can go at your own pace, you can limit the distractions around you... it's pretty great. However, it also has some disadvantages. Some of these are incidental and structural, and some of these are fundamental. Let's first address the issues that aren't going away. One obvious thing you lack is a teacher who can answer your questions. Not everyone approaches the same problems the same ways, and the lecture may make incorrect assumptions about your knowledge. For earnest and diligent students [1] this can easily be resolved by asking a question in class, but maybe not in an online course. Next, you lack classmates. While in some ways this can be a plus, discussing the material can help reinforce it in a variety of ways, and you're missing out on that. Finally, for some people, a screen leeches their brains. I'm a computer scientist, and I can't stand reading from a computer for any great length of time. Not everyone can learn well in that format. Next, there are incidental issues. For one, how can anyone verify that you understand the work? Tests and projects can be awful, but they're better than nothing. And how do you verify the quality of E-Courses? Colleges are known entities and accredited, there's no equivalent yet for E-Courses. The second set of issues can be permanently dealt with, but the first set will always need to be handled. All of them are roadblocks to replacing a school day with online learning. [1] Big assumption there! ",

One of her classes has over 300 students and many sit on the steps just to hear the lecture. Think that form of delivery is better than online training? I would love to see some reasonable comments back defending it. \u201cBlended\u201d courses are popular with Colleges. Some online, some classroom and the availability to meet with a professor as needed. What are the benefits to online? People can absorb the material based on their schedule, not one put out by the College. Remote living\u2026..now people can have access to quality courses no matter where you live. Missed a class\u2026.ok, with online you should never miss a class, just login and get caught up. As for a college\u2026no instructor or classroom costs.

            "answer_text": "When TV came out, Hollywood was concerned that it would replace the movies. And it did\u2026sort of. When was the last time you went to a movie and saw a newsreel or an episode of a serial? Movies changed. Some changes were purely aesthetic: widescreen format. We lost the serials and the newsreels. More recently, movie theaters have started becoming destinations, with high-quality food and recliner seats. Education is going to go through the same process. We\u2019ll lose some things: the lecture is likely to go first, because a 1-hour lecture is the same, whether it\u2019s in person or online. But the personal interaction? While you can get some of that through a videoconference call, that just means the classroom gets dispersed; it doesn\u2019t eliminate the classroom. (Put it in another perspective: one million people can watch a lecture at the same time. But you can\u2019t have a discussion with one million participants) Even more problematic are the laboratory sciences. For example, you can read all about performing a titration on Wikihow: How to Perform a Titration You can follow direction on YouTube:  But sooner or later, you have to turn the stopcock on the burette\u2026and you can\u2019t do that remotely.

            "answer_text": "We already have a 100% online option for four years of high school in South Carolina, and it is quite successful. Certainly it must be an improvement over the television courses that dominated my first two undergraduate years at the University of Minnesota. The top students are invariably self-taught until they get to the higher tiers of education, and even there graduate students must often do it mostly by themselves. Before public schools people could learn quite well and the lingering justification for classrooms will always be babysitting. But we are very close to an era when our communication with machine intelligence will be far more productive than communication with human beings. Even today the top chess players have to play intelligent machines to learn how to play really well. I also predict that people will prefer the 1:1 approach of hyperintelligent machines, machines that closely gauge every step of progress. When these master non-verbal communication, there will be no question here. But without academic or technical jobs, maybe people will not want to learn so much. ",

            "answer_text": "On-line classes appeal to a specific group of people. Universities have been offering on-line degrees for a while. Most students who are forced into on-line learning will adapt because they know it is short term and might be their only option. My son just finished his last year of college. He did not enjoy any of the on-line classes he had to take. You would think the flexibility they offer would be helpful, but he likes the structure of having to physically go to the classroom. It made him more proactive with deadlines. He also preferred meeting with peers in person, especially for group work. My daughter began her teaching career as an on-line instructor for USC. She is now at her third university, and was hired for her expertise in this area. She teaches both in person and on-line. Her in person classes full up immediately, while her on line classes take longer. She teaches in a location where distance learning would be optimal for many students. Her face to face students score higher on exams, have a higher graduation rate, and survey as much happier than her on-line students. My own experience, being suddenly thrust into becoming an on-line with about an hours notice, has been an overwhelming response from my students that they truly want to go back into the physical classroom. There is more to teaching than just offering curriculum. If it was that easy, we could just pick up books and learn, not even needing a computer. No, learning needs to be in the right environment. For some that environment is digital, but for most it is in-person. Equate it to this: You can listen to music on a hi-fedility record player and hear the beautiful tones and voice of a singer. You can watch a movie of an opera on you television. But, you can not replace the experience of dressing up and going to theater to see the opera performed live. ",

            "answer_text": "I've experienced bricks and mortar university and distance learning through the Open University. DL isn't quite the same as e-learning, because much of the material is in physical formats and many modules have face to face tutorials, although they aren't mandatory. It would be fair to say that you won't get far as a distance learner without access to a PC or laptop, but this is also true of a campus student. The latter might be on campus often enough to get by with the machines at the library, but given how busy academic libraries get, I wouldn't depend on it. My academic background is in the humanities, which means I don't have to use a lab and can work at home, in cafes, etc. Electronic libraries are wonderful things and have saved me a huge amount of time and money. But not everything is in electronic formats and for those of us in humanities fields, sometimes, you just can't beat time in the stacks. For that, you have to be on campus, at least occasionally. You might also want to meet tutors, supervisors and other students and just soak up the experience of being in an academic environment. You can also use the leisure facilities, get a coffee and maybe save yourself some money by getting your printing off done at the library. If you never visit a campus, you may sometimes feel as if you are getting all the hard work of being a student, the deadlines and pressure, without any of the fun. When I applied to do my master's, I decided to stay with the distance learning programme, but with a university a short train ride away, so I could spend time on campus. It worked really well and I'd recommend it to anyone who can't be a campus student. ",

Im sure those would be the golden days for everyone. someone would still remember their teachers that\u2019s because back then the methods our teachers use to teach us and we would be scared of our teachers too and lot of tuitions before the exams. Everyone around us brings out an environment where education is important and without it we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. Now , everything has improvised, technology has developed and it brings education straight to our homes where we wouldn\u2019t even require to attend schools or classes most of the time. Byju\u2019s doesnt really changes anything infact byjus converts your concepts in textbook into videos. Now consider a scenario where i present a textbook of 500 pages and ask him to study which would take him a week to study or more than that for him to understand the concepts but on the other hand if i give him a tab and tell him that it would only take 10 hours for you to complete a subject, the kid would go for the tab. I would recommend you to follow the old conventional classroom teaching as it helps us to mentally prepare our minds for examinations and use byju\u2019s just a tool and not to completely dependent on that. Let the kids create memories and enjoy their moments when they are at school I still miss my school days ! ",

As technology grows, some of our offline day-to-day activities transcend to online, including schooling and education in general. It is already happening, with an increased rate due to our current limitations. This is a view for education in 2050. I think, with the pandemic, we\u2019ll get there faster. More changes will follow - for example, if most of the education happens online, how do we prevent exam fraud, plagiarism and other academic integrity issues? This can be prevented with behavioral typing biometrics products that verify learners\u2019 identities like TypingDNA. Through the use of AI/ML, TypingDNA\u2019s behavioral typing biometrics verify learners\u2019 identities in order to prevent academic fraud in a passive and non-invasive way.  Though I work at TypingDNA, I can say for sure that we offer unique key features & capabilities: Built for a UX friendly student experience Automated and frictionless - Eases the authentication of students and simplifies the course administration with our passive 2nd factor.Privacy/Security - only captures users typing patterns and is tremendously less invasive than facial or voice recognitionIntegrable and customizable Integrates with existing LMS\u2019s and includes customizable risk thresholds to suit security needs.Versatile and cost-effectiveWorks with any keyboard, cross device (desktop + web), and in any browser.Compliant with regulationsHow it Works Simple enrollment - During students' course enrollment, their typing pattern is recorded on a short phrase (30 characters).Frictionless verification - before and/or during and/or after assessments, a periodic popup ask users to type their short phrase and a match score between the new typing pattern and the previous samples is given.Quick authentication - Instant flagging when the matching score released is above the predetermined risk threshold.",

            "answer_text": "Covid-19 has accelerated the timeline of acceptance of online learning in Indian education system. Prior to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, there were very few educational institutes that were relying on online education for academics. The lockdown has left no other options for educational organizations other than accepting digital technology in education. If we look at the broader perspective, it is a welcome change that we are observing in the Indian education ecosystem. The traditional classrooms focussed more on blackboard learning that involved only a teacher transferring huge loads of knowledge on students in the form of notes. This form of learning is usually unidirectional in which students have little to do. It also gets monotonous and students often lose interest (That\u2019s how backbenchers come into existence). Online Learning, or say Digital Learning has opened doors to infinite opportunities for students. A student can learn at his own pace. Explore different topics as per his interests. It also provides a collaborative platform wherein a number of students can work together and exchange information to get better and conclusive results in learning. If you have read through my answer, you can clearly see that there are many pros and very little cons to online learning. However, nothing ever is perfect and so does Online Learning. There are a number of limitations due to which Online Learning can never COMPLETELY replace classroom learning. For example, lack of internet, non-availability of resource, inadequate monitoring of students, etc. are some of the cons that are associated with Online Learning. However, thankfully many Indian EdTech companies are coming up with comprehensive and all-inclusive solutions that aid both classroom and online learning. Some of them are EduComp, Digital Teacher, Ebix, Cohesive Technologies, Globus Infocom, etc. Among them, Globus Infocom has emerged as a really trustworthy and innovative Make in India brand that provides not only learning solutions but also an interactive learning software (language software or digital content for K-12) as well as world class infrastructural facilities like student PCs, furniture, air conditioners, flooring, blinds, curtains, CCTV Cameras, etc. ",

With proper production and organization (I don\u2019t see the technology there yet), some customization will be possible and the cost per student is far less. As with traditional classes, the teaching only works if the students are evaluated properly and often. Think tests or quizzes or surveys for understanding. These \u2018tests\u2019 don\u2019t have to be for a grade, only to show the student did learn the material. The current way we think of E-learning is akin to Youtube videos which does not work*. E-learning will take a lot of time to make on class. More than traditional preparation. But this one class can then be used to teach far more students\u2026Until the material is obsolete and needs to be redone. If the material is corrected and updated too often, then E-learning for that class might not reach a cost benefit. I think E-learning should be and can be a large part of a class. The term I hear is \u2018flipped classrooms\u2019. The students watch the lectures or learn the material outside of class and during class time, ask questions and do \u2018homework\u2019. This only works if the total number of hours is similar to what was expected in traditional classes. If a teacher uses a flipped classroom to push more work and/or more hours on students, then it won\u2019t work. So \u2018homework\u2019 itself needs to be adapted and changed, possibly shortened. - .*Youtube does not work: I have learned how to do specific wood carving techniques with Youtube lessons. I have learned more academic material as well. But I really wanted to learn and was able to make myself concentrate on relatively concrete lessons. I don\u2019t think I could absorb and think about abstract philosophy while watching only videos. ",

The lecture videos can be recorded too and he can watch the video as many times until he is well through the topic.Hefty fees: The institutions have made a business out of education. Hopefully the fees will be reduced, if everyone moves to online education.",

However just like brick and mortar stores still survives (and retain a larger share of the overall spend), live classroom education will be with us for a long time. The  low stakes, highly commoditized segments of education will be the first to go online e.g. prep courses, compliance, certification, etc. Traditionally these areas are more suitable for self paced learning and very suitable for elearning using even the most simplest elearning tools. Some education domains are more sutiable for online instruction e.g. programming, IT, language learning, etc. They will replace classroom education more quickly. The target student segment are easy converts and lack of suitable platforms for elearning is no longer a constraint.  In addition, classroom education targeted for 15-45, think higher ed or professional is more likely get replaced by elearning. ",

I often argue that online learning can be more effective than classroom teaching because well-designed online learning requires interaction by everyone. There is a myth that classroom learning is more interactive but in a class of, say, 30 people, perhaps five of them are really interacting and the other 25 can be totally disengaged. That said, there is a lot of poorly designed online learning and many learners prefer the social interaction available in the classroom (although there is very little in most classrooms - there is still the illusion of it). Many people also prefer the structure and scheduling of classroom learning. Most learning organizations now (both formal education and corporate training) are providing a mix of the two and I believe that will continue for the foreseeable future. ",

Educators, Teachers, Schools, Parents and Students, everyone is wondering would physical schools be replaced with only online education. I do not think so. My view is that there would be hybrid business models wherein schools would tie up with online tutoring and education companies to complement the physical classes. So it is very important for all students to get comfortable with online education and take up tutoring classes with any renowned website. It is important that the website provided 1:1 private and customized live online classes to students. One such website that has been in existence since 2008 (12+ years) is eTutorWorld. You can read about them online on other review websites as well and see that they are not in this business to make money. They have only graduate and post graduate tutors (no inexperienced youngsters). What is the best part is that they offer a free trial lesson with no credit card required for the same. So take the trial and evaluate yourself before spending even a single dollar.  ",

            "answer_text": "Q - Can e-learning replace live classroom education? How and why? Yes, it can, but it\u2019s a bit more complicated than this. We should break the learning phase into 3 steps - pre-class, class and post-class. Pre-class step is when the student sees the subject (or question or problem) for the first time, understands the issue, and maybe gets some background. Sometimes we need to explain why it\u2019s an issue which we bother to think about or need to solve, or why it\u2019s not trivial as we may think. We then may raise few ways to approach and solve the issue, eliminate few and come up with a way (or several ways) which is/are good enough. The class step is the interesting one. The student may want to discuss, debate or ask questions, maybe disagree with what was said in the previous step, hear other opinions, etc. The post-class is what we call practice. Now, the 1st and 3rd steps can (and actually should) be delivered remotely through e-learning. With the proper engaging and interactive e-learning methods, we can make it interesting, fun and even personally adjusted to the student. There must be many little tests in the way, making sure that the student understands everything that was \u201csaid\u201d, and we leave no knowledge gaps or misunderstood areas. These tests do not have to be the usual scary exam (and no, calling it \u201cevaluation\u201d or other name will not make it more beloved). It\u2019s a nice interaction, never more than 1\u20132 together, which does not look like a test. A tutor (teacher) must be in the loop - using technology he/she can review the answers to those tests, see if there are areas that many students misunderstood and students that are struggling. Each failure to fully understand a piece gets additional explanation (built-in the material, no human involvement). The basic idea - we do not leave any student to misunderstand any part of the learned material. The middle step is where communication between students and teacher, and among students, is important. If we can have a physical classroom, that\u2019s when they all meet together. If this is not an option, they \u201cmeet\u201d remotely, using technology - small students\u2019 groups between themselves, and a weekly students-teacher virtual meeting. The students already know the material, and the teacher knows whats areas of the subject are less understood and need more explanation. There are tons of details which I left behind, but these are the basics. Hope I made myself clear. Thanks for reading ",

Not just between teachers and students, but also those between teachers, parents, and the wider community. That comes down to good online teachers. Teachers who can build a sense of community in a digital environment and stay connected without face to face contact. I think with coronavirus many teachers are now finding out just how challenging this is - but it can be done.

But rather than compare and contrast the two, it is more helpful to consider how each promotes learning and to think about what kinds of learning situations work best.

I develop training in an industry in which people spend much of their days staring at a radar screen, and most of the training is in person or in the classroom, because that is most effective. The e-learning is reserved for updates to software, refresher courses and practicing what has already been learned. While in high school I worked in a learning lab for students who were performing poorly in courses or needed a course that was required and didn\u2019t have the time for the class. The students who needed a course, but didn\u2019t have time due to a heavy load (AP, IB or performing arts classes) usually completed the required e-learning of the course in speech or economics easily even if they didn\u2019t really like the subject. They knew how to learn on their own. For the students performing poorly, the e-learning simply didn\u2019t work well. ",

New generations are fast and they don\u2019t want to be stuck in any places. For that reason, companies and institutions have had to be also agile and be ready to create new strategies that allow them to keep the employees or students. Would eLearning really replace classroom programs? I don\u2019t think we are at that moment yet. We know for sure that eLearning strategies have been taken into consideration to survive and stay in the market. Virtual classroom has been one of those strategies because it lets students access their courses anywhere, anytime. It can be as good as a classroom program. Even some studies say that virtual classroom helps institutions to engage their learners and also increase their retention. I\u2019m not saying that eLearning replace definitely classroom programs, but is a great way to complement and improve courses and learning. ",

Here, multi-dimensional, means to motivate the students for activities such as planning how to approach a given learning task, monitoring comprehension, and evaluating progress toward the completion of a task.  Adaptive learning tools are dime a dozen now a days., Knowre, Mathspace, Knewton tools, \u2026.. The software is great at delivering content, assessing prior knowledge, and dividing complex knowledge into manageable pieces, but it is not good at classroom climate, goal setting, metacognition, motivation, and organizing knowledge around key features. Both the software based on artificial intelligent and qualified teachers work in tandem, they can certainly make a splash and complement each other. Learning experience can be beautiful, and who knows our fun seeking brain may start loving this thing of beauty!  The answer could be Yes and No, considering the case of Urban areas(Developed) it could be effective, where it is needed the most the ruler areas(Developing) it would surely take some time. The reason is quite simple as the K12 e-learning is quit reluctant to change. ",

As far an untraditional learning goes, online education can also be a good change for those leaving the traditional classroom and considering home schooling. While many of these programs require tuition/payments, public online schools are tuition free. Though online education or e-learning is very effective and rising in popularity, traditional classrooms can embrace technology- and online education certainly exists so effectively because of traditional classrooms.

Learning from other countries mistake, India is not gonna do this. In fact recently, class 10th and 12th exams got cancelled up. Schools and colleges are making this method effective because they dont have any other choice but to conduct the classes online. In my opinion, not before October the schools are going to open. This whole time period can't be wasted. So yes, until the schools get back to its regular functioning they have to promote online learning. Teachers are getting trained so that they are able to conduct examination too. There are many blogs related to online learning and of course it is a fun learning method for kids. Reading more blogs can make you understand the situation even. Suggesting like Edu4sure where blogs are provided and hence these blogs can be read by anyone as its not complicated. ALL THE BEST. ",

Simply, in the new education echo system where e-learning is included, there will be two types of education. The online and the live. The live will be more about interaction, brainstorming, experimenting, demonstrating, creating- the type of creations that cannot be done online.Because of the availability of e-learning live classroom can actually find more time to go back to basic things like drawing, sculpting, carpentry and sewing for example. Not to mention dance, and drama and other types of social experiences. ",

For one thing, human rapport is much better in person than online. This may change in the future if VR or other technologies become (much) better. For another, certain activities at university require substantial equipment which may not be feasible to access in a virtual manner. This would concern lab-heavy fields like biology, chemistry, applied physics, etc. Finally, even if e-learning becomes a substantial part of a university, the fact that physical space is scarce will (in my opinion) always make it valuable, people will want to physically attend if they can.
