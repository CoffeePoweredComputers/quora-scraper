            "answer_text": "o Energy and transport economy becomes 95% renewable. Batteries replace gas peaking entirely. Every coal and nuclear plant will close. Most gas powered base load plants will close. o Electric Short Take Off (soccer field) aircraft disrupt airlines business and revolutionizes short to medium distance transport o Virtual reality completely merges offices thousands of mile apart. Same with nightclubs and entrainment. One can attend a concert, go to a British pub or Disneyland with little or no travel o Auto Drive cars will be in widespread use on good rural roads, but with limited and cautious use in cities. This will disrupt airlines too. o Science will open up from being a closed, impenetrable, almost medieval system to something very different. It will require reproducibility, publish its papers free to everyone, and make every paper accessible (in its use of language, content, and freedom from jargon) to all. School children will study the latest papers created in physics, biology, medicine, and other sciences just minutes after publication. Science will start to remove its cultural biases, which are substantial, after its methods repeatedly fail to find answers to hard questions. o By 2030 we will finally have low cost to orbit - $100 per pound, with $10 per pound in sight o The oceans will be mapped in detail thru a huge, expensive effort, with 1 meter resolution or better o 3D (additive) manufacturing will become dominate. o Robots will play basketball against each other, but in clumsy style. Children will strip the ball from a robot. o The impossibility of a Tech Singularity will become obvious o Quantum computers and algorithms will be shown to be impractical and maybe impossible for real applications o High tech currency (Bitcoins, et all) will loose their luster, being easy for hackers to manipulate. Humans will be needed to safeguard transactions, not code. o AI will become a huge part of the economy, with AI systems everywhere. But the more its goes into real use, the more obvious will its deficiencies become. o Biology and Life will seem more mysterious than ever, with a comprehensive understanding seen as centuries away. o The risk of species loss will start to reduce, with great efforts to protect the natural world. Natural environments will be linked in North America, Europe, and increasingly in Asia, Africa, and South America o Desktop and mobile computers will merge, but the smartphone will be seen as a quaint relic. In its place will be the \u201cubiquitous computer\u201d available free for all, and located everywhere. o Hard standards for transparent software will come. Code and comments will be made available for public or personal devices. Nearly everything will be open source. Those who try to \u201cprotect\u201d distributed software will fail, as reverse compilers and reverse software modeling tools will come out. The law will make that legal for software that is made public. o Software will become a branch of mathematics. It is now a haphazard, jerry rigged, ad hoc system without clear math properties. o Real world math will become ever more important - but this will not be conventional math. o The \u201cFree Economy\u201d will emerge. Free food and even free housing will come. o Organic indoor agriculture, with very high productivity, will start to predominate. That will open up land for the natural world. o The \u201cCo-\u201d movement will flourish, with Co-houseing, Co-operative ventures, Intentional communities, and the like. o Large enclosed winter and summer environments will come. Winter crazed Norway will have a year round winter playground. Other northern areas will have kilometer sized tropical resorts. Florida will have frozen lakes and snowball areas. This gets powered with sun or wind. o The first use of ballistic airline transport will be in sight. That promises 30 minute flights form New York to Tokyo o The ICBM will become obsolete. Hard anti-ICBM defenses will predominate. US cities are well protected now, but the defense are classified. That will become open knowledge by 2030. One remaining problem - short range missile strikes from subs and drones. o The \u201cCreative Culture\u201d will be central, and not just in cities, but also rural areas now linked to cites by short take off aircraft and VR. Just about everyone will be a creative professional. o Hard college credit, with high standards, will be granted for real life experience and independent learning. Jokes about a \u201cWikipedia Degree\u201d will get taken seriously. Edit Viral computer: Living bio viruses that can execute the x86 architecture will be developed. Although slow, there could be billions of viral cpu\u2019s available. See Does DNA have the equivalent of IF-statements, WHILE loops, or function calls? How about GOTO? Computer user Bill of Rights: No spying, lying, cheating, trespassing or stealing by computers or their software. Software as a refined machine: Software will be developed to perform like a well built Ferrari race car. The code will be developed with, alternate math and design approaches, and trade studies, just like aircraft components are designed. Code will have specific math properties, simple enough to be analyzed by theorem proving software. Established math properties: Software built in 2030 will be very difficult to hack. The code may have Quantum resilience - made unhackable by Quantum computers. see: /www.wired.com/2015/09/tricky-encryption-stump-quantum-computers/ New Operating systems: Brand new operating systems will spring out of nowhere, leaving Apple, Google, and MS in the dust. This will usher in a new era, with major disruptions in software. The new makers will jump on software theorem proving tech fast yielding high reliability software that is easy to use, and easy to design. New killer App: Portable Therapist. People will carry a portable therapist with them - a software program running on a lap top or smartphone. The choice of therapy will be: Adlerian therapy, anger management art therapy attachment-based therapy Ayurvedic psychotherapy body-centered psychotherapy bodywork brief dynamic therapy CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) counselling couples therapy creative arts therapies DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) drama therapy dreamwork EFT (emotionally focused therapy) existential / Daseinsanalysis experiential focusing Gestalt grief counselling group therapy hypnosis / hypnotherapy Imago Therapy Instant accuracy checking: software will listen to political speeches and do accuracy assessment within 30 seconds.

            "answer_text": " Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in all of human history. By 2030 the average person in the U.S. will have 4.5 packages a week delivered with flying drones. They will travel 40% of the time in a driverless car, use a 3D printer to print hyper-individualized meals, and will spend most of their leisure time on an activity that hasn\u2019t been invented yet. The world will have seen over 2 billion jobs disappear, with most coming back in different forms in different industries, with over 50% structured as freelance projects rather than full-time jobs. Over 50% of today\u2019s Fortune 500 companies will have disappeared, over 50% of traditional colleges will have collapsed, and India will have overtaken China as the most populous country in the world. Most people will have stopped taking pills in favor of a new device that causes the body to manufacture it\u2019s own cures. Space colonies, personal privacy, and flying cars will all be hot topics of discussion, but not a reality yet. Most of today\u2019s top causes, including climate change, gay liberation, and abortion, will all be relegated to little more than footnotes in Wikipedia, and Wikipedia itself will have lost the encyclopedia wars to an upstart company all because Jimmy Wales was taken hostage and beheaded by warring factions in the Middle East over a controversial entry belittling micro religions. Our ability to predict the future is an inexact science. The most accurate predictions generally come from well-informed industry insiders about very near term events. Much like predicting the weather, the farther we move into the future, the less accurate our predictions become. So why do we make them? In the segments below, I\u2019ll make a series of 33 provocative predictions about 2030, and how different life will be just 17 years in the future. I will also explain why predictions are important, even when they are wrong. \u201cOur greatest motivations in life come from NOT knowing the future.\u201d Why Understanding the Future is Important Ignorance is a valuable part of the future. If we knew the future we would have little reason to vote in an election, host a surprise party, or start something new. Once a future is known, we quickly lose interest in trying to influence it. For this reason, our greatest motivations in life come from NOT knowing the future. So why, as a futurist, do I spend so much time thinking about the future? Very simply, since no one has a totally clear vision of what lies ahead, we are all left with degrees of accuracy. Anyone with a higher degree of accuracy, even by only a few percentage points, can achieve a significant competitive advantage. \"Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in all of human history.\" The Power of Prediction If I make the prediction that \u201cBy 2030 over 90% of all crimes will be solved through video and other forms of surveillance,\u201d a forecast like that causes several things to happen. First, you have to decide if you agree that a certain percent of crimes will be solved that way. If so, it forces you to think about how fast the surveillance industry is growing, how invasive this might be, and whether privacy concerns might start to shift current trends in the other direction. More importantly, it forces you to consider the bigger picture, and whether this is a desirable future. If it reaches 90%, how many police, judges, and lawyers will be out of a job as a result of this? Will this create a fairer justice system, a safer society, or a far scarier place to live? Please keep this in mind as we step through the following predictions. \"Risk factors will increase exponentially!\" 33 Dramatic Predictions By 2030 over 80% of all doctor visits will have been replaced by automated exams.

Details here.\"Our children's children, who haven't even been born yet, are counting on you!\" Final Thoughts Reading through the prediction above you will likely have experiences a number of thoughts ranging from agreement, to amusement, to confusion, to total disagreement. As with most predictions, some will be correct and others not. But the true value in this list will come from giving serious consideration to each of them and deriving your own conclusions. If you were expecting me to aggressively defend all these predictions, then this column will certainly disappoint you. It has been a lifetime journey for me to formulate my thoughts about the future, but there are far too many variables to build a defensible case for any of them. That said, I would love to hear your thoughts. What\u2019s missing, too aggressive, or simply misguided? Sometimes my crystal ball is far too fuzzy, so I\u2019d love to hear what ideas come to mind.
