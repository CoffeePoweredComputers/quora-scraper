            "answer_text": "Paint Technology books are rare to come across as far as my experience goes. From the link mentioned below I take you are an HBTI student, the easiest and obvious ways for you to get a hand on those books are : To go to XEROX POINT. Almost each and every book concerned with the syllabus can be had from there.If you are lucky enough you may find some of the books in central library.Our department also maintains a small library (In the UG Lab), you can have your book issued from there.Or you can ask your seniors for their book and have the required sections photocopied.Also, finding the original published copy of these books in market is a tedious task I warn you.
