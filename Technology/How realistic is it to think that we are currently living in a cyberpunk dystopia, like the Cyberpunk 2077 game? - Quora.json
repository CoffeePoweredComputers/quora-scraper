            "answer_text": "We are, if you\u2019re taking it from the perspective of the people who were living 50 years ago who are alive today, which of course, is quite a few people. 50 years ago was 1970. Now, this was a time where despite the Cold War and other forms of crises, the economy throughout the decade seemed to be basically booming. It was great. That\u2019s one difference to the constantly shifting economy nowadays. In the 70s, people didn\u2019t have to worry as much about information as now. Now, our information is constantly being shared with all kinds of third parties, sold off quite frequently to other third parties. And due to breaches in security across the Internet, we\u2019re effectively putting our information, willingly, in a digital warzone where it could be accessed and stolen by an attacker. In the 70s, people never had to worry about hackers and careless corporations. Back then, there was much more honour, more face to face contact, and less sharing of information. Everything was quick to the cut, straight and narrow, no deception, no strings attached. Unless you were somehow talking to a Soviet spy. ",

            "answer_text": "Not very, not yet. I think we may be well on our way to living in a cyberpunk world but we are not quite there yet. Sure, there are signs like the power of multinational corporations but they fall short of the raw power to openly defy governments (though admittedly that gap grows smaller every day it seems). We have private prisons but we don't yet have private police on the same scale that Cyberpunk does. The style over substance aesthetic of cyberpunk, exists in our world in some ways but not quite to the level it does in cyberpunk. Our tech fall way short of cyberpunk as far as human modification but current science shows we are right on the crux of going full cyberpunk by mid century. We are close. Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the table top RPG Cyberpunk (1988) and its more well known follow up Cyberpunk 2020. Like other properties in the genre these games were set in the time in which we currently live (Akria and Blade Runner are both set in 2019, for example). As things stand not it's not so much that the futures these settings portrayed were wrong so much as they were probably premature. In another 20 years I could imagine Google or its descendant might tell China to go get stuffed rather than kowtowing, I can damage to the environment getting worse, I can see capitalism getting to the point that the individual becomes worth far less than they are in 2020. So no, I don't think we are currently in a cyberpunk world, but we are well on our way and surely have some of the components of such a world locked down while falling short in other key ways. ",
