            "answer_text": "I was A2A, \u201cDoesn't anyone else think we need a technology bridge?\u201d Based on helpful Question Comments by Muthigani Kiaira, I understand this question to be about technology that can provide appropriate connectivity between individuals and the world around them. I\u2019ve suggested in other places that personality simulators could do many of the things that I think the OP has in mind. I do think it would be helpful if we could feed information about ourselves, our knowledge, and our goals into a program that would then interact with the world when we became incapacitated or just want to do other things for a while. As the OP says, we have lots of technology that we can use, for example, to pay our bills, to collect interesting news items, to schedule our days, to plan our trips, \u2026 My \u201ctechnology bridge\u201d would need to have information about me and also be able to use all these programs. I can use my computer(s) and the internet to use all these tools. So my bridge needs to be able to use the internet. I think the OP\u2019s idea of letting the program continue to build its simulation of me is an interesting one. That way, for instance, the thousands of Quora answers that I used to train the program could be continuously and automatically updated as I write more. Perhaps it could point out contradictions in my thinking. I can imagine getting a email from VirtualEd saying, \u201cYou said \u2026 over here and \u2026 over there. Do yo realize that they are contradictory?\u201d :-) ",
