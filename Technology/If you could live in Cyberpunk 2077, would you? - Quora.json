Even if I\u2019m guaranteed a cushy well-paid corporate job I can easily see myself devolving into Patrick Bateman from \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d out of sheer boredom.  All the other options are worse - slave away at some factory, office or farm, or be a hobo without even a shotgun to your name. Either way, life is likely to be nasty, brutish, and short. I\u2019ll stay where I am, thanks. ",
