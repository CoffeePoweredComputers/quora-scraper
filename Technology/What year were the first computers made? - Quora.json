            "answer_text": "Ohhh this is a hard one. Most people will say in 1946 with the advent of ENIAC, but that could be seen as wrong basis the history of computing: Pre-20th century  The Ishango bone Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. The use counting rods is one example.  The Chinese Suanpan (\u7b97\u76d8) (the number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408) The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.  The ancient Greek-designed Antikythera mechanism, dating between 150 and 100 BC, is the world's oldest analog computer. The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog \"computer\", according to Derek J. de Solla Price. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later. Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b in the early 11th century. The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gearr-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD. The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation. The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.  A slide rule The slide rule was invented around 1620\u20131630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft. In the 1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automata) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically \"programmed\" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, and still operates. The tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers. First computing device  A portion of Babbage's Difference engine. Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the \"father of the computer\", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand \u2013 this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906. Analog computers  Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879\u201381 During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers. The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin. The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education (control systems) and aircraft (slide rule). Digital computers  Electromechanical By 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.  Replica of Zuse's Z3, the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical) computer. Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer. In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer. The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5\u201310 Hz. Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design), using a binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time. The Z3 was Turing complete. Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits Purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes. In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942, he first \"automatic electronic digital computer\". This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.  Colossus, the first electronic digital programmable computing device, was used to break German ciphers during World War II. During World War II, the British at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes. To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus. He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus. After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944 and attacked its first message on 5 February. Colossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer. It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1,500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2,400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process.  ENIAC was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army. The U.S.-built ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was Turing-complete. Like the Colossus, a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Modern computers Concept of modern computer The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper, On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called \"Universal Computing machine\" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine. Stored programs  A section of the Manchester Baby, the first electronic stored-program computer Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine. With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper. In 1945, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report \"Proposed Electronic Calculator\" was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in 1945. The Manchester Baby was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948. It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device. lthough the computer was considered \"small and primitive\" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer. As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1. The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer. Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February 1951. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam. In October 1947, the directors of British catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in April 1951 nd ran the world's first regular routine office computer job. Transistors  A bipolar junction transistor The bipolar transistor was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the \"second generation\" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955, built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. Integrated circuits The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit. The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952. The first practical ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor. Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958. In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as \"a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated\". Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby. His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium. This new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the microprocessor. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed and realized by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor at Intel. Mobile computers With the continued miniaturization of computing resources, and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s. The same developments that spurred the growth of laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones. These so-called smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and have become the dominant computing device on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2Q 2013. So now you tell me\u2026 what do you consider the first computer? And what year was it invented? ",

            "answer_text": "That kind of depends on how you define \u201ccomputer\u201d. Some people would include astronomical clocks - after all, they are machines that you can use to calculate information that would be a lot of work to do by hand. If you think that qualifies, the oldest by a mile is the Antikythera mechanism; an ancient greek clockwork device with indicators for date, time, solar and lunar eclipses, astronomical signs, and dates of different games (e.g. the olympic games), and a few other things. Similar things were re-invented in the 1300s in Europe. This is a recreation, photographed by Mogi Vicentini:  If you prefer something more like a calculator, which you can use to, well, calculate arbitrary mathematical problems, a good start would be the mechanical calculators of the 1600s. The first useful ones were designed by French mathematician, physicist, and generally important genius Blaise Pascal, who presented the first versio he was happy with in 1645. (His father worked as a tax collector and dragged Blaise in to help him with the calculations; he made the calculators to save himself some work). A Pascaline could do addition and subtraction, and by repeating those (by hand) you could easily do multiplication and division. They were fairly elegant machines, like this: (\u201cA Pascaline signed by Pascal in 1652\u201d, User:Rama )  They were also a bit fragile and finicky, so the first big sales success was much later, with the Arithmometer of 1851. The next level of development was the work of Charles Babbage \u2014 a fascinating, grumpy, wide-ranging British scientist with a very wide-spread range of interests. In between projects like sprinting into a volcano crater between eruptions to get samples (after paying locals to carry him up there, so he wouldn\u2019t be tired), and writing a sensible study on how to make factories more efficient, he found the time to design two very relevant machines, using clockwork-like brass parts and a crank to calculate different things. He began working on the first of them, the Difference engine, around 1819. This was meant to be more automatic than the earlier calculators: You set it up for some polynomial formula, and as you cranked it, it worked its way through a range of inputs and printed the results automatically. This could be used to produce things like logarithm tables, which was practically useful (and a lot of work to do by hand). He got far enough to build some working prototypes of a few parts; he demonstrated it calculating squares and cubes of numbers to 20 digits precision at some point. None were actually built, though; the first actually useful difference engines was probably the one designed and built by Per Georg Scheutz in Sweden in 1837\u20131841. There are modern reconstructions from Babbage\u2019s plans, and they seem to work. This one is from the London Science Museum, photographed by User:Geni. Note the crank.  Not satisfied with this machine, he continued to design one that would take input on punch tape (paper ribbon with holes), and do arbitrary things based on the input. Note that punch cards were nothing new - the 1805 Jacquard loom used a chain of punch cards to store the patterns it could weave, and that again was inspired by work from the early 1700s (e.g. Basile Bouchon). This more advanced machine, the Analytical Engine (first described in 1837) begins to look an awful lot like an actual computer. It had memory (a way to store some numbers), an arithmetic unit (\u201cmill\u201d) that could do mathematical operations on those numbers, conditional operations, and instructions to read and print data. It took three forms of input, as three different punchcard stacks: One for mathematical operations, one for load/store operations, and one for number input. It also was designed with a typewriter-style printer, a plotter, and a bell as output devices. The design of the input stacks is basically assembly programming \u2014 in hindsight, the first computer programmer was arguably the Lady Ada Lovelace, who sat down and designed an input stack to calculate Bernoulli numbers. Of course, actually building this incredibly intricate and massive mechanical machine in the mid 1800s was extremely non-trivial, and Babbage had problems both getting enough funding and working with his chief engineer; as I\u2019ve understood it he was also not willing to put in enough boring project manager work to actually get it finished. As of today, there is an ongoing project to build a replica (Building Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine), but they still have some unresolved questions (e.g. about the memory management) and are currently trying to collect a reference library of absolutely everything he wrote about it. Here\u2019s some of Babbage\u2019s original punch cards, as an illustration: instruction cards in front, data cards behind.(Punched cards for programming the Analytical Engine, 1834-71 ; Karol Lorentey )  Still, a computer that never actually got built may not quite count - and it was mostly forgotten and thus didn\u2019t influence modern development much if at all. The first of the modern generation were the electrical machines of WW2. The first was probably Konrad Zuse\u2019s Z3 from 1941 - though that was mostly meant to be used as a complicated calculator instead of a general-purpose computer, and it also fails the \u201cshaped later development\u201d test. Still, it deserves a nod. The Z3 was built with relays, electrically controlled electrical switches (like an old-style automatic phone central would use). Very shortly after, from 1943\u20131945, the British (specifically Tommy Flowers) designed the Colossus computer to help decrypt the German Lorenz encryption. This was still not a modern-style programmable machine, but you could rewire it to solve arbitrary problems. Like most computers until the transistors, it used vacuum tubes. Very much like the Z3, the Colossus wasn\u2019t quite general-purpose, and it also suffered from a similar \u201cpubllic knowledge\u201d-problem: It was a top secret program, and it took many decades before it was properly described to the general public. It did still have a large influence, though: Many of the people who worked on this project moved on to start new, commercial or research, computer projects after the war. (Even if they couldn\u2019t quite say where they had the ideas from). In parallel, the US wanted to quickly calculate artillery firing tables - artillery arcs are compex things, depending on air resistance and wind and mass and speed and drag and firing angles and the rotation of the earth. To do this, they designed and built ENIAC (the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer); it was started in 1943 and finished in 1945, and was another vacuum tube device. It was in the same \u201cprogrammable calculator that barely, technically, could in theory be used as a general-purpose computer\u201d niche as Z3 and Colossus, but unlike those, it went on to a post-war career at the University of Pennsylvania. It could be repurposed for fairly arbitrary tasks by rewiring and rearranging the machine; it had huge chunky connectors to make this practical. Later in its life, in late 1948, it was rebuilt (using the designed-in flexibility) to be more of a modern-style programmable computer; reading and executing a program from its number storage unit (large dials you could set by hand). ENIAC (US army photo):  However, between 1945 and 1948, a number of other programmable machines were also built. The very first one that could read and execute a program (without having to rebuilt the computer, and which was designed for and actually used in this way) seems to have been the Manchester Baby (or SSEM, Small-Scale Experimental Machine) at the Victoria University of Manchester in the UK; it ran its first program in June 1948. I personally consider this the first modern computer, but as I hope is obvious, that\u2019s a very arbitrary line.

All talk that the first computer was the Turing machine in the UK, and how it was the first computer and how it cracked Enigma is overrated nonsense. The Turing mechanical machine was not a computer, was not electronic, was operational at least a year after the first German machine, and the Enigma was cracked due to betrayal from the German side, and not due to superiority in decoding or mathematical prowess of the British. The real true superiority was in British covert action, and better attraction to defectors from the German side. ",

This machine was considered as the first \"programmable digital mechanical computer\".Lady Ada Lovelace  wrote many operating instructions for this machine developed by Babbage, therefore she is considered to be the \"FIRST COMPUTER PROGRAMMER\".And Charles Babbage therefore known as the \"FATHER OF COMPUTER\".
