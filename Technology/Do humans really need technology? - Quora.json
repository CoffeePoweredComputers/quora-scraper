            "answer_text": "Yes. You might consider computers, smart phones as technology while dismissing the idea that many older things are all technology. For example, farming is a technology, without it, we will not be able to maintain the current human population. Even in early hunter & gatherer civilisations, technology comes in the form of weapons and tools. The available food will be greatly reduced if there are none. Another example will be technologies to obtain water. If you have no technology, the only possible method to obtain fresh water is from rivers and springs. No, digging wells will not be possible. You can dig by hand, but you will not be able to understand where to dig. You might get lucky, but your hit rate will be less than 1% and you will die of dehydration before you get to the underground water had it not been sitting around.(and if you have other water sources, you don\u2019t need the well) So, without technology, people will be living in conditions worse than a lot of animals, which knows how to use tools and even make tools.(The Raven, for example, have been shown to bend a metal wire into a hook to hook stuff) You cannot use a cup, a glass to drink, since making such is technically technology, there will also be no plates, no knives, no folks, no spoons, no bowls, no buckets, no books, no writings, etc. Even drawing on rocks is a form of technology. Ah, there will be no fire as well, yes, fire is a normal phenomenon, but taking it to use for the betterment of human is a technology. Those who think otherwise is just ignoring the definition of technology and is spoilt too much in their easy lives, taking things for granted. The ancient people and survivors from the wild who had a really hard time starting a fire will definitely tell you otherwise. You will need fire to survive the cold in many areas on Earth, without it you will die and the method of starting it when you need it is not naturally occuring and thus a technology human created. So, some may argue technology isn\u2019t needed but only wanted by people, but the truth is, without technology, human will not be humans, they will be primitive animals than a long list of mammals, birds, octopi, etc. ",

Without medical technology, I would have dies at least 3 times before I was 27. That sounds weird. There were at least 3 times before I was 27 that I would have died without medical technology. That sounds better. Other than that, have you ever been camping? It was fun for three or four days, and then it got old really fast. It took forever to do things. And if you had to scrounge for your own food, it was worse. Nd you started out with shelter and fire for heat, clothes for protection, especially footwear, and tools. Did you miss technology? I bet you did. I worked in a library for just over 20 years and I can do more research on my iPad mini than I could in a library with a full reference department at my fingertips just 20 years ago. Technology is great! It\u2019s not a necessity, except for medical technology, but would we have that without the rest of it? No, I don\u2019t think so. ",

It is the techniques that humans have invented for dealing with the world, and the things created using those techniques. Farming is a technology. Cooking is a technology. Building houses is a technology. Making clothing is a technology. Hunting is a technology. Tool-making is a technology. Without technology, the only food you have is what you can hunt and pick with your bare hands. You have no clothing, no shelter beyond what you can find in nature, no fire. Language and society can even be considered technologies, so you can\u2019t talk, and can\u2019t form social groups beyond families. Technology is, in a very literal sense, what makes us different from other animals. ",

Technology has so intertwined itself with our lives that to think of living without technology is pretty much unthinkable. By technology I mean just about all of the thingamajigs and whatchamacallits we have surrounding us every day. From cars to cell phones. From fridges to televisions and everything in between our modern world is rife with technology. So much so that if it were all to be taken away is an unthinkable event. Yet what if it actually happened? This was a premise visited by a science fiction author whom I can't remember now where the magician Merlin was half woken from a deep sleep and used his magic to prevent any technology from working and actively destroy any technology around him. Basically reducing peoples lives to the level of the times of Camelot which had a very low level of technology. Not much different from the American Amish population. The Amish population actually is proof of the pudding that we really don't need technology to have happy and fulfilling lives. Not just the Amish as well. There are plenty of populations in these modern times which survive and thrive without technology as we know today. However, technology does make for an easier, longer and I would say healthier life. Some may contest this and say that technology is actually the cause for making us sicker and less healthy in general. Yet, (I would say but but everybody has one of those) technology is the reason our lifespan has increased from an average of forty to an average of more than eighty years. Technology has all but eradicated diseases which have almost eradicated the human race and technology has shrunk the world until we are almost a unified race. I say almost but there is still a lot of work to be done. ",

Simple tools have evolved into cutting tools which in turn have helped us to find more rare earth elements. These rare earth elements are used in materials chemistry to create the communications technology essential for us to defeat our alien enemies. As the Air that we breathe become more so filled with chemical elements of man made corporate waste, time wears thin. And though technology may be to blame for this hourglass of doom, the disfunctions and delays of malfunctioning  computers and misused software for crime seem pale in comparison to communications software systems machines which play a key role each moment in keeping humanity safe from extinction from any foreign or galactic threat. Technology is actually humanities intent to find permanence and immortality by any means possible. Technology as the hope and extension of humanity is the only chance for our race to resist the weaponry and deciet stemming from governments and terrorists' thirst for power. It is communications technology that the barbarian / pirate is too dim witted grasp, and as effect any genius programmer can write code in which to monitor, study, and paralyze, apprehend, or even physically trap and defeat him. The same goes for alien races that we fight regularly unbeknown to many there are hundreds of races of technologically advanced beings that monitor and have monitored earth and humanity for thousands of years. Some races are older and less of a threat to humanity than other races but we continue to thrive not because of our unity and our courage. It is because of our deep hunger for space travel and communications technology that we have not been fast to adapt to the high traffic invasion of earth and moon. Only just 100 years were scientists made aware of the craft that fly by and study humans each day and some species are caught and their technology reverse engineered not just in the USA either. Roswell is simple compared to what has been retrieved in total. Not to turn this into a science fiction response I prefer to stick to the truth: that technology will always have the upper hand when it comes to what is right no matter how flawed our race becomes: the deadliest technology will be handed to the innocent and they will know exactly what to do with it to defeat our enemies. Guaranteed. ",

Luddite - Wikipedia How far back is another question. Do we simply revert to a pre-industrial society and live in small farming and pastoral communities? Or do we return back to a pre-agrarian society of illiterate hunters and gatherers? Any such backward looking movement is destined to fail, as some people in these low technology societies will inevitably choose to innovate. Moving in the direction of more and better technology offers the promise of ending the tragedies of the human condition. An end to world hunger, peace on earth, eternal vitality, and the chance to become an interstellar species. An end to boredom and frustration. Of course, technology won\u2019t save us unless we find a way to peacefully coexist with other humans and all other life forms. ",

As a result of technological advances, they are increasing and spreading across countries. It is innovation that gives the power to spread their wings to organizations.

As for the hypothetical situation whereby all modern technology is suddenly removed or if a virus destroyed all electronic networks, I would think that mass chaos will arise with the fall of capitalism and existing institutions. As these digital pillars collapse, we should enter the second Dark Age of civilisation. The world's population will shrink. A feudal age will arise and in the midst of panic and uncertainty, religions or personality cults, will once again rise to the forefront of culture and education. ",

It took 45hrs(with all the halts in the stations) 1969: Rajdhani express takes 17hrs 20 minutes.  It used to have no intermediate passenger stop, however it had technical halt at Gomoh, Mughalsarai and Kanpur Central for refilling of the overhead water tank and to replenish the on-board catering stores. It was fastest train of India that time 2016: Rajdhani express takes 16hrs 55 min (including all stopages) If you take a flight, it will take less than 2hrs.  So basically we can see, there is always a hunger in human being to make a better and faster technology that can help us to transform and have a great future. This is the advancement of technology. So until and unless new technologies were implemented in our lives, this advancement would not have been possible.  Who knows probably we would me able to use nuclear fuel to generate energy for our engines and make our trains much safer to withstand a higher speed. Then it would take 1hr or even less to cover 1000 km and there will always be a curious mind who would say \"Hey why not cover the distance in less time\".   ",
