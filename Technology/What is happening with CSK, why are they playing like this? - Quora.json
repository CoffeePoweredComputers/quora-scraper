            "answer_text": "Cricket is a game of hindsight everyone's saying that CSK is a weak team now only because they're out of the tournament and are playing really poorly. Yesterday's match was probably the final nail in the coffin for CSK to reach the playoffs and look at how quickly things change in cricket after the first match it seemed like CSK would again enter the playoffs comfortably and were ready to prove everyone wrong who were raising questions on them after the departure of Harbhajhan and Raina. But after yesterdays game with Mumbai, CSK are officially knocked out of the league.  I've always been a CSK fan from the time I started watching cricket and they've never failed to disappoint me from the day I started following them because they've always qualified for the playoffs every year, won three titles and also reached the final 8 times in the league. But this year things haven't gone in their favour and they've failed to play good cricket as well. And there are many reasons for CSK failing miserably this year. I'll list them out for you. The major reason which I felt was the reason behind their downfall was that they weren't able to establish the right balance for the team and the right batting order, Players like Tahir, Santner and Hazlewood should've somehow played more games from the start of the tournament. Another reason could be that Chennai always pick a side at the auction which is ideal for Chepauk conditions and this year their spinners weren't able to adjust to the conditions in UAE well. Another thing which happened was they didn't have any like to like replacement for specific players like Harbhajhan, They didn't even have one off spinner except for Harbhajhan and if they had Harbhajan or a quality off spinner as his replacement, it would've payed off against a team like DC which has a lot of left handers. But again I'll say cricket is a game of hindsight and if CSK had played like every year people wouldn't even have been criticizing them. But I'm sure they'll come back strongly the next season, bring in new recruits in the auction come back with a stronger plan. And every successful team in this league has had bad seasons but they've come back strongly too and now when they know they haven't got any chance of qualifying for the playoffs maybe they'll play a lot freely. And I'll still be rooting for CSK with the same intensity as I did when they played their best cricket because this could be the last time some of my favorite players like Faf, Watson and especially would be playing on the field.

            "answer_text": "This answer is from a diehard CSK fan. I will not blame MSD for not performing with the bat( coz no batsman want to play bad ,he is lacking in form). But I will definitely say that his captaincy was not good .(tho I am no1 to raise questions against a legend ) CSK\u2019s obsession with experienced players is costing them matches . They are over-dependent on them. The team management\u2019s reluctance to give chances to young players like Gaikwad, Jagdeesan ,Sai Kishore etc. is also a big reason of their poor performance. No doubt in the fact that the experienced players were excellent in their time , but CSK is not ready to accept the change . In the initial stage of the tournament , FAF was playing brilliantly at no.3 but then for no reason he is being made to open and Watto is being made to play at no.3.When CSK dropped Jadhav after the match against KKR , it seemed that they have learned from their mistakes and will make a comeback but then they lost against RCB in which Jagdeesan played really well but then he was dropped against SRH for the experience. These youngsters need the same kind of exposure which was given to Unadkat and Deepak chahar when they were playing for RPS. In short , CSK needs to change their USP of experience and when it comes to experience , MI is no far from them\u2026\u2026..they have an almost perfect blend of young guns along with experience. CSK needs to have a look in the mirror about their strategy & game plan. TBH CSK doesn\u2019t even deserved to win the 3 matches which they have won so far in the tournament. NO OFFENCE PEACE \ud83d\ude42 JAI HIND (P.S: These are my personal views and yours might be contradicting) ",
