            "answer_text": "OK, an analogy first: in KZN they say there are no great whites off the local beaches; the water is too hot; all the sharks are down on the Cape. But in reality people stay inside the shark nets or bad things happen. On the Cape they say there are only a couple of great whites in Valsbaai, the water is too cold; all the sharks are up Durban / Umhlanga Rocks way. Somebody caught a world record great white on rod and line off the end of the harbour entrance pier in Durban - over on the headland side. It\u2019s a bundle of fun getting on to the pier that side: if you live in Durban you should try it (but conceal carry of course, it\u2019s wild country out there). You get on the railway track at a station about 2 or 3 miles back up the line, where you can leave your car. Then you walk down the track a couple of miles. You\u2019ll meet all kinds of people there. Where the track ends, you go illegally onto the navy land at the foot of the headland, cross that, and walk out along the breakwater. You\u2019ll be the only person there, all the Indian anglers are on the other side. Watch the ships coming up or down the narrow channel 24/7, steered by the harbour pilots who travel out to the ships by chopper. Bloke I met lost his boat in that channel - an RCOD 31. Smashed to bits, only the keel was left :) Silly bugger. Commodore of The Point YC, but apparently being chair of the board gives no guarantee of common sense: don\u2019t tack in a rocky channel 30 yards wide, use the donk. If you hover a helo off the beach in bunny chow country, you\u2019ll get sharks by the zillion, it\u2019s a shark magnet, and if there were no sharks there, well, you wouldn\u2019t get them turn up by the dozen for the chopper, would you? So the harbour pilots don\u2019t hover near the water for sure. And when I was in SA around 2000 they\u2019d just had a guy spearfishing in False Bay at the Cape taken by a great white - he\u2019d tied a fish he just speared to his belt instead of on the 30\u2032 line they advise, and the shark munched down the fish, him, and anything else attached. There are great whites everywhere so it makes no difference. It kind of points out that Cape people say Durban is far worse, and Durban people say Cape Town is the pits :) Both have a shanty town on the outskirts. If you get a flat tyre on your hire car, passing the townships, the car hire firm say to just drive on the rim, back into the city, they won\u2019t charge for any damage. They smile and say they don\u2019t want to see you get harmed - but really it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to lose the car. SA is a nice place, they drive on the left like all sensible people do. It\u2019s because you can shoot out the window with your right hand, why else. Out of town all the road signs are shot up. Also you can buy a large bag of clementines at the roadside for about 50p or so (back then the Rand was down). Cape TownI used to walk all round the town alone when I was there in 2000. No problems. I\u2019d walk from the marina to the railway yard on the docks (to see the project boats being built there) and from there into the town. All round the harbour front at night. Locals told me not to, for sure. Probably wouldn\u2019t do that now. Hired a scooter and drove round everywhere, from up above Houtbaai on that mountain road, to places they said don\u2019t go there by yourself. The toughest folks I saw anywhere round there were the working girls on the roadside out by Green Point. The trainTook an overnight sleeper train once, cross country, from Joburg to Durban (maybe it was to the Cape, I don\u2019t remember - long way, anyway). Later in Durban a guy said, \u2018You wouldn\u2019t catch me on that train without a machine gun, and even then I wouldn\u2019t risk it\u2019. So I think people everywhere will tell you things are really bad just over the hill there\u2026 DurbanNow that town is OK or it\u2019s hell, depending. Somebody moving out of one of the smart suburbs tried to sell me their house; it was an amazing place, like a giant round hut with an open interior and some kind of thatched roof about thirty feet up. Already had a place and no desire to relocate to somewhere that is hell in the summer and OK in the winter. In the summer it\u2019s about 40C and 100% humidity. Thanks but no thanks. Never got to PE but that sounds a better proposition. The marina (at the time) was as close to hell in the summer as I ever want to go. No power out on the pontoons; thick clouds of biting bugs due to some idiot rebuilding the harbourside wall with old tyres, which provided a breeding ground for ten million skeeters; the sun so hot that no wood survived on the boat decks there: it more or less burned off. People had enormous boat covers over the whole boat, a foot off the deck. Roaches like you wouldn\u2019t believe - I swear some were 4\u2033 long. Fabulous fishing though, not too far outside the harbour, with dorado, tuna and whatnot. I nearly got mugged several times walking around Durban. All the locals I knew said never walk anywhere, and half of them conceal carried. The Indian foremen and middlemen open carried. I used to walk from the shops back to the Holiday Inn on the beach front, and from the shops to the marina (sometimes I\u2019d spend a week in the Holiday Inn or an apartment out at Umhlanga Rocks as the heat in the marina in summer was unbearable for someone with a red beard and from the cold north). The local boys would eye me up and I\u2019d smile back at them as I walked past with a shopping bag in each hand. I was a bit of a hard case in those days and enjoyed a bit of sport. There was a chef\u2019s knife in each bag sort of kind of in the original packaging in case of Mr Plod (\u201cOnly just bought it, Officer\u201d), but they were thin on the ground in that town. One night I was sitting on the park bench on that little green bit in the middle of Umshlanga town, in the hot late night, eating a take-away from one of the shops there. Two white guys were eyeballing me from fifty yards off. They strolled over and said, what are you doing? Man you can\u2019t do that. Back where we come from in Pretoria (or wherever it was, I forget now) you\u2019d be dead in ten minutes. I said don\u2019t worry, this is a nice place. It probably wasn\u2019t but I was bored and hadn\u2019t had any action for a while. They sat down and we chatted. Where they came from sounded like the Wild West. It always is. All the stories about people being shot up at ATMs always made me chuckle. They probably went off thinking, mad dogs and englishmen. Can\u2019t argue I guess. \u2026\u2026\u2026.. Is Durban worse than Cape Town? Who knows. Anyone sensible stays in their car, keeps the tints rolled up and the doors locked, make sure to stop in traffic queues so that there is a big space in front you can power out of if the SHTF - they don\u2019t mess about in SA carjacking, they just kill everyone in the car for fun. It\u2019s why the flamethrower anti-carjack system is legal and used there: on each side under the bodywork there are gas jets off a propane tank in the boot: in a carjack you fire it up and cook the f***ers. I used to go out to the take-aways late at night and the scallions would size me up. For some reason they never had a go. Sensible people stay in the nice parts of town and don\u2019t go too far at night even in a car. The guy trying to sell me his house in Durban was moving a long way away, somewhere cooler and more sensible all round. Croydon maybe. ",

            "answer_text": "Crime can happen anywhere, and both Cape Town and Durban have their fair share of it. I was born in Durban and have lived in Cape Town for many years now. Let\u2019s start with Durban: It is a very corrupt and mostly dirty city which does very little for its citizens. It is also a tourist hotspot and has incredible beaches, sub-tropical weather, and a top holiday destination for locals and internationals. If you\u2019re a tourist you\u2019re likely to have a fantastic time as long as you stick to the guidelines about which areas are not safe. If you live there it\u2019s a different story altogether. I have family and friends in Durban and don\u2019t know one person unaffected by crime or corruption. I wouldn\u2019t like to live there right now. Cape Town is touted as one of the most violent cities in the world. Yes, it is, but only on the Cape Flats where murders are a daily occurrence with children often caught in the cross-fire. The worst areas are controlled by poverty, drugs, and gangs, and life is cheap. If however, you live in a medium to an upper class mostly white suburb as I do, crime is very low and usually petty theft dominates the list. Tour guides know not to take tourists to the Cape Flats so they skirt around the \u2018nice\u2019 areas and everyone falls in love with Cape Town. It is fantastic living here, but it upsets me to see Cape Town winning award after award for \u2018best city in the world\u2019 when in truth the majority of people here are poor and live in very densely populated areas that have poor amenities. The majority don\u2019t even have flush toilets in their shacks and share communal chemical toilets at the rate of 30:1. Not only are the gang wars a threat; they\u2019re susceptible to fires in summer and floods in winter. Public transport is unreliable at best with countless trains torched in the last few years and virtually no security on the trains making it not viable and yet sometimes the only choice people on the Cape Flats have to commute. Politicians too readily trade promises for votes and the poor suffer more each time. Yet, my white skin still affords me a decent life even though I have very little (I only rent a room in an expensive house - own nothing), while my friends suffer because they\u2019re black. I do not condone this, I am merely stating the facts. My choice is still to live in Cape Town because I am involved in an upliftment project which we\u2019ll be presenting to government early next year in the hope we can make a difference for all. ",
