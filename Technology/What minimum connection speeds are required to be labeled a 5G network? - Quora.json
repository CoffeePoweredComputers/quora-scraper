            "answer_text": "Well, if you\u2019re AT&T, you probably cheat and just dub your LTE Advanced link as \u201c5G\u201d. In the 4G era, \u201c4G\u201d was actually a performance metric, and several technologies were vying for widespread adoption. The winner was LTE (Long Term Evolution). But in the 5G era, the next generation radio technology, currently dubbed 5G-NR, has already been created, approved, and rolled out in some areas. It\u2019s a set of standards, including waveform, modulations, bandwidths, frequencies, radio access technologies\u2026 it\u2019s a big fat pile of standards, many of which are complete and official. So that\u2019s it \u2014 if you\u2019re on a 5G-NR radio link, congrats! You\u2019re on a 5G network. Some companies are rolling 5G as an overlay to 4G systems. This was part of the design of 5G, so it\u2019s ok. Chance are, you won\u2019t see much difference in speed, because at the same bandwidth, it\u2019s not all that much faster. Of course, if one of those signals reaches you today and you have a compatible phone, it practice it might be much faster, simply because practically no one\u2019s using it yet. Most \u201cin-band\u201d 5G-NR will run on 20MHz channels, much as LTE does, though some band will permit wider, and thus faster, bandwidths. Some 5G radios are going into the \u201cmillimeter\u201d bands, much higher frequencies that will permit much, much faster connections. However, as you go to higher frequencies, you lose range. So unless you\u2019re in a city, and the lucky part of that city, you probably have a wait. One of the idea for rolling out 5G in neighborhoods is put a microcell on every other street light or telephone pole. That\u2019s a ton of radios. But they\u2019re expecting this to get to 2Gb/s, at least under ideal conditions. Millimeter wave 5G can run channel bandwidths up to 400MHz. And 5G radios will run at super slow speeds, too. NB-IoT radios are designed to allow persistant narrowband internet connections to low powered, low bandwidth devices for Internet of Things, potentially as a replacement for WiFi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, 6-LoPan, and other IoT radios\u2026 eventually. It\u2019ll be awhile before the prices drop to use this as an endpoint radio. It\u2019s more likely to see use for IoT in industry, in places not already served by other wireless infrastructure.
