            "answer_text": "In short security. Since we now have Chip & Pin, and the majority of people internet on their phones, the ability to have card readers as one of the Apps on the phone, Chip \u2018n PIN is near 100% used in shops, and over the land-line telephone the number is input on to key pad and the CVV number input as well per instruction. To that end the system is largely paperless, the only paper is the \u201caudit trail\u201d printed by the card reader. Prior to chip \u2018n pin, the card had to go over an imprinter which had a roller which required both the vendor\u2019s clearing number and details, and the long card number imprinted in the same way by the roller being pushed over with some weight and the embossed numbers pressed through the carbon papers. This had two problems in so far that usually there was only one card roller per shop (department stores had several of course with sub -account numbers) however the biggest problem was that the Merchant copy was notorious for not getting the imprint perfect and the middle bank copy often smudged. Further for both bank and retailer they had to be hand-punched in to the systems and therefore time consuming. In the latter case that meant human error, and indeed some card numbers were incorrectly in put and the final processing stage and entries ended up on the wrong account. So Chip n PIN given that the card could not be easily copied to run through these roller numbers, the Chip and the Black strip could not be read. Finally the silicone chip now had the technology to cram so much data in such a small area and to carry an encoded PIN which only the computer and the card could accept and read made it more secure. Further with fibre optic technology large stores in particularly could process massive voloumes and not rely on a cashiering department to collect each banks cards voucher, then posting it (physically) to the relevant banks\u2019 processor, then receive a payment to the bank. Then you had the security issue in so far as the \u201croller readers\u201d could not do a live cheque to see if the account was cancelled, stolen or other reasons for acceptance to be refused. Prior to the on-line system, the only way to authorise was to telephone the issuers clearing centre. To do that for EVERY transaction for EVERY retailer was out of the question. So the banks introduced floor limits. The problem with that was that most people knew the floor limit was \u00a350 for nearly all stores, and only sometimes did that floor limit dropped to usually \u00a310 or \u00a312, to catch people out. However that caused a further problem with people queuing up for telephone lines and manual clearance. Particularly when \u201cplastic\u201d was being used more and more; the same went for banks since ATMs could not process cash advances until the \u201cblack-strip\u201d technology came available and later Chip \u2018 Pin for the. So for the banks there was a further safety where cash advances were being taken (again we can do this through ATM, but prior to that could only be done in branch), with chip and pin readers and as telecom technology got more powerful, and particular the advent of Broadband and fibre optics every thing could be processed faster. To that end there was no need for the card and expiry numbers to be raised as the Chip n Pin created the information; and even manual telephone transactions (now falling as the retailer can ask you to input the number over the digital phones that about 99.9% of people have now that information was now totally confidential between you and the clearing computer. The operator has know knowledge until the light comes up to say you have stopped in putting. So the whole system faster and more secure. No need for raised numbers, so not easily copied as the data is in the chip and the number just there phone transactions over the phone to be in put by you the card holder. Also it makes the card cheaper to produce and because EVERY transaction is cleared, the amount of fraud (relatively) fell through the floor if you base it on a transaction voloume /value -v- fraud committed. Of course fraud is still a major issue for the banks, but given that about 80% of purchases are now cleared electronically/digitally, in terms of sheer value-v-number of transactions per day the level of fraud has fallen through the floor. Of course the further advantage of overseas operations and certainly I would suggest 100% of modern European Countries; more so USA clear on-line too. So for the international traveller even faster than the original AMEX, Carte Blanche and Diners Club International; and of course most \u201ccommon\u201d Credit Cards can be used overseas as well. Again another safety element, since if you are passing through several countries in your journeys, whether commercial or leisure you are not having to carry multiple currencies, which small individually can soon rise to several hundred Pounds /Dollars/ local currencies, making that person a walking security risk. So with Chip n PIN, no raised numbers to copy covertly all around far safer, and again with the speed of clearance over the internet any \u201cfoul play\u201d can be picked up almost immediately (Card Declined) or if erratic/freak transaction/ use comes up the card blocked and the exposure to fraud reduced. Indeed an attempted fraud on my own account was picked up by one of these systems as being an \u201cimpossible sequence\u201d (two were all PIN Controlled) but in between those two was another transaction in another Country; the time frame in which all three transactions took place was physically impossible. Although we never caught the person (s) who attempted the fraud, it didn\u2019t happen and was picked up at the point of sale and blocked or returned as a fraudulent transaction(s). Again something that the raised number, carbon copy voucher and floor limit was seriously affecting the amount of fraud, and once technology was in place (and continues to improve) these frauds have been reduced considerably. As I mention above you will never completely prevent fraud, but at least you can control it more and more efficiently Chris R- London ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re no longer needed. Back in the day, credit card transactions were processed using imprinting machines (those old school things that made carbon copies of the face of your credit card). Like this:  I saw one of these a few years ago in a very small town; I don\u2019t even remember what kind of store it was. Being a Payment Card Industry security guy, I politely pointed out that those are no longer kosher. The old guy laughed, said that he was aware, but didn\u2019t expect to be audited any time soon and it wasn\u2019t worth spending the money on building out an electronic Point of Sale (PoS) replacement. Most of his customers were neighbors, and they always paid cash (clearly, I was not a neighbor). We laughed, and then realized that my card didn\u2019t have raised characters, so he wrote the card info down. In any other environment, I would have walked away. But the quaintness of the whole thing actually just gave me a chuckle. ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect the reason is that the raised numbers are a legacy of old technology. The reason that numbers were raised was because years ago there was no instant way to scan a card and get an approval. Instead, merchants had a device like this:  Which they would put paper in with carbon paper in between and take an imprint of the card. Give you your receipt and keep one for their records and one to send to American Express for example. The raised numbers are no longer needed since there are so many ways to economically get a real time authorization/approval. ",
