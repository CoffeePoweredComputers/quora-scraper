            "answer_text": "Others hopefully will add to this but for vehicles, solid state batteries and for power stations flow batteries seem to be coming along. One of the chief criteria for batteries is they have to last through thousands of recharges and not lose a very significant amount of their capacity. Testing this takes a lot of calendar time slowing down battery development. They are also experimenting with a variety of different cathode and anode materials many of the new composites. An example is sodium instead of Lithium. I may be wrong but I don\u2019t think any of these alternatives are on the market yet. Elon Musk did say that they have reduced the amount of Cobalt required in their batteries. ",

A battery that meets all the needs of a car seems to be a seriously intractable problem (to nobody in the battery development community\u2019s surprise) Hydrogen fuel cells seem to be a far better technology to use despite all the hoopla about batteries and battery cars.
