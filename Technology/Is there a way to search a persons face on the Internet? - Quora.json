            "answer_text": "Not really. You can, as others have suggested, find or upload a photo of that person, then do an image search of it. (In Chrome, you can right-click any image and select \"Search Google for this image.\") I have no inside knowledge about how Google image search, but I think it's doing less facial recognition and more matching on generic image features. For example, if you have a photo of a friend wearing a red turtleneck, I'd expect you to get more matches on other people wearing red turtlenecks, and no matches of your friend wearing a business suit. You results may vary, and may change over time. (I just found an online photo of myself, and did a Google image search on it. Most of the matches were of young blonde women. None were wearing non-sun glasses. Stating the obvious: none had a beard. A similar Bing search found no results at all, not even the original photo.) The other alternative is to do a generic search on someone's name, then click the \"images\" link. This works well for \"barack obama.\" It doesn't work well for \"paul s r chisholm.\" Even with quotes, this search mostly turned up the faces of other people named Paul Chisholm. (It's a surprisingly common name.) Caveat: There are very few photos of me on the World Wide Web. Do any image search results for \"John O'Neil\" find you? (They do find \"John P. O'Neill.\") Obligatory disclaimer: I'm not speaking for any search engine. ",
