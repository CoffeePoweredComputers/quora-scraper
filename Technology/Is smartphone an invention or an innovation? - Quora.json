            "answer_text": "The smartphone, however evolutionary it may seem when compared to the world's first mobile phone invented by Dr. Martin Cooper, can be classified as a new invention in and of itself. The world's first smartphone is the IBM Simon Personal Communicator released in 1992. Neil Papert invented 'text messaging' in 1992, as well. The world's first text message was \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d. In 1994, genius inventor Andr\u00e9 Gray invented Ringtones and Ringbacks along with the SYNC Programming Language--the world's very first downloadable third party mobile app for his IBM Simon. Once again, in 1998, Andre Gray Invented Microgrooves Electronic, or Microgrooves-E for short, the world's first multimedia player which was capable of playing single songs, entire albums, and can even show videos, albeit with very fuzzy images that looked rather dot matrixed. And the rest, as they say, is history\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Its an innovation. As you can see, we still call it \u201csmartphone\u201d. The basic usage of them is communication which the classic phones did. They evolved from one to one with more and more features. Moreover, our old goodies are the pioneer for today\u2019s smartphones. Well, sometimes it could be an invention too with powerful things in it that we didn\u2019t think of, a 10 - 20 years back. In base, they are actually an innovation not an invention. ",
