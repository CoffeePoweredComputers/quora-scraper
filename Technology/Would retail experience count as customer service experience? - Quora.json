            "answer_text": "In my honest opinion, YES! Retail is the front lines of customer service. Customer Service: the assistance and advice provided by a {individual}/company to those people who buy or use its products or services. (definition provided by Google) In retail, this is your sole job. Every position in retail focuses on making sure the customer is happy and comfortable shopping with that particular store/ business. Whether you are stocking groceries, cleaning bathrooms, bagging, etc\u2026 all of those positions play a role in providing a positive customer service experience. Just imagine:You walk into your local grocery store. You\u2019re able to grab a grocery cart with ease because they have someone out in the parking lot bringing carts in for customers to use. You start cruising the aisles and grabbing the products you need\u2026 because the shelves are fully stocked thanks to the stockers that are working hard putting products on the shelf as fast as possible. You have trouble finding an item on your list, so you ask an employee where to find it. They drop what they are doing and walk you to the aisle where the item is at. Uh oh! Nature calls\u2026 so you find the restroom. You\u2019re able to use the facilities and wash your hands\u2026 thanks to the person that is cleaning and stocking the bathroom with toilet paper, paper towels, and soap. You then go to finish collecting the rest of the items on your grocery list without fear of slipping on the floors because there is someone mopping up any spills and sweeping the floors regularly. You head to the check out stand where a team of individuals helps ring up and bag your items for you. They may even offer to help you out and load them into your car for you. Now just think, in that one scenario\u2026 how many people were working to make sure that you had a pleasant shopping experience in their store. That scenario alone, has at least a half dozen people providing a form of customer service. They may not have had direct contact with the customer, however they were still \u201cproviding assistance/advice\u201d to the customer. It\u2019s still a retail situation, but they are all part of the customer service experience for that customer. ",

            "answer_text": "If you worked at a large retailer in the Accounts payable section - you can hardly count that as customer service experience and any interviewer with half a brain can see that. Customer service works differently and in varying degrees across industries. Customer service work pressure in the hospitality industry is much higher than in Grocery retail for instance. If you want exposure to customer service experience - work in the hospitality sector. ",
