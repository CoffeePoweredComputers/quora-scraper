            "answer_text": "Politics in India or for that matter anywhre in the world is fraught with negative connotations. Why? The answer lies in the fact that it is an arena where there are no rules. Mao Zedong once famously said, \u201cPolitics is war without bloodshed, and War is politics with bloodshed\u201d. History has shown us that every great empire and every great dynasty has perished with time, because nothing is permanent. What remains partially permanent is the \u2018Ideaology\u2019. There are basically three ideologies working politically in India-: The Right, The Left, and The Central. Since Independence Congress ruled for the better part with a strong centalist ideology and left little space for \u2018The Left' and for 'The Right'. But with Congress, there was a problem, that it was somewhat leaned towards 'The Left'. This gave space for the BJP to take charge and rise as the best known Rightwing force. Political pundits predicted that it was a short lived tryst with destiny for the BJP when the Congress was back in 2004. But with the Narendra Modi juggernaut, old calculations and predictions have extinguished like fire in the rain. The Centralist ideology is all but over. Now, let me come to the core of the question. The future of Indian politics will be between the Rightwing (Centre-Right) and the Leftwing (Centre-Left). And this can be assuaged with the somewhat Leftward shift of the Grand Old Party. It is happening not because of a coincidence, but because of the BJP and it's Rightwing ideology. Whenever there is a dominant viewpoint, there is also always a counter viewpoint, and that's the beauty of democracy. If we analyse the current political scenario, the opposition is fragmented into various Left leaning parties, countering the BJP. One thing is for sure, till the time \u2018the left' depends upon dynastic politics, there can be no credible opposition. There are many claimaints for the Leftwing ideology, but it will all depend upon their public appeal. With the BJP posturing itself into Centre-Right and the Congress into Centre-Left, time will tell which ideolgy gains traction. Afterall it is the people who choose in a democracy. Let me know in the comments section if your liked the article. Disclaimer: I am politically partisan. I like every ideology as far as it helps humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "Indian politics\u2026..! It is the topic of interest of many such people who are sitting with there friends, hot topic discussed on tea stalls and much . my view it is the topic which should be discussed by the scholars and thoughts of them should be respected by other political leaders.There could be a lot of viewpoints which will be changed from person to person. I am going to share some of my viewpoints here on the future of indian politics. In the near future,we may see some extraordinary technologies in the field of engineering ,doctory,astronomy,space etc. But everyone wants to see ascension of indian politics in the future. The politics in which the opposite party and ruling party work together in the betterment of society. There will not be any discord between the leaders of respective parties.All will come together when it will the issue of sovereignty of nation. Our India is addressed secular country. In the front of the world , India sets an example that how the people from different religion pours themselves in the water of unity. But some leaders makes it grudge of dispute and play politics. In the near future ,there will not be talk of any party discussion that hindu votes me or lower class would them. There will not be a distribution of votes according to caste and religion. The whole focus of the leaders is to development of services , development of infrastructure,quality of education for poors,quality of Heath services and much more. People will come to government schools for better studies of their progeny .The facilities of the government hospitals are as good as private ones. The role of politics in all them is very much. Today without the consensual consent there will not be done any thing .In future any decision would be taken asap which would facile any type of community. There could be a Maxim of the opposite party members that \u201c We are from the opposite party,it\u2019s our work to oppose what is happening.\u201d In the future I want to see the change in mentality of them. There could be their minds to think and perceive that what is happening,is this for good cause or not,it would leave good impact on people or not\u2026..Think deeply,and then if they find bad they are independent to oppose that.But now everyone comes first to oppose whatever would be happened.Change in mentality will also a matter to resolve . There could also be a line of interest at the astronomy , technology, astro physics. Development of research and technical equipment at ISRO,DRDO,BARC and such institutions which provides India a better technogical platform against the world would also should be consider. Development of Heath services, research are equally important as employment ,shelter and food. To develop a scientific and technology based environment would also needs support from political leaders. I should think that in future there will not be any politics by making an issue for or against our force . The Indian military ,navy and the airforce are very special and primitive among all of us.And it is very cynical thing to play politics on defence issues. In future political leaders should become more sensitive for army. To provide best services to army and army person would be their goals. At last , as summarizing my own viewpoints in a sentence which is in near future if the leaders of all parties will work together, keeping their personal benefits aside, it will provide a great environment for work to all and development of India would be ten times better than now. There will be only goal to provide everything as they can and make india \u2018aryavart'which represent the best in the world. India will leads to world economy if politics of india is clean and corruptionless. Please upvote if you like\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Things will work out fine! And I am not saying this out of dreamy optimism, but because that is the way of history and we appear to be moving in the direction other older democracies have. Obviously, there are a lot of differences.. but that is not is to be answered here.  This gets a bit lengthy.. but if it interests you.. go on. First things first, let us do away with idealist conception of democracy and focus on how things actually work. The people standing for offices mobilize support from the general public. These candidates desire these offices for certain interests that come with the office (power, respect, possibility to serve the public), and would like to retain them for the same interests. If things are so organized in a society that the office bearer performs well in the interest of majority, he is reelected. Ideally, with a large middle class this would work great because the interests of majority are more or less similar.  Now coming to the Indian situation. We have been historically divided on innumerable lines of division in terms of wealth, caste, religion, language and what not. The socialistic policies of the pre-1990s period (not exactly socialism) could not provide the economic impetus that would have shaken these traditional divisions and hierarchies. It was inevitable that caste based, religion based politics emerged simply because in the absence of change in economic situation for the lot, these interests mattered more.  With the new economic order since 90s, our society has started moving towards the classical large middle class structure. Apart from around 32% census defined urbanization, there is a rapidly growing low middle income group that stays in census towns (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_town) and nearby villages with aspirations to move up the economic ladder. Roads, good education for their children, ease of business matter much more now than caste or religion. With the present demographics, in about 20 years or so one can argue that our society will be more or less define political interests in terms of its economic goals. That is assuming, social changes accompany economic development at a steady pace (which it usually does). That's the larger picture. Yes, our political leaders have been late to realize these transformations and still hold on to the old classifications, but things surely are changing. Elections are now being decided on performance of the government. Fractured mandates have largely diminished with people voting in favor of a stable government. Debates on economic issues like education, FDI, pension reforms and prospects of economy have become commonplace. We have the largest population buying newspapers today. More interestingly, a serious division between two main parties on the development model question is now visible (close to the lines of right vs left) as the 2014 elections draw close. And no one can doubt that with 2014, a leader will have to emerge, and whoever it is, we might be seeing the last of Indian politics that used to be.   In the recent future, I guess we will move close to a two-party structure at centre (with stable coalition partners) and similar 2-3 way contests in states. Federalism question will remain prominent for next 5-6 years till we arrive at a consensus on coalition politics. Controversial questions on reservations, article 370, AFSPA will remain untouched. Knee-jerk reaction based governance (like what happened with Lokpal and anto-rape bill) is here to stay till our political class realizes that to remain in power, long term solutions need to be harnessed. By 2030, I feel that our politics will be closer to that in the mature democracies. For now, there's an amazing political thriller that awaits us in 2014 that might change at least a few of the usual ways of Indian politics. ",

            "answer_text": "Ha! A debatable question! India's currently in a perplexing situation: While on one hand it flaunts that a vast majority of its population represents youth; on the other hand, its politics still dwells on the past and needs considerable changes. However  various instances in the past few years are indicative of a brighter future! People have become more vigilant of their responsibilities & rights and have learnt to see through the false promises setup by political parties prior to elections. The crowd pulling Anna Hazare protests against corruption is a sign of people discovering themselves and their collective power.  There is a unanimous outcry against injustice- political, social or moral; debates have flared up; unanimous voice against Durga's wrongful suspension over illegal mining scam and arrest of influential politicians over convicted cases give hope that  honesty does prevail over influence and power. Besides, introduction of NOTA option by EC shall ensure that more efficient candidates are put up by the political parties. Furthermore there's a shift from our ideology of pointing fingers at the government for almost everything ranging from a faulty light bulb to an earthquake! We have realised the need to roll up sleeves and do our bit as responsible and aware citizens.  The growing popularity of AAP, which is represented by a major chunk of neglected middle class individuals shows people's recognition of the need to be a part of the system to bring about a change in it, rather than just being a critic. The youngsters have become more politically aware like never before. They are eager to be a voice and lend a hand in the change. The rising use of social media by political parties in mobilising the youth is an indicative factor. Hence, with the people's welcome intervention in politics, both actively and passively; to the political parties' realisation of the need to endorse themselves with a better performance, Indian politics is definitely headed for a better future!

The politics of the nation will take a dramatic change from Congress centered one to nation centered one. People will talk of super power or developed India. India occupying the first or second position in every aspect will be the desire of the people. People will be agitated if they are ranked anywhere below fourth or fifth. The party in power will lose the support of the people. People would have completely forgotten Congress and Gandhi family. Many of the regional parties become extinct and those that will be there will not be powerful enough to rule any state independently. Kashmir problem which we are facing now will no more be there. Even the Kashmiris themselves would have compromised on India. Communism will completely be erased from the soil. Socialism which is very much prevalent now will make way for market based economy. Socialistic ideas become a subject only for students to study or comparative discussion. Unlike the present politics which is centred round scams and looting, politicains in future will be more honest and no more politiains carry the stigma of corruption. India in the next 30 or 40 years would have become a super power crossing China and even US, that the people will be concentrating on making life easy. Automation, education, transport, connectivity etc., become the subject of talk. ",

Seriously future of Indian Politics will be Vanished if , soon we will not get another Modi, because modi can take india forward for 5 years from now , & he will retire.Is 75 the new voluntary retirement age in politics? Present is better , but first time its looking that future is not looking good , If Modi is working so why many are against , because they don't want to see developed India, they don't want to see rich India, Because they don't see intellectual India, Because they don't want to see secular India . The point is that why they want this, this is Because how they will get vote if India will be developed. Developed india will give vote only for development , and they are not fit in that , only Modi fits in that. Everyone wants Chair on the cost of Anything. They want that people of India should always be Backwards. Then only they Able to make there Chappatis. They want that Indians use to fight in the name of Ram, Allah, mandirs, Mosque, Gurudwara, churches etc. People will fight & these our leaders able to secure their seats. Atlast, I can say people are changing. If we want to get develop then we have to stop begging & start earning. They want that we always use to get dependent on them. Many of the examples are here: a man said that he will give free water to the state for FREE. Then what we have done. ? We have given the whole state to him in an election. We have to earn, we should earn. Why always we attract towards free? At least for self-esteem, we have to earn & not run for Free things.The future of political India At last, I must say that awareness is coming in our people. Now people are understanding who wants to Take India to world & who to Darkness, backwardness etc. Live and current example is UP Elections. Atlast, India is progressing and we are developing. But future will be totally depend on us so we careful whom you vote. ",

I'll narrate an incident which recently happened: I was in a Birthday Party of my friend. We had 7\u20138 Indians in our group, 1 Nigerian and 2 Pakistanis. Things don't normally escalate but I was provoked by one of the Pakistanis and the Kashmir debate started. But it was NOT cool, and the Pakistani said \u201cI'll educate you about Kashmir. You are from f**king (sic) other state of India, and you don't have any right to call Kashmir yours\u201d. I told him, \u201cI don't need Education from falsified terror sources. And I have full f**king right, because its not just my state, its my country\u201d. I debated till the end (until being stopped), but the most shameful thing was, out of 7\u20138 Indians only the Birthday Guy (from Himachal) supported me and all other (Indian) Friends were either trying to close the debate or (2 of them) blaming me and stop it. I was literally shocked. If I had more Marathi friends there, they would have literally insulted the Pakistanis in such a way that they would feel ashamed of being Pakistani. Infact they would first compare GDP of my \u201cstate\u201d and Pakistan, when that oversmart idiot tried to limit me to my state instead of country. When he said, \u201cIf I recall \u201965 war then you won't dare to talk!\u201d I literally understood how educated he is. I mean he thinks '65 was won by Pakistan. I knew he was educated by Pakistani History books. At the end of the Party he demanded not to discuss about Politics (because yeah, I mean he would definitely lose it). People, don't be afraid to show your nationalism if its required! Be a proud citizen and stand up to debate instead of sitting silently as a coward! ",

They are not concerned by just announcing MNREGA or giving away money to everyone without a properly defined system. Now, I see debate on reducing our debt; About converting all public transport to electric to save for oil(which is bought in $, hence save forex!); About providing insurance to all; About urging the brain drain to come back and invest in India(which happened over the years, thanks to the Congress!);About making peace with all our neighbours(Thanks to congress that we had issues with them!);About removing red-tapism and urging foreigners to invest in our country!I certainly believe that such attitude demarcates a good future of Indian politics. Indian politics is tough, with so many regional parties and so many point of views. But, despite all this, the ability of a party to capture a majority in Lok Sabha is the reason I feel optimistic about Indian Politics. Let's see what happens.  ",

It is not that just India but the world over has become right-winged. Right from Donald Trump to all the other world leaders. However this did not happen all of a sudden, it was a gradual shift towards right-wingness at an international level. Many international crisis and development has led to the growth of this. What we see in India is the same. Things like multiculturalism have lost their charm and sheen. As far as the future is concerned it depends whether the voters want better infrastructure and life or they want to fall into the trap that petty politicians lay for vote-bank politics. With religion, caste and many social aspects getting intertwined with political parties and government, it is difficult to gauge the future. I just hope true Democracy survives in India wherein every citizen is treated equal before law and has the right to better life opportunities irrespective of race, religion, caste, creed, sexuality and others.

What can say, with a fair amount of confidence is that the history of democracy, free elections, has so far served as a solid underpinning for the nation. Yes there are some states where the government is less than totally honest, but that happens all over, even if in India it can be on quite a large scale. India\u2019s population growth is declining, and somewhere between 2040 and 2060 it is expected to stabilize or start to decline. This will make things easier for the poor, as there will be more housing available, and more food. The lack of population will eventually mean that most of the various religious, tribal, and other rivalries will begin also to decrease, as there will not be nearly the fight over the spoils. So the future in the long term looks bright, it is merely trying to maintain the democratic foothold it has, enlarging it, and trying to ensure that Justice for All Equally gets practiced. The more the late part is emphasized, the more likely the state will be stable, and still grow strong economically. ",
