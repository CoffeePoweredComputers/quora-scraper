            "answer_text": "Not really, Yes the RN7P takes better pictures in 12MP mode majorly, but the number of \u201cmegapixels\u201d don't matter that much RN7P uses the Sony IMX 586 sensor, which is almost a flagship level, used by phones like Honor view 20, Mi 9, OnePlus 7 pro. It allows great amount of details in the shot even being 12MP Its dynamic range and low light performance is better than what sensors of RN7P's are capable of because of how big a size of a pixel is(as its 48MP capable, it combines 4 pixels into 1 to take a good 12MP shot, which allows much more light in) The only phone I think that'll come close(still not beating it) to RN7P in this price bracket will be Realme 3 Pro as it also sports a decent Sony IMX 519 sensor(not good as IMX 586 tho, but close enough) ",

            "answer_text": "Hey it is not the Megapixels which define the clarity of the pic. Since Redmi note 7 pro has got Sony IMX sensor it gives a good pic when compared to other manufacturer. For ex if you compare the same mobiles from the Redmi series you might under stand. Redmi note 7 and Note 7 pro. The later one has got Sensor where the former one lacks. This itself defines the picture. You can compare these two phones cameras. ",
