            "answer_text": "You may be speaking in such a way that combines the variations of the persons you model after,and your listeners are confused. If you have used multiple teaching sites online, you may be pronouncing one word with a London accent, and the next with a Mumbai accent. The English language itself is complicated in that there are numerous exceptions. No one can be sure of how they sound unless they have some face-to-face honest feedback from someone who is trained to listen to speech and accent. Speech-Language Pathologist or a teacher with good credentials in Teaching English as a Second Langugage has been trained to assess the amount of words that are understandable to an average listener and to point out the sound errors you are making that deviate from the standard accent of the people you wish to communicate with. You may be able to have an assessment and a few specific practice instructions via Skype or FaceTime. ",

            "answer_text": "The internet is a wonderful tool, but has many limitations and you shouldn't depend entirely upon it. What you are missing is all of the subtleties that are only gained through personal interaction and conversation with another human being next to you that has a better command of the language. Seek out all personal opportunities to engage native speakers of the language you wish to be proficient in and you will have the highest degree of feedback and learning on the subject. Immersion is the best teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "If you truly have tried accent tutorials and they did not work, you probably need more ear training and you should work from positions for the speech sounds in the American English language. I would take a look at Edith Skinner\u2019s book Speak with Distinction. It is old, but she gives basic positions and images to create good speech sounds. ",

I\u2019d recommend English comedians on YouTube like Dave Allen. Listen closely, and match their speech. Imitation is halfway there. ",
