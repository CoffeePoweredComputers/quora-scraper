            "answer_text": "There are a couple of things to consider here.   Is the laptop refurbished, or only used? How old is the refurb? What do you need a laptop for? First, there are some places that will call a computer refurbished, but are really selling you a used computer that has simply been cleaned and reloaded.  Refurbished usually means that there was a problem with the item that forced the owner to send the machine back and get a replacement.  The problem is then fixed, either by replacing a part, or by replacing the entire computer but keeping the same case.  Getting a refurb can usually save a few bucks, depending on the age of the computer, but getting a relatively recent refurb may not save you a whole lot. Generally, with a true refurb, you usually get a manufacturer's warranty equal to that of a new machine.  This is definitely a plus, but I have bought refurbished items that had not actually been fixed.  The warranty says you can send them back, but unless you are really getting a good savings, the trouble may not be worth your while. The age of the refurb may also tell you a little about it.  If the item is a current or near current model, the device is probably a repaired item and you can get a small price break on it.  If it is a year or two past the end of the model series, then you might actually be getting a non refurbished machine.  This in itself may be okay since you will probably get a really good price on it, but used computers have their drawbacks in limited warranties (around 30 days from purchase) if any, and you have no idea what the history is on the computer and may have some serious wear and tear which might result in parts failures soon after purchase.  Used items may have been sold in a bulk sale which includes broken and damaged equipment.  The salable machines are often put together using parts from the broken ones.  Finally, what do you need the laptop for?  If it is for Internet surfing or writing papers for school, used or refurbished computers may be more affordable, but there are some basic laptops at many department stores that sell for less than 300 dollars U.S. new.   If you are using it for work, or for heavy duty use with games or graphics programs, the laptop you want may go for 700 to 1500 dollars U.S.  A refurb might save you a few bucks, but it might also give you a few headaches.  If you want an Apple machine, expect to pay the upper end of the price range, but Apple does sell many of its refurbished items on its website.  However, the more current models are usually sold out immediately. Technically, refurbs are usually a good buy and is usually risk free since most companies will honor the original warranty if anything is wrong.  But getting a new computer may save you a few headaches, and there is always that great feeling of buying something completely new. ",
