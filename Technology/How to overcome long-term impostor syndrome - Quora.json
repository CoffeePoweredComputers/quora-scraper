It\u2019s healthy for you to question your qualifications, to recognize your good fortune, to tally up your lucky breaks. It keeps you grateful, it keeps you humble, and it helps you to plan for a fall. Just don\u2019t let it dominate you. It\u2019s like an old friend who\u2019s kind of hard to take but who sometimes gives you good leads. Meet him for a drink, but don\u2019t let him move into your house. ",

Once you\u2019re actually at your max level (you can do the work, but it costs you a lot of time and energy), you dial back. Now you know you\u2019re in you\u2019re comfort zone again. Actually you just really need the experience thatching can do more than you\u2019re doing now ;) ",
