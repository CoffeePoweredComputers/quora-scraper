            "answer_text": "The answer is one for practitioners, not patients: an app to walk people through the steps necessary to do a differential diagnosis. Suppose someone comes in to see their primary care physician with a severe skin rash. What are the appropriate steps to take to determine whether it\u2019s eczema, or impetigo, or a fungal infection, or something else? A doctor will probably remember how to distinguish between the most common problems, but a physician\u2019s assistant may struggle, and anyone but a dermatologist may not think of the less common potential causes. And that\u2019s just one example. Think of the dizzying array of things that can go wrong with a person. Many of these get passed on to specialists, creating substantial additional costs and delays, just because generalists aren\u2019t confident in how to diagnose and treat them. Yet, the set of steps is usually straightforward, like a flowchart: does the patient have symptom X? If yes, do test Y. If not, does the patient have symptom Z? There is no way that an app could replace medical judgment, or eliminate specialists. But it could serve as a extremely valuable resource for practitioners, distilling down well-established guidelines into step-by-step guides. Attempts to do this with desktop applications have been heavily opposed by doctors. But when they\u2019ve actually been used, the quality of care skyrockets. It\u2019s simply impossible for one person to remember the whole realm of medicine, and best practice guidelines get refined frequently. An app that would not intrude so much on the interaction, and was pitched as a helpful tool rather than an \u201cexpert system\u201d might get more traction. If it did, the savings to the healthcare system would potentially be huge. ",
