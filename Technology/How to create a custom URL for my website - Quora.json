            "answer_text": "When you say a working URL,  DO YOU MEAN MAKING A WEBSITE...  if so the easiest way for making and registering them a Custom Url...  The one you type in the address bar for logging to a website (as in www.google.co.in)  is by using Websites like Godaddy. Com  Domain names GoDaddy or using WordPress.com: Create a free website or blog ... These hosts will register it and pay for the name for free and for premium users you'll have to foot the registrar fees,  and you will get a domain name without their commercial name tag.  What i have used is WordPress. Com and it has a free and paid version for getting domain names and registering them to Internet (just meant making them searchable)  The hard way is by individually hosting a server, which can be your pc., getting a static IP address from your I. S. P(INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER) ,  and finally... Getting a domain name involves registering the name you want with an organisation called ICANN through a domain name registrar. For example, if you choose a name like \"Example Domain\", you will have to go to a registrar, pay a registration fee that costs around US$10 to US$35 for that name. That will give you the right to the name for a year, and you will have to renew it annually for (usually) the same amount per annum. Also .com. .in ,.uk,  .gov etc.  Have their own price tags..  Hope this was what you where asking for ",
