            "answer_text": "This really depends on how you take your screenshot. On my laptop, I typically press windows key+print screen which captures the whole screen. If this is how you took screenshots, you can find them in a folder called \u201cScreenshots\u201d. Another method is where you press print screen and you crop out the area which you want to take a screen shot. Then a notification from snipping tool will appear and you can then edit and save your screenshot. Hopes this helps. Edit: I forgot to add that if you press the print screen button and screenshot, your image will also be saved to the clipboard, where you can get it from pressing Ctrl V. ",

Definitely a better program than default \u2018Print Screen\u2019 images.You can set the save location so the screenshots you take are easily accessed instead of stumbling around your whole PC to find them.
