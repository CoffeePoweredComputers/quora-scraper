If you're able to validate demand for a certain feature among actual users of your app, and if it's technically feasible, you can always add the feature into a future release. This is why you should maintain a relationship with the mobile app developer you hire. They can help with ongoing maintenance, as well as build new functionality for you in the future. List your app on other app storesYes, there are other app stores outside of the Apple App Store and Google Play store. A few examples include the Amazon Appstore, AppsLib, SlideMe, AppBrain, and others. Consider app store optimization (ASO)Similar to search engine optimization (SEO), app store optimization (ASO) improves your app\u2019s ranking directly by making small adjustments to your app store listing. It consists of a variety of tactics, such as adding relevant keywords in your app\u2019s title and including screenshots in the preview section. Apps are typically found with only a quick search, so ASO is key to making your app more discoverable to potential users. Also, you can promote your app by your own or with help from companies like MoPeak. They provide full marketing promotion services and help make your app to get the highest position in the Top. Also their experienced Mobile Marketing Team will make your app visible and popular for thousands of new users. If you\u2019ve had low ratings and poor reviews in the past, order their review service in order to get stable relevant reviews made by real users. Hope this helps:) ",

            "answer_text": "Right now, if you want the full experience on a web service you have to install an app. Even if you only want to book one ticket, you have to install the app of the provider, fulfill the booking process in order to then uninstall the app again. Data from AppsMarketer shows that almost 30 percent of apps are installed only for one day.  So wouldn\u2019t it be great if the full app is loaded in the web and you don\u2019t have to actually download it to use it only once? Well, that\u2019s exactly what Google announced this year with Android Instant Apps. And I think this will be the next thing after mobile apps. Android Instant Apps ",

To earn positive image and become visible for your targeted audience is not an easy task when you have new app with no rating and reviews. You can find cheapest installs on platforms like MoPeak or KeenMobi. They provide $0.04 CPI for Android Installs from real users. Also, the retention is 3 days ;) However, look at App store optimization (ASO) which is a key component of your app succeeding. It is an effective promotion search tool in Google Play and App Store. Hope it helps. ",
