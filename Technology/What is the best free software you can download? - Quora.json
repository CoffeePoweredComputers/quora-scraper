            "answer_text": "Linux. I use it for pretty much everything. I happen to use Ubuntu, which is lazy of me. Because Ubuntu occasionally lets non-free software onto my computer in the form of video-card drivers, Flash players etc. to make my life simpler. But apart from that, everything else is free software. Ubuntu is based on the Debian package manager. Which is one of the great triumphs of free software. It\u2019s what makes it so easy to manage a system like Linux. I\u2019m writing this in Firefox. Another wonderful piece of free software I use almost every hour of every day that I\u2019m online. Here is some more free software which I use all the time and find incredibly useful : git (to manage the source code of all my projects)emacs (a superpowerful editor)Python and many of its standard librariesPandoc and LaTeX for making documents (I usually write them in Markdown)Clojure (my favourite language) and Leiningen (a very useful build / dependency tool)the open-source version of the Java Virtual Machine (to run Clojure programs)meld (for diffing directories and projects)youtube-dl (for grabbing Youtube video) and ffmpegaudacity for audio editingevince for reading PDFsgedit for simple text editingmind traffic control (my own todo / task management software interstar/MTC-CLJ )my own wiki software which I use to organize a lot of writing / thoughts : interstar/ThoughtStormsProcessing and Sonic Pi / Supercollider for music and art",
