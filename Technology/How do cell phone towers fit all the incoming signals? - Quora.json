            "answer_text": "That is a great question! the whole idea of cellular technology is building multiple cell sites to cover smaller geographical areas and then have them communicate to each other. The easiest way to describe it is that one cell site (depending on its height, terrain and surrounding obstructions) can provide a quarter mile to about 1 mile of coverage in an urban/suburban environment. the number of users served by a cell site would be in the thousands. The theory is that not everybody makes a phone call at the same instant in time so the airwaves are sliced such that numerous simultaneous users can use the network. To add more capacity more frequencies are added. When the consumers start moving out of the cell tower\u2019s coverage area they hand off seamlessly to another cell tower that is covering the neighboring area. It really is fascinating how all of it works! ",

            "answer_text": "The cellular signals (4G) work in such a way that the mobile phones ( for uplink) need to request the base station for a grant. The base station has certain time to approve the grant. The mobile phone sends the data to the base station based on the grant provided. The grant contains the frequency, bandwidth and time slot negotiated between the mobile and the base stations. All these events happen so fast (in microseconds). If the grant is rejected, the mobile phone will continue to keep trying until it gets one. The downlink is much easier, since base station already knew all this information it can serve specific mobile phones on specific time and frequency slots based on the scheduler design. ",
