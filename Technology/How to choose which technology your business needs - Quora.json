            "answer_text": "Choosing the technology is certainly a difficult proposition and this needs careful attention. Technology from outside India is costly, Chinese tech is cost effective but not trustworthy, Indian Technology is rarely original and not dependable, technology from CSIR laboratories have very less takers and this is how an average Indian thinks. The above do not include the IT sector. In this scenario, you have to choose a technology. India runs with JUGAAD and our prevailing technology is not second to any. We are also exporting a large number of manufactured goods,e.g. pharmaceuticals. My suggestion to you is that enter the INDIAMART and find out the manufacturers of machinery , reach them, see them functioning, get yourself satisfied, bargain ad buy the technology. ",
