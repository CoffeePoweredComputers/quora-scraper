Ideally any gadgets with analog circuitry you will found many useful components depending on the product- SpeakersHeatsinksScrewsWiresSmall transformersChokesInductorsCapacitors - both good and bad, both electrolytic and ceremic. If it is a power supply you will get X caps, Y caps, tantulum, multilayers. Ignore SMD components, waste of time.Diodes- Bridge, zener, clamper, TVS, Rectifier. If it is a power supply you will get high ampere diode rectifiers.Motors- if the circuit have it always get this first.Resistors, variable resistors.TrimmersAmplifiers.TransistorsLedsPcb boards and excellent routing guidelines, it is a place you can learn something in every pcbs.Connectors.Various specific analog ics, go through the datasheets.19. Fuse and fuse holders 20. Ptc and ntc. If it is a digital one- CrystalUnusable microcontrollersLcd displays or some time seven segments.If it is small device, chamces are you can get shift register ics too.SensorsUsb connectorsMemory, EepromPush buttons.5V, 3.3V or 1.8V voltage regulators.Small coin batteries.",
