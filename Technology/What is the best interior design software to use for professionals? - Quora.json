            "answer_text": "Here in my networking, it depends on which firm/consultant you will apply to. They usually have different requirements, and sometimes there is also some consultant that have no restrictions. But if you\u2019re a freelancer or self-employed that can freely choose the software you\u2019ll be going to use, mostly the essential software that is used and needed are: AutoCAD for 2D layout, SketchUp for 3D modeling, and V-ray for 3D rendering. Actually, you can freely choose and use whatever software you enjoy and good at while working on the project. Because the most important (mostly for the clients) is the final result. And that doesn't always depend on the software you are using. As long as you enjoy using your favorite software, then use it! I personally use AutoCAD for 2D layout, SketchUp for 3D modeling, and 3ds Max Corona Render for 3D rendering. But the first time I learn to make 2D layout, I used ArchiCAD because it\u2019s easier but it\u2019s quite laggy compared to AutoCAD. But the more you can use multiple software, the better. And make sure you have your own favorite software to be mastered at. Or mastered them all.. but we always have that \u2018favorite\u2019 one, right? Thank you Aisha for the question, good luck to you! ",
