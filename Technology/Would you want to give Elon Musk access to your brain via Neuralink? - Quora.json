            "answer_text": "The idea of accessing the brain sounds spooky, but it is about stimulating certain part of the brain that control neurological functions. It is not about \u201creading your mind\u201d in the sense that is can read your dreams, hopes, fears, aspirations, sexual attraction to another person, memories of childhood, your visual memory of your grandmother, the smell of roses, and the warmth of the sun. Elon Musk is a tech entertainer who has read too many science (cyber) fiction tales. People have been fantasizing about brain-reading machines and copying the brain\u2019s \u201ccontent\u201d to digital computers for decades. There are at least two problems making this currently impossible. For one, the brain is not \u201cthing\u201d. It is a process. You can\u2019t pull the plug or isolate it from its \u201chost\u201d - the body. The brain, like the body as a whole, has genetic memory. It \u201cremembers\u201d your ancestors from many thousands of your ago. Moreover, humans have consciousness (evolved instinct) which we do not yet fully understand - how it develops, where it resides, where nature ends and nurture begins, etc. Using binary computers to decode and copy or reconstituting the brain assumes that the brain is a binary organ. Some \u201cmechanisms\u201d and functions of the brain can be interpreted as binary (neurons firing on and off), but the brain also involves analog processes. The techies will claim you can convert any analog information to binary data. True and false. \u201cDigital\u201d music doesn\u2019t exist. We sample the analog sound wave and give a binary number to each sample. For playback, we convert the binary data back to an analog signal. After all, the ear is an analog organ. Sampling involves a minor loss of information (the space between the samples). Music is sampled 44.000 times a second, so we do not notice the loss of information. But imagine sampling brains wave and missing the slightest information. It would impair the copied brain in ways we cannot predict. The analog-digital dichotomy means that we can *simulate* but not *duplicate* neurobiological processes. The analog-digital dichotomy is a blind-spot in the tech community. It was a big topic at the legendary Macy Conferences, which set the stage for the digital revolution. The issue was shelved as unresolved business, which it still is. Freeman Dyson one of the few curious intellectuals to have tackled the issue in recent years. IS LIFE ANALOG OR DIGITAL? ",

            "answer_text": "I would be wary until the technology is tried and tested but neural computer interfaces are the future I think the most likely development in the short term (10 years or less) will be brain neural interfaces such as Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink, ultimately these interfaces will lead to whole brain emulation, a technology is where the brain is uploaded to a digital medium and increasingly enhanced and replaced with non biological components until it reaches a stage where the non biological components can model the biological part so accurately the original brains loss would be irrelevant from a functional perspective. This technology is now progressing quite quickly with lots of current research taking place, it is hard however to put an exact time-frame on what will arrive when although we may reach this point much earlier than expected, clearly whole brain emulation has the potential to encounter significant difficulties which are unforeseeable from where we stand currently but it's quite possible that nanotechnology will speed up the development and even just being connected to the internet would massively increase the biological brains capabilities. I see some sort of significant progress toward this objective within 10 years, whole brain emulation I feel will be 30/40 years further down the road but nanotech might change that as could some sort of unforseen technological breakthrough.
