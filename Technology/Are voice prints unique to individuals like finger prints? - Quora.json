            "answer_text": "Let me start by first admitting that I have little experience about voice biometric recognition. This is however an interesting area that I am also looking at carrying out research in. Back to answering your question. Usually we humans are able to recognize one another from our voices. I can tell from a crowd in the dark that my brother is among a group of people talking in the dark at a corner somewhere because I can hear his unique voice even though I cannot see him. Biometric Authentication basically makes attempt to do what humans can do and if possible do it even better or faster. Voice biometric signatures are supposed to be unique but you and I know about those kids in high school who could perfectly mimic their peers, teachers or authority figures perfectly. Comedians too have a way of mimicking politicians or celebrities almost to near precision. Based on the ability of other humans to mimic other human voices, I also doubt that voice biometric prints can be concretely relied upon to determine unique identity of an individual. It could even be possible that parrots could beat voice biometric recognition. Let me promise that I will come back to update this answer once I have studied in depth how voice biometric recognition works so that I can give a much more informed response. Hope this answer helps.
