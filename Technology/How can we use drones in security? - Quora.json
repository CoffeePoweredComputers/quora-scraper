            "answer_text": "How can drones improve security? Drones can improve security in many ways. Improved Vantage Point: Having a higher vantage point allows a wider field of view giving a better overall picture.Cover More Ground: Drones/UAVs can cover more ground faster without getting tired. I would bet 1 drone can cover 3 guards routes in half the time.Cameras To Record: Most Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) are carrying body mounted cameras these days. And with good reason! Private security should be doing the same.Camera Variations: BeBeing able to mount and utilize multiple cameras on one drone is priceless. Inferred and night vision cameras are extremely useful in any surveillance situation. You can't hide from modern technology.Automatic Subject Tracking: Drones can lock on to its target and simply follow them.Multiple Drones With One Operator: One drone pilot is capable of operating more than one drone (with training and waivers). I suppose you could say one security manager could instruct multiple security guards, but not as efficiently (shy of military style ops).I could list more but this will get your mind thinking. With today's technology, your imagination is your limit. In the right hands, we can do amazing things. But in today's world, for every good use we find for something, someone else is bound to find two other ways to use it for harm. Unfortunately in the end, they will still be controlled with human interaction. This will always be a weak point. But don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting SkyNet either! ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine a huge crowd at a concert. There are thousands of people. Security, obviously, needs dire attention. In the age of technology, just having security personnel deployed in a huge concert would be beyond stupid. Likewise, a CCTV cannot be particularly useful in a concert where a static camera is nothing more than a useless prop. There is an obvious need for a bird\u2019s eye view. And that\u2019s precisely where the drones come in. Just like a concert, there are several other scenarios where a drone can be put to use. Drones could be used to guard prisons, patrol factory perimeters etc. The need for a bird\u2019s eye view calls for the usage of a drone. You can read more about how drones could be used for security measures here. ",

How could a remote, reliable, relatively low-cost, automatic, programmable, constant, immutably operating machine contribute to achieving desired values along those parameters? What are the consequences of the inevitable negatives? ",

Which could be better in various ways as follows; Faster taking out an guard would be way easier than taking out a drone which is connected to the security network and AI controlled.Drones will be impartial in most of the ways. As compared to an human guard driven by feelings, emotion and money.restless working! A drones will work for hours without getting tired.Apart from that it has some disadvantages too. ",
