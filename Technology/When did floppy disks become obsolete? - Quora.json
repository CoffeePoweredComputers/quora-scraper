            "answer_text": "Better removable media came along. There were actually several kinds of floppy disk, if you really want to be nitpicky about it. Each got obsolescent and then obsolete in turn. The 3.5\u2033 disks are the newest and best of them; you can actually still find them (and readers) new though you are right in that they are basically obsolete. As to why\u2026 first came those Zip drives, ejectable hard drives, and CD-Rs. I remember when those seemed so awesome. They kind of co-existed with floppies as they were more expensive, but they could also store much more data. Then came removable flash storage: memory cards and USB drives. These were basically better in every way than anything that came before: faster, more durable, higher capacity, more portable. They got steadily cheaper over time too. These are the current removable storage standard and what made the older types obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "The writable CD units were not the death knell of the floppy disks - after all, writable CDs and DVDs cover a totally different use case than floppies (writing anything on a CD or DVD took about a minute for the \u201ctable of content\u201d which was written at low speed, so for small files a floppy disk was much faster with a write time in seconds. Also, the first CDs had a total capacity of about 400 floppy disks, and it increased to about 500+ floppy disks). The floppy disks (and rewritable CDs and DVDs) were made obsolete by the \u201cmemory sticks\u201d (USB memory storage) - write speed comparable to floppy disks for small files (i.e. seconds, and add some more seconds for ejecting them), write speed better than CDs for large files (1+ minute for CD-size data is faster than the fastest CDs/DVDs), and practically indestructible (unlike floppy disks).
