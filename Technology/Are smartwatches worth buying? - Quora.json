            "answer_text": "11 reasons you should buy a smartwatch\uff1a 1. Notifications The ease of having them sent to your wrist and being able to identify their importance without removing your phone from a pocket or bag is invaluable. It simplifies your life and it saves time - and time is important. 2. Social etiquette Checking your phone can be rude. Replacing that with a quick glance at your wrist is quicker, simpler and subtler. 3. Internet of Things I can control the volume of my Sonos sound system with a few taps on my wrist, I can also turn Hue lights on and off. Again, it's quicker and simpler than retrieving a phone, and the Internet of Things and 'Smart Home' technology is only set to expand. 4. Travel During Apple's 'Spring Forward' event, Tim Cook demonstrated the Apple Watch being used to get through airport security by displaying the user's boarding pass directly on the watch screen. Anything that makes the airport security process easier is a benefit. 5. Answering calls Various smartwatches handle answering calls differently. The Sony Smartwatch 3, for example, allows users to accept and decline calls on the watch, but activates the phone's speaker and microphone (or headphones, if plugged in) for the conversation. This is helpful when walking around with headphones on, or while driving, when your smartphone isn't easily accessible. Others, such as the Apple Watch, allow users to answer and carry out conversations directly from the watch (the phone may remain in your bag). This may make you feel like Dick Tracy, and it's not the ideal way to answer every call, but it does come in useful for quick conversations when you can't get to you mobile. 6. Fitness I've had a Fitbit, worn it for several weeks, then forgotten about it - it's a common problem with dedicated fitness trackers. All smartwatches are capable of step counting, and most will run fitness apps such as Endomondo and Strava. The benefit of smartwatches is that they hook users in with other useful features, making them less likely to be sidelined. 7. Music You can walk around town listening to music on the phone in your pocket, if a track comes on that you don't like then simply hit 'next' on your smartwatch. You can also pause, adjust the volume or line-up the next track. It's sounds trivial, but it really does make listening to music easier. 8. Battery life One of the biggest drains on your mobile's battery life is that big, high-resolution display - as a smartwatch reduces the amount of time that large screen needs to be on, it can have a significant impact on battery life. And before you question whether being connected to a wearable all-day drains the battery - most use efficient Bluetooth 4.0, which isn't power hungry at all. 9. Customisation Being able to change your watch face everyday is surprisingly fun, on the weekends I can walk around with a dancing Micky Mouse on my wrist, but at the Monday morning office meeting I can wear a more professional watch face. 10. Security Ever found yourself in a rough area at night and too afraid to get your \u00a3600 smartphone out? Luckily a smartwatch is a lot more discreet (well, as long as you don't go flashing your \u00a38000 Apple Watch around). 11. Navigation And finally we come to navigation - getting around an unknown city is much easier with a smartwatch. Directions are sent to your wrist, telling you when and where to turn next. Walking around while following directions on your mobile increases the chance of that glass and aluminium baby meeting the cold, hard concrete. Reducing the chance of this happening is another major benefit to wearables. Of course, the main argument against smartwatches is that they simply do everything a smartphone can, which is true, but they're not there to replace your phone - they're there to complement it, and make your life that little bit easier. If you know these reasons and want to buy a smart watch. If you are interested in smart watches, then you can read this article. The article introduces 10 smart watches. They are all very good smart watches. I highly recommend it to you. For example, Apple Watch Series 5, Garmin Venu Smartwatch and so on.

            "answer_text": "My answer refers to my experience with my Samsung\u201d S3 Classic\u201d Bluetooth (not LTE) which I have owned for a few weeks. I paid $199 on sale direct from Samsung, less $25 I had in Samsung points from using the Samsung Pay credit card app on my phone. I only purchased it after seeing how well my son\u2019s Frontier S3 model functioned for him. The S3 has MST (magnetic swipe technology) and can make contactless payments on credit card terminals that only accept magnetic swipes as well as the newer terminals that use contactless NFC. I make easy credit card transactions using Samsung Pay app on nearly any credit card terminal. The newer Samsung \u201cGalaxy\u201d smartwatch does not have MST technology and requires a terminal with NFC when using the Samsung Pay app. I have been using Samsung Pay on my Samsung Galaxy S7 phone for nearly two years and love it. Many retailers and merchants have yet to upgrade to accept contactless payments but the S3 works on most (all?) of these older systems that require a card swipe. I frequently have cashiers tell me when they notice me holding my phone (and now smartwatch) near the terminal that it won\u2019t work on their system only to be surprised when the transaction is processed. The S3 smartwatch is faster and easier than using my phone. The app uses tokens or a virtual number instead of the actual credit card number, so provides an extra level of security. I can use my voice to initiate texts and phone calls directly on the watch while my phone remains in my pocket. This is especially helpful during the colder months when I am wearing jackets with lots of my phone is buried in an inside pocket. I have missed many calls while trying to get my phone out. Or if I left my phone in my jacket or downstairs etc. I still have my watch on to receive calls and notifications. Also when driving I can use the watch to text, which is disabled in my (current) car\u2019s system unless I am stopped. (I only do short quick texts while driving). It can all be done via the S Voice app without having to touch the screen. I have had to adjust the name of a few contacts as the voice recognition did not always recognize or distinguish certain similar sounding names. There are some 3rd party apps that can be installed to allow the watch to better manage notifications. Samsung\u2019s \u201cS Voice\u201d works but can be slow depending on what you need to do. Asking to navigate to a destination will take longer than a less complex request like \u201ccall\u2026\u201d a contact. Perhaps if you download the map base to your phone it would be faster but I have not wanted to bother installing the map base. These little smartwatches do not have the processing power of a modern smartphone and should not be expected to perform at the same levels. They may also be transferring data from the phone. The texting and phone dialing has worked well for me. I have not found a situation where I would have wanted to use it for navigation. I can quickly see notifications and reply, mark as \u201cread\u201d or delete without pulling out my phone. I can easily see the weather either by a single swipe of the screen, using the S Voice function ,widget or from a link built in to certain watch faces. Yes the phone has it bit this is another example of something that is just easier on the watch. I am doing much better at keeping track of my heart rate and steps since the watch is always on my wrist. Often I would not be carrying my phone if at home or work etc. The info syncs with the Samsung Health app on my phone. The \u201cFind my phone\u201dapp\u201d has proven a great convenience too. I use it nearly daily! There are many watch faces available. I have installed about 30 free ones. Some even have built in shortcuts to apps like Calendar, weather, health, timer etc. Most I have installed display both 12 and 24 hour times as well as battery, steps, heart rate, day and date. This Samsung watch is easy to charge and uses a wireless charging dock with a built in magnet to hold the watch in place. No need t plug in a tiny USB plug. I have replaced the watch band with one with a deployment clasp making it easy to take off and charge at night. I found the leather one supplied to be a bit stiff and cumbersome. I have not had any reason to use the GPS capability as I would typically just use my phone\u2019s Google or car\u2019s systems. There is a built in SOS feature that will send and track your location to phone numbers that you have pre-programmed. Pressing the \u201cHome\u201d button 3 times will activate the SOS. There is no builtin native navigation but there are apps available to install. I installed \u201cHere WeGo\u201d a free navigation app that is recommended by some. It seemed to work well but I don\u2019t believe it is a replacement for my Google Maps or car\u201ds GPS system. I installed a calculator app that comes in handy for calculating tips or tax without being obvious. Also a flashlight app turns the screen in to a light that helps read menus in dark restaurants. I use the timer, opening and setting by voice. You can set a custom prompt to open the S Voice dialogue. I set it to open with \u201cengage voice function\u201d. The link to a timer on a watchface I installed did not open a timer. I failed to realize the watch does not have a native timer app. I only had to install a timer app though the Samsung Gear app. Same with the stop watch app. All is good now! There is a music player but I still use my phone for music. A complaint many have is the lack of apps compared to the Android Wear OS watches. I have not found this to be an issue as there are enough to make the device very convenient and useful. There is nothing you can\u2019t do with a smartphone but the watch makes certain things much easier for me but it will depend on individual needs and habits. Another complaint is the battery life which Samsung can claim to be up to 4 days but most seem to get 2 days, as seems to be my experience. It is not a problem for me since I charge overnight just as I do with my phone. It is possible to put it in watch only mode which can extend the battery for a few weeks Samsung says. I am aware some smartwatches have longer battery life but it is not a big deal for me. I am use to charging nightly. I have to admit I had been skeptical but have found it has made life easier and I would not want to be without it. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a Seiko 5 that made in February 1969. Has a day/date complication. It\u2019s still working and is accurate to within 15 seconds per day, usually within 10 seconds. Ought to take it in and have it serviced with cleaning and relube after 51 years, but a timegrapher shows it\u2019s still got decent balance wheel amplitude, and its beat is steady. Not a high priority. I\u2019ve got a few others over 45 years old that need to be cleaned and serviced more than it does. By comparison, a \u201csmartwatch\u201d will be obsolete in about two and certainly within three years. In the era of 1970 mechanical watches, one that was only good for a couple of years was considered a throwaway - much like a zero jewel pin lever escapement watch with a chrome plated \u201cbase metal\u201d case you could buy for a dollar or two at Kmart. If it died after a couple years, you pitched it and bought another. They were considered \u201cbeaters\u201d by miners, heavy equipment mechanics, millwrights, oil drillers, military and others who tended to bash and thrash watches to death very quickly on the job. That was the same era of $1.25/hour minimum wage. If it lasted even six months, the price was right for a throwaway beater. Now consider the price of a smartwatch and amortize that across two and three years, its technological lifespan. Doesn\u2019t matter if it still powers up or not, or recharges or not. It\u2019s technologically obsolete and won\u2019t \u201cconnect\u201d with anything, making it worthless. Welcome to \u201cprogrammed obsolescence\u201d in which consumer electronics manufacturers deliberately make the electronics they sell you worthless within several years. Buy an Apple Watch for $300 and it amortizes to $100-$150 per year of useful service - and that\u2019s a lower priced one. Up it to the $450 model and it\u2019s $150-$225 per year. For that much I expect it to wash the windows and launder my clothes. I see all the gizmo stuff they allegedly do and am truly amazed how I managed to survive the 1960\u2019s, 1970\u2019s, 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s without any of it. Cute, but adds nothing of any real, tangible, value to my life . . . and it certainly would not saving me any time. The cost-benefit ratio is appallingly abysmal. Yet one more fancy gizmo to get money from your pocket to theirs . . . in large quantity every two years. ",

            "answer_text": " Are smartwatches worth buying or am I better off with a durable plain watch? A smartwatch is as durable/longterm as a mobile phone. This is the sad truth. As they are objects bound to technology, they are going to be superseded by other devices as time goes by. So, eventually your smartwatch in a few years will become a memento of times gone. Maybe worth to someone as a curio, but definitely not something you are going to wear each day every day. I could be wrong, of course - I do not have a scrying ball where I can see into the future - but it has happened like this is almost every niche connected to the technology field. I will make you an example of what happened to me. As for myself, I remember buying a notepad-cum-GPS, something like 10/15 years ago. Boy, what a useless piece of junk it was! It drew enormous battery juice - like having a four to six hours reserve before charging. If you used the GPS intensively, the reserve of power was severely reduced. And the worst part is that it cost a small fortune. I used it until the thrill of the new gizmo faded, wounded by its obvious technical issues, and quietly the device found its resting place in a drawer, until I threw it away when its batteries leaked and rendered it useless for good. If I had spent that money on a good watch (and I could have bought a somewhat nice one - possibly in the 1.500/2.000 USD range when new - I would have used it for all this time without it losing value and eventually ending up in the trash bin. Now that I think about it, it has been one of the worst buying decisions in all my life. So, my educated advice is to think twice before spending your money. I do not want to deter you from buying a smartwatch, but I urge you to spend as little as you can on something that will become obsolete soon. There are some nice watches which do not cost a fortune, so you would be good buying one of those, knowing beforehand that it is a - ehm - disposable device that will probably end up in a drawer sooner or later. If you want to buy a smartwatch, one that I could consider right now is the Skagen Connected, at about USD 150 (limited set of interaction with this, as it is an analogic display one), or the Skagen Falster, at USD 250, if you really want to splurge and want a true lcd device on your wrist. I like their style - even if I know for sure that Skagen, since its buying by the Fossil Group, has lowered its standards of quality, unfortunately. I have always had a strange passion for Skagen, even if I know very well that they are cheaply made watches - but hey, just bear with me. So, my friend, your choice. But if I had to spend my money somewhere, I would first of all buy a good watch (most possibly, a nice second-wrist watch), and a smartwatch (eventually) with what is left of that money. And if you plan carefully, you may just do that: a simple, good second-wrist mechanical from the sicties would cost you around 200 USD. With the Skagen, you would add other 150 USD. The total of 350 USD would buy you a new Apple Watch.

My husband is a stroke victim\u2026he was left with very limited mobility and almost no speech or means of communication. He is on the same level as a toddler, unable to read, write or even turn on the TV. Knowing that I had to change a lot of the things I had previously taken for granted\u2026. I have a programable wall phone that no matter what number you push, it automatically goes to 911. That was the only means of instant help I had in the beginning\u2026. When I heard the iWatch had a GPS and a one button 911 feature, I knew I needed that. Although a cell phone does the same, locating it when things get chaotic is a feat in itself. Cell phones can be anywhere and when you are trying to focus on the immediate problem, good luck with that. That was my reason for the purchase. He needs help, it\u2019s always with me on my wrist, no searching, it\u2019s there. And keep in mind, chaos can happen while driving far from home\u2026..so those \u201chelp I can\u2019t get up\u201d devises are still a part-time help, and he would not understand what to do with it anyway. I needed something for me, and the IWatch solved the problem. Now after having had it for a while\u2026.I can\u2019t imagine how I got along without it. It does everything my other Apple products do. I won't go into details, but it\u2019s the most comforting experience you can have. If staying on top of everything \u201cenergizes\u201dyou, then a smartwatch is for you. ",

We should investigate a portion of those advantages. Notifications You're out with companions. Everybody has their telephones heaped in the focal point of the table. First to take a gander at their telephone loses. It's an incredible method to urge vis-\u00e0-vis mingling. Nobody gets a handle on left, nobody passes up the discussion consumed in the most recent images. No more warning of the President's most recent tweets. In any case, you're sitting tight for a significant message from your chief. Or then again your mother. Or on the other hand your accomplice. You realize you can just keep going so some time before you have to go after your telephone, to be safe. Wearing a smartwatch might be cheating, however it works. Your telephone will naturally send you notices of the messages and calls you get on your telephone. Rather than getting your telephone, and perhaps the tab, you simply look at your wrist. In the event that it's significant, you know immediately. In the event that it's nothing, you can proceed immediately in the discussion. Getting notices without pulling out your telephone is one of the fundamental advantages of a smartwatch. It's likewise helpful when you're anticipating a significant call at work. Leave your telephone on quiet so it won't divert you. However long you can see your watch, you'll never miss the significant stuff. Different notices are similarly useful. Schedule updates, office gatherings, date evenings, and other significant updates likewise show on smartwatch faces. In case you're somebody who is going around throughout the day, continually checking an organizer or electronic schedule to remain on target, this administration is significant. Realizing you'll have the option to get significant notices when they happen likewise adds to your true serenity. You may wind up investing less energy in your telephone just in light of the fact that the dread that you'll miss something significant is less. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can get one cheaply, maybe. Otherwise no. I\u2019ve had an LG Watch Sport for over a year. I paid $160 for it on eBay. At that price, I\u2019m happy with it. If I\u2019d have paid more, I would probably feel like a bit of a sucker. That said, even being happy with my purchase, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d repeat it. The utility is questionable. If I did repeat it, it would mainly be for the convenience of getting my notifications right on my wrist. Pros: It\u2019s super nice to not have to keep pulling your phone out of your pocket every time you receive a notification or call.If you have a cellular-enabled watch, it\u2019s a great backup phone that can work without your smartphone in case you forgot to bring it with you.Can provide GPS if you get lost and don\u2019t have your phone on you.Some fitness tracking features can be useful.Some models provide RFID payment capability, so you can just tap your wrist to the terminal when purchasing something. It\u2019s a cool feature.Cons: They don\u2019t do as much as you think, or at least, it\u2019s not comfortable to do all of the things that they technically can do on such a small screen.Cannot reasonably browse the web or message people. They can do these things, but it\u2019s so cumbersome that it\u2019s not worth the effort.Battery life is usually awful unless you disable all of the features that make it useful.The OS situation is a disaster.Most of them are bulky and look cheap. If you care about that. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that they have to cram into these things. The ones that aren\u2019t annoyingly bulky are only thinner because they lack some of the nicer features and can leave out components.",

            "answer_text": "IMHO, No. And my reasons are two-fold: a) A smartwatch is first and foremost - A watch. And regular watches last a lot longer on a single battery than a smart watch does in a single charge. b) I am more or less going to refer to my phone for more detailed information about a particular notification - Frustratingly owing to the fact that I would\u2019ve disabled functionality on my smartwatch to eke out more battery life to serve (a). When the Moto 360 came out in 2014, I was an early adopter (and my G-Shock had just exhausted its battery) ,wanting to try out this fancy new gadget that offered immediate notifications without having to look at my phone. I was able to : Read my emails.Attend calls.Navigate through Google Maps.Change songs through Spotify / SoundCloud.Add reminders and use Google Now in general.Reply to Skype / WhatsApp messages.I was even able to opt from a slew of watch faces which was super-cool!Every night, I would place the watch in it\u2019s charging dock and it would charge within 45 minutes. This is what eventually wore down the smart watch for me. Yes, I know the 1st Gen Moto 360 was never going to have awesome battery life but I want one less device (apart from my two phones, my laptop) to worry about as far as charging is concerned. For comparison, my G-Shock lasted 7 years before the battery died. Besides, once my work emails started appearing on my phone, my watch died in half day because of the amount of notifications that popped out. I was running more or less in Airplane mode just to conserve battery\u2026. which defeated the purpose of a smartwatch. In the end, I have my trusted Seiko Solar Chronograph and a Citizen Navihawk running on Light energy. They may not show me my notifications\u2026 but I will never run out of battery on these devices.

Notifications that I notice and others do not (my iPhone is normally on silent in my pocket) mostly Google calendar appointments, Todoist reminders and SMS.Caller ID (as above). (Now also for dialling when driving with my phone bluetoothed to the car - I just say \"Hey Siri, phone wife or phone sister\")A remote control for my music as I run, because sometimes you just want to skip that track (phone in backpack, Bluetooth earbuds). Similarly for my Sonos system. (Yes, still use it for that but lack of physical buttons is less useful than the Pebble for changing tracks while running).A not to bright torch when checking on the kids at night (a quick flick of the wrist gives a few seconds of backlight). (Apple Watch less useful for this but the kids are a year older so less of an issue).Silent alarm clock (I wake up half an hour before the wife and kids of a morning). (Apple watch less useful here as the battery life is not as good as the Pebble, I have to remember to stick it on the charger while I shower to top up the battery).Weather app (Darksky on the Apple Watch has proved useful, basically a quick notification when - UK so no if - it is going to rain).Bus time / next bus appNavigation (linked to the satnav app on my phone it gives me a nudge and show the next direction when driving or walking somewhere new).Oh, and a watch.But it is not really a watch. It is a personal assistant that happens to be small enough to fit on a strap on my wrist. ",

You can even pay for purchases on your card with them. They look good as well, nothing says stylish more than a fancy new smart watch on your arm. Plus, it syncs nicely with your phone and computer, so you can access everything all the time. However, there are a few disadvantages to smart watches as well. One of these is the fact that they are very expensive, with the entry level models starting at around \u00a3300. They can break easily, and the cost of repair is often the same as the purchase price. Plus, it can be hard to tell the time and you end up having to flick your arm in a most dramatic manner. They can also be fiddly to use and the novelty soon wears off. They are fun to play with, and can be useful to some people, but for the majority they end up a novelty. The Traditional Watch: Pros and Cons There are some advantages to the traditional watch. It can be simple or complex, but without the latest technology installed. They are much more varied and come in a variety of styles and with a wide range of price tags. It is easy to tell the time with them, and some will be able to tell you the date and even the current weather, but without the need for expensive technology. It doesn't have bugs, it doesn't need to be restarted when encountering an error (as there are none), and there are no frustrating synch issues. They are made with care and precision; you can feel the passion the watchmaker had when constructing each piece. In an ever advancing world, it brings you back a little. Of course, there are a couple of disadvantages too. They don't offer the same level of functionality as a smart watch, although for those who are looking to take a step back from tech, this is not all bad. The nicest ones are also often the most expensive, which can be a shame when you go to buy a traditional watch. Resource Link: Great Selection, Wooden, Mechanical and Quartz ",

            "answer_text": "As a Mac developer, I think the Apple Watch is beyond hideous, it\u2019s so awful to behold that it discredits design by calling it \u201cawful design\u201d, I think it\u2019s better just to say it wasn\u2019t designed, and save offending anyone. Battery life makes it of limited use, say if go for a weekend away, it\u2019s another charger to pack, whereas an automatic watch charges from the movement of the wrist. An Apple Watch does much more of course, but it duplicates functionality found on my phone, so I don\u2019t want to have the Apple Watch with me any more than I want a second phone with me. Unlike my Deep Blue watch, it\u2019s not waterproof, so it\u2019s doesn\u2019t present usefulness as a sports watch, to me. Worst of all perhaps, most of us are only prepared to wear one watch at a time, so it\u2019s taking a spot on my wrist which could be better used by something not so grotesque. I think a smartwatch is a solution in search of a problem, and solves the imaginary problem with the ugliest watch I\u2019ve ever seen. At least the $50 Android devices are honest about being cheap, the Apple Watch is priced expensively, but cheap, in, well, spirit. It might not be cheap like a $5 pizza, but it\u2019s cheap like a bribed police officer. Smartwatches represent the nadir of innovation in this computer industry. ",

            "answer_text": "Gadgets are fun and cool in theory. When Casio introduced a camera watch, it was cutting edge. I thought, \u201cI have got to get one of those\u201d. The pictures were B&W and had the quality of vintage photographs from the early 1900\u2019s. It was an expensive novelty. Sony made a TV watch with sketchy reception. Casio Unite and Timex Datalink were watches that interfaced with computers but had limited functionality. All those novel watches reside in a box with other sentimental tech like personal data assistants (PDA\u2019s) and electronic address books designed to make life more efficient. Their usefulness had a very short lifespan before the next generation or improvement hit the shelves. The classic mechanical watches that I bought before more and more features were crammed into a microchip, I still wear on occasion. A watch driven by quartz or mainspring does what it was intended to do - it tells the time. Most of my watches include the date, some have complications like phases of the moon. This is what a watch is intended to do, provide a record of the passage of time. Those timepieces that have special features are just examples of innovative horology. The longer people use them for this service, the more value they provide through the years. I was tempted to purchase a smart watch but the daily or weekly recharging was a huge turnoff. Regardless of all the features a smart watch may provide, I am forced to remember the box of outdated tech watches in the basement next to old desktop computers that need to be recycled. ",

For anything to be worth buying, it must provide a service you need, that has value greater than it\u2019s cost. For me, this is just not so. But for you? Who knows? Smart Watches provide information, much more information than do regular watches, but much less than do Smart Phones, tablets, and laptops. Their size limits the practicality of information transfer, and limits them mostly to \u201con the go\u201d info. Stuff you might need immediately, and conviently, like\u2026 Your heart rate, if you have heart issues, track your exercise levels closely, or prefer to keep scientific data. Perhaps the wrist based music controls suit you better than mp3 player or earbud based controls. Maybe you enjoy knowing how far you ran, having on board GPS, or use the device as an emergency beacon. There are many different features available for smartwatches, and if you need, and can afford them. Go for it! They can be great. Just bear in mind, you need to know the differences between smart watch features that sync from phone versus those that are built in. It\u2019d be disappointing to find out that GPS was NOT built into the watch, and relies on the phone you left on the kitchen table\u2026 For me though, smartwatches are just another annoying \u201csmart\u201d electronic device, and I\u2019d rather pass on that, grab time on the go, and forget about everything else. My thoughts. Take care. ",

Steps, calories, distance, heart rate, notifications, and sleep tracking are the new features. I used to watch my stats everyday. But, then, I started to get tired of one thing: the battery. Oh my God! It had to be charged every few days and sometimes, depending on what I was doing, I would forget to charge it or I would assume it had enough battery yet. By assuming, I would be without a watch. Also, let's not forget the accessories like the band, it would last approximately 1 year and 3 months and would get discontinued in order for you to buy a new smartwach. So, after all this, I changed to a regular watch. The battery lasts 5 or more years, the bands are easily replaceable and they would last more. Hope this helps ",

More options doesn\u2019t hurt any buyer and due to the stiff competition, companies are required to maintain their standards. The Vector SmartWatch is up for release and it promises to be quite a device based on the flawless design and the most important feature that is a one month long battery. The good part about this smart watch is that it is the first ever SmartWatch which works for all three important Operating Systems : iOS, Android and Windows. Features of Vector SmartWatch:The Vectore SmartWatch was launched by the company at the Watch show Baselworld. The best feature stands out to be the promising 30 day battery which mocks the Apple Watch\u2019s battery that is supposed to last just a day or so. The Vector comes in two form factor types and is compatible with all major OS. You can choose to go with the rectangular Meridian design for the watch or the round faced Luna design. There is also an option to choose from the various steel and leather straps. The bands for both these watches are interchangeable. You would be surprised by the 30 day battery life that Vector boasts of. This long battery life is made possible by the combination of Monochrome memory LCD screens and the low power custom Operating System. Some more info about Vector:Vector is the creation of former Timex CEO Joe Santana who brought along with him Steve Jarvis ( infamous for the ugly Time Ironman and a former design head at Nike.) This team is completed by CTO Andrei Pitis. It was announced on 19th March and the watch is slated to ship to the public pretty soon. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the younger generation (born after 2008) wearing ONLY a smartwatch with 3G / LTE makes sense. They probably have not bought new phones before. Anyway, the school shall influence on which tablet / laptop computer to buy. Overall trend was \"phone with dial pad\" to \"smart phone with physical keyboard\" to \"small smart phone with virtual keyboard\" to \"phablet\". If you already have a smart phone, it is not necessary to wear a smartwatch. Remembering to charge both daily is not worth (wireless charging sounds good but expensive). Therefore, I guess you are better off with a durable plain watch. The Google Glass is not popular, and one of the reasons is that it does not have 3G / LTE. As of today, smart glasses cannot work as a standalone phone. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. I got my Apple Watch Series 3 on Christmas Day this past year. The moment I got it, I have been impressed. The design is great. I know it is square and seems big, but the rounded edges gives it a slim look. I beg to differ from the guy who said the Watch was not water proof. From my understanding and on Apple\u2019s website, it says up to like 125 feet or deeper. So in standard electronics, that means it is water proof. On the series 2, you get gps. Battery life for me is really good, even though I use it constantly. On a hard day of usage, I get at least 45% left on for the night. I charge it overnight. Software wise, it is almost like IOS. I'm hoping for the Watchos4 to have more screen wallpapers But overall, the Series 2 Watch is the best to go with. If you love Apple and want to stay within the ecosyste, then the Apple Watch Series 2 is to go. Disclaimer: I own stocks and mutual Funds. However Apple is not currently one of them.

Get a real Swiss mechanical watch and forget wearing a tiny tiny iPhone on your wrist . For Pete\u2019s sake you already have the iPhone now you need one on your wrist? Seriously? Again: you already have the iPhone now you need one on your wrist? Seriously? I think the basic idea of a watch is to glance down and see the time whether it be off a minute or two, who cares. Then, and this is the important part, you can get away with wearing something heavy and beautiful and stylish, not only with the watch movement in it, but with a beautiful bracelet, the metal the watch is made of. They come in perfect shiny stainless, titanium, 18 karat gold, white or red or yellow, hard ceramic In so many colors \u2013 and it feels good on your wrist, something living and alive, something mechanical and extremely well engineered. Personally, I think it\u2019s kind of creepy when guys wear bracelets. But a big beautiful watch, listen guys, you can get away with wearing a big nice watch all day. Think about it: 400 years, 500 years of human technical ingenuity has gone into mechanical watches. Right?! That says it all. Not only that, they have been crafted to have beautiful faces, dials, whatever. The Apple Watch is just a completely standard homogeneous roll out, without any beautiful dial or case characteristics, no matter what metal you buy, no matter what bracelet either. It\u2019s like wearing a giant big Mac. There\u2019s about 10 million maybe 100 million of them out there. Not very distinctive \u2013 \u2013 Thanks for listening, David Thomson. ",

And if you do buy one, you will eventually be found at a bus stop, looking up \"Blow up the Pokies\" by the Whitlams on youtube, sung by Tim Freedman that famous son of Collaroy (in North Macedonia). Tim Freedman is said to have some connection with the central European bicycle pump manufacturing industry, and a Pokie is thought to be a kind of stuffed animal, or perhaps a kind of small cake. A hat? A popular dance move in Alabama? You can ponder all of this when you listen to the song on youtube again and again. You can listen without a smartwatch. Youtube is accessible on a normal computer. ",

While I was addicted to the functionality of the pebble, I have since moved back to a normal watch. The reason was cost and durability when compared to a normal watch. When I buy a watch, I expect it to last a long time. Watches for me have a sentimental value in addition to just telling time. Smartwatches, like any mobile phone are rendered obsolete within two years. Plus, the software isn\u2019t robust enough to last too long. Add to this the fact that they cost anywhere from 6000 INR (100 USD) and upwards, I wouldn\u2019t want to spend that amount in addition to changing my phone at the same interval. Unless smart watches come up with a more robust and long lasting design along with better looks, I doubt there will be too many people buying smart watches. This is a personal experience. There are many other reasons why smart watches have not taken off: Failure to launch: a few reasons why smartwatches haven't caught on ",

It\u2019s also great for sports, I play a lot of golf and it gives me my yardage and keeps my score, it counts laps when I swim and the fitness trackers are good for letting me know how lazy or otherwise I\u2019m being.

So if you are going for a run, you cannot use the iwatch without iPhone. This is also a marketing strategy to create dependency on the products by various companies. To be honest i can have all those features on phone and use the same for my run. I use the arm pouch, put my phone in that and go for a run. The purpose is met. One thing i don't like about these products is that they are not offering anything spectacular and yet are expensive. So if you are not bothered by its price and its limitations . You can buy one.

Realistically, you don\u2019t really need notifications because your phone is never more than 3 feet away from you. I\u2019ve had a couple of smart watches and have gone back to a Seiko automatic watch which is a mechanical marvel and beautiful to look at. I never need to wind it or charge it and it will work after the bomb drops. It runs a little fast and I normally have to set it back a couple of minutes every month but compared with daily charging and having to flick your wrist to see the time it\u2019s nothing compared to the inconvenience of a smart watch. When smart watches have always on displays, when they can last a few weeks on a charge and when they\u2019re compact and beautiful to look at, I might try one again. ",

Pebble, one of the most successful Kickstarter projects at the time, got the ball rolling in 2012 with Google and Apple following two years later. But in 2017 it\u2019s safe (and a bit sad) to say that the smartwatch buzz has died down. Pebble got sold to Fitbit amid financial troubles.

            "answer_text": "If you want a smartwatch do some research on what you need remember that a smartwatch has no use. You have to give it a practical use that you want it to be used for. They do come in handy when you can't get to your phone or so happen to lose it somewhere it's way easier to find with the watch given it's connected to the phone. So if you have a use in mind for it I recommend finding a watch that's comparable with your phone that's in a style you like and that has what you want and remember it's a new technology so it's still a work in process.

These watches can be connected easily with your smartphone. So, they are very much modern than the normal watches. But, the standard watches are worthy than the smartwatches because they do not have so much life as the luxury watches. In addition to it, they are not so precise and exquisite like the normal watches. ",

Consumer electronic companies want you to buy a new device from them every 2 to 3 year. They will keep releasing new features to make the device you bought last year obsolete. In comparison, watchmakers want you to by one watch and recommend to have it serviced every 5 to 10 years, depending on the brand. ",

The latest ones also do not need daily or weekly recharging. They work on large user-replaceable Lithium Button cells. (Do not buy any that need recharging.) I recommend those HYBRIDS that have Lumed Hands and a Vibration for notifications.And these are not expensive, and are some good ones made by Fossil that are below USD200. Yes, they may be considered toys, but they are FUNctional. Why not just keep up with technology for the price of a good meal? Enjoy! ",
