            "answer_text": "Every piece of advanced technology is built on previous advances; for instance, digital cameras depend on microelectronics, optics, LED\u2019s, CCD\u2019s and advanced batteries (each one of which was it\u2019s own impressive advance). However, given the frame of the question, I would vote for the satellite global positioning systems (GPS). To pull this off, you need to combine advanced technology in microelectronics, precision timekeeping, RF propagation, geodetics, rocketry, reliability, radiation hardness, battery technology, LED or LCD displays and materials technology. And it\u2019s all the more impressive in that this technology has become massively and inexpensively available to everyone on Earth, becoming so ubiquitous that GPS is now just an assumed accessory for your smartphone.
