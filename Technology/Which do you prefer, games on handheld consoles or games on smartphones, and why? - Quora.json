            "answer_text": "Handheld consoles, no question. We\u2019ll avoid the elephant in the room for a bit. First, consider the controls. An actual d-pad or analogue stick is so much better for controlling things over those crappy on-screen controls that they\u2019ve even made addons you can hook to your phone to give you that experience. Touch screens have their places, but even then, I find a stylus, ala the DS and 3DS, to be far more accurate than a finger. Also consider that with a smart phone, everything you\u2019re doing is smearing grease over the very screen you\u2019re trying to view the game on (I initially thought the very concept of the DS was insane with its two screens back in the day, but it of course turned out to be brilliant, even allowing for touch controls when useful while still keeping the main screen free of fingerprints). Now for the elephant. Most mobile games are shallow, currency-locked or ad-covered pieces of trash that are designed to suck money out of the players endlessly. Their worth usually boils down to their initial cost-nothing. They\u2019re junk, pure and simple. There\u2019s no innovation, beyond ways to come up with more currencies and more time-locked items in order to suck more milk from the teat of the whales. Most gameplay boils down to tapping on a few things every x number of minutes in order to gain a currency to get another item to tap on later. If you want really good stuff to tap on, though, you have to pay. If you want to play something that\u2019s an actual game, with actual gameplay, something where you can do more than tap on pixels every half hour like a rat desperately sucking on its cocaine-filled water bottle, most of what you find on handhelds still fits the bill. It\u2019s mostly still the old economy, where a developer would create a game, put it out there for a set amount of money, and then you\u2019d\u2026get an actual game, generally most or all of it, right there and then, to play for as long as you want without artificial restraints like time-based currencies. The handheld days are sadly on the wane. People would rather carry one device that does all things in a crappy manner than carry several devices that each do their intended purpose very well. Additionally, the old game economy is in the ICU. We can see this with the increasing number of freemium game nonsense that started creeping into the 3DS eshop and is now in full swing on the Switch\u2019s store. Nintendo is hardly the main culprit here, as the same bullshit is going on with the other consoles and on the PC as well. They\u2019re just following along with industry trends (since like every other online-related thing, they\u2019re kind of bumbling far behind everyone else). At any rate, the combination of the change in games plus trying to make the mobile phone the jack-of-all-trades is leading to the end of an era, one that I\u2019m dreading. ",

            "answer_text": "Which do you prefer, games on handheld consoles or games on smartphones? Handheld consoles, there really is no contest. Why? There are just so many reasons. Without going into too much detail; The games, I can\u2019t stress enough how different the games are between these two platforms (and they are two very different platforms), the design, the delivery, the experience\u2026 there is very little common ground, almost none. Mobile games are designed for a very different audience to portable consoles.The overall experience is better. Smartphone users seem to be allergic to buttons, but for games, physical inputs are so much more versatile. For long time gamers, the touch screen controls can actually be quite frustrating, but the screen only control also limits the complexity of the games, making mobile games seem rather shallow in comparison to other platforms.The marketing. There\u2019s something to be said for buying a game outright and getting the whole package, this is what you get on a portable console. On mobile, you get \u201cfree\u201d to play games as the entry level. You get the game for free, but only the the tutorial is truly free, beyond that, if you want to take the game seriously you need to spend money on it\u2026 continuously and copiously, without that, your game is a hollowed out shell that holds the basic gameplay to ransom. On a portable console, you pay up front, it costs a lot more but your progress is never restricted, you don\u2019t have to wait to pass through waypoints or pester your friends, you don\u2019t need to buy additional resources to improve the game, you get the gameplay at its best all the time.Distractions, mobile phones have additional purposes and gaming is just an additional use. It takes back seat to communication as a phone is primarily a communication device. It\u2019s quite frustrating to be wrenched out of your game by a phone call or text and annoying to be bombarded with notifications when you\u2019re trying to concentrate. Portable consoles on the other hand are designed first and foremost with gaming as the focus, your experience is far more immersive because you won\u2019t be hounded by background applications or communications. Yes, it\u2019s another device to carry around, but for me, absolutely worth it. The entertainment value is just worlds apart, and the games are just that much more enjoyable. I would venture to say, it\u2019s cheaper overall as well. Especially with the recent trend of adding a weekly subscription fee to access the full or premium game, that\u2019s just too far, I was reluctant to spend a monthly $15 fee on other platforms\u2026 but $12 a week for a virtual colouring book? $8 a week to remove commercials? No thanks. And well, I\u2019m a little tired of the obvious manipulation. I\u2019d rather pay $100 for a game up front and have the whole game, all the time, at its intended pace. In terms of overall experience, you get what you pay for. ",
