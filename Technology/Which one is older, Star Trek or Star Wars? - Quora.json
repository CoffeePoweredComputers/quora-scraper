            "answer_text": "Older might be a slippery term. But from proposal to actual production, it\u2019s Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry came up with his \u201cWagon Train To The Stars\u201d in the early Sixties and created the first pilot in early 1965. It was too cerebral (\u201cThe Menagerie\u201d, an excellent episode that was turned into The Original Series only two-parter and a Hugo Award winner) and an unprecedented second pilot was ordered, \u201cWhere No Man Has Gone Before\u201d. The first episode, \u201cThe Man Trap\u201d, was launched on September 6th, 1966. From an article about George Lucas: \u201cEmboldened by his early success with Graffiti, Lucas was determined to follow through on an idea for a \u201cspace opera\u201d he and his partner, Gary Kurtz, had been noodling around since 1971. The story was based on outer-space adventures like those of Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers\u2014stories Lucas adored as a young boy growing up on his family\u2019s walnut farm. \u201c So from the timeline, Star Trek was envisioned whole in 1964, if you take into account the production requirements to start up the pilot. Lucas\u2019 vision of Star Wars was around 1971. Yet like most great ideas, they had been stirring for a long time. Gene Roddenberry was a Hollywood screen writer and his work on shows such as \u201cHave Gun Will Travel\u201d had been fermenting the idea of a Horatio Horblower captain in outer space had been working on him for a while. Likewise, the story of Luke Skywalker is the classic hero\u2019s journey, written about by Jung and repeated many times. So it comes down to where you think all great ideas start. By the calendar, it\u2019s Star Trek. ",
