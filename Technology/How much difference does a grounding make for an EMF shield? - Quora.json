            "answer_text": "I have seen a video about a study on an experimental shielding effectiveness of a Faraday cage, against EM waves. Surprisingly, grounding produced less than 10 % increase on shielding effectiveness. However, the shielding phenomenon is strongly frequency dependent. According to some non-mainstream scientists (Nicola Tesla was one of them) there are longitudinal EM waves beside the, above mentioned, transversal ones. For those EM waves- if they exist- any kind of shielding has zero effectiveness. ",
