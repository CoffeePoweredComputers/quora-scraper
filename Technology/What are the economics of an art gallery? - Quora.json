            "answer_text": "A typical gallery has a 50/50 split with its artists, although shopping mall galleries often take as much as 75% with the artist receiving 25% of retail.  A few galleries work 60/40 artst/gallery, though that is becoming more rare. Most galleries rent their space. They have to pay utilities, web costs; staff requires base pay, usually commission of 5-10% + benefits & taxes which are another 20% or so. Advertising can run a great deal - a good print ad program can easily be $25-100,000 a year. Openings run $1,500-3,000 or more depending on ads, and many galleries do an opening every month. Oh yes, framing. Most galleries frame the works of their aritsts - although some require the artist to do this. And all of this before the owner takes a salary. Even a modest gallery in a not-very-high-rent area has to gross $250,000 just to break even. Be in a higher rent area, and one had better double that. And you're still just breaking even. Translate that into selling some number of artworks at a cost of $5,000 or $10,000 each that have to strike not just one person, but more often two people perfectly (husband AND wife) and be within their budget,  AND be the right size AND a compatible color palette and all happen at the moment they walk into your space.  It's a tough business.   But on the good side, you get to work in the land of beauty and talk about happy and glorious things all day long. If you can put up with the economic uncertainty, it's pretty damn wonderful. ",
