            "answer_text": "In simple terms, the most devasting thing that can happen to the economics of your society is civil war. The second worst is a war between nations. The third worst is persistent corruption. The fourth worst is religious intolerance. In general, any event that causes citizens to avoid taking economic and social risks (e.g. getting an education or starting a business) are destructive to society. Homogeneous societies tend to succeed because conflicts between subgroups (e.g. races or ethnic groups) do not cause instability. This is typically only overcome by rich democratic roots or a strong ethos favoring diversity. The latter is rare. Some places (e.g. in Africa or the Middle East) must overcome colonial land organizations which group unlike communities in one place (e.g. Iraq). This challenge has plagued Africa. Right now it seems to be in the process of decline in the face of increasing national identity (I am an Ethiopian or Kenyan\u2026 not a tribe, religion, etc.) Islam can present an exception. Usually, only a strongman type government or a very strong democracy can overcome such challenges of complex stew politics (e.g. Singapore.) Often issues of race and colonial versus non-colonial culture become persistent (e.g. Brasil.) Other fissures such as religion (which can follow and further emphasize these other challenges) add to the tensions and cross-currents\u2014particularly where modes of marriage are traditional rather than modern. Strongmen typically retain power through militaries and these militaries tend to want to be exercised. Hence, strongmen lead to wars or uprisings (civil wars) and in turn lose stability. As such, the strongman is not usually a long-term optimal strategy. In crisis it is often deemed necessary (e.g. Russia or Brasil). Usually things end badly. The best strategy is probably to develop a trade-based culture with tough cultural rules that are not based on corruption or dynastic military frameworks (e.g. Rwanda or Singapore). Another outcome is to wait for a relatively wealth homogenous democracy to take hold that can absorb the stresses of tolerance while advancing diversity (e.g. Netherlands or Sweden). Nations on the right track seem to include Bolivia, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and a few others. It isn\u2019t that these places are perfect, it is that they have suffered most of the ills described above and decided to implement safeguards\u2014having seen success in places like Rwanda and Singapore.
