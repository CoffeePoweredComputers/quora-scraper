            "answer_text": "Then they would have lost the war more quickly than they did. Because, you see, winning the Battle of Britain means that the Navy and Army now have yo actually try to invade Britain. Which was something so far beyond the capabilities of Nazi Germany that they couldn't even have achieved it with help from the Daleks. They would have used coal barges to transport their troops, which could be sunk by machine gun fire or indeed a well-behaving English Channel. The invasion force would have drowned. The Luftwaffe would have had to maintain air presence constantly in thr channel to stop the remnants of the RAF from sinking the barges, whilst also trying to stop the Royal Navy's Channel Force (50ish destroyers and cruisers and one battleship) from murdering thr whole German army. It was not capable of doing this due to losses sustained in the Battle of Britain. At the same time the Kriegsmarine has to somehow magically help this endeavour, with three battleships, eight or so cruisers and 5 destroyers taking the field against 9 battleships, 3 aircraft carriers, and about 80 Destroyers and cruisers. In this circumstance the Kriegsmarine's surface fleet woyld have either fled or ceased to exist in perhaps 6 or so hours at most. If the Luftwaffe had won the Battle of Britain, Germany would not have thanked it. Tens of thousands of German soldiers, sailors and airmen would have died and achieved nothing more than embarrassing Germany in the process. The population of the UK would have laughed and clapped and celebrated theit great victory; proof that God as well as righteousness was their ally. And then the German economy would have collapsed a matter of weeks later. ",

            "answer_text": "Then the Army (Heer) and particularly the Navy (Kriegsmarine), would have been in a real pickle. They both used the Luftwaffe\u2019s failure as an excuse not to attempt a cross Channel amphibious operation. Had the Luftwaffe prevailed they would have had to come up with another excuse, or face a humiliating defeat that would have made the Luftwaffe\u2019s loss of the BoB pale into insignificance. ",
