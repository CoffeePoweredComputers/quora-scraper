            "answer_text": "Hi, Machine Learning is going to be the next big thing in the world of technology. With the volume of data floating in the market today, organizations need to rely on the A.I. & ML models heavily to deliver accurate and fast insights without having to explicitly custom code it. It will result to huge demand of Machine Learning Experts in many vital industries. Therefore, if you are really looking to build a career in Machine Learning, don\u2019t think twice. There are quite a few good institutes today which offers Specialization and online courses on Machine Learning, namely Simplilearn, Coursera, Jigsaw Academy, AnalytixLabs and a few more. I would personally recommend Jigsaw Academy because they have a streamlined course on Machine Learning. (Hyperlinked for your reference). Through the course content you will get to learn A-Z of Machine Learning. The faculties are learned and very approachable (Telling this from a personal experience and recommendations) . You can extract the most out of them. Recently, they have launched a Post Graduate Program in Data Science & Machine Leaning PGPDM in collaboration with one of the top universities in the world, University Of Chicago which you may want to consider. You can get hands on experience on real-time projects during the tenure of the course and get to learn from the International faculties and industry experts. More importantly, focus on gaining the right kind of knowledge and upskilling your current skills. It will definitely help you getting the job you want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Start building small ML systems with python, R or Lisp. Pick an area of ML to focus on and solve small problems. If you're not getting your feet wet solving problems and diving into the nuts and bolts of anything whether it be ML or other discipline then you won't be taken seriously. Get yourself well versed in common problems and solutions implemented in ML. Know why particular solutions are used, when and when not to use them. A good starting point for you may be Start Here With Machine Learning - Machine Learning Mastery On the job front I recommend finding companies or open source projects that interest you. Network and contribute to those projects. Learn, build things, ask many questions, and give back to the ML community; you'll be well on your way to getting your ML career off the ground. Good luck!
