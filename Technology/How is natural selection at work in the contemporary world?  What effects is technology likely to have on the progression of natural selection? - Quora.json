            "answer_text": "The rate is not so small.  Notable variations within a species occur within a few generations of that species, which is fairly short compared to human generations. There's the famous case of moths in England.  When coal burning made the urban landscape mostly black in the 19th century, only the black members of a particular moth family survived.  Those moths stayed black until coal was replaced as a home heat source in the 20th century.  Now that species of moth is white. I recently heard a similar story on the radio, about a species of birds that has always built nests on the sides of cliffs.  In urban areas, they are taking advantage of overpasses and building their nests there.  But this led to a lot of birds getting hit by cars.  Recently the bird deaths are down.  Studies have found some wing modifications (compared to 20 years ago) that help the birds maneuver more quickly. And, of course, there's the concern that our antibiotic technology is inadvertently  breeding antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Take all the antibiotics in the prescription you are given! ",

            "answer_text": "If you're talking genetics among humans, everyone will soon (within 20-25 years) have the ability to decide their kids genes. In time they will also be able to choose characteristics for their children and the system will design and build genes for that. The distinction between animals / people and machines will blur. There will be classes of beings between animals and humans, and also super-smart humans. And all these will be enhanced with machines and AI and network communications built or grown into them. But, natural selection will continue to function - if not at the level of the genes, then at least at the level of the technologies. Technologies will be competing against each other, and the ones selected will be the ones that work best and can out-compete other technologies. Decency and goodness will be even more rare for a time. ",
