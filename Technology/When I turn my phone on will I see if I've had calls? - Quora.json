            "answer_text": "Some carriers in my experience, namely Prepaid airtel IndiaPrepaid Vodafone IndiaHave a service by the name missed call alerts. What it does is charge you 30 Rupees a month, and send you SMS alerts of the numbers that tried to reach you when your phone wasn't connected to the mobile carrier network. Switched off technically means not connected and should work the same way. All of the above, if your service provider has such an option available for starters ",
