I personally use the Blackberry Priv and I find the keyboard wonderful to use, it also come with some specfic Blackberry software which is pretty good in my opinion. If the keyboard is not your thing Blackberry do provide software so you can use their suite on your own Android phone. ",

Blackberry\u2019s focus is still in the the business sector for now, but their phones are still pretty good just like most android devices out there. Their key and key 2 phones have received some positive reviews because of their physical keyboards, whilst some persons cant look past the fact that physical keyboards on a phone still exist. As with purchasing anything its wise to consider your needs. hope this helps! ",
