            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Yes Reversing a Jailbreak is very much possible. To do so just follow the steps listed here. Also do keep in mind following the above method will leave certain \u201cblobs\u201d in your device which though do not cause any harm but if detected while being serviced by Apple Authorised retailers can cause your warranty being void. The only way to remove those is to wipe the device and restore as new. Hope it Helps:) ",
