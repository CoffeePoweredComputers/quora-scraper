            "answer_text": "The easiest way is to simply swap SD cards. The Raspberry Pi 3 (by default) uses an SD card as its boot drive, so swapping operating systems is as simple as shutting down, swapping the SD card for another and rebooting. There is no need to try to install multiple operating systems on the same SD card. It is possible to configure the Raspberry Pi 3 to boot from a USB hard drive, in which case multiple OS\u2019s can be installed and booted from the same HD (but running separately, not simultaneously - that requires a hypervisor and virtualisation of hardware, which would be hopelessly slow on the Raspberry Pi, not to mention the lack of RAM).

            "answer_text": "I can give you two choices: 1.Using Noobs (refer link) 2.Using multipple sd First one is software based, less safe and more chance to get corrupted. Second , is safer and is free from corruption of data to a certain extent. Because either OSs are isolated. So, I recommend second option as safe for beginners. ",
