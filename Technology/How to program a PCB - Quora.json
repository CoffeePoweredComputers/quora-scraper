            "answer_text": "First design your circuit properly or take reference from online resources like electronicshub, electronicsforu, elprocus or any other site will do which gives you a proper idea of circuit layout. Then design the schematic on any PCB designing software like Altium, Eagle, NI Multisim and NI Ultiboard or online softwares like EasyEDA. After making the schematic convert it to PCB and route the circuit components using autoroute or route it yourself. Make certain adjustments regarding track width and color of the board. Then convert it to pdf and print it on the glossy paper. Then take the printed glossy paper and cut the piece of perf board or copper clad pcb exactly the size of the design you just printed and stick the printed side of the paper with the copper surface of the board such that they are parallel to each other. Then stick a paper tape around the sides of the board and take a hot ironing machine press the the paper against the board. Do this process for 5-10 minutes. Then let it cool for sometime and put the board in the water and lightly rub the paper you will see the tracks printed on the board. Then dip the board in Ferric Chloride (FeCl3) for 10 to 15 minutes this will dissolve the copper which is remaining and as you have masked your tracks nothing will happen to it. Afterwards take a sand paper and lightly rub your printed tracks, you will see a shiny copper tracks on your board. Ta-Da your PCB is done ",

            "answer_text": "First, you don\u2019t \u2018program\u2019 a PCB. PCB stands for Printed Circuit Board. This is what all the components of the device you are building will be attached to, and it is simply a layer of copper firmly glued to a non conductive board. The circuit connections are created by shielding parts of the copper from an \u2018etchant\u2019 which removes the copper everywhere except under the shielding, called a \u2018resist\u2019. Solder pads, etc. and copper \u2018traces\u2019 left behind from the etching process form the connections between the ICs, transistors, resistors, etc. that are then soldered to the board to form the complete circuit. So you \u2018create\u2019 a PCB, you can\u2019t \u2018program\u2019 it (unless when you finish building it it\u2019s some type of computer! haha!) ",

            "answer_text": "How can I program a PCB? Well, it actually depends on the IC itself, different package of ICs will definitely have different programming ways; Generally, you need at least prepare Programmer, IC, (PCB), encryption program, etc. BWW, speaking of PCB Programming, there are actually two different ways: Online Programming and Offline Programming; Online Programming: IC has to be soldered on the board; Offline Programming: IC can be programming as individual;  ",

            "answer_text": "You need to include a microcontroller or a microprocessor and program it. If you want to make things easy, go for arduino boards first so that you don\u2019t have to waste time on setting up the auxiliary stuffs like power supply, crystal, bootloaders and all. And of course you will have to go with either assembly language(not recommended at all! ) or C++(which is super easy if you are using Arduino). Good Luck.! ",

            "answer_text": "Way back when I was in Junior High School (early 1960s), I made my first PCBs by using epoxy glue to attach copper foil to fiberglass panels. I then hand painted the circuit pattern on the foil. I mixed my own etchant of ferric chloride and dissolved the copper. Wow. I was crazy, but this was the 1960s and a hobby. Today the processes are vastly improved: Printed circuit board - Wikipedia ",
