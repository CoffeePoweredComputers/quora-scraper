            "answer_text": "I will answer about teaching science as I am more familiar with that. The teaching of science can be done even to children as young as two or three years old. Teaching scientific methods to children will include seeing something, asking what happened, can something be observed, can we document it and can we come to a conclusion. Simple activities for two years olds: In 2 small plates put some cotton balls damped with water (but not soaked) and put on them 2 different kinds of beans. Check them out daily and see what happens to them.. It is a good idea to take pictures every couple days to see the change. Talk about the roots and the colors of the leaves, compare the seeds too. Teach new words such as sprouts.Buy some white flowers like carnations. Take 3 plastic cups and fill them with water (1/3 cup full). Then put a few drops of different food coloring in each cup. Put the cut flowers in them. Check them daily. Discuss what happened to the flowers and why.Plant in water an onion and a sweet potato in two different jars. Wait a few days and see what happens to the roots and the leaves. Let your child make a drawing or picture of the plants. New words to learn: roots, leaves, sprouted.If you have a yard, you can hang two bird feeders and put in them different kinds of food to eat such as dry breadcrumbs, sunflowers or other seeds you might already have at home. Check the bird feeders daily to see which kind of birds \"liked the food offered.\"Other activities Sorting - Let your child sort items (buttons, legos, colored candies, etc.) by colors or size. This teaches logical thinking. Baking - Mixing different ingredients: water, flour, yeast, food coloring and eggs will cause changes in front of the child's own eyes. Some examples of talking points: What is happening? What if..? If we do it again tomorrow will it be the same? Homemade Playdough - Research \"homemade playdough.\" While making it with your child, talk about measurements and teach new words like: measure, pour, mix, reaction, etc. You might want to do a search for simple science activities to do at home with toddlers. Hope you find this helpful. Good luck! ",
