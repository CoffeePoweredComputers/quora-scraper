            "answer_text": "You splash out thousands of rupees/hundreds of dollars on a new smartphone, so why not to spend just a little more in order to ensure it doesn\u2019t get scratched or broken? Smartphones are getting tougher all the time, and there are quite a few waterproof smartphones now, but the vast majority will not survive an accident unscathed. If you want to find out what might happen should your phone meet with disaster, you can check out the numerous damage tests posted online. Let\u2019s have an comparison between the Soft and Hard Case covers. SOFT/SLIM OR BASIC CASES Sometimes it feels like a shame to cover your phone\u2019s gorgeous design, or maybe you just don\u2019t want something too bulky in your pocket. If style outweighs protection for you, then you can opt for a soft and slim case. It will safeguard against scratches on the areas it actually covers, and it will certainly boost your phone\u2019s chances of surviving a fall (you just can\u2019t count on it). I have seen more and more translucent cases making their way to the market, meaning it\u2019s easier than ever to get something that allows your phone\u2019s design to shine through. You shouldn\u2019t need to spend big on a slim case, and they can be great if you feel a basic level of protection is enough.  These one-piece cases are typically made of TPU, which is durable and slightly malleable, so they\u2019re easy to fit and offers some shock protection. You\u2019ll find the biggest range of styles and colors in this category, but make sure you check the cut-outs and remember that a lack of protection at the corners or a lip on the front means weak protection from falls. Some of the cases in this category also offer decent drop protection by combining a thin, hard back with a thicker, malleable bumper. TOUGH/HARD CASES If you want a case that will definitely survive a drop, but you don\u2019t want to add too much bulk or completely forfeit style, then you\u2019ll probably want to opt for one of the many tough cases currently on the market. A standard combination that works well is a layer of hard polycarbonate with an inner layer of something softer, like silicone, to absorb shock. Also, keep an eye out for the military drop test certification.  You can expect these cases to add a bit of bulk and weight, but they come in an array of styles and they shouldn\u2019t stop you from accessing everything your phone has to offer. Make sure that there\u2019s a lip or some protection on the front in case your phone lands face down. You should also expect added grip to reduce the chances that you\u2019ll drop it in the first place. THE FINAL WORDS If you have the opportunity to check out some cases before you buy, then I recommend doing so. After all, it\u2019s always better to get a hands-on feel. It can also be a good idea to buy a couple of cases for different occasions. Getting a slim case for your 9-to-5 gig and a rugged case for your weekend hiking excursions, for example, could be the way to go. So, please don\u2019t go comparing between soft and hard case covers, both are equally good provided their features are excellent to safeguard your device. ",

I'm a student so I roam around everywhere, clicking photos too much, lending phone to friends for use, that's why I use hard case It has saved me various times, when accidentally phone slipped from my hand on various occasions. My advice is always, use a hard case. It might look little bulky but it saves your costly phone for sure. Soft cases are mostly rubber or related material, which over the time period doesn't looks good and colors, feels also doesn't remains the same. Where as my hard case is almost a year now still same feel and no colors fade out Just buy a quality cover, Here is my case, device: OnePlus 2 It also saved my camera lense from scratch  ",
