            "answer_text": "2Mbps is good enough for browsing. Let me make 1 thing clear though.2 Mbps that is specified by the broadband providing companies would give you a download speed of around 240-260 kbps (the speed fluctuates to give an average of 250KBps). Most pages we regularly load are of small sizes and will load in 1-2 seconds. About downloads- Youtube-Videos will play smoothly in normal resolution(360p or 480p) i.e. the resolution that is YouTube's default. But if you choose to watch the videos in 720p or 1080p, it will wait for buffering quite often. In that case you will have to download the videos in hd resolution. A Bollywood song in HD resolution would take around 15 minutes to download. Torrent-Movies would take 1 to 1.5 hours to download. For average sized games(4 or 5 GB) you would have to wait around 4 or 5 hours. Limited sized files downloading-Softwares and other stuff like music, etc can be easily downloaded on a 2Mbps broadband line. Such files are not too big in size and will take a feasible time to download. Overall a 2 Mbps line is pretty good unless you want to use the Internet like an overspending king. It gives the best combination of cheap price and satisfactory usage. ",

            "answer_text": "If you ask me, it would rather suck. See, first, it would be 1/8, because that's the  ratio. So we get 2/8=1/4 mbps speed. That means 250 kbps. BUT! There's more to it than meets the eye. Speed, by ISPs is measured in kbps, while the layman measures it in KBps. Translated, the speed you are promised is 2 mega bits per second, while you think it is 2 mega bytes per second. So again, there are 8 bits in a byte. That means we gotta do 250/8. That's about 32KBPS. Now decide if it's a good speed or not. Okay, so even if we skip the ratio, what you get is 250 KBPS. And, not all providers deliver the speed they promise. ",
