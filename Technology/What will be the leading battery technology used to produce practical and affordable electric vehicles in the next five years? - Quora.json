            "answer_text": "Lithium is not the only one that would be popular in the future. The countries which have large deposits of lithium (and cobalt) are Chile,Argentina,China , USA amongst others. Countries like Japan are investing in Hydrogen fuel cell technology to avoid a massive hurdle of procuring lithium when the demand for lithium balloons to accommodate all the car manufacturers. If all the cars being produced in the world shifted to lithium based tech, today , we would be having lithium wars in 8 years. An alternate lies in HFCs and this would , in the future also get popular. Obviously since Mr.Musk has the resources of lithium in USA and China does too - the biggest billboard spaces get occupied by lithium supporters. ",

Because of the time already put into lithium, it\u2019s unlikely that anything else will appear on the scene any time soon, unless it is really incredibly better. BMW is making big investments into a \u201csolid state\u201d battery. It\u2019s not very clear what this is, but BMW must really think it holds promise. BMW invest $240 million to bring electric car range to 430 miles with new battery cell center ",

            "answer_text": "The one in contention right now is Lithium Ion batteries. Because of its energy density and weight. Moreover more research is being done in this technology rather than any other technology. Other technologies are Na batteries and others. The cost of Li-Ion is supposed to decrease to just 100USD from today's 300USD (approx) by 2027. So considering the next five years Li-Ion is the one. ",
