            "answer_text": "It depends on the circuit, such as how it is connected. I have read about such DIY device using high amperage battery terminals connected directly to metal pans. This is a risky thing to do and may cause your life if you have a weak heart problems and have direct contact (touching) with the metal pans. There human body resistance is not fixed. It ranges from hundredths of ohms to hundreds of kilo ohms depending on a lot of factors. If the cells break down due to high energy electric field, the body resistance will reduce suddenly, causing higher current flow through the body. The longer the harmful current is flowing through your body, the more damage it will cause to your internal organs. Please take a look at this reference as a guide to find out the effect of electric current to the human body (The Electric Shock Questions) When you touch the pans, you are making direct contact with the battery terminals. The current will flow directly through your body. Assuming your body resistance is lower than 500 ohm, the current through your body is 12V / 500 ohm > 24 mA, which could cause a painful shock according to the chart given. As a safety precaution, you could connect a fuse and resistor in series before the metal pans. But, make sure these components are not touching the solution. The fuse shall act as a circuit breaker so that any current higher than the specified value will blow the fuse and protect you from further shock (typical fuse blows within 100 ms). The resistor limits the current that will flow through your body. For example, if you wanted to limit to 5 mA, then the resistor value to use shall be 12 V / 5 mA = 2400 ohm. Alternatively, you might want to submerge your hands in the solution without touching the metal pans. However, the resistivity of the solution is subjective to how the solution is made, and therefore affects the resistance between your hands and the pans. ",
