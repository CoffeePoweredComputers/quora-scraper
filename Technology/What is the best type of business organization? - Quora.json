            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cbest\u201d type of business structure. There\u2019s easy to complex. Sole Prop: Straightforward and relatively simple to set up. However, the sole prop is personally liable for all debts and liabilities of the company. There is no legal protection as with other forms. Sole Prop can have only one owner. If you want to bring in another, you have to change structures. All profits/loses pass through to the owner\u2019s personal tax returns.LLC (Limited Liability Company): Comes with substantial legal shields and protections to the members, very flexible in how it\u2019s structured, requires additional documents and agreements which can be simple or complex depending on the specific situation. Tax reporting more complex but income and losses generally pass through to members personal returns.Corporations (S, C, etc). These offer the greatest protections but are the most complex to set up and manage. Very complex tax and legal implications to work out. Administration is most burdensome and expensive. Many instances of double taxation and regulatory headaches. The is the most common form of structure if one is seeking outside investment.",

            "answer_text": "The hot businesses these days are owning a franchise of a good company, they are best because the franchisee receives the benefit of the franchisors\u2019s advertising and promotional activities. It is usual for the franchisee to make contribution to the funds which are expended for this purpose. The franchisee receives the benefit of the bulk purchasing power and negotiating capacity which are available to the franchisor by reason of the size of the franchised network. At the franchisee\u2019s disposal is the specialised and highly-skilled knowledge and experience of the franchisor\u2019s head office organisation while remaining self-employed in their business. The franchisee\u2019s business risk is greatly reduced. However all business undertakings involve risk and a franchised business is no exception. To be successful, the franchisee will still have to work hard. The franchisor will not be able to promise great rewards for little effort. The franchisee has the services of the field operational staff of the franchisor who are there to assist with any problems which may arise from time to time in the course of business. Franchising offers the advantage for both vender and purchaser. For franchisors, the key resource is the capacity to utilize other individuals' cash to amplify the brand more rapidly than they could either alone. The underlying franchise expense and continuing eminences they gather allow franchisors to assemble their image without prior control to outcasts. The eminences and expenses are utilized to subsidize tasks at corporate central command, preparing and bolster franchisees, enhance the nature of merchandise or administrations, showcase and publicize the brand and upgrade the brand in the commercial center. The best franchises I can suggest you now a days are Online services, They are the franchise options for many reasons, low cost and less initial space are the two important features of it. Look out for a company like Phixman. This company is India\u2019s one of the best Online Mobile Repair Company, this is the best investment because smartphones are becoming a basic need in everyone\u2019s life and we can\u2019t live without our phone for a day. Phixman is the company that takes your smartphone from your doorstep, repairs it and then delivers it back to your doorstep, all you have to do is place your order. It is India\u2019s one of the fastest growing franchises and is the best franchise to start in 2019. ",
