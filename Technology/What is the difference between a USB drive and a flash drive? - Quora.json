            "answer_text": "Well, sometimes they're very different, and sometimes  they're not different at all! The two phrases - \"flash drive\" and \"memory stick\" - are referring to different qualities of a device. First, lets talk about what's called \"flash memory\". This is a particular way of storing data on a silicon chip. There are lots of different ways of doing this - i.e. lots of different types of memory - but flash memory is a particularly useful one for long-term storage, because it's one of the few types of memory that carries on remembering stuff long after you've disconnected all the power. OK, so we've got a way of remembering stuff after the power's turned off... What can we do with it? Flash memory turns up inside all sorts of devices, but the two kinds most people will know it from are: The memory cards used by modern cameras: There are several types of these, in different shapes and sizes (you'll hear terms such as \"SD, MicroSD, Compact Flash\", and so on), but they *all* use flash memory, and are all \"flash drives\" (though more often referred to as \"memory cards\"). The USB memory sticks that you can buy in most high streets. These can be plugged into any suitable computer with a USB port to read the contents, or add to them, or change them.  These sticks get called by all sorts of different names; Here's just a few:\"USB stick\"\"Thumb drive\"\"Flash drive\"\"Memory stick\"\"Memory dongle\" ...and so on. The trouble with these terms - aside from the fact that there are so many different ones, which is confusing enough! - is that several of them are ambiguous. For example \"memory stick\" could mean a USB-connected stick of flash memory, or it could mean a stick of DDR2 or DDR3 memory to go *inside* a computer. It's a totally different kind of memory, for a totally different job; but it's still memory, and it still comes on a stick! I work in an electronics retailer, and whenever somebody comes in and asks for any of the above things, I'm always careful to check exactly what they mean. A third type of flash memory device that's becoming very common these days is usually known as an \"SSD\". The letters mean \"Solid State Drive\", and basically these are a way to use flash memory as a replacement for a traditional hard disk drive: They're lighter, they *can* be a lot faster (though not if they're designed badly!), but they're also much more expensive, and more limited in how much they can store compared to a traditional hard drive.

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course it was, and it still is! First, \"USB sticks\" is much, much more general!There are several sorts of USB dongles that are NOT flash memories!Right now I have two \"USB sticks\" plugged into may laptop, which are NOT storage, they are not Flash drives or thumb drives, they are Wi-Fi access points in different frequency ranges!The third one is much smaller than a memory stick, it is the transmitter for the Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse \u2026Another SUB plug-in is strictly PASSIVE, it is a reader / adapter for Micro-USB cards.Flash drives, at least for me, are \u201cstorage drives that use Flash memory\u201d. As such, they are NOT always interfaced via USB, but rather via SATA (all of mines are of this type), mSATA, PCIexpress, and so on.So they are NOT always \u201cUSB sticks\u201d or thumb drives.Also, Flash drives or SSDs use multiple Flash memory chips and have an ADVANCED controller, that can manage the memory chips to ensure high access speed, reliability, and so on.thus, a Flash drives or SSD has in common with the humble thumb drive the fact that it uses Flash memory for storage, but little else!When you say to me \"flash drives\", I think about different types of SSDs, while \"USB sticks\" does suggest a memory stick or a thumb drive \u2026",
