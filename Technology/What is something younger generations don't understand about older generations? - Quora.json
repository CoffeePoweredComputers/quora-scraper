            "answer_text": "I think that many people in younger generations (and that includes mine\u2014even now that I\u2019m older) don\u2019t know how much people older than them suffered or what bad times they went through and how they overcame adversity. This is mostly because people don\u2019t like to talk about these things. Perhaps they don\u2019t want to relive the past (or at least the bad parts) or don\u2019t want to seem like they are bragging about their achievements. Or maybe they just forgot about it all. Many younger people tend to assume that the older generation had it better (which may be true) and that things came easily to them, which is often not true. They may see a more settled lifestyle, more material goods or fewer money worries and think that this just happened by magic. But they don\u2019t take into account what kind of economy it was when the older people got these things, or how hard they worked to get them. They may also not realize how much their elders economized and how simply they lived for years, when they couldn\u2019t afford things. Another thing younger people don\u2019t realize is that, when you get older, you aren\u2019t as strong, may even have a chronic illness that keeps you from living the way they think you should. Weakness, growing old and illness are also things that people don\u2019t like discussing, usually. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cOur grandparents would never understand the difficulties and struggles of our life.\u201d  This is one of the most common complaint that we all can relate to. A lot of people claim that the older generation can never understand and accept the ways of life that the new generation has, which they often label as 'problematic'. I want to share a post with all such people who think that lives of their grandparents was much easier than them. Imagine you were born in 1900. When you're 14, World War I begins and ends when you're 18 with 22 million dead. Soon after a global pandemic, the Spanish Flu, appears, killing 50 million people. And you're alive and 20 years old. When you're 29, you survive the global economic crisis that started with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange, causing inflation, unemployment and famine. When you're 33 years old the Nazis come to power. When you're 39, World War II begins and ends when you're 45 years old with a 60 million dead. In the Holocaust 6 million Jews die. When you're 52, the Korean War begins. When you're 64, the Vietnam War begins and ends when you're 75. A child born in 1985 thinks his grandparents have no idea how difficult life is, but they have survived several wars and catastrophes. Today we have all the comforts in a new world, amid a new pandemic. But we complain because we need to wear masks. We complain because we must stay confined to our homes where we have food, electricity, running water, wifi, even Netflix! None of that existed back in the day. But humanity survived those circumstances and never lost their joy of living. A small change in our perspective can generate miracles. We should be thankful that we are alive. Note - This is a post that I read on LinkedIn a few days ago. These aren't my thoughts but I strongly agree with the writer. Peace :) Source - LinkedIn ",
