            "answer_text": "Pros and Cons of Wireless Charging Pros: Goodbye, cables! You can just rest the phone on a pad.Its USB-C port is free to connect the headset.You find it in cars, coffee shops and are easily recognized by the seal.Cons: The device must be very close to the charging base (45 mm).The device must be in the correct position to align with the coil.In most cases, it will be slower than wired charging.Not all materials support wireless charging, and even some covers may disrupt the process.Another issue is that this is still an expensive technology, which raises the price of smart-phones.

            "answer_text": "Pros - it\u2019s slightly easier. In truth though it\u2019s just as fast to plug the phone in. Cons - Slower. Finicky. Extra cost. Takes desk top space. Wireless phone charging works. That\u2019s all the good you can say about it. I think it\u2019s funny now that android is stepping away from it, Apple is finally going to it. Weird. ",
