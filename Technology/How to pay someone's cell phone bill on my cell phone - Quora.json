            "answer_text": "Absolutely. It\u2019s possible. Depending on the other persons carrier, the steps may vary. You may or may not need personal information or their password. Most POSTPAID (contract) bills can be done at a carrier store with a minimal amount of knowledge. You walk in, tell a person \u201cI\u2019d like to put this amount of money on the account with this telephone number\u201d and they will almost always take it. If you don\u2019t know the persons carrier or its prepaid, it\u2019s a little harder, but can be done if you\u2019re communicating with them. Now, it is hard to ANONYMOUSLY pay someone\u2019s bill, especially if it\u2019s prepaid. You would not have the minimum amount of information required to direct your payment to the proper end, but not fully impossible, if you can determine at the least, which provider or carrier it is.

            "answer_text": "Easiest answer is to call the carrier and tell them what you want to do. They will take your credit card number and credit the other person\u2019s account. Slightly harder, but still doable is you get the carrier application that lets you pay bills and enter all the right stuff. This requires you have intimate knowledge of the other person\u2019s phone arrangements. You will need their password and possibly a PIN code. If they don\u2019t want to give this information to you, you are back to the first technique. Me? I wouldn\u2019t even ask about the second way. Just do it by calling. ",
