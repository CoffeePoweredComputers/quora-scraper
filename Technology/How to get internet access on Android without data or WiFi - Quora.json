            "answer_text": "Dear Quorans are all wrong. Actually you can get internet access on Android without data plan or WiFi. Fast, simple and unlimited. Most of USB OTG-capable devices would have no problems with USB Ethernet adapters, at least RNDIS-compatible ones. It's fast - you could easily saturate USB 2.0 with Gigabit Ethernet adapter, that's up to 480Mbps. It\u2019s simple - if the network you're plugging into has DHCP (most do), it's just plug-and-play. It's unlimited - usually there's no traffic accounting on copper ports, at least on small networks. And a lot of Ethernet ports available has an internet access, be sure to choose one with greater speed. So, all you need is an USB Ethernet adapter, internet-connected Ethernet port at a router (it may look as wall socket with RJ-45 receptacle) and a patch cable long enough to get yourself comfortably seated. Enjoy! :) ",

            "answer_text": "To get internet (fast, slow, limited or unlimited), you need an internet connection. It can be a WiFi connection from your router that\u2019s connected to your cable internet. It can be by mobile data. It can even be by an Ethernet adapter for your phone to connect it to your router that\u2019s connected to the internet by wire. But you need an internet connection. You don\u2019t get internet access without an internet connection. Which type of connection is up to you, but \u201cnone\u201d isn\u2019t one of the choices that works. ",
