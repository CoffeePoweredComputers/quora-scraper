            "answer_text": "Using a cellphone for a long time isn\u2019t necessarily detrimental to cognitive abilities, depending on what you do. That being said, the use of cellphones in conjunction with certain things will. Social media for instance, is one of the primary applications that most affects our attention span. This is because with consistent use of apps such as Facebook, we tend to become more partial towards instant gratification from likes and comments on our posts. This means that things we would have enjoyed before, such as reading and drawing, are no longer as rewarding because the gratification comes much later. There are, of course, other miscellaneous factors, such as if we use our phones at night, we will affect our sleep cycles due to disruptions in melatonin production. We can easily develop habits that are borderline obsessive where we no longer feel comfortable without our phones, and so on and so forth. Spending too much time on your cellphone isn\u2019t as dangerous as people think. ",
