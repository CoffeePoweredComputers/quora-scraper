            "answer_text": "Depends on what category. Japan is ahead in standard of living and their economy is much larger than the UK\u2019s however culturally the UK stands far ahead of Japan and in that case, most nations. The world's most widely spoken language is English and a lot of previous old English inventions are mainstream (the industrial revolution, suits and ties, the telephone etc.). I think ultimately it depends on what category and it does go both ways. Without the UK, there would be no industry in Japan and without Japan, a lot of advances in computer and mobile hardware would not occur. ",
