            "answer_text": "Use a known, fixed resistor R to charge the unknown value cap C after it is fully discharged through shorting its terminals. Use a known fixed voltage V as the source for charging. Use the Exponential equation for capacitor charging . Observe the time t required to reach a certain fixed voltage . You can calculate the exact value of this cap using that data you observe. OR Use a constant current source . Use the simple equation CV=IT So, C =(I/V)T. Charge the initially discharged cap using the const , known current I for a known time T. Observe the voltage V across the cap C. Calculate the value of C using that data. OR Use a capacitive voltage divider of a known fixed capacitor C1 with this capacitor C to divide a known ac voltage of fixed amplitude and fixed frequency. Measure the voltage across the unknown cap. The ration of the voltages can be used to calculate the unknown cap. ",
