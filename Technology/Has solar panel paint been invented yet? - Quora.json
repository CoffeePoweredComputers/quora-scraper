            "answer_text": "Yes it has been invented. It will be commercially available within few years. Here\u2019s an article which will help you to know more about solar paint. Researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne(Australia) have developed an innovative solar paint that produces endless clean energy from water vapour. This revolutionary paint takes up moisture from the air and splits into oxygen and hydrogen. This hydrogen emitted is captured as energy.  The paint combines the titanium oxide, a white pigment used in many wall paints with a new compound called synthetic molybdenum-sulphide. This molybdenum-sulphide acts like a silica gel, which is used to absorb moisture and keep the things fresh and dry. Synthetic molybdenum-sulphide acts as a semi-conductor and also catalysis the splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. As a result, hydrogen is captured as a fuel source. A simple addition of new material to titanium oxide converts a wall into energy harvesting and fuel producing wall. Read more here :This new solar paint creates endless energy from water vapour ",
