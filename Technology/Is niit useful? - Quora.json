            "answer_text": "Ok I will give answer on my personal experience with NIIT. I took admission in GNIIT. The course looked good at start. After I took admission they started conducting classes. Classes were not up to the mark. The faculties use to only read the slides and nothing else. The biggest problem started afterwards. I gave bhavishya jyoti scholarship and my fee was 125000. I started paying in instalments. I completely paid my fees and then they asked for more and told me that my fee was 140000. I showed them all the documents and then they told me to pay next instalment of 4000, they would give it back afterwards. Then they didn\u2019t allow me to give any exam as they told me I didn\u2019t pay full fees. I again went and showed them the documents then they said they will look into the matter and said they were sorry. Then again same thing happened. The same thing happened for around 3 years and I couldn\u2019t even complete the GNIIT course as I was not allowed to give the exam. The same thing happened to all the people in my batch. My dads 129000 rupees have gone to waste and I was not able to do anything. I belong to a lower middle class family. I live my life in regret that because of me my dads money has gone in waste. Sadly I couldn\u2019t go to court and also other people from my batch were afraid to goto court and file a complaint on NIIT. I couldn\u2019t get any support from anyone. It has been 6 years now and I\u2019m still regreting the decision to join NIIT. NIIT is just looting everyone. Please do not join NIIT. Instead join some other course like CDAC its government course. Yes one more thing I forgot to mention they had my entire batch enrolled for cloud computing forcefully as they said that everyone has to take it. And we took it. We paid extra 30000 for that which made the total course fee of 155000 and I paid 159000 and of that I didn\u2019t get anything back. I did GNIIT course from chembur(Mumbai, India) branch and now it is closed. ",
