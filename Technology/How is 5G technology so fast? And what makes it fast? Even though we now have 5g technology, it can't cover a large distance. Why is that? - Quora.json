            "answer_text": "How is 5G technology so fast? And what makes it fast? Even though we now have 5g technology, it can't cover a large distance. Why is that? Like the standards that preceded it, the \u201c5th Generation\u201d of cellular standards includes some new ways to modulate the radio frequency to include more bits in the same bandwidth of a radio channel. That means it can be faster, since it\u2019s like travelling in a bus. The bus goes the same speed, but if the bus has more seats, it can carry more people. Which means that if you\u2019re trying to move people from one place to another, the buses with more seats can do it much faster. Additionally, 5G standards allow for the operation on a much wider range of frequencies. \u201cModulation\u201d is something very much dependent on the frequency of the radio wave. If you can imagine it in a very simple form, each time a radio wave completes one cycle, assume it contains a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c0\u201d. So, if it was just your household power, it could carry 60 bits every second for power lines that use 60Hz (60 cycles per second) AC current. Cellular radio uses radio waves at about 900,000Hz - 2,400,000Hz. That\u2019s a lot of bits. But 5G standards make it possible to use much higher frequencies\u2026all the way up to 100,000,000Hz. So that means 5G could carry lots more bits than our current 4G and 3G standards will allow. Ah\u2026 but there\u2019s a problem. The higher the frequency, the shorter the range. That\u2019s why you hear about the shorter range of 5G. Radio waves are absorbed by water, and air has lots of water in it (humidity). But its only shorter at those higher frequencies. If they implement it at the same frequency as 4G (which is what they are doing) the range is the same as 4G. But it won\u2019t be as super-fast as the sales people want you to beleive.. ",

            "answer_text": "5G has greater bandwidth, meaning it can handle many more connected devices than 4G. The speed (actually capacity) can go from 30Mbit/s to ~3 Gbit/s & approaching fibre. Of course, with fibre, we can add as many \u2018pipes\u2019 as we need. With wireless, the spectrum is limited & shared for multiple uses. Huawei says it achieved 3.67Gbps peak using mid-band in Switzerland Low-band 5G is similar to 4G & with 30\u2013250Mb/s.Mid-band 5G uses microwaves of 2.5-3.7 GHz, with 100-900 Mb/s (most frequent & with range of several km per cell)High-band 5G currently uses frequencies of 25\u201339GHz with ~1Gb/s & higher. This is called mmWave & has much higher capacity but shorter range/penetration & will require many smaller cells for dense urban areas (1km radius if affected by walls/obstacles). Another significant factor is reduced latency from 50ms to 10x less (potentially 1\u20134ms.This is critical for some applications, eg. remote surgery, games, car to car communication to avoid accidents.The latency is improved with Edge cloud connections coming closer to the end devices, like in the GIF picture below.
