            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll go first. Not sure what you mean by commercially useful - for who, for what. But whatever your answer is, mine is the same. Nobody has a clue. For instance, in the US there are over one million small drones registered with the FAA. The common wisdom is that number represents less than half of all the drones sold here for recreational use since 2011\u201312. The feeling, though no one is positive is that most if not all drones used for commercial purposes (i.e. flown under Part 107) are registered for a variety of reasons. But they account for perhaps 10% of the registered fleet. Keep in mind that for the most part there is no difference between a DJI Mavic purchased for commercial or recreational use. The functionality and capabilities are the same though the missions may be quite different. ",
