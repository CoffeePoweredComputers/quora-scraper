            "answer_text": "My first order of business would be to replace the emphasis of consumption/consumerism with one of creativity/expressionism. Then I'd level the playing field. People wouldn't have any stress as far as ever going into poverty. Everyone would have enough to eat, reasonable clothing and reasonable housing. With all of the basics covered, crime would be lowered considerably. Crooked politicians and corrupt governments would be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up if need be. Life long politicians that forgot how to relate to the people they \u201crepresent\" would be weeded out. There'd be no more campaign financing from corporations or from billionaire eccentrics. The legal system and prison enterprise would also change along with the world of politics. Space exploration and building new civilizations would become a priority. Moreover, education would be geared more towards innovation, exploration and the individuals own strengths/interests. There would be a bartering system once again. Not a system that replaced money altogether, but more of a second option for people to help eachother out through personal negotiations/services. I figure all of this is a decent start to get the wheels in motion. Naturally there would be drawbacks and the unexpected. Human nature is greedy and isn't always predictable. I'm glad I'm not in charge of the fate of humanity. If I was I'm sure I'd be pissing on somebody else's parade, even with the best of intentions you can't win everybody over. ",
