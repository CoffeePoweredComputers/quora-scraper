            "answer_text": "I would find someone to help you who has these skills. Once you have written something, they should not only make the corrections, but they should do this on your written page, so you can see what changes they made. If you can team up with someone at work, that will do nicely.Even better is to get two such persons, have them each make corrections or changes and then compare. Talented editors are rare. They are usually persons who read widely, care about grammar and spelling, and are very particular.It also might help to see which style book that your work uses.Chicago manual of style, New York times manual of style. These will go into detail about what is acceptable, what is not acceptable and what are the preferred ways to do things. Another way to approach your writing is to work at it on the sentence level. A great book to learn to do this is The Art of Styling Sentences: 20 Patterns for Success    To do this method you learn patterns, and then make up your own. Here are the ten I teach my writing students.  1. One word sentences. Examples: Stop! Who? No.  2. Questions. Who did you say she was? Where are you going? Did you see that? 3. 2-5 word sentences. Don't do that again. Sit up. Go away, you freak! She said that? 4. Two ideas attached by a semicolon instead of and or but. She cooks dinner; I do the dishes. I rob banks; she drives the getaway car. 5. Sentence within a sentence set off by dashes. My father - who was born in Chicago - loved deep dish pizza. Babe Ruth - who hit more home runs than anyone else in his time - liked to drink and dance and stay out all night.  6. Simple sentence. She never gets to school on time.  7. Dependent clause, simple sentence. Because she can never wake up early enough, she always arrives late to work. After the school bus passed, he was left by himself.   8. Dialogue: \"Are you kidding me?\" she asked. \"John never has time to eat breakfast,\" said Mr. Hanson, \"which is why he is always starving by the time lunch rolls around.\"  9. Twos. Bob and Ted are my best friends. She ate breakfast then went to school. She eats and she sleeps.  and  Threes. She goes to school, eats lunch, and then comes home and takes a nap. Bob, Fred and Ted are the three best players on the team. She can talk, do her makeup and mess with her phone all at once. 10: List following a colon. She made breakfast: oatmeal, eggs, bacon, toast, grits, ham, sausage, cereal, pancakes, waffles and coffee. He found a pile in his drawer: 13 pennies, a brush, two bus tickets, a two dollar and a twenty dollar bill, 4 Hershey's kisses and 26 ancient valentine's day heart candies in a plastic bag.  There are other sentence patterns, well worth learning, but since I teach elementary kids, I stick with these ten. Do each of the patterns 5-6 times daily for six months, and you will see them become part of your writing. You will begin to notice them used by the pro writers who write for great magazines and newspapers like the NY Times, National Geographic, Sports Illustrated, etc.  Once you can easily do six samples of each, try this exercise. Take a sentence, the imagine what would come after it, or before it and after it. She made breakfast.  That morning when she woke up she had the strangest feeling, like something bad was about to happen.  She made breakfast. As she did, she kept looking up, expecting the phone to ring or a policeman to burst through the door, or a siren to sound.  But there was nothing but the barking of dogs and the distant hum of the city.   Another exercise to try is to show rather than tell. Tell: He robbed a bank. Show. He pushed open the dusty glass door and stepped inside. Each footstep echoed back hollowly from the far wall. An ancient ceiling fan buzzed and whirred lazily, send up flies that rose and then settled again.  Dust motes floated down in the shaft of yellow light that came in through the one tall floor to ceiling window.  A bank guard nodded and went back to listening to the ball game on his phone. He waited his turn in line, and when he finally got to the front, took the note from his front pocket, pushed it under the glass partition. He set the package, which ticked loudly, onto the ledge and leaned forward. The red headed cashier - a fat woman about fifty with fiery ringlets straight out of a dye box - read the note and wide eyed, looked up at him. \"I'd like all the money. But no dye packets. Leave those out. And no pressing buttons. Understand?\" he hissed.  She gulped, nodded, and began counting out packs of twenties and one hundreds, her wide eyes never leaving the ticking package.  The two in line behind him, a fat man and a thin, tiny grandmother, shifted their feet, bored, waiting for him to finish. Another exercise: Five paragraph essay. Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them using three lines of argument, then tell them what you told them.  Prompt: Should football be banned in high school? Response (An example of the five paragraph essay) : I think that football should be banned, as funadamentally unsafe, not only in junior and senior high schol but until an athlete reaches age twenty one. As the recent movie Concussion showed, if you play football, you will likely damage your brain and that damage is irreversible. Sixty Minutes recently quoted an expert on helmet to helmet collisions. This expert worked with the NFL until the NFL tooks his findings and hid them. But by working with a number of high school football teams over a number of years, he came to this startling conclusion: the average high school football payer has 650 helmet to helmet collisions each season.You do not have to have a concussion to damage your brain. Small collisions rattle the brain around in your skull, and cumulatively, damage the brain. Moreover, students below the age of 21 are being used for other entertainment before they are old enough to decide if they wish to participate. Though they might agree, or even want to play in their teen or pre teen years, they are too young to agree. Further, their brains are not yet developed enough for them to make wise decisions. But most importantly, football is designed to be violent, and helmets are designed to hurt. Football could have - as boxing has done - designed a helmet that was both protective and outwardly soft. Instead they chose a hard plastic design that, like a weapon, almost encourages helmet to helmet collisions. Because football irreversibly damages brains, because that damage is cumulative, because the helmet is designed to hurt and encourage collsions and because students below the age of 21 don't have sufficiently developed brains or decision making capabilities, football should be banned until an athlete reaches the age of twenty one.   Learn the 10, or better yet 20 forms, practice them daily for 6-12 months. Learn to show rather than tell. Learn to expand one sentence into a number of sentences. Learn and master the 5 paragraph essay. Do all of these and you will go a long way towards vastly improving your English writing.   ",

            "answer_text": "I belong to a middle class family and my father did not have enough income so that he could enroll me in a good school, so he got me admitted in a government school where studies done in Hindi medium and daily in government school There was no education as well in english, which had a great impact on children\u2019s learning and learning skills\u2019 due to which I do not know very good English but I understand a little English So I used to write paragraphs on one of two topics daily, due to which my writing skill improved and a little English learning was also improved and simultaneously started making notes in English and Started reading online. Practicing daily makes the writing skill faster and improves. So, I am giving some tips which are given at the point below which can improve writing skills 1.Expand your language ; To express yourself clearly, you want a fantastic active vocabulary. That is not just being in a position to recognise a lot of words it means really having the ability to use them properly. Do so by learning new phrases such as sentences, not only word lists. Hint; If you find out a new phrase, try learn all of the forms of this word as well as the prepositions which are usually used with that. (by way of instance, instead of simply the term'depend', take note of: to rely on, to be determined by, a dependant. 2. For instance ; 'bare' and'keep' sound exactly the exact same but'bare' signifies nude and'bear' is a massive creature. Furthermore, incorrect spelling makes it hard for your reader to comprehend exactly what you've written. Hint; Exercise your text using flash cards and test yourself if you've got some spare time. 3. Read frequently; People often state that we learn to write best by reading. Reading in English is useful in a lot of ways. It's a great way to get an notion of the different styles of writing and determine how to use phrases appropriately. Hint; Pick articles or books with topics which interest you. Learning should not be dull. Read each text a few times to make sure that you know how to use new words and expressions in the text. 4.Improve your grammar; Always use the proper tense and remember to use punctuation. Hint; Consistently proof-read your writing double. The first time, look for general mistakes and also the second time search for mistakes with the specific grammar point your are studying at the moment. 5. Just get it done! Writing could be daunting. However, the best way to improve is get a pen and paper or sit in front of your computer and really write. Be prepared to write several versions of each text as even for professional writers, the first draft is not ideal. Remember, practice makes perfect, so now is the best time to sit down and get started with our complimentary English quizzes.  ",
