            "answer_text": "If you mean the copy and paste functions of an operating system like Windows, those functions are integrated into the OS and cannot be removed or disabled easily (although one search response suggests a PowerShell script to clear the clipboard periodically), as far as I know. Most commenters agree this is a terrible idea, anyway. There are registry hacks to disable the clipboard history, if that\u2019s what you are after. If you mean something else, please clarify your question. ",
