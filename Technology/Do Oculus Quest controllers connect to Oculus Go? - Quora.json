            "answer_text": "Oculus Quest controllers have a wireless (RF) link with the headset (HMD). This means that both the controller and the headset have transmitters and receivers for message exchanges. Oculus Go does not have these transceivers built into it and a Quest controller will not be able to communicate with the Oculus Go headset. As a result, Oculus Gp controllers cannot connect to Oculus Go. ",
