            "answer_text": "The revolution in technology has made customer service more outbound focused rather than inbound focused. In fact, customer service has changed so much due to new technology that building a culture centered around great customer service has made businesses realize how much value and revenue it can generate. Because customer service now has more access to data than ever before as well. Automation has made processes a lot more efficient so teams no longer have to help customers from a single source. With data, automation, and integrations, customer service is also no longer bound to a single team. Overall, customer service is no longer just a cost center but a revenue generating center for businesses. Being able to help customers, talk to customers, convert customers, and get better visibility into their behavior has made customer service a relationship building tool rather than a problem solving tool. Technologies such as pusher and socket based real time messaging has also broken customer service out of its natural habitat, email. Customers can now talk to businesses across social media, SMS, chat, etc. Customer service used to be, again, about inbound. Modern service is about inbound, outbound, education, and relationship building. These have implications for the tools that evolve to address these needs.
