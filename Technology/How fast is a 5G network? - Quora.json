            "answer_text": "5G Transmission Speed: Up to 1 terabit/sec New wireless technologies always offer faster speeds, but speed can mean at least three different things: speeds achieved in the lab or in limited trials, peak speeds achieved in the real world under ideal conditions, and the speeds that real users in the real world achieve on average. Although 5G is still in its early days, there is some data indicating what each measure is likely to be. The fastest-ever 5G lab transmission has been 1 terabit per second, and the record for a field trial currently stands at 35 Gbps. Neither is a good indicator of real-world speeds in the short term, although longer-term projections are that 20 Gbps may be an achievable real-world peak speed. 5G under real-world conditions will likely be slower than 35 Gbps but still markedly faster than 4G networks\u2014and also faster than some fiber and cable solutions. In general, peak speeds of more than 1 Gbps are likely, although that would only be for someone ideally situated, very close to the transmitter, and using the network when it was not busy. Nonetheless, according to simulations, median data speeds would surge with the upgrade to 5G, based on the cell-site locations and spectrum allocations of two current networks. One simulation based on a Frankfurt-based network estimated a ninefold increase in median speed, from 56 Mbps to 490 Mbps. Another test based on a San Francisco network calculated a 20-fold increase, from 71 Mbps for a median 4G user to 1.4 Gbps for a median 5G user if using mmWave coverage. As with real estate, achieved speeds will come down to location, location, and location! Speed is not the only benefit of 5G networks, of course. Another additional potential benefit is lower latency: the time it takes to send a message from a device to the network and get the answer back. 4G networks average latencies of around 60 milliseconds (ms), although there can be considerable variation, and 4G latencies could theoretically be lower than that. But 5G networks will have, in time, a latency of less than 1 ms. Read more at 5G Transmission Speeds - Bulk Outside Plant Cable & Equipment ",

            "answer_text": "5G is very fast, at least in the high frequency range of the technology (the low-frequency range is just 10\u201350 percent faster than 4G LTE). The peak data rate should be 20 gigabits per second, about 200 times faster than the 100 megabits per second peak data rate of the current 4G LTE mobile data. The median rate should be 0.5\u20131.5 gigabits per second \u2013 which would still be enough to enable a one-second download of movies. On top of that, 5G should have a vastly reduced latency (the time needed for preparations to send the message etc.) relatively to 4G. 5G should eliminate the waiting. For many years, 5G will allow faster mobile data than what almost all existing devices may actually exploit and \u201cunnecessarily fast\u201d will probably be the main criticism for years. Needless to say, once some technologies \u2013 driving cars and others \u2013 start to intensely exploit the immense speed, the situation may change quickly and 5G may look \u201cinsufficiently fast\u201d in 2025 or so. The 5G network technology is already being installed by Telecom companies along with Nokia, Samsung, Ericsson, Huawei, and a few other producers of the antennas in big parts of the world. The consumer devices will have to wait for a few months if not a year or two. For example, iPhones with 5G chips will only be released in 2020 because Intel \u2013 producing these chips for Apple \u2013 has some problems to create the 7-nanometer chips that are needed for 5G to be sufficiently battery-saving.
