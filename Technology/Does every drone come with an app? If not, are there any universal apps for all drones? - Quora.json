            "answer_text": "Many commercial drones these days do, so that they can be controlled via phone or controller. Most apps are quite simple and how they operate, which ports they send messages on and the data protocols can be analysed and manipulated via tools such as WireShark. In terms of universal apps, that would be something i\u2019d like to see! It is possible to control a drone via a python script for example, as they are just computer systems that require instructions to move the rotors, switch on lights, make sounds etc. So in theory a universal app (that communicates on different levels of RF/wifi) is possible. For some drones it may need to handle different types of encoding/encryption to send or receive signals to and from the drone. ",
