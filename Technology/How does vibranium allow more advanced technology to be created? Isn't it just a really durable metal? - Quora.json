            "answer_text": "If the question is limited to the MCU, it\u2019s not clear. Vibranium absorbs energy and stores it for future release. It\u2019s not clear how access to that metal enables Wakandan scientists to discover how to generate force fields, anti-gravity, particle weapons and the like. The fundamental problem is that in order to get there, they need to understand the scientific method. It\u2019s not clear from the MCU narrative how quickly they advanced beyond Western technology, but without that foundational groundwork they wouldn\u2019t advance much beyond \u201cthis is a super strong metal\u201d. Of course, they could easily handwave it away by saying that the Panther God Bast also inspired their scientists. This is the MCU after all, and Wakandan scientists figuring out how to create these technologies is just as realistic as Tony Stark inventing an AGI that designs the Iron Man suit for him. ",

            "answer_text": "What if there was no iron? Would there have been industrial revolution\u2026 would there have been cannons, guns, ships which in turn enabled european powers to colonize Asia and Africa. Similarly what if there was no silicon? There would be no transistors. With no transistors, no modern computers, no mobile phones. No solar cells and by a long shot no internet as the form we know today. World would be same as it was in 1970s with out any technological advancements. We would eventually reach where we are today but it would have taken more time. Similarly, extending the hypothesis, Vibranium is that wonder metal which has enabled Wakandans to excel in technology that is yet oblivion to rest of the world. Vibranium in itself absorbs complete vibrations, who knows this property of its atoms might work wonders when combined with other metals. Or it is just one of those comic book things to make storylines better and futuristic. ",
