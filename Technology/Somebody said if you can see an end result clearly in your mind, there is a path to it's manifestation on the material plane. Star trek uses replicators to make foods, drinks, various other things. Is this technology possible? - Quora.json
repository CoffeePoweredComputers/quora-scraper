            "answer_text": "No. This premise ignores the fact that seeing anything \u201cclearly in your mind\" has no effect on reality. If it did, children would never fall when they jump off the roof of the doghouse with towels around their necks absolutely while seeing clearly in their mind that such is what allows Superman to fly. Star Trek replicators have just enough handwaving treksplanation to seem plausible. Back that up with a pretty light show and it does its job which is to help the audience reach the willing suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy a story in science fiction. That's not to say that sf and Trek aren't useful in speculating about what could be in the future. 3D printing might someday provide similar immediate gratification in material goods, but not by converting matter to energy and back to matter but by people learning how reality works and then using that knowledge to their advantage. Imagination is a powerful force, but if it gets stuck playing in imaginary scenarios, it won't have a chance to be applied to reality. Reality does not care what you see clearly in your mind. ",

I can, with minimal effort, see an infinite variety of end results that I know no one will ever achieve for reasons like violation of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, etc. Star Trek replicators are one of those tech ideas based on a failure to understand not science, but economics. Sure, everything is made of energy. But how much energy does it take to make energy into food, compared with using, for example, chemistry to make various precursor molecules into food? Also, no one who actually likes food wants it to be identical every time down to the last molecule. ",
