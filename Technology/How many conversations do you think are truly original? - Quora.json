            "answer_text": "There is nothing new under the sun - especially when it comes to talking! What is unique is when talk leads to action. When someone said, you know if I did this, what would happen? I don't know, why don't you try it? - The results would be unique, but the conversation wouldn't have been. For instance, when Einstein discovered Atoms, it was just the end of 2000 years of conversations which started when some Greeks started talking about the building blocks of life. Maybe some of their conversations were unique, but people have wondered about life forever, and would have drifted into the conversations that Einstein was having - the meanings would have been the same, but the words and the definitions might not have been. So yes, there have been unique conversations, but in the grand scheme of things, it hasn't lead to anything and so isn't important. ",
