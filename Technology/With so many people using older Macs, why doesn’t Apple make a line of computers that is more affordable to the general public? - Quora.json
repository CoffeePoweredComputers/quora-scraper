That would mean entering the market for consumer-grade PCs which is horrifically competitive and with profit margins you can barely see. They are making a profit on Macs without having to enter the MMA-level market of $500 PCs. I would personally hate to have to be in that market because every night I would have nightmares of one of my competitors suddenly finding a way to shave ten cents off the price of their machines and eating our lunch.

This is why I\u2019m happy to drop money on new Macs: I know they\u2019ll last. I bought a G4 Sawbuck Tower in the late 1990s and it strictly still runs to this day though I don\u2019t use it because I can\u2019t run the latest MacOS on it. My G4 Mac Cube also still runs fine. This is why you buy value. And why buying old Macs can be a reason value for people on budgets. ",
