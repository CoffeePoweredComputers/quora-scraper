            "answer_text": "None whatever. Lightning is relatively infrequent, unpredictable, and occurs in a form that is extremely difficult to use. Lightning is massive, brief surges of electron flow. Thousands of amperes, thousands of volts, which lasts no more than a couple of seconds. Electricity cannot be stored, as can be done with rainwater or ice. We could not use it to charge batteries, because the rate of energy flow is so enormous that any battery would simply melt, or otherwise decompose. In principle, the electricity could be used to charge up capacitors, but they would have to be incredibly massive, with dielectrics materials which do not exist and are far beyond the capabilities of any known materials. Nor could we use the electricity to heat water, for example. Yes, a bolt of lightning hitting a tree, can in some circumstances instantly convert the water inside the tree into steam, actually causing the tree to explode. There are ways to store steam, and to use what is called flash steam, but the infrequency of lightning, the unpredictability, and the wide spread of areas where it occurs, makes any kind of steam generation scheme simply impractical. Yes, in principle it would be nice to find ways to harness lightning, and to be able to utilize all that energy productively. It would also be nice to use the vast amounts of energy expended by all the birds flying, or to collect all the methane generated by cows farting, or to route save all the excess heat generated during summertime for heating our houses during winter. But these are only fantasies. We have, in recent years, found ways to harness and use some of the energy available from wind blowing, or from sun shining. But we still cannot harness the vast energy of a hurricane or a tornado or a derecho \u2014 such energy is wasted, or worse, because it goes into destroying cities and farmlands. Similarly for solar energy, which can be utilized in small amounts, but which is impractical because it is not continuous, and is present in places and at times where and when the electric power is not needed, in the main. Many people, I daresay most of whom are more educated than you and quite likely many even smarter than you, have considered whether and how the vast energy expenditures of nature might be harnessed, and utilized for cheap or free power. There are enormous reasons why that cannot be done. However, there is one natural source of energy which can be harnessed and managed to provide very low cost electricity. That is nuclear radiation, from chain reactions of radioactive materials breaking down into simpler atoms. Nuclear power can supply us with virtually unlimited energy, available where and when it is needed, in varying amounts according to the instantaneous demand. However, the capital costs of nuclear power are extremely high. Waste products and power plant materials create tremendous disposal problems. Protection from damage to the power plants is an enormous concern, as it can lead to terrilble tragedies \u2014 such as Chernobyl or Fukashima. Brilliant and competent people are at work all the time, trying to find ways to use naturally available energy, to provide power for homes, businesses, and cities. But the sad fact is that most of the power expended by nature, cannot be harnessed for human use, or the cost of doing so would vastly outweigh the benefits achieved. ",

            "answer_text": "The current situation regarding lightning bolts is that they can cause enormous financial damage and kill people located at an electric generating or transformer, or switching station. Therefore , there are extensive efforts to dampen the effects of enormous rogue voltages on these facilities; the primary technology is to create a very large ground mat of copper to dissipate the randomly created incoming voltage. Other strategies involve keeping metering equipment from being destroyed and saving the lives of any staff members who may happen to be washing their hands or climbing stairs holding a handrail. These strategies do not convert lightning strikes into useable electrical energy . Sorry ",
