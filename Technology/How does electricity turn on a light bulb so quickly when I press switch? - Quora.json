            "answer_text": "Interesting notion. You feel that although the evidence of your eys shows you how fast something happens you feel it should be slower. Yes I know what you mean how can those pesky electrons get through that solid material so fast. Until I strted reading questions and answers in Quora I had not worried about this. Then I saw one of the answers to a similar question. Turns out individual electrons only move a short distance. What moves fast is the applied field that starts the movement of charge round the circuit. So charge moves slowly but electrical field us fast. Next consider what evidence you have for how fast a signal passes down the wire from the switch to the bulb. A slmilar situation is when you are on a phone call to someone hundreds of miles away. How long must you wait for an answer? The physics of the signal down a wire is similar just as well the signal seems to travel pretty fast. In that case it's even harder to believe electrons could be so mobile. Turns out they don't have to be. Its the the voltage that travels so fast not the electrons. I had never thought about that till yesterday. Good this. ",

            "answer_text": "hi. Simple example. Hold long stick in your hand. Touch one end to the light switch. Now slowly move your and forward. Presto! the light switches on instantaneously, though your hand was moving too slowly to have reached the switch. Why? Obviously, all particles in the stick started moving forward along with your hand - so, instantaneous effect on switch due to forward movement of the stick end touching the switch. Electric current is just like that. it is not necessary that the electron near the switch activated the light. All electrons in the wire simultaneously move ahead due to a cascading effect. i.e. a more of less stick like effect reaches the light long before your electron reaches the light! terribly dumbed down example, but it gets the point across.
