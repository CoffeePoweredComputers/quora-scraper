            "answer_text": "At the moment it is new technology. It is precision farming at its best. If you have a self driven tractor and self driven planter. You cut away a lot of possible errors. The only errors you might encounter is mechanical ( oil leak/flat tire) or human error (did not set the correct GPS coordinates). This is a very good thing on the farmers behalf. It is not such a good thing for the farm workers. Essentially they will be laid off because the farmer only needs a skeleton staff crew. This is still a long way off. Turning your farm into a farm that is \u201crun by robotics\u201d is still a long way off. At the moment it is still very expensive. It is not reliable in countries with bad connection. There are still a lot of problems that has to be solved. I work for Laeveld Agrochem. We have started what is called MyFarmWeb. Which is an App that has your farm's entire history, soil classification, pest monitoring and much much more on there. It even predicts what yield you will have in the type of soil you planted. Yet all that information is mostly relevant to vegetables crops at the moment. Don't get me wrong. It works on other crops as well, but just not as well as on vegetables. https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23&ved=0ahUKEwihxqrby6TYAhUKDMAKHU2QDY0Qxa8BCCQwAA&usg=AOvVaw0VTJzWxrN8ZFOD4xbU2nov The future of self operating farms is exciting and interesting. All farms will have to go there at some point if they want to stay ahead. Otherwise they will not make as much profit and they will end up closing shop. Luckily they still have quite some time to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "What is robotics in agriculture? Before you can answer that you have to have a definitive definition of what a robot is\u2026 Unfortunately currently one doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019ve been in multiple discussions with robot scientists and engineers and almost every definition was ether vague enough to include machines that most people wouldn\u2019t consider robots or so limiting to exclude machines that most people would consider robots. My personal definition is: \u201cA machine that senses and interacts with its environment\u201d. Note: by \u201csenses and interacts\u201d I mean it senses changes in its environment and uses that information to change how it manipulates the objects in it\u2019s environment. A conveyor belt is a machine but not a robot; but add an occupancy sensor to turn it on/off (like the one used at your grocery store\u2019s check out counter) and you have a robot. This definition would include all the assembly line robots manufacturing most of our consumer goods. (in all fairness my definition would probably include your home furnace\u2026 something most people would not consider a robot. ;-) \u2014 Ok, that said, there aren\u2019t many current/common farm machines that most people would consider robots. However there are some in development. I\u2019ve seen several variants of camera controlled plant sprayers. The most complex one is based on a \u201chigh boy\u201d (a tall spraying rig with hydraulic motors on each wheel). High definition broad spectrum cameras are mounted on each side of each row of crops near the front of the rig. Artificial intelligence is used to analyze the camera feeds to identify each plant and its specific needs. Computer controlled sprayers mounted near the back of the rig then apply the specific chemicals (pesticide, fertilizer, water, etc.) on a plant by plant basic. Because the chemical usage is fine tuned specifically for each plant this system uses 90% less chemicals that traditional spray rigs (which indiscriminately just spray every plant the same). That\u2019s 90% less waste to end up in our rivers and streams. Note: There is no operator for this spray rig; it\u2019s AI drives the rig and controls the sprayers. The only human intervention is necessary when the chemical tanks need to be refilled. (Note: a traditional internal combustion engine is used to generate energy to run the computers and electronics for the cameras and sprayers as well as the hydraulic pressure to drive the wheels. This engine has a fuel tank that has to be manually filled (by a human) as well.)

            "answer_text": "There are different kinds of mobile robots, such as aerial drones, ground rovers, and autonomous cars, as well as waterborne drones! The use of autonomous drones allows collecting accurate data about crop performance and or to assess crop damage in specific locations and times to regulate natural capital markets and to provide date to crop insurance companies. Mobile robotics allows to gather data in a more flexible and scalable way, providing data that is impossible to obtain any other way. And the use of Blockchain and other decentralized technologies allows us to guarantee data consistency so that it cannot be manipulated by malefactors. ",

Main area of its application is during harvest, also, they are now being employed for controlling weeds. Are they replacing human labor? Yes, these robots are being employed in activities like Fruit picking, sheep rearing, pruning, weeding, spraying and even monitoring. This way they are replacing human labor and making all the tasks easier thereby turning to be an advantage to the agriculture industry. Benefits to Agriculture sector- The major benefits that they are providing are- Help in producing higher quality of produce.Lowering the cost of productionReduces the need of manual laborAutomating the manual tasks like weed/bracken spraying etc.In sum, Robotics are making Agricultural tasks easier and efficient. The need is to use them wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "My suggestion is that one need not bring robot to agri field. I say so because robot is a machine which is capable of doing multi-tasks at a single time in a controversy to human. If they are used so they will reduce man-power. It will lead to reduction in the number of farmers there by leading to unemployment. Also I think that one might have heard of Hydroponics. In that technique the machine used is costly. Also if it is repaired or damaged then it is very much costlier to replace. Robots in Agriculture is not suitable to countries like India which is mainly a country dependent on red-collar job. Also that India is one of the largest populated country. This leads to unemployment in India ultimately to poverty. But one of the best use of robot is that they reduce man power. This makes our India to develop industrially. Hence I leave the answer in the hands of the person who chose this project. It is even good also bad. Sorry for my English ",
