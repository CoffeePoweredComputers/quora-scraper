            "answer_text": "Both Democrats and Republicans have been good on an emergency level for saving and beginning to revive small business in America after the COVID devastation. Here is how each does it but both can contribute / work and must be done in tandem and that has been to save the economy. But only the Democrats agenda will really do anything for small business, which is a tremendous irony given the traditional idea of Republicans is they are main street and the Democrats are union. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Dems in fact are the friends and protectors and the best by far for reviving small business in America in spite of being clumsy and hardly able to communicate anything other than slogans. They still are getting it done and thank god for that. THE PARTIES TOGETHER Bi partisan participation in all of the bills passed to fight CV19 have worked.The Republican focus is :Large Corporates 1st - No help to small businesses unless they were vendors serving large corporates like airlines. And there are very few in that category as you have to be a big guy to serve the big guys.No liabilities for anyone (favors corporates) - No help for small businesses.Distribution of funds via banks (leaves less available to businesses). Also it means your likelihood for funds lowers if your business is a small cash type like a restaurant or salon and does not have good banking relationships. Also if you are an expert in these processes.Expanded definition of \u2018small\u2019 for businesses up to several thousand employees and you could apply per location (small number, excellent for franchise or corporate multi locational business and file for each). - Hurt small businesses as they were slow to get money and the rules on wages vs loans meant many could not use the money.Agreeing to the Dems on their agenda but only to July, 2020Wont give in on anything new unless liabilities are covered in next bill. Could help small businesses but aimed at corporations.More money in next bill for corporatesLittle to none for states. So no help to small businesses.Massive multi trillion zero interest rate loans for corporates via the Federal Reserve. No benefit to small businesses not even trickle down.Democrat focusCash to individuals - $1,200 for individuals and $600 per week on top of state unemployment. Helps small businesses but could hurt them if workers dont want to come back as the 600 is a disincentive to return. Weak point for Dems, nice idea, saved millions as an emergency move, but not well conceived.Supported loans / payment to furloughed workers to small businesses. - Good one for Dems.Moratorium on loan repayments. - Excellent for Dems for small biz.Temporarily Forbid foreclosures, or getting kicked out if you cant pay your rent. - Excellent for Dems for individuals and small biz.Extending this as long as possible, at least September. - Again high marks to Dems.Agreeing with the Republican agenda but desperate to expand it to states, essential workers and keeping schools funded, police and other local and state services. - Massive advantage to Dems on supporting local govt means supporting local biz the primary services for small govt and beneficiary of increased spending which by definition is local.WHAT ARE WE MISSING? No one on either side is talking about reviving small businesses as neither party understands small businesses per se. Yep, Washington just doesnt get it but it is not all bad.They have little to no experience; only think of them as service business. Every time they fix something like loan forgiveness, the other side wants something in return.They are not dealing with the \u2018fake\u2019 economy of still taking money out, of tax cuts for the wealthy and an over reliance on small businesses that are highly vulnerable to any downturn.WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND CAN THE DEMS DO IT? DEMS can do it because they are focused on people, communities and even though they have no experience with \u2018small businesses\u2019 they get it that money in peoples hands and loans and rebuilding and community trust is the way forward. Also the Democratic agenda is perfect for \u2018main street\u2019 and not wall street regardless of how clumsy they are. Yes, WITH LOANS ESPECIALLY TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES and subsidies to cut the cost of loans for housing to move people from renters to buyers.Funding to rebuild with contracts to small SMEs not global companiesFocus on small solutions down to the micro level of funding for small businesses and funnel it through the statesEmploy the laid off state and local workers to spearhead this effort, keeps people in their jobs which is a typical Dem approach.Provide block grants (a typical Dem program) that includes job training like the famous COMPREHENSIVE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ACT (CETA) and make sure it is vocational jobs.Make community colleges and vocational/technical schools freeUniversal health care including lowering prescription drugsI could go on. Nothing that the current Republican corporate, tax cutting side will do anything for small businesses. The entire Democratic agenda, messy and ill conceived that it always is, is in fact perfect for small businesses. All they have to do is get the Senate to agree and Trump. That of course may prove to be impossible in the short run, but then again there is November. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. Democrats believe in a one size fits all model, and static models of growth. Dems put fourth a tax on yachts, thinking this wouldn\u2019t effect the number people purchased, and what happened, yacht sales in the new tax area fell, and the revenue didn\u2019t come to pass, this happens because too many Dems, think the real world works like the government world, and its just not true. Small businesses need people who understand the real world,how hard it is to keep a business going, less rules and regulations, or at least not adding new ones. Dems are all about growing government and controlling your life, because they believe all money is the governments and the people are to be controlled,not in control, Republicans understand that they work to serve the people and the people control the government.

            "answer_text": "Well, they are usually better at planning long term, so that means less easy-access seed money and more solid business plans needed to get funds. The goal is long-term survival and realism in planning\u2026 Not high-risk for high-reward (or BUST!!!). But then, they usually help the underdogs survive when they face problems, instead of getting erased and sold for parts\u2026 And the economy is usually more stable and less deregulated, which is good for exactly the long term, sensible, view that the Democrats like\u2026 Anyways. think about the last republican governments and what they ALL left behind. HUGE economic drains that had to be addressed by the newly elected Democrats.. EVERY TIME!!! Now who would you like to get to fix a failed economy? The party that usually BREAKS it,OR the party that usually FIXES it? Obama had to fix a HUGE deficit and disrupted public services AND finish a war that seemed to never end\u2026 AND he didn\u2019t scrap the country doing it\u2026 He left a pretty nice ship for Trump to sink in not even 4 years\u2026 The PROOF of this is all out there. So its about time for the brainwashed to READ everything, not just the same dribble! ",

That is the best thing to do for small businesses. The majority of people will immediately spend the money, starting money flow again That is how capitalism works, through the circulation of money.
