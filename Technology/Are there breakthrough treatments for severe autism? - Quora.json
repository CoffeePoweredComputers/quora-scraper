            "answer_text": "Severe autism means different things to different people. I shall limit myself to genuinely severe autism. Fragile X: Gene therapy exists. At least in Europe. I don't know if the ban in the U.S. has been lifted. Other forms of Low Functioning Autism: There are no reliably identified genes (genes linked to autism have failed to be linked to familial autism, at this time), no reliably identified structural issues (high-resolution scanners aren't widely used, no gross structural changes have been found) and no reliably identified brain activity changes (for this, I'm using Ben Goldacre's articles on the reliability of medical statistics). So far, the best approach to LFA is that outlined in the autobiography \"Somebody, Somewhere\" - if you keep the noisy sensory data within the brain's limits, brain function is actually pretty good. Autism is not a single condition, at a rough guess based on the factors actually linked to it, there are a few tens of billions of potentially underlying causes, of which some are shared with other conditions. Maybe all of them are. Without knowing precisely what does what, it's probably best to imagine all mental conditions as being like one of those colour charts with all the colours slowly mixing - only with a couple of hundred million primary colours. It's a mess that geneticists lack the knowledge and computing power to sort out. If the key researchers were given something like the Earth Simulator (each) and anonymised whole genomes from maybe another hundred thousand people, you probably COULD see breakthrough treatments for severe autism, severe schizophrenia, and so forth. They don't lack skills or intelligence, they lack tools and data. That's why it's so annoying when people ask for cures. If everyone who asked for cures paid for gene sequencing (or joined a personal genome project) or crowdfunded a supercomputer that could handle sequencing, the researchers would have cured severe autism by now and alleviated the more annoying aspects in a way that left the rest of us with our choice of autism symptoms that are helpful to us. Eliminating symptoms with no idea of why they are there to begin with, especially when the actual effect of the medication is not well understood, has always been a bad idea. It tends to result in cures where the side-effects are worse than the original problem, and is why medication has a very bad reputation. It's a bad approach. It's also the only approach in many cases, because nobody funds the work or contributes the data needed. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Amanda S. Mills' careful parsing of the question, but not her answer!   As one of the people who THINK they have made a breakthrough discovery about treating severe autism, let me preface this by saying that I didn't start out looking for this, nor was I even looking at autism. I started down this road as an environmental health engineer (now also a toxicologist) looking at the effects of chronic CO poisoning in adults.  This is an easily tested and treated but commonly unconsidered cause of many neurological symptoms as well as CFS and fibromyalgia. Since doctors were clueless and often unwilling to prescribe  arterial and venous CO blood tests needed to confirm a case (when venous COHb>arterial) or oxygen treatment even when warranted by test results, I developed non-invasive  DIY methods for screening, testing and treatment that people can do on their own like first-aid. They don't require physicians, hospitals, labs, medical insurance, prescriptions, supplements, or even oxygen equipment. I was several years into this CO research before I noticed that many descriptions of autism reported  similar sensory sensitivities to light, sound, touch, odors etc as adults with CO poisoning.   These people were NT before their CO poisoning but not after, and they also experience more  depression and anxiety and are at higher risk of premature death from suicides and accidents, jus like people with autism diagnosis. Fortunately, their multi-sensory sensitivity and most other CO related symptoms can be reversed in less than 4months of daily home therapy by any of several free methods of lowering the level of CO that remains in their tissues back down to a healthy range.   Anyone can measure their tissue CO level  in one minute with a plastic bag and a professional CO detector costing under $200.  Per my patent pending method, just hold your breath for 35 seconds first and then  blow the last second of your exhalation into a bag containing the detector. Anything over 4ppm is unhealthy unless you have PMS or are pregnant when CO rises naturally due to increased heme catabolism (the main source of.the CO our bodies all make 24/7) As for treatments, anything that speeds excretion of CO via lungs and/or skin reverses the sensory symptoms of CO poisoning and should do the same for people.on the autism spectrum who have the same symptoms.  The  free DIY treatments I recommend to lower CO in tissues are: 1) daily sunbathing at least 1hour per day, exposing your arms, legs and  back (keep head and eyes shaded).  This increases CO excretion from tissues  up to 5x per hour compared to lying in darkness.  2) daily breathing exercises wearing a DIY rebreather mask, 15-20minutes a time , as often as tolerated. Rebreathing exhaled  CO2   reflexively increases your respiratory drive so you exhale more per minute with no conscious effort.  A conical rebreathing mask can be folded from a single sheet of paper.  Or if that is too much work, you can use the paper oil funnels that gas stations give away.  Just hold it over your nose and mouth and breathe normally.  About 2%of people have CO2 hypersensitivity and can't tolerate rebreathing, so they should stick to sunbathing. This is why there are no autism epidemics in countries around the equator and why prevalence increases with latitude. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a litany of options available to parents and caretakers, and deciding which works best for their family can be overwhelming, even with the aid of medical professionals. Researchers have overwhelmingly proven that a non-aversive positive reward based approach is a more effective way to behavioral change. The encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders defines non-aversive treatment as: \u201c\u2026intervention (that) involves the application of positive reinforcement and/or extinction contingencies as a consequence to a behavior, or alteration of the intensity, duration, or magnitude of a behavior contingent upon the removal or presentation of an antecedent stimulus.\u201d Some of the top non-aversive techniques in autism treatment include the following: 1. Adapting The Environment Changing an autistic individual\u2019s environment to reduce behavioral episodes can be an effective technique. Removing stimuli\u2014such as persons, locations, or situations that are observed to create tension, anxiety, and frustration\u2014can have a soothing effect. Providing organized and consistent structure is also key. This can be achieved by planning calendars of activities and consistent routines, thereby limiting unexpected events that could cause stress. It can also be helpful to inform others who may come into contact with the individual, so that they may avoid introducing stressful stimuli and aid in behavior observation. 2. Positive Behavior Supports This technique refers to a behavior management system used to understand the reasoning behind inappropriate behavior, instead of simply reprimanding that behavior. By developing individualized positive behavior support plans, a caregiver builds pride in accomplishments and instills a sense of responsibility in those on the spectrum. This can help reduce the anxiety that often leads to aggressive behaviors exhibiting themselves in the first place. Some helpful strategies for yielding these type of behavioral supports include: Celebrating strengths and successes by accentuating positive feedback.Respecting and listening to the child and their reasoning for their actions.Validating the child\u2019s concerns and emotions instead of brushing them off.Providing clear and concise expectations of behavior.Ignoring challenging behaviors, and staying the course despite them.3. Teach Replacement Skills The goal here is to replace potentially inappropriate behaviors with more adaptive skills, focused on communication, social skills, and self-regulation. These skills can be established in several ways, such as: Developing functional communication skills, be they language, sign language, or device interaction that helps the individual to go through their daily activities.Using social stories to build social awareness and skills.Creating an activity schedule to reduce anxiety and promote independence.There are many potential benefits to non-aversive therapy. These techniques aim to avoid the situations, persons, and behaviors that trigger outbursts in the first place. In this way, the quality of life for everyone involved can be improved with an optimized environment, positive behavior supports, and replacement skills firmly in place. Here are some pioneers in various fields of autism research and treatment.  ",

There is a steadily increasing understanding of autism's effects and impacts, and a very slowly developing understanding of causes. In my experience, one of the most significant ways to help an autistic child is to educate the people around that child - the parents and carers. If you're in the UK, the National Autistic Society is a fantastic resource that offers training and support. In the Dorset area, Autism Wessex also do great work. When it comes to directly assisting the child, there are tons of good, tested therapies that can help your child navigate the world according to their specific abilities. Unfortunately, there's also a lot of crap out there that Amanda has already written capably about in her answer. Please don't let your fear for your child push you into choosing one of these harmful or at best unproven therapies. Autism is not a sickness. It's a different way of perceiving and interacting with the world. It's important to keep that in mind, IMO. ",

Whether a cure for autism is desirable is an open question: yes for some people, no for others. But in either case, no: there is no cure in sight. The biggest breakthrough is that the psychologists, and the pubic at large, are beginning to see autism as more than just as problem.

US Centers for Disease Control statistics state that one in every 150 children in United States is diagnosed with autism -- that is one new diagnosis in every 20 minutes.  Music and movement therapy has been used to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals of all ages. Interventions can be designed to promote wellness, manage stress, alleviate pain, enhance memory, improve communication, and promote physical rehabilitation. For behaviors such as restlessness, aggression toward other children, noisiness and tantrums, music therapy has shown positive effects. It has been exceptionally great to tackle inattentive behavior. For the child music therapy is fun, easy and motivating and encourages social interactions. An MRI Scan of any kid suffering from autism while undergoing music therapy has shown significant improvements in behavior. It has also helped parents in determining early treatment options. ",
