            "answer_text": "On an unrooted mobile as everyone said just try installing ES File Explorer from Google playstore and then connect an USB to check if it working else if it doesn't work try rooting your phone(this will definitely work) :-) ) USB OTG requires capable hardware, software on which it\u2019s enabled and the right drivers. OTG is basically a hardware supported feature. So if your phone doesn\u2019t support it then you can\u2019t get it to work. Having said that, there have been mods created by phone enthusiasts to get the OTG feature to work. Example \u2013 Google Nexus 4Does not support OTG out of the box. However, you can flash a custom kernel (thanks to ziddey on xda forums) and then use a Y cable\u2013 one end to your phone\u2013 another to a pen drive\u2013 last one to an external battery source. The last one is needed because N4 does not output enough power to run the OTG device and hence we need to provide additional power supply to run it. Similarly if someone comes up with a workaround like the one above you should be able to use. Look through xda forums and you might find something interesting there. First Step is to Root your device which you can do with King Root or One Click Root , After your device is Rooted, Please go to Google Store and search for \u201d USB OTG Helper \u201d Before you go ahead with OTG Support, Remember few points : This experiment may be dangerous to your SmartphoneDevice has to be rootedSupporting Kernel / kernel modules are installedUSB OTG Cable is requiredIf after OTG, You feel device is getting heated, Stop immediatelyDo not use OTG for longer time, as some smartphones may get heated up and end up burning Motherboard or chipset due to high voltage supply in host modeFeatures of OTG Helper Stock and custom kernels supportedMount and Unmount drive with a single clickNo Ads!Full NTFS support built-in!! (from v3.0.3)Automatically start on device connect (intent broadcast) (from v3.0.3)Notification when drives mounted! (from v3.0.3)One click access to unmount (from v3.0.3)Option to enable UTF-8 if kernel support (from v4)Automatically open explorer after drive mounted (from v3.0.7)One click debugging and feedback (in app)Second App to install is \u201d OTG Troubleshooter\u201d what all it does : Once your device is rooted and capable of OTG, This app will detect and offer solutions if any problem is detected in OTG. It will also verify, if OTG is installed in proper way or no. How it works : Disconnect OTG Cable when promptedConnect OTG Cable when you are told by appIf every thing is smooth, you will get 4 green Dots1. USB Host Support2. OTG detected3. No USB Device detected in Linux4. No USB Device detected in AndroidOnce every thing is Ok \u2013 Option 3rd and 4th will change to \u2013 Mass StorageHope this helps! :-D ",

            "answer_text": "For OTG cable to work your phone must have an operating system that supports OTG. Any Android version above Android 3.1 Honeycomb will work. More important than software support is Hardware support, because lack of software support can be compensated with the help of custom ROMs. Finally if you have both software and hardware support your device needs to have drivers for whatever USB device you are connecting to it, which most devices with hardware support will have for popular devices. If your device is approved of the above three, then you can go ahead and prep up for loads of fun How to detect if your device has OTG support? 1) Connect the cable in the Micro USB slot and attach a flash drive or USB keyboard at the other end. 2) Now if a pop up appears on your display, you are good to go. But if not it could mean either your device lacks software support or hardware support or it is missing necessary drivers. 3) Now download USB Host Diagnostic App from Play Store (Free) 4) Run the app. tap on \u201cstart diagnostic\u201d It will ask you to remove USB devices and reconnected them when prompted 5) In the summary screen you will see if your device has necessary Hardware and Software to support USB host mode. If your device has hardware support and apt O.S, then it will most likely have drivers for devices like flashdrive, USB keyboard, mouse and even joysticks for gaming. You can also download necessary drivers from various apps on Playstore. ",
