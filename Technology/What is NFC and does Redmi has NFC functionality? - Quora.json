            "answer_text": "What Is NFC? Enjoy the instant access to varying information related to various services, products, people and landmarks using the power of NFC. Well, it\u2019s not something like rocket science. It\u2019s one of the wireless radio communication technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This technology was already there, but it was not able to gain enough response from the market and users. NFC technology enables users to set up phone-to-phone communication to store and transform information. NFC supported devices can work for you as a contactless payment system, social networking, and promotional platform. NFC tags are one of the essential parts of this technology. It allows users to transfer the data within a maximum range of about 4cm. Due to narrow ranges, NFC tags are largely used for the promotion of versatile products, services or items.

            "answer_text": "No, Redmi does not have NFC :( NFC is a contactless communication technology, it is very short distance, so in real life, it is about 3 cm. It can be used to transfer data between two NFC readers (phone is a reader as well), or between reader (phone) and NFC tag. NFC tag is a chip with antenna, that is powerless (it is powered by the reader, when within the short range). So it can be used for all sorts of identification, similarly like RFID - those chips you may know on products in a mall. In general everyday use, you may use NFC for mobile payments or triggering some action or set up in your phone (e.g. Bluetooth on/off, alarm clock on/off etc.) ",
