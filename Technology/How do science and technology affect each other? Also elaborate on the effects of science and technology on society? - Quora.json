            "answer_text": "Technologies such as writing have had an enormous influence on science. Without writing science would have progressed much more slowly. And take for instance the technology of the lens, which led to the microscope and the discovery of a lot of science. Also the technology of the lens led to the development of the telescope, and the discovery of planets, the study of the motion of planets. The study of the motion of the planets led to Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. The science of optics has at the same time been the method by which telescopes are designed. The technology of printing made the wide dissemination of science possible. The technology of printing has had a huge influence on the world. Almost no technology available today is not based on some advanced science such as quantum physics being necessary to design semiconductors that are small enough to build today\u2019s computers. And of course today\u2019s computers have changed society at a rapid pace. We no longer communicate with each other in the same way was did 10 years ago. We use technology these days to send written messages to each other using devices we call phones which used to be devices we used to speak to each other rather than having to send written messages. There are many, many sciences being used to make a mobile phone work, from the physics of electromagnetic radiation, the physics and chemistry involved in battery technology, analysis of the heat transfer from the cells in the battery to the case of the phone to prevent the battery overheating, growing of crystals of silicon with various chemical \u2018dopants\u2019 to construct the chips, Optics and quantum physics in the design of the camera, and many others. That combination of sciences and technologies enables us to see something and take an image and send it to almost anywhere in the world and to millions of people within seconds. This changes everything from policing, war, politics, relationships, media, humour and more. Meanwhile the science of metallurgy means that we can fly in a plane and be fairly safe from crashing. Although this happens to have not been applied properly it seems to a plane that failed tragically today, which shows how important that science is. The technology of the Jet engine makes long distance flight practical in a reasonable time, thereby changing the way humans see the world. There is really no way to adequately answer this question without feeling that it is just scratching the surface as the degree of interaction between science, technology and society is the days enormous.

            "answer_text": "\u201cIt Depends\u201d The antineutrino (electron antineutrino) was mathematically postulated in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli to embody the \u201cmissing attributes\u201d attending beta decay of unstable nuclei. In 1942, Wang Ganchang proposed using electron capture to detect neutrinos, but it was not until 1956 that the detection devices were capable of this, and first reported (the Cowan\u2013Reines neutrino experiment) successful experimental detection. In 1962, another team proposed that there were also muon and tau neutrinos, but it was not until 2000 that the tau neutrino was detected. There has been no discernible impact on mainstream technology nor on society form these developments. However - in the national decision (US, 1961) to \u201csend a man to the moon\u201d - and in the development of the Lockheed A-12 (US, 1959) and its subsequent redesign from a 1-man aircraft to a 2-man aircraft (SR-71 blackbird), the interplay of science and technology was much tighter than ever before - and the impacts on society were nearly immediate. Numerous specifications (theoretical) for materials to handle thermal extremes, force and vibration extremes, navigation and communication capabilities called for both materials and in fact theories to be developed and problems to be solved - - mathematically - well in advance of the existence of materials and manufacturing / engineering techniques needed to embody them. The results: Exoatmospheric flightStealth capabilitiesSupersonic flightCeramic components and coatingsElectronicsetc.The same spread of lengthy paths from theoretical science to practical technology, and compressed timelines from discovery to adoption can be seen in other fields as well.
