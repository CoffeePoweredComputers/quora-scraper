            "answer_text": "Short answer\u2026 read the contract. Do what it says. Pay whatever penalty is specified. In general, you\u2019re going to have to live by the terms of the contract you signed. If there are extenuating circumstances, you might be able to get them to let you out of it. For example, if the contract was made with someone who died and you are the executor of the estate, you might be able to get them to void the contract without penalty, unless the contract specifically has provisions for what happens in this event. As an example, I had been using the same phone provider for a long time and bought a house in a new town, which is right off two major highways. There is no reason there shouldn\u2019t be cell coverage there, and the provider\u2019s map showed strong coverage. However, my phone got absolutely no reception at the new house. I went to the local store for that company and explained the situation to the manager. He also looked at the map and said there should be full coverage. He suggested my phone might be to blame. He gave me a loaner phone to take home and try, and when that didn\u2019t work either, he agreed to release me from the rest of my contract, as they weren\u2019t providing the service they claimed to be. In general though, if you sign a contract, be prepared to deal with whatever terms are specified. The provider isn\u2019t likely to let you out of it because you found a better deal someplace else, or because you signed up for a service you couldn\u2019t afford. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "If the provider that you are in contract with cannot meet it\u2019s obligations to provide you with services, then they are in breech of said contract, and a visit to an attorney would be in order. Otherwise, you can pay an ETF (Early Termination Fee) and remove yourself from the contract. If you have a phone in subsidy (Paying for said phone with a contractually obligated period of months of service) you can pay the remainder of the subsidy, and walk away. Or you can find a carrier willing to pay your ETF, to join their network. ",
