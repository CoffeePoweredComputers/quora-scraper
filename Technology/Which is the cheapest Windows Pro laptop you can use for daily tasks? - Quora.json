            "answer_text": "First of all Windows Pro is software, laptop is hardware. You can practically* (this has some exceptions) install any system on any laptop. If you currently have a laptop that fulfils your need, but it doesn\u2019t have windows pro on it, and you need it to have windows pro on it for some reason you might be better off purchasing the software upgrade. Now on to the question.

Lenovo ThinkPad T490s | Work From Home Laptop | Lenovo US There are cheaper options and alternatives but the base model would be great for anyone that wants a good portable laptop for every day use.
