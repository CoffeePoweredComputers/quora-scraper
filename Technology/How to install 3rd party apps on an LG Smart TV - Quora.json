From here, you\u2019ll be able to download all the apps you want. I used this myself to download \u2018Netflix\u2019 onto my new TV. To get to the content store, simply click the Home button on your remote and then scroll through the cards at the bottom to the right one.  Here you can browse through all the various apps available for your TV and keep up with any app updates. If you want to check out what they have available, you can do that here Also, as far as I am aware, the only 3rd party apps you can install on the LG are the ones offered in the Content Store. Thanks for the A2A. Hope this helps! ",
