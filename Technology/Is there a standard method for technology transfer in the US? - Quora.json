            "answer_text": "Yes and no. There are various existing mechanisms that have been in use for decades. Participating government agencies will have their own method of handling technology transfer because there is no standardized approach. Case studies over the years and even as recently as the 2019 NIST Green Paper \u201cReturn on Investment: Unleashing American Innovation\u201d have identified the need to streamline the mechanisms currently in place and identify the best practices that can be implemented government-wide. Prospective applicants can seek additional guidance and clarity from online resources like government websites, Quora, and aShoGi. aShoGi not only provides government information but helpful guides on navigating SBIR, STTR, and related programs. aShoGi resources can be found at: https://www.ashogi.com/ ",
