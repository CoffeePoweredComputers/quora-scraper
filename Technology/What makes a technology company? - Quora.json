            "answer_text": "It's what they sell, and people's perception of that.  Technology is the making, usage and knowledge of tools, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or serve some purpose. - Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology See also What is the definition of \"technology\"? (or, worse, look at http://www.quora.com/Can-technology-eliminate-poverty/talk) I'd argue that if a company is selling you tools, they're a technology company. Now, that is clearly a bit broad, in that it encompasses computer companies like Apple (company) & Microsoft (company) and more, shall we say, mundane tool-makers like Black & Decker, Stanley (was part of Sears Products and Services), etc. The trouble with the word \"technology\" has to do with the difference between what's \"new\" for everyone, and what's \"taken for granted\" (what was already in wide use when you hit puberty and began to actually notice the world). It's a generational thing. Most often, when you say \"technology\", people think, \"high technology\" even though mundane stuff like agriculture & fertilizers are most certainly technology. They think of Apple & Microsoft & IBM, and biotech, and so on. Is C.C. Myers, or Bechtel, a \"technology\" company? Naah, they're construction companies! (but you can bet they both do some hard core engineering to build the things they build, and use some quite technological tools). So, really, this comes down to a marketing question: if you say your company is a \"technology\" company, will a majority of the people on the street agree? ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has come to be synonymous with what used to be a subset, information technology. For example, Tesla up until this point has very much been a traditional technology-centric company, but their product defines our perspective. The same could be said of Elon Musk' other company, SpaceX. It might be an aerospace company or a space company, but I wouldn't refer to it as a technology company even though the ratio of engineers to everybody else is probably higher than in the software company I work for, which I would describe as a technology company. A company working on genetics isn't a technology company; a company that builds new software to break the genetic code is a technology company. tl:dr: A technology company sells a product that creates, distributes, provides access to, or manages digital information - logically or physically.
