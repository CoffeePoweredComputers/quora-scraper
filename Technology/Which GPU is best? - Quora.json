            "answer_text": "That's a question I was having and I researched a lotttt and found something but not sure but I will try to list Before the release of New NVIDIA cards there were 3 TOP tier GODLY cards (Extremely powerful) Weakest was 2080 Ti then stronger was Titan RTX and the strongest GPU before was THE QUADRO RTX 8000 with 4000+ cuda cores and HOLY!!!! 48 GB's of GDDR6 Vram it was one hell of a GPU(5500$ approx price)But now after the release of the new NVIDIA cards and AMD cards the positions have changed quite a bit RTX 3070 is either equal to or more powerful than the 2080 Ti(SEE THE BENCHMARKS YOU WILL KNOW IN SOME AREAS IT DOES BEAT THE 2080 Ti) RTX 3080 hands down is a beast in everything be it GAMING/3D MODELING/ARCHITECTURE etc. It is WAYY faster than 2080 Ti And beats Titan RTX with a good margin 3080 can give a performance of above 200fps at ultra settings while the Titan cannot,at 1440p ultra 3080 can give above 150 fps while the Titan falls below 140 At 4K 3080 can reach an average of 120 fps butt The Titan barely crosses 100 fps. Soooo according to my Verdict 3080 is pretty strong than most cards butttt RTX 3090 Beats everyone at everything and can run 8K!!!!!!! You have your answer Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "The Graphics cards you've suggested here are 'gaming graphics cards' and aren't meant for designing purposes, you need to look out for workstation based graphics cards i.e. look out for a AMD FirePro or Nvidia Quadro alternate of above mentioned cards.Workstation based cards are better optimized for graphics designing, they've significantly more VRAM and greater memory bus width resulting in much more memory bandwidth gaming graphics cards don't require large amounts of VRAM as they don't have to handle huge amounts of data another difference is in the drivers, both types have different drivers regarding different optimization levels for different things. (You might think that Titan Z is coming with 12 GB of VRAM, brother games are getting more and more complex, require much more data to be transferred moreover they're not intended for gaming @1080p they're for 4K or above resolutions).PS. If your significant other doing designing for fun then you may go for R7 260. ",
