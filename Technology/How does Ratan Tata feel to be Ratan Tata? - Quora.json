            "answer_text": "Ratan Tata Is what Ratan Tata. Reams have been written about him. In one sentence, I will describe him. \u201cHe listens to everything, he is open to suggestions but he is unyielding on ethical issues\u201d. This is how he can be best described. Succeeding J.R.D. Tata was never easy. There were stalwarts he need to face, quietly assert himself and navigate the group to what it is today. There were powerful people close to J.R.D. Tata as well as political leadership, like Russi Mody, Darbari Seth, or Ajith Kerkar. I don\u2019t want to go thru here how each one of them were powerful and Ratan has to work his way thru. Then there were tough situations like handling trade Union leader Rajan Nair, Assam government accusing Tatas of funding Assam extremists, or Ananth KUMAR on the issue of Tata-Singapore airlines tie up, or Pramod Mahajan , BJP telecom minister on Tatas -VSNL investments, Ratan did not waver and compromise. Be it, Dilip Pendse who invested \u20b9300 cr company funds in stocks and Ratan has to file charges against him, even though he was close to Ratan. He steered the group from being just a commodity based business group to one of value additions. Many may not know that he quietly quit about 30 of the businesses and entered into new 15 businesses, believing that TATAs should be in the top 3 in every business they are engaged. A workaholic of about 15 hours of work a day, minimalist luxury, believing in creating value propositions for the customer be it, Tata Indica or Tata Nano or steering Tata motors from a commercial vehicle manufacturing to passenger car manufacturing and so on. Down to earth, making everyone comfortable, grounded always ( he does not believe in palatial mansions - his remarks on Mukesh residence created flutters), embodiment of virtues. I am glad, I am able to write a few lines about him. ",
