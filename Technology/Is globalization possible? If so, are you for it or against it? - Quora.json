            "answer_text": "Economic globalization is not only possible but realizable. For the past 25 years, nations have recognized what 18th century economic theorists realized during the era of mercantilism: global trade is a win/win problem on the macro level. The advantages of trade that allow nations to focus on economic activities at which they excel is both logically true and true in practice. That us why trading nations like the UK, Germany, China, S. Korea, and others have the ability to create so much more wealth than a non-trading nation like the DPRK or Venezuela. It is also clear that what is positive on the macro level might not be on a micro level. While offshoring by firms like Apple or Walmart have served their customers, both relocated production and jobs to lower labor cost producers. That was a large part of the appeal of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism. It gave them the Rust Belt and the electoral victory that came with it. Political globalization is impossible and unlikely. The current issues of the EU demonstrate how even something as innocuous as a currency union does not \u201craise all the boats\u201d evenly. When faced with sacrificing national sovereignty, even a prosperous nation like the UK saw over half of its voting citizens reject the idea of regional integration. There has been no clamor in either Norway or Switzerland to sacrifice national sovereignty to join the EU as long as they are permitted to trade with it. Some things thrive under globalization: corporations, religions, technology, popular culture. Other things suffer under globalization: trade unions, cultural homogeneity, theocratic legal systems, national security (safety from external terrorism). I favor economic globalization but have a belief that sovereign nations serve the needs of populations better than supra-national polities. ",

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u201cglobalization\u201d? Global trade has been a reality for over two centuries and has been increasing. This trade has grown human prosperity enormously and undermined tyrannical governments. It happens spontaneously when barriers created by governments are removed. Is this what you have named \u201cglobalization\u201d? International ownership - investment across national boundaries - is one of the factors that enabled the U.S. to go from an agricultural backwater in 1790 to an industrial powerhouse in 1890. Expansion of the system that enabled the people of the U.S. to become rich (relative to most of the world) has been called \u201cglobalization\u201d. Like international trade, this happens spontaneously when government-imposed barriers are removed. Is this what you have named \u201cglobalization\u201d? Modern-day Mercantilism, militarily powerful nations manipulating international trade and investment for the benefit of those in their nations with political power (which could be the result of election or bribery) is what some critics insist is the inevitable result and what they call \u201cglobalization.\u201d So, is globalization possible? That depends on what the name refers to. Can Sam pull a plough? That depends on whether Sam is a horse, dog, woman, or man. The word can do nothing, but the thing the word refers to may be able. World-wide political unity is different, seldom called \u201cglobalization\u201d and may not even be desirable. ",
