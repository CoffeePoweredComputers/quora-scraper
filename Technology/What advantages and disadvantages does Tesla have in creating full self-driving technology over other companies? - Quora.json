Teslas approach is gradual, it trains its system as data from existing cars comes in.And it uses cheaper hardware - cameras, sonar, radar. Advantage? Once ready, it will work on any road - known, unknown, changed. Disadvantage?The alternate approach, using HD pre-mapped roads, HD maps and Lidar seems to be the faster approach. It\u2019s more expensive in hardware and needs another car \u201calready being there\u201d and has problems with road construction or other obstacles - but you were asking about Tesla and not Waymo.
