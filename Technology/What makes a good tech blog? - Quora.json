They follow some steps in my understanding they are like- Fix a target (either multiple tech or specific element)Make a thorough research about current trends, future, and forgotten trendsStarting with current trends they go into the future with time and occasionally they publish catchy and informative content about forgotten trends (remember Content is most important).Now let's talk something about a good blog- Have a good outlook with easy movementNot so much critical wordings. Easy to read and understand.Mostly engage people and satisfy their needs.Not too many annoying ads.These are very important in my sense. However, there is a lot you can find. ",

            "answer_text": "A good tech blog always tends to be the one that never sides with the product you are blogging about.

This happens when you are not into making your audience dive into your blogs but just trying to sell the gadget which is sponsored or is affiliated. Personally, Its always better to give your blog some proofreading where you can distinguish yourself whether you are being transparent in reviewing the products or not. Because mostly its the comparison between the new and the old, the better or the worst, or something about its influence. So, What makes a good tech blog? Being Transparent ",
