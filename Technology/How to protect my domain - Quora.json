            "answer_text": "Regression is a generic term with multiple meanings \u2013 linear regression (statistics), past life regression (for those who believe in reincarnation), etc. If the owner of Regression.com has a trademark, then it will apply to a limited range of uses.  There are several websites where you can search for trademarks free of charge.  So you'll be able to ascertain whether they have a trademark and, if so, which services are covered. If you've been using your domain or plan to use it in the same field as they use theirs, then you MIGHT be violating their trademark.  Otherwise, you are not.  And you are justified in owning / using your domain, unless you are infringing their mark. Right or wrong, they can make threats and file a proceeding against you to confiscate your .IN domain.  One would hope that this process will support your case, but sometimes those adjudicating make errors in judgment. Filing any proceeding (lawsuit or otherwise) is quite expensive.  If they really want your domain, then they probably ought to negotiate and purchase it from you \u2013 unless you have really violated their trademark. Their threats may be a bluff.  In reality, they may have only a very weak legal case.  But I have researched neither their brand nor yours. Direct them to me.  If they really want your domain, then perhaps I can broker a fair settlement. ",

When he started getting confrontational I'd have just hung up. You really don't need to listen to someone make a fool of himself over the phone because he can't control his anger.   Edit: I found three articles that do a good job of explaining this Copyright/Trademark (and additionally linking even) subject in layman's terms. I'd still consult a lawyer. 10 Big Myths about copyright explainedA brief intro to copyrightLinking Rights Hope this helps some. ",
