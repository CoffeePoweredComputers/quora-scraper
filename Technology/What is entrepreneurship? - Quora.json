            "answer_text": "Entrepreneurship is basically the creation of a new enterprise to achieve some objective. It\u2019s the creation and management of a new enterprise. Do entrepreneurs work to make money? No, not necessarily. They want to create value, and the value could be based on money, or it could be based on service or some sort of a mission. So I think value, if you create value and the value happens to be financial, then you're making money.Well, it could also act as a bridge though. People can choose to go into entrepreneurship either because they're forced to do it between other things or because they want to try and engage in something new themselves that fulfills some personal goal or value as well.So I think this notion of creating and managing an enterprise is probably appropriate but, I think entrepreneurship, in general, could be much broader than that.I mean, we're talking about corporate entrepreneurship, it's not necessarily creating a new enterprise.There's also entrepreneurship at the individual levels. I think to me it's about taking initiative and thinking out of the box and starting something new. And so it means different things for different people. How is that different from innovation more broadly? Is it the same as innovation? I mean that sounds like a definition of innovation? So in our tedious world of academic debate over this, there is an ongoing debate over whether it's about the opportunity or discovery of opportunity, it doesn't need to be an innovation. Right, it can be an existing market that you're going into, and the debate is now whether the opportunities are discovered or created. So innovation is about creating some new opportunities. But you could discover that there is no coffee shop in your neighborhood, right? You don't have to innovate to necessarily do that and find an opportunity to act. Taking the Uber concept to Pakistan, would be entrepreneurship and not necessarily innovation in that definition. ",
