            "answer_text": "My job involves training CS graduates when they\u2019re newly hired by my company: they need to learn our tech stack and be generally indoctrinated in the culture and expectations. One thing I\u2019ve learned is that \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d is rampant. But it\u2019s not just in this young population: I\u2019ve been in the industry > 35 years, and it\u2019s rampant among the old folks too. Short and sweet: get a sense of humor and stop hiding that you think you\u2019re a fraud. Most of us are frauds\u2026 that\u2019s what drives us to keep learning and growing and being competitive. It is true that this represents a less-than-glowing internal daemon, but the attempt to \u201covercome\u201d (or disguise) it produces side effects that are far worse than the creature itself. You\u2019re human, it is OK to be imperfect and uncertain, you\u2019re not hired for your heroic persona or magnificent mastery, you\u2019re hired to participate in a team which serves a purpose. Tune into serving your purpose, and stop worrying so much about how you look in the mirror, and it all works out in time. ",
