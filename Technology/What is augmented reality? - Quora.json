            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s first be clear on \u201cVirtual Reality\u201d: VIRTUAL REALITY: In \u201cvirtual reality\u201d you wear some kind of goggles that shut out your view of the real world - and instead display some kind of 3D graphics world. As you move your head around there are sensors in the goggles that the software uses to draw the 3D scene from your perspective as you look around within it. The software can display a subtly different picture to each of your eyes - which (mostly) fools you in to seeing the \u201cvirtual\u201d world in three dimensions. AUGMENTED REALITY: In \u201caugmented reality\u201d, it\u2019s very similar - but the goggles aren\u2019t opaque. You can still see the real world. The computer graphics are overlaid as an opaque or semi-opaque layer on top of the real world. So, you could imagine a game, where somewhere in the city there is a hidden treasure. Maybe there are clues to where it is. You walk around in the real world - everything seems normal - until you find a clue\u2026maybe in the form of a big red arrow seemingly painted onto an office building or something. The office building is real - but the big red arrow is computer graphics. Not all of augmented reality is done with goggles - sometimes it\u2019s done on the cheap with just a cellphone. In that case, the designer takes the image from the phone\u2019s camera and displays it at roughly the right size so that it almost looks as if you\u2019re looking at the real world THROUGH the phone\u2019s display. As you move the phone around - it\u2019s like the display has turned into a sheet of clear glass. Now they can draw graphics over the real world video stream - and it\u2019ll be like there are these invisible things in the world that you can only see by looking through this magic piece of glass. APPLICATIONS: Augmented realiity is used in some games - the \u201cPokemon Go\u201d game being the classic example where Pokemon characters were \u201chidden\u201d in various real-world locations - and you could go there and find them and see them through the magic \u201cwindow\u201d of your cellphone.  The system is networked so two or more players can see the same character in the same place - but from different directions. But there are also serious applications - I\u2019ve seen systems where some person is inspecting an airplane engine - and a computer is showing them which specific places in the engine need to be checked. So the service tech is wearing the goggles - they can see the real world engine right in front of them - but the computer is overlaying an arrow showing where some voltage should be measured - maybe also displaying the maximum and minumum voltages that should be there. Here, a circle-clip has to be removed - and the computer shows where the clip is (overlaid on the real world engine) as the part number and the instruction of what to do.  Basically the computer helps out the technician by \u201caugmenting\u201d the reality of their own eyes. OTHER USES OF THE TERM: I worked for a company that made a \u201cvirtual try on\u201d system for people who were purchasing sunglasses. They\u2019d go to the company website - make a short video of their face - turning left and right - using their cellphone camera. We\u2019d analyze the video and make a 3D model of the person\u2019s head. We could then render a realistic image of any of hundreds of pairs of sunglasses over the top of the video - and allow you to see yourself wearing them. The system rendered the glasses themselves along with realistic shadows and reflections of light shining through the translucent parts onto your face. In this case, there are no goggles involved - it was all happening as if the cellphone screen was a magic mirror that reflects your face as if you were actually wearing the glasses. ",

            "answer_text": "Augmented reality is the layering of digital information within the user's environment in real time. There tends to be a lot of confusion between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, as they both have been part of the same hype cycle. Simply put: Virtual Reality immerses you in an artificial environment, Augmented Reality brings artificial elements to the environment around you. Or you can think of it like this: Virtual Reality is like dreaming (you are in an artificial world) and Augmented Reality is like hallucinating (artificial stuff appears around you). Virtual Reality needs a form of headset to completely immerse the viewer, whereas almost everybody is already walking around with a portable Augmented Reality device: the camera on their phone. You are already using Augmented Reality if you\u2019ve ever used Snapchat, Instagram or Facebook stickers or animated effects. Pokemon Go is another popular example of AR: when you are in the camera view with the character overlayed in the scene, that is AR. And AR is not just available on phones. On television, most if not all sports broadcasts use Augmented Reality. If you\u2019ve watched a football game and seen the first down line graphic that looks seamlessly like a line on the field, that is AR. There are glasses and wearables, such as Magic Leap and Hololens, that combine real-world vision with graphic elements. The future of AR is wearable devices such as these. In addition to entertainment, there are a lot of pragmatic and practical use cases for augmented reality, such as helping you choose the best furniture for your home by placing into the scene, real time. Graphic displays on car-windshields that help drivers keep their eyes on the road, medical and industrial training, wayfinding in busy airports, the applications are endless. As AR expert Charlie Fink says \u201cThe world is going to be painted with Data\u201d. And the world is a very big canvas. ",
