            "answer_text": "A) The most brilliant minds from the field of technology have collaborated with the automobile industry and the results have been nothing short of astonishing. Automobile technology has experienced an exponential change and what seemed sheer impossible, maybe a couple of decades back, has been transformed into reality. India, being the 5th largest car manufacturer in the world, has not been left untouched by this phenomenon and we are seeing a lot of gradual changes happening with concepts like electric mobility, alternative fuels, automation in manufacturing gaining prominence. In this scenario, it becomes interesting to see the kind of advancements that are happening around the world and the impact they will have, locally, when these technologies make a foray in our nation. Technology is changing the way we arrive from one place to another, with increased safety, in-car entertainment, contentedness and efficiency being the major areas which are seeing a marked development. Talking about fuel efficiency, manufacturers around the world are adopting more electric and hybrid technology in their vehicles. In a few years, it won\u2019t be surprising if the conventional engines will be phased out and replaced by electric and hybrid technology which would help your car run for hundreds of miles in a single charge. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become the buzzwords in the auto industry and predictive capabilities is one of the exciting areas where a lot of interesting work is happening. Advanced brain mapping is helping understand the driver behavior better and avoid accidents on the road. At the same time, sophisticated algorithms are helping predict any malfunction in your car and set up appointments for service in real-time. Perhaps, what has piqued the interest of automobile enthusiasts everywhere equally is the self-driving technology in cars. While there is a long way to go until fully autonomous cars start running on our roads, semi-autonomous vehicles have experienced a good amount of success in the real world. These machines feature technologies such as looking for blind spots, adaptive cruise control and self-parking. Driver less technology is also being leveraged for car hailing/renting services where users will be able to share rides or hire vehicles for their transportation needs. In the days to come, automobile industry is perfectly poised to be revolutionized by path breaking technological inventions, with a plenty of amazing things already in the making. Like Bob Dylan had perfectly put it- the times they are a-changing\u2019, and at Group Landmark , one of India\u2019s most professional automotive networks, we have been a proud partner in this transformation. Representing the leading brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Jeep, Nissan, Ashok Leyland, Volkswagen, Honda, Renault, Datsun and Fiat, we have enabled this paradigm shift and brought to our customers the best and the latest from the exciting world of automobiles.

            "answer_text": "Although automotive markets is witnessing a continuing slumping growth market wise but the amount of technologies that are coming up is quite a number. Although most of these are safety features some of the features are innovative based and automakers provide them only in top end models but as demand grows,awareness grows these trickle down to lower end models too. Rear Mounted Radar: Reversing cars or parking cars in a busy parking space that to during peak hours can be quite a task so what rear mounted radar does is it when it senses a body approaching the vehicle it starts to make a sound indicating a body so to make the driver awareNight vision with pedestrian detection: Night vision can hardly be regarded as a new technology since Cadillac started this in 2000 but a new version of this feature can be seen in Mercedes-Benz & BMW .As the distance between a pedestrian and the vehicle decreases i.e the pedestrian comes closer to the vehicle a warning is indicated in night vision monitor to alarm the driver.Automatic high beam control: Some of the manufacturers provide this feature which can act as a determinant in providing safety ro both the pedestrians and the drivers .Lexus was the pioneer in this system. A camera is mounted in the rearview mirror which detects and also illuminates or dims the beam lights in accordance to the traffic.",
