            "answer_text": "the concept of the autopilot comes from the aviation industry. An airplane may have an autopilot feature and that will allow the airplane to flight at a certain altitude and on a certain heading, at a certain speed. Some autopilots also allow the pilot to control a descent to x amount of feet per minute too, and certain autopilots will allow the airplane to land itself. That last feature requires some extra assistances from the infrastructure on land. Like a special category of ILS. Now moving to the automotive word. Tesla decided to use the term autopilot and it\u2019s not far from how an airplane works. It keeps the car on a certain lane, and it can also keep the car driving at a certain speed. A car\u2019s autopilot needs to deal with a lot more situations than an airplane as airplanes have assisted traffic separation by the control towers, while cars don\u2019t have that luxury. Cars also deal with obstacles that airplanes rarely deal with while on the air. Now going back to Tesla\u2019s autopilot, the current level of autonomy is II. You can read about levels of autonomy here: What Are the Different Self-Driving Car \u201cLevels\u201d of Autonomy? stating that Tesla\u2019s autopilot is \u201chalf-naked\u201d could be true if we knew what \u201cfull-baked\u201d is. if you think a full featured (baked) autopilot should be able to drive a car from point A to point B without human intervention (Level 5), then yes. tesla\u2019s Autopilot is definitely half baked. Tesla however, has another name for that: it\u2019s called \u201cFSD\u201d or Full Self Driving and that is coming up later this year. Now that being said, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot or EAP (Enhanced Auto Pilot) is a joy to use for the most part. It takes a lot of stress of a daily commute. It thrives on slow traffic (stop and go) and it does really well on highways. To account for the infinite amount of factors and situations a driver can face requires a lot of learning and Tesla is using its fleet of cars to eventually \u201cteach\u201d all its cars capable of FSD how to drive. I can give you tons of situations where autopilot isn\u2019t good at: roundabouts, red lights or stop signs, stopped vehicles or obstacles, merging to another lane with cars, exiting a highway to another highway with oncoming traffic from such highway, driving under bad weather conditions, to name a few. Now that we understand the levels and the scope we can understand how difficult it is to achieve level 5. Yet, calling or thinking that autopilot is half baked seems a little harsh. The software is being updated using an agile approach and each version is getting better and better and even providing new features. I personally think Tesla is about 5\u20136 years ahead of its competition and I think full self driving capabilities are not too far from becoming a reality. We could see a full featured self driving car within the next 5\u201310 years. ",
