            "answer_text": "First of all (speak after me :-): 5G IS NOT ABOUT SPEED. Speed plays a big role, yes. but that is a press makeup and operator marketing joined in. Probably because someone in the public space decided that the general public would not understand mobile Internet of Things or high security mobile connections. Which are the main focus areas. But lets start from the start: It was clear that 4G wouldn't last forever, given the growth in data volumes and new challenges in the area of machine-type communication and critical communication. A total makeover was needed. Thus the responsible international organization ITU-R (International Telecommunications Union) designed a new service spec, in a documentation called International Mobile Telecommunication 2020 (IMT-2020), presented it to the World Radio Conference (a United Nations organized international conference) in 2017, and got approval. The technical development organization 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) undertook the enormous task to develop a technical specification to meet the ITU-R requirements. Under 3GPP all major players of the industry, including US (Qualcomm for example), Europe (Ericsson, Nokia) and China, Korea, and Japan (Huawei, ZTE, NEC, Samsung) and many more joined forces and worked together for a couple of years in an open and constructive atmosphere. They came back with their standard Release 15 (they count since there establishment in 1998), and are in a process of presenting that standard to the ITU-R for acceptance (the ITU-R owns the \u201cx\u201dG label). Now what is in? Here is a ITU chart about requirements:  Now let us talk about data speed: as with every wireless transmission the achievable data rates depend on a number of factors, not just technology. With 4G we had already reached the peak performance overall in terms of bits/s/Hz, so called spectrum efficiency. How much data transmission can you squeeze out of a Hertz (unit) of frequency. Which means: find wide frequency bands. LTE was at a maximum of 20 MHz of spectrum per network. Which was already 4 times the spectrum available for 3G. Now 5G standard goes to a whopping 400 MHz (which is 20 x 4G/LTE). You don't find such bands in the traditional frequencies below 5 or 6 GHz. It is already too congested. And between 6 GHz and 20 GHz (approx.) is reserved for satellite TV. You cannot just switch off satellite TV, can you? So for the ultra-wide bands they went up to the 28 GHz+ range, where there is ample space. It has other benefits, but also drawbacks: high band radiation has a very short range and reach. Attenuation increases with the square of frequencies. A high band signal has a reach of several hundred meters max. And it doesn't penetrate walls. So you have to install indoors, too.On the benefit side high band radiation has very small antennas (in the mm dimensions). So you can put many antenna elements together and create massive MIMO antenna arrays which allow to point the signal towards the phone.So this is obviously the area where you find the highest speed. Still very slow in rollout; FCC has allocated a few test bands for now, but that is it. In the traditions spectrum range 5G doesn't give much more than 4G to the private user. The mMTC part is basically done on low frequency bands, below the traditional ones (such as 450 MHz). Here speed is second prirority. All that matters is range, reliability. For Short latency a new transmission frame was created. Which does not give you more speed; to the contrary: in a given spectrum a short latency connection will have less data rate than a normal connection. For the ultra-reliable side of things, the core network plays an essential role. Core networks are cloud networks today; so they can manage redundancy end-to-end from server to phone. Hope this helps to put things in the right perspective. And: if you expect 5G features today; go back and relax. What they roll out is an intermediate standard, called non Standalone mode, which can be seen as 4.5 G or 4.9G, as some put it. Everything is handled by 4G base stations, which act as masters for the connected 5G base stations. The speed gain that has been reported somewhere is mainly due to the fact that very few users actually are on the new frequency bands. And data rate of a user is always: (Data rate of base station)/(number of users in the cell). ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: Type? There is only one standard for 5G. Its use on the new mmWave frequency bands (which only 5G supports) results in the fastest performance, and that is much faster than 4G or even 5G on the earlier frequency bands. ",

            "answer_text": "There should be standard for 5G and Google it for more details. Huawei is leading the way and will write the protocols. Right now we are using 4G or LTE in US and normally the speed is < 400MB/second. We don\u2019t have 5G yet as the speed of 5G should be > 20GB/second. But China got 5G already which is significantly faster than 4G. ",
