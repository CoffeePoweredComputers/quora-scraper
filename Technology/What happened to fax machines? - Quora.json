            "answer_text": "FAX Machines are still around. I have one next to me in my home office. However, these days, I use it as a B&W scanner, copier, & printer. But, and it's a big but, they have become somewhat obsolete due to the internet, high quality scanners, PDF software, and large file eMail capabilities. In essence, there are zillions more FAX machines out there (in disguise) then there ever were as every computer with a scanner & a printer is effectively a FAX machine. So, what is a FAX? It is a scanned facsimile of an original document that has been digitized. It is then transmitted to another machine that then converts the digitally scanned information into a printer replica (facsimile) of the original document. ",

            "answer_text": "\"fax\" is an abbreviation of \"facsimile\", which is a fancy word for \"copy or duplicate\". A facsimile machine, then, sends a duplicate of a document to someone instead of sending the original (like you would do if you put the document in an envelope and send it by USPS). Specifically, a fax machine transforms the graphic images on a page into sounds, which it sends via telephone lines, to another fax machine elsewhere. That other fax machines transforms those sounds back into images, and prints them out on paper. Fascinatingly, a fax is the most secure way to transmit documents electronically. It is very easy to hack email and steal a copy of a PDF. However, wire-tapping a fax signal usually ruins the signal, rendering the document unreadable. This is why fax machines are still used today, to send sensitive documents when security is an issue. ",
