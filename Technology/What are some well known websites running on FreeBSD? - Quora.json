            "answer_text": "There are some notable users of FreeBSD in handbook (1.2. Welcome to FreeBSD!): Apache\t     - The Apache Software Foundation runs most of \t    its public facing infrastructure, including possibly one \t    of the largest SVN repositories in the world with over 1.4 \t    million commits, on FreeBSD.Apple\t     - OS X borrows heavily from FreeBSD for the \t    network stack, virtual file system, and many userland \t    components.  Apple iOS also contains elements borrowed \t    from FreeBSD.Cisco\t     - IronPort network security and anti-spam \t    appliances run a modified FreeBSD kernel.Citrix\t     - The NetScaler line of security appliances \t    provide layer 4-7 load balancing, content caching, \t    application firewall, secure VPN, and mobile cloud network \t    access, along with the power of a FreeBSD shell.Dell \t      KACE\t     - The KACE system management appliances run \t    FreeBSD because of its reliability, scalability, and the \t    community that supports its continued development.Experts \t      Exchange\t     - All public facing web servers are powered \t    by FreeBSD and they make extensive use of jails to isolate \t    development and testing environments without the overhead \t    of virtualization.Isilon\t     - Isilon's enterprise storage appliances \t    are based on FreeBSD.  The extremely liberal FreeBSD license \t    allowed Isilon to integrate their intellectual property \t    throughout the kernel and focus on building their product \t    instead of an operating system.iXsystems\t     - The TrueNAS line of unified storage \t    appliances is based on FreeBSD.  In addition to their \t    commercial products, iXsystems also manages development of \t    the open source projects PC-BSD and FreeNAS.Juniper\t     - The JunOS operating system that powers all \t    Juniper networking gear (including routers, switches, \t    security, and networking appliances) is based on FreeBSD. \t    Juniper is one of many vendors that showcases the \t    symbiotic relationship between the project and vendors of \t    commercial products.  Improvements generated at Juniper \t    are upstreamed into FreeBSD to reduce the complexity of \t    integrating new features from FreeBSD back into JunOS in the \t    future.McAfee\t     - SecurOS, the basis of McAfee enterprise \t    firewall products including Sidewinder is based on \t    FreeBSD.NetApp\t     - The Data ONTAP GX line of storage \t    appliances are based on FreeBSD.  In addition, NetApp has \t    contributed back many features, including the new BSD \t    licensed hypervisor, bhyve.Netflix\t     - The OpenConnect appliance that Netflix \t    uses to stream movies to its customers is based on FreeBSD. \t    Netflix has made extensive contributions to the codebase \t    and works to maintain a zero delta from mainline FreeBSD. \t    Netflix OpenConnect appliances are responsible for \t    delivering more than 32% of all Internet traffic in North \t    America.Sandvine\t     - Sandvine uses FreeBSD as the basis of their \t    high performance realtime network processing platforms \t    that make up their intelligent network policy control \t    products.Sony\t     - The PlayStation 4 gaming console runs a \t    modified version of FreeBSD.Sophos\t     - The Sophos Email Appliance product is based \t    on a hardened FreeBSD and scans inbound mail for spam and \t    viruses, while also monitoring outbound mail for malware \t    as well as the accidental loss of sensitive \t    information.Spectra \t      Logic\t     - The nTier line of archive grade storage \t    appliances run FreeBSD and OpenZFS.The Weather \t      Channel\t     - The IntelliStar appliance that is installed \t    at each local cable providers headend and is responsible \t    for injecting local weather forecasts into the cable TV \t    network's programming runs FreeBSD.Verisign\t     - Verisign is responsible for operating the \t    .com and .net root domain registries as well as the \t    accompanying DNS infrastructure.  They rely on a number of \t    different network operating systems including FreeBSD to \t    ensure there is no common point of failure in their \t    infrastructure.Voxer\t     - Voxer powers their mobile voice messaging \t    platform with ZFS on FreeBSD.  Voxer switched from a Solaris \t    derivative to FreeBSD because of its superior documentation, \t    larger and more active community, and more developer \t    friendly environment.  In addition to critical features \t    like ZFS and DTrace, FreeBSD also offers \t    TRIM support for ZFS.WhatsApp\t     - When WhatsApp needed a platform that would \t    be able to handle more than 1 million concurrent TCP \t    connections per server, they chose FreeBSD.  They then \t    proceeded to scale past 2.5 million connections per \t    server.Wheel \t      Systems\t     - The FUDO security appliance allows \t    enterprises to monitor, control, record, and audit \t    contractors and administrators who work on their systems. \t    Based on all of the best security features of FreeBSD \t    including ZFS, GELI, Capsicum, HAST, and \t    auditdistd.",
