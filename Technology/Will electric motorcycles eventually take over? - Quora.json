            "answer_text": "Yes. If gas motorcycles stay stagnant\u2026 as happened with \u201cclean diesel\u201d in Europe\u2026 they will eventually be the minority. Electric motorcycles are the future but aren\u2019t quite there yet. Pluses include the nearly no maintenance, just wearables like tires, brakes and belt (brake fluid too, hence nearly), much lower cost of ownership and cheap operating costs. The downside of electric anything is the cost of batteries, range limits and recharge times. Those downsides are being mitigated by technological developments\u2026 so, in time, they will be on par with gas engines. Now, I don\u2019t think gas engines are staying idle\u2026 new wankle engines are coming out, a new compression ignition for gasoline was developed (higher efficient burn) and the infrastructure is already in place so costs are low to keep it around. What will likely happen is a combination of the two. Gas electric will give the range with simplified mechanics (like no transmission) and smaller batteries (which mean lower costs). This will likely fill your larger bike niches need for range like in touring models. I predict trailers with range extender generators for all electric bikes so the \u201coff road\u201d bikes can haul gear, have the range and dump the weight for the trails thereby keeping some bikes smaller and nimble while others will be all-in-one for long hauls. Will electric take over? No\u2026 not really\u2026 but it will play a greater role in our choices. Small bikes and city bikes don\u2019t need the mileage and the only advantage gas has is the price of original purchase\u2026 so that segment will drift into electric over time. Big bikes have no equivalent in electric\u2026 there is no electric touring yet because that is the strength of gas powered engines but gas electric is viable and a realistic solution. ***please note: hybrids are not gas electrics\u2026 hybrids have transmissions and recharge from braking which is why they don\u2019t get the same mileage on the freeway as they do the city; gas electric has no transmission, the engine is just a generator which charges the battery along with the braking but the engine is not connected to the motor directly. Gas electrics are used in locomotives, heavy earth moving machinery, and other large set ups but are starting to scale down. A hybrid is only efficient because it captures braking energy but is, otherwise, no different than a regular engine set up; a gas electric just makes electricity as efficiently as possible, no revving up and down, just mostly on or off as needed to recharge but it also captures braking energy and loses the weight and complexity of the transmission that a hybrid must keep.

            "answer_text": "Probably. However, they might not be the electric motorcycles we know today. Right now, electric motorcycles are significantly more expensive than comparable gas bikes. Last I checked, it was 2x to 3x. Whole segments of the market have no electric bikes at all. The limitations they come with are far more pronounced than in cars and are more of an impediment to normal motorcycle usage. There are no electric tourers, and everything outside of light commuter bikes is made in very low numbers and is extremely expensive. Meanwhile, gasoline bikes are tons better than they have ever been. Now, technology never stands in one place, and electric bikes will be getting cheaper and better. However, improvements to batteries are incremental. Either the way people ride needs to change, or the bikes need to come a long way. This will take time, no matter which way it goes. It is entirely possible that in that time some technological revolution will happen, and something will replace the battery electric motorbike before it has a chance to completely displace the gas bike.

            "answer_text": "If everyone gets really serious about climate change and urban pollution, and actually bans internal combustion engines outright, then yes I guess they will. I don\u2019t see that happening till 2050 with all the foot-dragging that\u2019s been going on - halting sales of new ICEVs by 2040, for instance, implying there may be 2039 model year gas vehicles on the road. Unless the environment really goes sideways and takes the economy with it, so that no-one can afford to buy anything. An electric motorcycle is still a motorcycle, not a scooter or an autonomous Uber pod. It\u2019s still fun to ride; it won\u2019t be so bad. ",

Electric bikes simply don't have the range to compete with gas bikes that take two minutes to gas and go. Nobody wants to wait an hour or better for their bike to charge on a road trip, just to go less than 200 miles before they have to charge again. ",
