            "answer_text": "Anyone who wanted to engineer humans to use photosynthesis for the same purposes that plants do\u2026 they could do it only after they genetically modified humans to be: \u2026immune to skin cancer (to eliminate an early death due to melanoma);\u2026coldblooded (to reduce our energy requirements);\u2026mentally capable of sustaining a complete lack of motion for long periods of time, probably through reduction in brain size (to eliminate energetically-wasteful movements, like fidgeting, or play);\u2026covered head to toe in pine-needle-like hairs or fleshy sea-slug-like protuberances ready to be charged with chlorophyll (to increase the surface area available for capturing light).\u2014\u2014\u2014 I\u2019m dead serious. To gain the functional capacities of a plant would require you to be designed like a plant. Plants *deliberately evolved* to be motionless. It\u2019s not because they didn\u2019t need to run away from predators; plant predators are way more common in nature than animal predators; that\u2019s why photosynthetic microalgae often have one or more flagella. No, plants evolved the way they did because that\u2019s what was necessary in order to perform all the necessary metabolic and homeostatic life functions using a food source as terrible as light energy. Because yes, light energy is a terrible, terrible cellular food source. You get very little energy gathered per unit time, and even what energy you do get comes at the cost of producing toxic oxygen species, the \u201cfree radicals\u201d of nutrition fame, every time a photon hits a water molecule just right. Plants devote large amounts of photosynthetic energy towards producing antioxidants to detoxify their water, which in their case might as well be their blood. To be fair, light energy is not quite as terrible as deep-sea vents or other chemical gradients. But it\u2019s pretty bad. It takes about a quarter acre of land to feed one human using maximally-intensive agriculture. I really do mean maximally intensive. We\u2019re talking a multi-layered guild of fruit trees, vines, and ground cover, and it still only produces a starvation diet. A quarter acre is 10,890 sq. ft. I don\u2019t know what proportion of that sunlight actually gets captured and converted to sugars. But even if only 0.1% of the sunlight on a hyper-intensive farm actually gets put towards your caloric needs, that still comes out to a human needing the equivalent of 10.9 sq. ft. on which is being captured 100% of the sunlight. The average human body contains 14\u201318 sq. ft. of skin, only about half of which can be insolated at any given time, 7\u20139 sq. ft. And that too-small patch of skin, in addition to being required to pull off a thermodynamically-impossible feat of 100% conversion efficiency, would have to harvest enough additional energy to produce enough additional antioxidants to detoxify the free radicals in your photosynthetic organs. We\u2019ve made assumptions so generous, they break the laws of thermodynamics; and even then, the numbers still don\u2019t pan out. The only possible conclusion is that your body literally doesn\u2019t have enough space on it to grow enough chloroplasts to feed you. No single human-sized plant produces enough sugar energy to feed a single human for a year either. Heck, even one tree-sized plant can\u2019t do that. And even if the human body could be reconfigured to have enough surface area, this is still assuming that the thermodynamically-miraculous photosynthetic human would be doing nothing, nothing at all, except laying in the sun every day of every year, without moving. Note: we haven\u2019t even addressed protein and mineral needs yet. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Could we give ourselves photosynthesis? Maybe, technically. But in order for photosynthesis to be detectable or experience-able as a component of the human diet, it would come at such a steep metabolic cost as to require fundamental reconfiguration of what the human experience even is. Unless you\u2019re deliberately striving for recognition as a boddhisatva, the cost might not be worth the hassle. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, genetic engineering can do anything evolution does, and more. There are at least 4 known animals that photosynthesize (although the definition is stretched somewhat in some of them). And they do it in a variety of ways like symbiotic algae or stealing chloroplasts. 4 Incredible Photosynthetic Animals  The sea slug above uses the stealing chloroplasts technique, plus it steals a few genes too. Sea Slug Steals Photosynthesis Genes From Algae So yes its possible but only in the far future when science knows enough about human genetics. Its pretty easy to splice in genes into human DNA, we can do it now. But its MUCH MUCH harder to know what and where to splice in a whole set of many many genes and have it function well without adversely affecting the human. That knowledge is many decades, perhaps a few hundred years away. It however might be of limited practical use. There\u2019s a reason why photosynthesis is so rare. Several reasons actually The obvious considerations are ones of structure and lifestyle. Photosynthesis works best for organisms with lots of surface area that they expose to the sun\u2014hence the flat leaves and branched structures of trees, for example. Animals, especially big ones, typically have small surface areas relative to their volumes. Moreover, many animals spend much of their lives under cover, away from sunlight, avoiding predators. Nevertheless, even some invertebrates with only weak exposures to sunlight do photosynthesize, such as giant clams, and one might still expect animals more generally to use photosynthesis as an energy supplement. (MacKenzie and Le Page run through calculations showing that in theory, even a standard fish such as a carp has more than enough surface area to sustain itself energetically through photosynthesis.) So structure and lifestyle can\u2019t be the complete answer.For many animals, the potential benefits of drawing free energy from sunlight might be offset by the considerable risks of extra UV exposure and overheating.The bounteous sugars that photosynthesizing symbionts might spew into their animal hosts could be too rich a diet for them, and pose health risks of their own.For most animals, the genetic and physiological costs of having photosynthetic symbionts or their own chloroplasts may simply be too high. Given that animals need to eat to acquire other essential nutrients anyway, the more efficient strategy for most creatures is simply to eat green plants, which have a billion years\u2019 experience with photosynthesizing efficiently.Why Animals So Rarely Photosynthesize | Retort ",

On average plants convert about 0.1% of the energy they receive from sunlight into useful chemical energy. Ever wondered why plants that walk haven't evolved? Because they can\u2019t, they simply do not have enough energy to move, other than the odd leaf twitch. Plants that do move purposefully, such as the Venus Flytrap, are powered by eating other living things. This is obvious by the fact that if you trick a Venus flytrap into snapping its \u2018jaws\u2019 shut when there isn't a fly in there (like by prodding it with a toothpick), it very quickly dies. Photosynthesising humans would be novel and interesting, but it would be pointless, costly, and would provide nowhere near enough energy for us to function. ",

Research and development would take unimaginably long and be unfathomably expensive.  We would need to figure out which plant organism would best suit our specific needs for DNA incorporation. Then we would need to find a way to not only splice it into our own genetic sequence,  but write new genetic code allowing our entire bodies to be compatible with photosynthesis. That genetic programming would have to make fundamental changes to all systems in our bodies and the cascading changes that would make it possible to work would result in something that was so far from human your immediate reaction would be to kill it with fire.  This is because animals  (like humans) have energy requirements that are orders of magnitude larger than that of plants. Moving,  thinking,  mating, food,  shelter, caring for offspring and avoiding predators are all things that plants don't have to actively do and their passive, low-powered energy production (photosynthesis) works for them. Trying to power an animal with photosynthesis would be like trying to power a sailboat with a fart.",

There is more involved than just having the organelle. However it is possible that at some point in the future, we\u2019ll be able to add skin-coloured plastids (who wants to have green skin) to our cells, edit our genome to both express them in our skin, and utilize them the same way plants do.

Now look at how much grass a cow needs. We evolved to be predators to gain access to that vast amount of grass - the herbivores eat the grass, we eat the herbivores. A cow is, essentially, condensed grass. Evolution favored predator animals over photosynthetic animals in most circumstances, although corals and some other animalicules have symbiotic relationships with photosynthesising cells but it wouldn't scale. As an organism gets bigger the surface area to volume ratio falls. An organism 10 times the sizes needs 1000 times the food but only has 100 times the surface area. ",
