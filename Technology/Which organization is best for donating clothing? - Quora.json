            "answer_text": "My personal experience is to donate to a local Church or Synagogue. They will give them out to local people who are in need. The other clothing charities sell the clothes in a store front. As an example of how the money is distributed Goodwill pays their CEO James Gibbons $598,000 plus an additional compensation of $118,000 per year. Marsha J. Evans, the president of the American Red Cross, was paid $651,957 in 2004. The president of the United Way is now Ralph Dickerson Jr. and his current salary is $420,000 per year, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. UNICEF C.E.O. and President Caryl M. Stern earned $478,645 in 2009 according to a Better Business Bureau report. The Better Business Bureau also said that Brian Gallagher, CEO of The United Way earns $1,037,410 in 2008. By comparison the Commissioner of the Salvation Army Todd Bassett and his wife received $64,116 per year to manage the Salvation Army. They have a number of salvation Army stores. As this is basically a Religious organization they fall in the Church category. A fact checking of their budget shows they give back $0.93 of every dollar received to their mission. Please view these sites for verification: Salvation Army President is paid only $13,000 per year-Fiction! Goodwill Industries - Wikipedia. If You Think Goodwill Charges Too Much for Used Clothing, You Need to Read This PolitiFact - Don't be duped by bogus audit of charitable groups I hope this helps. Please beware of where you donate. If there are any questions about an organization call them and ask for more information. Many non-profits have to provide a form 990 to the IRS. This is available to the Public. It will give the salaries of the Officers. All non profits must publish their books and make them available for review. A word of caution do not believe everything you read on the Internet. One page gave the salary of Todd Bassett as just $13,000 per year. That number was very low. ",
