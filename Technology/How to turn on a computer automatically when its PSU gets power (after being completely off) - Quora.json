            "answer_text": "I am not sure if there is any suitable, existing solution available, but I am sure you can achieve your goal with own creativity. As the pins provide 3.3V to 5V there is a solution possible with an Arduino. You can run a little program on an Arduino which activates as soon as the PWRSW pins are high. The program then shortens the pins to power on the computer and the program enters idle state again. The most interesting part is to define all states and make sure that the program can differentiate between powering on the computer and coming from idle state into activation mode. Previous answer: There is a more simple solution possible:  Enter the BIOS setup utility after powering on your computer.In the menus look for an option named like \"Restore on AC/Power Loss\" or \"AC Power Recovery\" (browse through the various menus, as they differ per manufacturer).Usually there are a few options, but the one you need to select is \"Power On\". Save the BIOS settings.Now your computer will power on as soon as the PSU gets power. After the event of power loss, the computer will be powered on again as the PSU gets power again. Make sure that there are no other programs or tools are blocking the start-up process. To control the PSU, you can use a switched RPDU (Remote Power Distribution Unit), which can either be a professional appliance or a simple module for home usage. Here make sure the module can handle the power load and that it's not a lightweight module which is intended for controlling lamps. More close to your question is a solution called \"WebReboot\" I experimented with for a large hosting provider. See the following video for a demonstration of the product: Servprise WebReboot Enterprise Demo The appliance was connected to the reset and power pins of a servers' mainboard and allowed remote soft- and hard reboots and power cycling. Unfortunately nowadays the product is not available anymore and I am not sure if there are any newer alternatives available. ",

All you need to do is to connect that to any of the black wires on that connector.  If you make a permanent connection, then the PSU will always be on whenever there is power.  I am unsure whether you need to cut the connection, or splice the connection in. The green wire is labelled PS_ON# in the below diagram.   ",

Years ago EDN magazine showed an excellent solution, and I believe it's the one that will best suits your construction needs.

An RC delay will keep the !RESET pin low on the 555 for a few seconds to allow the power supply to stabilize, then the monostable will activate and put out a 1 second long pulse. This goes to a resistor, to the base of an NPN transistor. The collector of the transistor connects to the POWER ON wire and pulls it low during that 1 second (emitter to ground). I'll draw up a quick schematic and post it here momentarily. ",
