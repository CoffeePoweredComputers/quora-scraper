            "answer_text": "Sure has. In addition to technology are shifts in the foundational systems that the world runs on. Examples would be things like laws, rights, voting systems, which are all intertwined with one another and affect people\u2019s lives in a significant way. We take these things for granted but they weren\u2019t always there, and in fact they vary hugely from country to country even today. You just have to look at the differences in living conditions across different countries of the world today and in a way you\u2019re getting a glimpse into the past of what life would have been like in your own country at some stage in the past. It\u2019s not just poverty, but things like the legal system which can affect people\u2019s experience of the world hugely. In some countries you have laws that stop the government just seizing your property should they choose, in others if they want to themselves a mansion where you live they can just turf you out. Of course there is no such thing as \u2018the past\u2019 just the same as there is no such thing as \u2018the present\u2019 (the world is very different for someone living in a war torn poverty stricken country than it is for someone in an affluent peaceful nation, and even within those countries life is different for different people), and so it\u2019s a mistake to try and even generalise a trend that covers everywhere in the world at once. But it\u2019s safe to say the world has seen huge changes in many ways. Some things stay the same, but things also do change an equal amount. ",

The political/economic system of communism. The religions Bahai, LDS, and Scientology. Anything resembling economics as a field of study. Systems of government in which every adult could vote. Widespread literacy. Public schools supported by tax revenues. Distilled alcohol was discovered in Egypt and Iran about 1000 years ago. These are just off the cuff, I\u2019m sure there is much more.

            "answer_text": "Well, yes. 1000 years ago, there were fewer people, more tribes, and fewer nations. Empires were more common. Literacy was rare. More people lived from hand to mouth in the same jobs their parents had done. Medical skill among peoples was spotty, at best, which meant that a large percentage of the population died young. Beggars were common in the streets. Punishment for those caught committing crimes was brutal and very public. ",
