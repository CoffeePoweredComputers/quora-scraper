            "answer_text": "As often as possible. The main way that modern batteries managed by smart battery management systems such as the ones in modern phones suffer reduced life is due to deep discharges. The more often you keep the phone on the charger, the less deeply you\u2019ll discharge it. Every other effect is so minor or so unlikely that you can pretty much ignore it. For example, a person who uses 20% of their phone battery every day who leaves the phone on their charger every night will get roughly triple the battery life of someone who uses 20% of their phone battery every day but only charges it every other day. The reason for this is that the first person only discharges his battery to 80% and the second discharges it to 60%, which is much more stressful for the battery. If someone sends you the link to battery university and claims it says anything different, they are wrong. Look at table 2 of that link. All the other effects are so tiny that in practice, only the depth of discharge effect matters. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for A2A. There is no definite \u2018times\u2019 of charging a mobile in day. If your usage is based on internet then generally you will be going to charge your phone for more than one time. If it for moderate use, like scrolling through Facebook, messaging in Whatsapp and little other uses, then it will stand at least for 15\u201320 hours in a days. But this are all depends on the battery capacity and your usage. In to the core, battery life cycle is the at most important factor. If you charge your phone often in a day after one full discharge, then your battery life cycle will reduce sooner than normal time. In order to keep battery healthy and lasts long, you need to keep some routine which is experimentally proved by Battery University according to the chemistry of battery. Normally Li-based battery in smartphones are recommended to keep battery percentage between 40% to 80%. It keeps battery healthy and increases life cycle time for your usage. Maintaining this habit, will help to operate battery in optimized voltage level. If you charge your phone to 100% it will create pressure of voltage in battery that affects it. This problem reflects in life cycle of the battery. Hope it helps! ",
