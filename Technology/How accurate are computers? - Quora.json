            "answer_text": "Your question could be improved, I think. Computers is too broad. Accuracy is too broad. But to answer it, in part, you could look at IEEE double precision floating point numbers. That would give you an idea of the numerical precision of languages which use IEEE floating point. This gives about 16 decimal digits of precision. ( Technically, precision and accuracy are different things, but I am presuming this is one possible question you might have had.) One way in which computers have accuracy issues, is corrupted data. I have no stats on how often corrupted data occurs. This is probably a broad topic. But some brief statements on it can be made. Memory is subject to possible corruption by cosmic rays. This is rare, but does happen. Some computers use error correction systems to handle corrupted memory. Your mobile, laptop and desktop computers likely don\u2019t. Storage can suffer corruption. So backing up your computer is suggested. Here\u2019s an article on data corruption, which of course affects the accuracy of computing - Data corruption is worse than you know | ZDNet If computers are working properly, and your math is using an acceptable precision, another source of inaccuracy is program bugs. Of course this is a nasty example of a computer bug, especially when it saves the result, in a permanent, irreversible way. We know bugs are common, but how common are bugs which cause inaccurate answers? I can\u2019t answer that question. But not long ago, someone was the beneficiary of money they were not supposed to get from a bank, or payroll system. They foolishly spent some of the money they should never have had. I blame them mostly, but perhaps they were unaware of the law, and were normally not a thief. I would call that a pretty sad series of events which started from a computer error of some kind. Some computer errors have killed people. So clearly some of these issues are really serious, but not so common. ",
