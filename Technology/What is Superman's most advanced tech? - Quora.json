            "answer_text": "This is what I know from memory, not gonna do some deep research because there\u2019s a whole bunch of crap in that Fortress of his. He has a super-computer that connects to every other computer in the world.  A machine that seems to be able to cure any disease in the world. Why do I say this? Because he\u2019s the first person to cure Joker venom (before Batman), and Joker venom is pretty much a death sentence back in the pre-crisis days. So this one is probably the most impressive if you ask me.  A machine that can give him powers if the sun blacks out or something similar happens  Bio Remediation Suit, a special suit/robot he built that slows the prevention of Kryptonian diseases, or will also take his place in case Superman dies.  He probably has a time-machine or dimensional traveling machine somewhere but it seems almost every superhero has one of those laying around. ",

Also, know it was never adapted into the movies other forms of animated media\u2026 but Superman does own a Spaceship/Jet. I remember always watching it growing up on the Super Friends show. It looked awesome and had some neat tricks to it. Look I found a comic page with both on them:  ",
