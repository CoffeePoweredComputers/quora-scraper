            "answer_text": "YES, gamers often use gaming laptops daily for all their computing needs. All laptops are the result of juggling different requirements, and gaming laptops have been optimized for gaming (heavy graphics use and significant cpu, memory usage). So the further away your requirements are from what a gamer prefers, the less a gaming laptop will suit your needs. NO, If you need a notebook that is light enough and small enough you are happy carrying it in a handbag, and you don\u2019t want to have to be forever wondering where the nearest power point is, then a gaming laptop is not suitable for you. YES, If most of the time your laptop stays in your home office, then a gaming laptop would be fine, as its downsides (increased weight and power consumption thus less battery life) are not likely to be a concern. NO, if you want to trim your budget, especially if you are taking it to school or other public place and you are worried it might get stolen or damaged. In that case a cheap second hand laptop that does what you want but is looked down on by others would be the right choice - keep a backup of your work on a memory stick, and if the laptop gets gets stolen hopefully its cheap enough to replace that you or your parents wallets wont hurt too much.

            "answer_text": "They are good if portability and all-day battery life is not necessary for your daily routine. If you are always carrying the machine around or traveling, and you need to go unplugged for many hours at a time, most gaming laptops will be problematic to use. Even the longest-legged ones only run about 5 hrs on battery (not gaming, just productivity or browsing). They also tend to be pretty heavy and have heavy power bricks on top of that. Again, there\u2019s a few exceptions, but this is generally true. ",

They run on the same software (Windows) and have amazing keyboards (except for the ones that have the WASD keys in a different color. That really pisses me off). To be honest, however, I recommend building your own computer from a YouTube tutorial. You will save hundreds of dollars. ",

Then I missed, should keep Win1? but Win2 was much better, should I get Win2? If so I know I will never touch Win1 again. Finally, I sold Win1 and get Win2.
