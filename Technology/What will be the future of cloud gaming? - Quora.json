            "answer_text": "Cloud Gaming will be the next evolutionary leap in the video game industry. Cloud gaming platforms can provide much needed compute and storage resources for open source gaming, which enables game developers to modify existing games and create new variants of games. This will remove the barriers to entry for smaller, niche game developers. Cloud gaming will be perfectly fine for single player games and people wont have to pay for the expensive hardware to play AAA Single player titles but none can deny the fact that multiplayer games dominate single player games in terms of player base and the revenue that the companies generate with help of multiplayer titles. Huge multiplayer titles have given birth to the industry of eSports. Over time, online gaming has increased the number of interactive players worldwide, turning it into an ESPN-worthy spectator\u2019s sport, estimated to reach 454 million viewers globally in 2019 according to eSports Trade Association. Right now, all i can see is that cloud gaming wont be able to provide ultra low latency required for online gaming. The whole idea right now is gonna cause a very bad experience for the player. I dont know know how companies that are coming up with the concept of cloud gaming(Google, Nvidia, etc) are gonna tackle this because if they resolve the online gaming issue, cloud gaming is the next BIG thing.
