            "answer_text": "Well, that's the odd thing. Phasers are presented to us as being lasers, just with the photons swapped out for a more accommodating fictional particle called a nadion. And yet if it were a laser, the beam should be pretty much invisible regardless of what frequency it's tuned to unless you happen to be directly in the line of fire. If we are to assume that the beam is something the characters can see and not just a convenient visual aid for the audience, there are a few ways I can think of to explain it. A small percentage of the nadions being emitted will spontaneously decay into conventional photons within the visible spectrum, which are then emitted in random directions. The visible beam therefore represents energy being lost to entropy as opposed to anything that does serious damage.The light is created by dust and other stray matter fluorescing and/or burning up after being caught in the beam on the way to the target. This would neatly explain the beams we see when the weapons are fired within the atmosphere or the less solid appearance of the beams in DSC and TWOK, but is very hard to reconcile with pretty much every other shot where we see starships firing their weapons unless there's a lot more air in space than there used to be.Phasers are deliberately tuned to produce visible beams due to some technical limitation of working with nadions. Gamma ray lasers are notoriously easy to diffuse, for example. Perhaps nadions are so energetic that it's almost impossible to produce a coherent beam unless you stick within the range of frequencies we can see.Phasers use visible beams as a concession to their operators, so they know exactly what they're hitting when they fire. If the beam were completely invisible it might be uncomfortably easy to accidentally sweep it over something you shouldn't, like your CO's knees.",

            "answer_text": "     If I had to guess it's because they are particle weapons. Ionized particles can be visible or made to be visible. And if they were not, how good would the phaser be if you couldn't see if you're hitting a target. Can you imagine you firing your phaser and you see that your enemies were not going down, only to then notice your phaser wasn't even firing because it was malfunctioning. Also some weapons in Star Trek are invisible. Remember all those times people died from radiation exposure? Most of the time you didn't and don't see the radioactive particles hitting the character. Like in Kirk case when he died.  The gamma radiation in the Warp Core wasn't green or anything like that. Still Kirk got heavily dosed with enough radiation to kill him. Weapons make sense the beams are visible, mainly because you need to see if you're shooting right. And what you're hitting. Anything outside of weapons, now that's where we can really complain. ",

From a strategic perspective, if you could not see your weapons trajectory and you missed you would be relying on your tech to tell you how far you were from hitting your target. If your tech fails, or if you are in an area of space where your targeting system cannot operate effectively, wouldn\u2019t you be unable to re-aim your invisible weapon? While Trek did a good job of trying to stay true to science when possible, the number one focus has always been producing an entertaining TV show. That focus is how the writers invented the transporter. Having the crew board a ship and fly down to the surface of every planet would consume too much episode time. So, Roddenberry and crew invented a new technology. Presto, humans can now transport down to planets in seconds. For all the cannon and tech manuals in the Trek Universe, it is still all about the benjamin$. No TV executive keeps his/her job pitching invisible action scenes. ",

And let\u2019s face it - Captain Kirk pulling out a phaser and it makes a really cool-looking beam and a cool-sounding noise and the Klingon drops to the floor or disappears (depending on phaser setting) is a HELL OF A LOT cooler than he pulls out a phaser and nothing happens. Just like battles in space - it can\u2019t transmit sound, but Michael Bay-scale kabooms are added because that\u2019s cooler than total silence\u2026. ",

A good example of this is something we see everyday, the sun, while the sun gives off light, light is not a particle it is a wave. The surface of the sun is actually particles which is why the sun can be seen. Directed energy weapons are not light and therfore are not waves, they are particles like the ones that you see when looking at the suns surface. ",
