            "answer_text": "Hi\u2026 Fibre-optic communication is particularly beneficial for IT businesses, or any business that is heavily reliant on internet. Fibre optic technology continues to evolve and it apparently has great improvements over conventional broadband internet connectivity delivered through copper cables. So, why should you make the switch to fibre technology? The IT telecommunications specialists explain the 5 benefits of fibre optic communication below: Speed: Of course, the number one factor any user would analyze before opting for data connectivity is speed. Fibre optic communication is several times faster than the highest speed copper internet technology, with speeds ranging from 5 Mbps all the way up to 100 Gbps. This means that your internet speed will remain optimal even when there\u2019s high demand. Having a stable and speedy internet means that your business productivity will not be adversely impacted. Reliability: Fibre internet offers superior reliability over copper broadband. This is because fibre is stronger than copper and is not susceptible to damage during harsh weather conditions. Fibre is also very resistant to any human or electrical interference. The only way fibre optic cable gets damaged is when it\u2019s physically cut. Easy Cloud Accessibility: Several businesses have been embracing cloud technology for data access and storage, apps, hosting, and more. Having a robust internet connectivity is supremely important in a cloud environment. The speed and bandwidth capabilities of fibre-optic connectivity will give you faster access to cloud data. Your business will benefit from fewer delays in accessing cloud information. Symmetric Speed: Symmetric speed is a term which refers to equal download and upload speeds on an internet connection. Fibre-optic connectivity lets employees benefit from equal download and upload speeds. Employees today will have to upload heavy files such as high-resolution videos, large files, and make calls with VoIP. The symmetric speed of fibre optic connectivity will make this seamless. Eliminates Latency: Latency refers to the delay caused in processing data over an internet connection. The advanced technology of fibre-optic avoids latency issues, regardless of downloading or uploading content. For businesses, this means improved voice quality on VoIP, downloading and uploading of heavy files without hiccups, better collaboration between employees, and more. Convincing enough? The ability of fibre-optic connectivity to offer a robust and hassle-free internet access makes it an ideal choice for businesses. Get in touch with a network consulting services company that will accommodate your requirements and get it setup at the earliest. My suggestion for Fibre-optic is CONNEK, who is a specialist telecommunications & information technology company, which offers an array of professional services to a number of large Australian and New Zealand companies. They provide full-turnkey project services to Australia\u2019s leading carriers, vendors and subcontracting companies. Feel free to connect to this group to be kept up to date with the latest information on projects. To know more, visit NBN Infrastructure & Network Services Australia. ",

            "answer_text": "Fiber and copper cable each have their place, with their own advantages and characteristics. Depending on the application, there is no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answer when choosing between the two. In fact, they\u2019re complementary in many ways. As our world becomes increasingly hungry for more bandwidth, and costs of fiber optic cable come down, ICT professionals are starting to take a closer look at it. But before you decide whether copper or fiber is best for your application, there are a few benefits of fiber cable that you should know about. 1. Fiber Supports Very High Bandwidth Levels When it comes to bandwidth, no currently available technology is better than fiber \u2013 especially single-mode fiber. Fiber optic cables provide more bandwidth to carry more data than copper cables of the same diameter. No matter what new fiber-optic technologies make it to market in terms of transceivers or other electronics, the benefits of fiber include the fact that its performance isn\u2019t limited by the cable itself. Instead, it\u2019s limited by the electronic components that make up the system. Upgrade the components and your fiber cabling will be good to go. 2. Fiber is Inherently Secure Fiber cables don\u2019t emit signals; connecting taps to a fiber cable to intercept data transmission is incredibly difficult. Because the signal traveling through a fiber cable is contained inside the individual fiber strand, it must be accessed from the end of the cable by cutting into it. In most cases, this would take the network down, and everyone would quickly become aware of the issue. 3. Fiber is Intrinsically Safe Because electricity isn\u2019t involved with transferring data (data is transferred via light instead), the benefits of fiber include the fact that it\u2019s safe to handle. 4. Fiber Withstands Water and Temperature Fluctuations Fiber optic cable isn\u2019t impacted by temperature changes, bad weather, or moisture. For example, if it comes into contact with rainwater, communication goes on as usual. If lightning strikes a fiber cable, the surge of electricity will not be propagated because the fiber cable doesn\u2019t contain any metallic components. It can withstand harsh environments without any changes in performance, making it ideal for rugged environments like outdoor, long-distance, and industrial applications. 5. Fiber is Immune to EMI Placing lots of electronic cables (which carry electric current) in a dense environment can create crosstalk between cables \u2013 which causes performance issues and data-transmission interruption. Fiber cables, however, don\u2019t produce electromagnetic interference (EMI). They aren\u2019t impacted by EMI, either. You can deploy them right next to industrial equipment without worry. ",
