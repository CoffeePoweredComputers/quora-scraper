            "answer_text": "Hi Roksana Parvin Yasmin, You could use the Serial Dongle from Adafruit that allows you to Connect from the USB Port on your Laptop to the Raspberry Pi through a Serial Interface. Many people use this when Programming the Pi for various Input and Output Activities. I have attached an image of what they look like.  There are other ways to connect to the Raspberry Pi. I use the VNC Viewer which allows me to have the Pi screen on my laptop, and have direct access to programs, the terminal, and the various file managers. Also if you install OpenSSH on both your Laptop and the Pi you can SSH in and use the Pi through a Terminal Session. My preference is to use VNC. Simple and Easy\u2026. just google VNC. I think it is already installed on the Pi. So you just need the client on your Laptop. I hope my response will be helpful. Thank you for your question. Sincerely Robert Tonkavich. ",
