            "answer_text": "Think of a group of castaways on Gilligan\u2019s Island who are left there with a set of technical manuals but no tools. Let\u2019s assume that they can live forever on coconuts and are immortal. How long does it take them to recreate all of modern society? The truth is that they would be working thousands of years just to come up with and refine the first few tools. It would take them thousands of years more to be able to get trace minerals out of the ground (assuming that the island was rich enough in those minerals). The early ages would be by far the most difficult and the slowest. But after many ages, the creation of tools to make still better tools, and so on, would eventually accelerate. (If they didn\u2019t get discouraged and give up.) The nature of history is that a certain \u201ccritical mass\u201d of technological improvement had to happen first, before most of the great progress could be made. This technological \u201ccritical mass\u201d included relatively fine instrumentation that made tracking planet\u2019s position accurately, for example. That led to Kepler\u2019s discoveries (probably impossible otherwise), which in turn led to the greatest disocverties by Newton. Think of technological improvement being plotted on a graph. It was a very, very slow climb that accelerated after the creation of urban civilization, about 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. Before then, the arts of tool making and metallurgy improved very gradually over a period of 50,000 to 100,000 years. About 5,000 years ago, human technology improved at a faster, but still relatively slow, rate. By the time of the Renaissance, the making of fine tools had improved, creating an inflection point I describe above. At the same time, the ability to travel anywhere in the world caused greater acceleration, as many new substances could be brought back to Europe, as well as knowledge of the Earth\u2019s extent. Another inflection point was experienced during the Industrial Revolution, accelerating the discovery of new knowledge even further. The major inflection point in our time seems to be the invention of the computer and information technology. But against that, the human race may be reaching some limits of scientific knowledge, at least for now. Ironically, then, we may reach a plateau for a while; or, it may be that the IT revolution will accelerate the discovery of new knowledge faster than ever before. ",

            "answer_text": "Literacy: prior to 100 years ago literacy was relatively rare, without a substantial portion of the population to become technologists, you end up with a lot of wasted intelligence being farmers, bakers and smiths (all noble professions)automation: particularly farm automation, 200 years ago 70%+ of the population were farmers, with a plow and an ox (if you were lucky) you could farm *maybe* 40 acres. Modern farm machinery can sew, fertilize or harvest 40 acres in half-a-day to a day (depending on size). What took a man an entire growing season now takes a day. That has freed up >95% of the population to spend on more education, arts, sciences and engineering.building on exiting technology. Science and engineering build on prior work (this is one of the dangers of patents). The technology we have today is built on the shoulders of giants that pushed technology forward: Tesla, Turing, von Neuman, Godel, Lovelace, Newton, Hopper and Babbage.",
