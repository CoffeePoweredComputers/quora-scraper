            "answer_text": "The difference between the size of your gas tank and how much gas you put in it. You must add qualifiers to your question. HEAT CAPACITY is what happens to a substance when heat is added measured as an increase in temperature. Adding heat to a substance raises its temperature, How much depends on Quantum mechanical states available, kinetic energy of the molecules, phase changes available. Over normal temperatures addition of heat raises temperature in a monotonic way defined by the heat capacity or specific heat. If you mean something else you have to tell us. ",
