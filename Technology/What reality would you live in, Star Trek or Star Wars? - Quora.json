            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to say. We get a better picture in Star Wars\u2019s canon of what it\u2019s like in the middle, working, and lower class parts of their society, especially through the Clone Wars TV show. In fact what we don\u2019t see much of is what it\u2019s like to be one of the wealthy elites, other than through Padme. Most of the main characters come from the middle or lower classes. From what we can see, if you are citizen of the Empire or First Order, and are randomly born on one of its planets, you have a good chance of living a middle class workaday life. However, there appears to be a bias in favor of humans in the Empire so they have good old fashioned racism. Better to be born human in a privileged society on a privileged world. While it\u2019s clear that species from the various worlds interact, they seem more tribal & stick to themselves more, less accepting of diversity, more tension between them. Ie: Leia jokes sarcastically about kissing a Wookiee in a way that indicates that the idea is disgusting to her. In Solo we see the characters baffled by the notion that Lando and the droid might have a sexual relationship. Oh and they treat the droids - many of them like C3PO obviously sentient beings - like slaves or worse, e.g. wiping their memories against their will without a moment\u2019s hesitation. We wouldn\u2019t do something like that to our pets. Coruscant appears to have a capitalistic society with a similar economic class structure as our own. Naboo appears to be Italy, with a society that looks European & prosperous. Things suck more if you live on one of the war-ravaged worlds that resisted the Empire or First Order, ie: Kashykk, those controlled by criminal elements like Tatooine, or a world that the Empire exploited & let decline like Corellia. Again, prosperity & freedom in the Star Wars galaxy seems highly correlated with the luck of your birth. So it\u2019s about like our own world. We don\u2019t see much of Star Trek\u2019s society, especially not Earth or any of the core Federation worlds or major human colony worlds. We only see the societal workings of some of their military field officers. Not just any officers, but the elites of the elites who get posted to the flagship. Even the societies we do get to visit in Star Trek - we still only see their elites - Spock\u2019s family on Vulcan is part of their upper echelon / diplomatic caste. Worf comes from some kind of noble lineage on the Klingon homeworld, connected to the high council. Deanna Troi is the daughter of the \u201cheir to the chalice of Reeks\u201d on Betazed which must mean nobility. Jadzia Dax is one of the top 10% of Trills that gets joined with a symbiont, an honor that only phenoms that win some kind of Olympic-style competition get. Then we occasionally see a few of the farthest-flung outpost colonies established by quirky people or extremists. For example, Beverly Crusher\u2019s grandmother lived on a colony planet where a few hundred white humans apparently wanted to recreate old-timey small town Scotland free of aliens, muslims, and black people. They do not seem representative of the Federation though. We see almost nothing of the broader class structure or average citizens of the Federation. Ie: we know there are large cities on the moon and mars. They are mentioned in TNG, presumably the suburbs of Earth populated by middle class people, but we never see them. We also never see core Federation worlds like Andoria or Tellar prime, nor larger, more established human colony worlds. Generally speaking, the Federation mainstream society seems a lot less racist, more accepting of diversity such as inter-species relationships. Ie: none of the characters think that it would be weird for Data to have a relationship with a biological being. Riker is willing to have sex with pretty much any female alien, even an androgynous species. They value life a lot more\u2026 go to great lengths not to hurt sentient beings unnecessarily and respect their free will. Again, in Star Wars the droids are pet slaves. What we do see of Earth indicates a society that\u2019s more evenly prosperous, with less extremes between rich and poor. They have replicators, which would render moot our understanding of economics. The economics of Star Wars seems to be similar to our own - the rich privileged worlds exploit the poorer worlds and colony worlds for their advantage. I get the feeling there is some kind of unstated caste system in Star Trek however. In Star Wars, I know that either droids (in the empire) or slaves (in the outer rim) are cleaning the toilets. Who in Star Trek cleans the friggin\u2019 toilets?? Somebody has to. I suspect that in order for the Star Trek society to work, there is some kind of intelligence-based caste system or strict tracking in the schools that determines who gets the best jobs. Even with the limited knowledge of Federation society I think I\u2019d take that. Just a much better chance of being prosperous and free, rather than poor and/or a slave. ",

            "answer_text": "Star Wars. First, I can NEVER get past the implications of transporter technology or believe a Heisenberg Compensator can exist. I have the option in Trek of potentially dying in the midst of a war or attack where, assuming I\u2019m Federation, at any given time the people running it for \u201cour\u201d side are either incomprehensibly arrogant and inept (how many times does Enterprise-whatever have to save the day because they\u2019re the only functional ship in range or the entire advance Federation group has been wiped out) or are actively aiding the enemy OR being duped by them? In the case of human tech, it\u2019s a few centuries old at best and is constantly being tested or failing or running into an anomaly and someone not a top-billed cast member pays for it. Heck, sometimes you\u2019re even subject to the completely random whims of a literal god-like entity who likes to play games with your captain. Speaking of HIM, pray that he\u2019s more like Kirk and will decide to hell with prime directives if it means saving your pre-warp society than Picard, who at best might be guilt-tripped into helping in secret and then wipe your memory without your consent while lecturing on how it\u2019s the right thing to do. Alien races? The only ones who politically matter are the Vulcans (and to say they\u2019re arrogant and high-handed is putting it politely), Klingons (who may or may not be trying to kill you at any given time), Romulans (ditto times ten), and whatever new alien race is trying to wipe out the Federation and probably getting helped by someone highly placed. Meanwhile, in Star Wars, sure, no transporters and no \u2018replicators\u2019 we can see (though worlds like Coruscant must have fairly sophisticated food systems) to violate physics and create the question of whether you are you, and trans-light travel is so advanced it has literally existed for THOUSANDS of years. Long enough there are species that it\u2019s suspected are products of divergent evolution from humans tens of thousands of years earlier. Traveling through hyperspace may not be like dusting crops mathematically, but as far as convenience goes, it\u2019s not \u2018ask a friend in Starfleet or take your chances on finding an independent operator if you can\u2019, it\u2019s more like \u2018who can afford a car?\u2019 \u201cEvil\u201d Empire? Don\u2019t live near terrorist insurgents or the kind of things one like the Rebel Alliance is likely to target (and let\u2019s be honest, the Empire is fighting a counterinsurgency/counterterrorism operation; the biggest danger is you\u2019re living next door to the people planning to blow up the stormtrooper barracks down the street. Or worse, JOIN those people. Counterterror in particular is a matter of choosing from a menu of bad options as there is, one the terror campaign begins, little you can do to avoid civilian casualties.) Sure, there are places and times you don\u2019t want to be (Separatist worlds during the Clone Wars, on Alderaan after the Rebellion begins, AFTER the fall of the Empire under a Senate that sets a track record for becoming uselessly corrupt leading to a First Order run by toddlers) but by and large, especially under the Empire, live somewhere out of the way or lose yourself on Coruscant and you have the advantage of thousands of years of travel and medical technology, as in any world avoidance of crime is a combination of luck and common sense, and you\u2019re not going to be killed or maimed by some probe looking for a whale, assimilated, or constantly captured and tortured or killed as a red shirt because your government wants to pretend everything is sunshine and roses and is therefore incapable of preparing for the worst, only responding to it. IOW, better to be a background performer in epic fantasy than to be a proverbial red shirt in an episodic TV show. ",
