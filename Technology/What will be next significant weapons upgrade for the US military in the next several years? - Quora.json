            "answer_text": "It may be more focused on the concept of 5th generation war fighting. The thing with 5th gen concepts is that they are mostly theoretical, and puting them on paper is very not something that can be done easily. Likewise, it takes a while to come up with these new ideas. The F-35 for instance is taking very long to be fully operational. There are several key ideas however. These being that the new 5th gen way of fighting involves a lot of sensor fusion, computerized everything, and information being available in the battlefield at real time with little to no delay. Furthermore, precision weapons are a very important component as well regardless of delivery platform. Air, land, or sea are all subject to this. With this in mind, 5th gen war fighting would be very fast paced, and this would likely be the new weapon. ",
