            "answer_text": "Like with every other business the answer is three words long: Economies of scale. The only way an ISP can provide faster access is primarily if they have a last mile fiber connectivity to the user or atlast fiber/copper hybrid close to the end customer. Having decent capacity on the access usually helps. Apart from that there are primarily 4 factors which can help an ISP to get that economy of scale. Buying lots of IP transit(bandwidth) from 2\u20133 players. Cost for bandwidth at scale drops to ~\u20b9400\u2013500/Mbps.Peering with content providers can further bring down the costs. Peering essentially means ISPs can exchange traffic with content providers or with other ISPs for free or very low costs. ISPs of decent traffic levels can peer with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Limelight etc. and can peer with other ISPs at NIXI.Content providers can install caches inside an ISP\u2019s network. Google\u2019s Google Global Cache and Akamai\u2019s caching solution are examples of this. Torrent caches are also a good solution.With more users on the network connected with high bandwidth plans, effective usage per user doesn\u2019t actually increase much after a point. Connecting a user at 30\u201340 Mbps or 1 Gbps doesn\u2019t really change bandwidth used per user much since most users would not be able to take advantage of the higher speeds. Bandwidth needed by applications doesn\u2019t really grow beyond a point. Hence the ISP can get a better contention ratio. The only thing which matters is that the bandwidth at peak time shouldn\u2019t exceed the capacity that the ISP has.Offering fast internet service is all about having good scale and managing the network well.

So what these local ISP do  , is that they create a cache or a FTP . So if your neighbour ( another subscriber ) downloads the latest movie from that link , and in the evening you start downloading the same movie from the same link , the movie gets downloaded from that FTP or the cache server( that is on LAN ) not from internet and it is counted in the data you used however the local ISP didnt reach out to the internet for that file .
