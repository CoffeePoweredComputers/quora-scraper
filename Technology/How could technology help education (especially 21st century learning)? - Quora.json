            "answer_text": "Education is a space where I feel a lot is going on as far as the startup world is concerned. We, as a country, are becoming more and more technologically enabled. More internet penetration and easier access to smart phones are certainly going to influence this field. The concept of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has been around the corner for a while now. We have seen the uprise of Khan Academy, Coursera, and National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning in the last five years. They mainly focus on higher education though and we are yet to see something substantial in the primary education section.  I feel technology would help the education sector in these three ways: 1) Decentralising the power to impart education: Platforms where anyone could teach anyone, or help them with their math problems can become mainstream in the near future. A Delhi-based Computer Science graduate can teach the basics of C language to a 9th standard school kid in West Bengal. 2) Standardisation of content: At times, there are disparities in the content of the material or the way it is being presented between different schools in the country (or different boards as we call it). With technology, we will be able to normalise this as more students, as well as teachers, would have access to content which is more accepted. We might see a system where half of the lecture/class consists of a video\u2013which is verified for correctness and widely accepted\u2013and the other half has a teacher who fills and gives the class a human touch. 3) Learning by doing: We will, for sure, leave the system where we gain knowledge just by reading a textbook. Learning by watching, learning by interacting and learning by doing would be more popular. Students would be able to feel the proof of Pythagoras Theorem instead of just reading and mugging up a formula. Game theory principles would make learning more fun. It's time. We are going to see the next level of education system very soon. :) ",

Technology-enabled services have quite overtaken all our life processes, though it\u2019s just about 20 years past the last century, we feel a new world already and it\u2019s just started. For all good reasons the Education sector is also transforming tremendously, however, it is also imperative to imbibe the old practices that are still valuable. Technology is a good tool that can be used to make learning more interesting, exciting and effective.
