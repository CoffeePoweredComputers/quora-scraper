            "answer_text": "Space technology is not a way out for our present natural process on the Earth, and it cannot enable us to continue our exponential progression into space. It is not that easy. It is our present primitive way to explore space and accumulate space knowledge but it cannot be taken as a fundamental way to solve our problems. Because the fundamental cause of our problems are on the system and process level but not on the methodology level. That determined our science and technology progress in natural science alone cannot solve our fundamental problem. the only way out is the hard way: long term thinking information and biological information evolution that reach the level that can connect us into higher process to lead us into perpetual future. That needs us to preserve the Earth in its best possible condition for the nature designed life span but not exhaust the resources as fast as possible to push economic growth and technological growth. Exactly what that is, is beyond our present imagination ability but it surely is not the space technology as we know it. The idea of we can follow our present natural process to practice our exponential progression of material needs into endless space is wrong: the nature would not allow any exponential progression to go on without being checked. To follow exponential progression into future is mathematically flawed (logically flawed) and physically flawed (contradictive to natural laws), so it is fundamentally flawed and no scientific and technological solution can be found to support it. Like in any other case, exponential progression has to be avoided. It is a dead end. We cannot follow exponential progression as we cannot do in all other fields, for instances: economic growth, population growth, resources consumption, waste production\u2026 Some say technology is growing exponentially, it is not true and fundamentally wrong: like any other things, science and technology cannot grow exponentially. And more importantly is that the supply of material wealth is fundamentally unable to meet the insatiable needs of human natural demand for material wealth. ",

            "answer_text": "As has been noted many times here, the limits on space technology are the speed of light, which is about double the maximum speed we can achieve with space travel, and the distances between stars, which are so great that any trip to a star takes a lifetime of the crew. It isn\u2019t possible to travel faster than light, and the energy required to travel much faster than 50% of the speed of light is go great it borders the impossible. But, technology grows so fast that a crew going to and from a near star would return to technology incompatible with that of their spacecraft. And, of course, everyone they knew would be dead. Managing such an exploration would be virtually impossible. ",
