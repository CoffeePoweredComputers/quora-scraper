            "answer_text": "There are very broad weather processes which affect long-term weather. Probably the best known is the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This is an irregular cycle which causes temperatures in the Pacific Ocean to be warmer or cooler than normal, with effects on world weather. When El Ni\u00f1o (the warm phase) occurs, the number of Atlantic hurricanes is generally reduced, while the Pacific tropical cyclones ten to form in different areas than during La Ni\u00f1a (the cool phase). There are many temperature and rainfall patterns caused by El Ni\u00f1o. Here is a map of them:  Here is the corresponding map for La Ni\u00f1a:  However, it\u2019s important to understand that these are only general trends. The effects can vary in day-to-day weather or not occur at all in some locations. For example the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season was average despite occuring during a prolonged El Ni\u00f1o. It featured category 4 hurricane Ophelia, the strongest since 2010, which impacted Bermuda and the Lesser Antilles. ",
