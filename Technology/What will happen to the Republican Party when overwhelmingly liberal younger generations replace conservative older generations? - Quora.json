            "answer_text": "Good question. Something happens to the wide eyed liberal younger generation when they begin to live in the real world and enter the middle class. I\u2019m not talking about the rich kids mind your or those who grow up to be well off adults, I am talking middle class and lower middle class Americans. I know this because there was a time I was the liberal younger generation and I thought we could just change things, it all sounded so good, free health care, free college, stop global cooling (yes I said cooling this was the 1970\u2019s), all I had to do was give up my purple can of Aquanet, peace in our time by holding hands across America, the rich could afford to pay more and the Democrats promised they would do just that. It all seemed possible. I was single and living at home and paying a bit more taxes didn\u2019t seem so bad, I didn\u2019t care who came here as I thought there was plenty of room for everyone, and hospitals and schools and Utopia was possible. Then the 80\u2019s and I had my first good paying job and when I got my first paycheck I was horrified that so much of it was taken in taxes. Hmm Not to mention the raise I worked hard for two years later ended up with me bringing home less money then before the raise. Hmm again. Then I got married and we purchased our first home and the taxes were outrageous for what I perceived I was getting. Hmm it was sinking in. What was the government doing with all my money with any of our monies? You watch the government waste your hard earned dollars and you see how some of your Utopia ideas are hitting you right where it hurts. You realize the rich never end up footing the bill the middle class does. You realize NOTHING is free, that it gets paid by someone and it\u2019s usually the middle class. You remember your blue dog Democrat father telling you just that and you also remember rolling your eyes at him. Suddenly you find yourself in your 50\u2019s listening to twenty somethings tell you how you messed everything up and how they are going to fix it. You think be my guest the bills will be yours so go ahead make your bed. Regulate yourselves into higher gas prices, food prices, pay higher taxes to get all your free stuff and when the bill hits you at the Accountants when you file your taxes I hope you keep those wide eyed ideals. When you watch the government spend billions on new programs and new ideas and bridges to no where you will start to wake up. Reality will set in and out of the ashes of an disillusioned liberal will come a middle class conservative just trying to make ends meet and build a better life for your kids and family. I have no doubt Conservatism will be just fine in 20 years and in 40 years and so on and so on. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends a lot on to what degree the overwhelmingly liberal younger generations decide to participate in elections:  In 2016, 70% of eligible voters 60 and over actually cast a ballot. By contrast, just over 40% of eligible voters from 18 - 29 bothered to vote. And that was a presidential election year. In 2018, barely more than 30% of the youngest voters showed up, while more that 65% of the oldest voters did. If the younger voters continue to sit on the sidelines and watch, then us old farts will continue to have more political influence than we should have. And that means that the Republican party might continue as a viable U.S. political party for at least the next 20 years or so. One other thing to keep in mind; its not all about the president. Congress is a supposedly co-equal branch of the government and the Senate is the most influential of the two congressional branches. The problem with this is that in the Senate, each state has equal representation. So places like Wyoming, North and South Dakota, and Montana have just as much of a voice in the Senate as California, Texas, New York and Florida. So the Republican Party\u2019s congressional influence isn\u2019t going away any time soon. However, I do believe that eventually there will be at least one more viable political party in the U.S., with elected members in congress. It would not surprise me to see the Republican Party break into at least two parties in the next six to ten years. For the better part of the past two decades, the Republican Party has been courting proto-fascists, white supremacists and Christian fundamentalists in order to win votes in the rural parts of the country. Its a strategy that has helped them win two presidential elections based on electoral votes when their candidate lost the nationwide popular vote. But it has created a party that past Republican stalwarts like Eisenhower, Goldwater and Buckley would hardly recognize. Eventually the sane conservatives will have no political home to call their own. In fact, you can already see this happening with groups like the Lincoln Project and others: Here are the prominent Republicans backing Biden Republican Groups Backing Biden Get Attention. Their Impact On Voters Is Less Clear All The Republicans Who Have Endorsed Joe Biden For President So, either these sane conservatives will retake the Republican Party, forcing the trumpsters to form a new third party; or, and I believe this is more likely, the trumpsters will remain in control of the Republican Party and sane conservatives will have to form a new party of their own. Either way, sooner or later, the two factions of the Republican Party will have to split up. This may eventually make way for other viable political parties, and maybe, hopefully, someday soon, the U.S. will truly become a multi-party government where more and more people can vote for and support a viable political party that truly represents their interests.

Were the liberal 20\u201330 year old people in the 1960s (stereotypically the most liberal \u2018generation\u2019 in the US) still liberal when they were 50-60 year old people in the 90s?

            "answer_text": "Young people grow old and become . . . older people. Older people become more concerned with lower taxes, paying their mortgages, financial stability, good returns on their retirement investments, fewer regulations, lower prices for food, fuel and utilities and the practical things in life. Also, older people may be retired veterans, police or fire employees, who have an appreciation for public safety, defense and patriotism. Therefore, the older people tend to become more conservative. Ultimately the balance between young, motivated progressive liberals and more realistic, practical, pragmatic and older conservatives balances out. At least it has in the U.S. for over 200 years. Then there are the exceptions, such as older liberals (like Bernie Sanders) or young conservatives. Plenty of these folks exist as well\u2026 ",
