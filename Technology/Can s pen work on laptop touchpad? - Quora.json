            "answer_text": "Do you really mean touchpad or touch screen?For touchpad: no, I have just tried it.For touch screen: only if it is pen-enabled and uses the same technology.S-pen uses a digitiser technology from wacom if I don't make a mistake.S-Pen from Galaxy Note 1 works perfectly on my surface 2 pro and vice versa, I can use surface pro 2 pen on my note. This is because they use the same pen technology. I heard that microsoft changed the technology in surface pro 3 so I can guess there s-pen wouldn't work. ",
