            "answer_text": "MY answers are always different; AND better: We\u2019re not looking for different types, but what TYPE it is. It\u2019s data mining, searching for several characteristic of viruses. To mention a few: it\u2019s searching for key loggers, malware, ransomware, but it\u2019s really looking for back-doors, rootkits, Trojans, worms (creeper viruses), dialers, fraudtools, adware, spyware, browser hijackers, and more computer threats, DDoS threats, phishing links, spam-scams. Antivirus scanners began with sandbox detection, a particular behavior search and detection technique. Instead of detecting a fingerprint run-time it searches for programs that are in action of doing something unusual. Data mining and machine learning techniques, learns from the computer, to classify the behavior of a file, then extracts the file itself. Traditional viruses are signature based to identify malware. Heuristics detects mutations which are viruses which grow within your computer, such as Trojans. A rootkit is the same way but targets your administrative level to take control over your computer. Real time detection is the most common as it runs in the background and checks the main drive, preferably on a common schedule and checks email. Phony renewals: Sometimes you will get an email that will be a fake renewal. Don\u2019t fall for this. When it\u2019s not time to renew, check your antivirus for the date when it renews and don\u2019t renew until then. Among these are \u201cemail viruses\u201d are called WinFixer, MS-Antivirus, Mac-Defender - all do the most damage. Each of the bran name scanners have been mentioned as getting awards for finding the most worst viruses, and each has their viruses they caught. Encryption and VPN programs have had conflicts with antivirus software, such as TruCrypt, SSL remote access, network access control products, and some games played online can have a conflict. Turning off the antivirus scanner is a common thing during games but players need to be cautious. Damaged files can be corrected with some virus scanners, but not all of them will recover, as most do not have a shadow copy to recover. Ransomware will damage a computer beyond recovery. Windows has a shadow copy. Firmware such as your motherboard and the BIOS chip and the CMOS which is your calendar and clock can be damaged. Both of these chips are needed for a boot the next time. If the clock is shorted out, the computer will not boot. This is common damage reported. The BIOS has a BIOS-flash that can be placed onto the computer to recover the BIOS but the clock cannot be repaired. Both chips are hardwired into the main board and cannot be replaced. Cloud storage does NOT have a virus protection in place. It does have a firewall but a firewall does not detect viruses, nor does it recover a computer or protect against viruses. Clouds have had corrupted files from viruses. Also, studies show that a cloud can be hacked and it happens more common than expected. The stats about businesses: The FBI reports that major businesses lose $12 million annually while dealing with viruses. Symantec reported in 2009 that 1/3 of small and medium sized business did not use antivirus protection at the time they were attacked, yet 80% of home users had some kind of antivirus protection installed. It was reported in 2010 that 49% of women did not use any antivirus program at all. Single women are usually targeted with phishing email. Large corporations use proxy servers which are setup inline with the main servers, as a \u201cdummy-server\u201d so that hackers will think they are in the server when they really are not. Permissions are setup for accessing a server and both the administrator and key operator have 3 different passwords each they use to gain access to their servers. This alone can keep out hackers. Still, corporations MUST report when they have had a breach reported by their computer administrator. Most of the time, nothing has been accessed and there is no loss of data anywhere in the system, but reports to clients is mandatory. ",

            "answer_text": "Both. The management part is application software - UI, update, settings, notifications, tasks - everything that is logic and Ui. System software is the drivers, system and user callbacks, scanners, watchdogs - pretty much what interacts with the OS or OS settings. So if a program does a registry change (say changes AeDebug) and is caught, the driver calling CmRegisterCallbackEx is system, while the message presented to the user \u201cThe app acme.exe attempted to register itself as a debbugger. Do you want to allow that?\u201d (Yes/No + Report this) the interaction with the user, save user decision, editing that later etc. is the app part. ",
