            "answer_text": "Sensors? There are lots of them on Star trek... the Tricorder for instance. Sometimes \"sensors\" can detect people on board. We can do that using Infra red cameras easily enough, or if they have a phone on them you can track people now very easily.But the Start trek ones are not so far fetched. We have in engineering a device called a PMI that can tell you in seconds the exact constituents of a metal or alloy. You can get an App for I phones that will tell your heartbeat just using the camera pointing at a persons face. You can regard Radar as a sensor, to detect metal objects such as planes or boats. Sensors on cars now \"sense\" where the white line is and judder the seat if it detects you going to sleep at the wheel. In offices in the UK it is now a legal requirement to have movement sensors on lights so they turn off if no one is in the office. An average mobile phone has lots of sensors, accelerometers that know what \"down\" is for screen rotation and lots of other games etc. ",

            "answer_text": "In-Universe they work the same in principle as they do in the real world- they are extensions of our biological senses of sight, hearing, smell, and so forth. Some of our senses are so-called \u201cpassive\u201d senses that can gather information without having to \u201cactively\u201d touch or otherwise disturb the thing being sensed- we see light reflected or emitted by objects, we hear sounds generated or reflected from things, we feel the movement of air or water caused by something moving near us, we smell molecules emitted by objects. We have to actually reach out and touch things to feel them, or touch out tongues to things to taste them. The sensors we design can be similarly divided into \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpassive\u201d types depending on whether we have to emit anything to sense a thing. For instance we can use a microphone array to find aircraft flying by passively, or we can actively shine microwave beams around and look for reflections off an airplane. Submarines do the same thing with sonar, both actively and passively. Radar is useful for imagery too- we\u2019ve used radar to acquire images of the surface of Venus right through its cloud layers, from Earth: Planetary Radar at Arecibo Observatory Given that we can get images of the surface of Venus from a few million miles away now, I can easily accept that the Enterprise can get distance information and imagery of Romulan ships at similar ranges in a couple of centuries. Radar techniques using much shorter wavelengths (millimeter-wave and so-called \u201ct-wave\u201d) can \u201csee\u201d right through many materials and let us see what\u2019s going on inside buildings and underground, but generally not through conductive metals. Terahertz Imaging:Another Way to See Through Walls - Slashdot The latter technique can do non-destructive chemical analysis too. So, give those technologies a couple centuries of advancement and refinement and you have a lot of Trek sensors covered. The FTL sensors (\u201cSir, there\u2019s a starship three light years away and it\u2019s looking at me funny\u201d) depend on technology we haven\u2019t invented yet, based on fictional subspace physics that will probably never be discovered. But allow the existence of waves that can be directed and detected over very great distances just like electromagnetic waves, but which move faster than light, and you have most of the rest of a Trek ship\u2019s basic sensor suite using much the same techniques as the electromagnetic sensing technologies I\u2019ve mentioned, just with different kinds of \u201cantennae\u201d. There are also gravitational wave detectors mentioned on screen, and we have actually built a couple: LIGO - Wikipedia but the Enterprise is not nearly large enough to mount such instruments and the ones we have are not nearly as sensitive as theirs. They will need a couple centuries of refining too, I\u2019d think. Other sensors detect subatomic particles like protons and electrons in free space and we know how to do that, too. Other particles invented for script convenience though- well, if we ever discover them, we will design sensors for them too. The one that bothers a lot of fans is the \u201clife signs\u201d detector- how can that work in space? We can look at the reflection spectrum of a planet\u2019s atmosphere and find free oxygen and deduce the existence of life on a planet from that, but not be able to tell how many deer or microbes there are without direct imaging. Doing so through a nearby starship\u2019s hull? I think we\u2019re gonna need some more fictional particles for that. There was some speculation that TOS life signs detectors were extrapolated from Kirlian photography and other \u201calternative\u201d ideas about biofields, a hypothetical field of energy generated and transmitted from all living things. However, the first popularization of that technique, developed behind the Iron Curtain, didn\u2019t hit Western bookshelves until 1970 though it was first announced to the world in 1958. Kirlian photography - Wikipedia It\u2019s possible that the very out-of-the-box minds behind early Trek knew of this kind of research and decided it was as valid a starting point as lasers and radar for their necessarily fictional sciences and technologies.
