            "answer_text": "The iPhone X notch that Apple introduced in late 2017 is a compromise between gorgeous design and sophisticated functionality. Apple wanted to make an all-screen iPhone for years, but it waited for technology to catch up with its dreams. But the iPhone maker couldn\u2019t create a phone with a screen that occupies the entire front of a phone in 2017. The notch had to exist to house all those smartphone features that can\u2019t be relocated or killed, including the new Face ID facial recognition system that had no rivals over on Android. Apple kept in place the iPhone X design last year, and it\u2019s expected to do the same thing in 2019. But the tech Apple needs to kill the notch is already here, and 2020 may bring us the iPhone of our dreams. In the meantime, try thinking of it as a positive instead of a negative: Apple could have blacked out the space on either side of the notch - instead they chose to give the user bonus screen space on either side of the notch.

But if aesthetics are more valuable to you than security is there are plenty of other companies out there with that mindset, just don\u2019t expect Apple to ever be one. ",
