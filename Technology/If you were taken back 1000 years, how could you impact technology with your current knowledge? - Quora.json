            "answer_text": "You couldn\u2019t. Almost none of the materials we take for granted even existed back then. Electricity didn\u2019t exist. Steam power didn\u2019t exist. Half of the things you know would be considered blasphemy or sacrilegious. Saying the Earth is a globe and orbits the Sun could get you killed. All of that is before we get to the language barrier. In the UK you\u2019d need to speak Anglo-Saxon. In America you\u2019d need to speak native American. With some luck you\u2019d survive long enough to learn the language. With a bit more luck you might eventually be able to contact the leading scientists of the time. If you could find them, travel took a lot longer back then. It\u2019s highly unlikely that you\u2019d effect anything on a larger scale. There were no magazines, there was no postal service. Travelling overseas was risky. At best you might be able to write down everything you know and tell a few scientists. They\u2019d probably think you were insane or possessed :) ",

            "answer_text": "Practical steam power and knowledge of pathogen/sanitation theory would be the big ones to set me up for life (which of these I was able to leverage first depends a bit on the social structure of the place I end up, but both are important). I also have a working knowledge of firearms and the basic chemistry of explosives, so eventually I\u2019d be pretty important in military development (but it would take a lot of investment to set up, so I\u2019d need cred first). I understand Newtonian physics level math, so I can invent engineering up through the industrial age. That would require even more cred, unless I happened to come to the attention of an existing genius. But ultimately I only have my own life-span to work in, so there are limits on what I can do. And sparking a \u201cscientific revolution\u201d requires broader social change, which my contributions would actually tend to inhibit despite my best efforts, because I\u2019d end up making just one local nation-state vastly more powerful than it\u2019s neighbors for a relatively short period of time. That doesn\u2019t encourage widespread dispersal of technology and science, it gives the dominant culture every incentive to keep those things secret, and the power to enforce that. I could eventually set up a kind of academy for teaching technology and scientific methodology, but it would be highly exclusive and insular. Frankly, a huge amount of my time would be eaten up fighting stupid political brushfires and defending my title as \u201cThe Wizard\u201d. Very tiresome, a problem that has not exactly gone away though it is less necessary for actual engineers to engage in it these days. Scientists still have to do it, though\u2026and they\u2019re currently losing rather badly even in academic settings, let alone the wider world. ",
