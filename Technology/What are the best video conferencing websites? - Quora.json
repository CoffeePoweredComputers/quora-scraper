            "answer_text": "First, allow me to say that I may be bias as a Senior Account Manager at IVCi. That said, this role allows me to experience all types of video conferencing software and fully vet the experience for my customers. I am in agreement with one of the responders above the Zoom is a great solution and has taken the market by storm; their features are possibly unmatched and ease of use makes many customers happy. I believe that one challenge with Zoom is that it does not make proper consideration for the endpoints you have existing in an environment outside of the H323/SIP Room connector. Allowing these endpoints to dial into a Zoom Room is only step 1; what about assuring their quality and not making existing investments obsolete before their time? The truth is, the industry is changing fast, which means a lot of companies don\u2019t just need the \u201cnow\u201d solution in cloud video conferencing, they need the solution that bridges the gap between their previous strategy and their new strategy. That is why I believe a company called Videxio is still on the forefront of Video Conferencing software and cloud solutions. Videxio was has been around a number of years, founded and run by some of the brightest minds from the original TANDBERG team. The solution offers both a powerful, simple video software and all-inclusive video meeting rooms, in addition to the ability to register endpoints (both legacy and new) to their quality assured MPLS. On top of that, as many commpanies make use of their Skype for Business access, Videxio is now offering the ability for endpoints to dial directly into S4B users/meetings and vice versa, which is extremely powerful. Why haven\u2019t you heard of them? Simple, their marketing to date has been minimal because they are often white-labeled by the companies, like IVCi, who sell their service. That\u2019s changing this year and you shoudl start to hear a lot more. So, if you are really just looking for a software, then Zoom has everything you could need, but if you are looking for a company cloud strategy, I might suggest leaning towards Videxio. ",
