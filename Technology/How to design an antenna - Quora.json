            "answer_text": "Some of the basic steps to follow are:1. Select the application or frequency for which the antenna is to be designed.2. Choose appropriate antenna type according to the application. Like size, profile, cost of material etc.3. Choose the dimensions of antenna as per design equations given in the literature of that particular antenna.4. Select one of the antenna designing and simulation software for analysis of the design.5. After simulation and obtaining desired results, one can go ahead with fabrication of antenna prototype.6. Then hardware of the antenna can be tested in real world situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Design aid equations and reference designs are a good place to start. However, anything more complex than a simple wire monopole/dipole antenna or a microstrip patch antenna requires advancing to 3D full-wave simulation, using a software tool like CST Microwave studio or Ansys HFSS, or 2.5D simulation as in keysight ADS. Again, I would start with a standard design and try to improve it based on the application: Operatiob frequency band, gain requirement and size requirement. Once the design and fabrication are done, reflection (S11) measurements, using a network analyser, are necessary as well as radiation plots of the antenna\u2019s far fields. ",
