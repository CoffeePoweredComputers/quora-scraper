            "answer_text": "Luxury is about pleasing the senses. From cars to homes, quality construction, soft leather, thick carpet, open space and lots of light are just a few of the things that communicate luxury. People can't be fooled into believing something is truly luxurious just because of a marketing campaign or clever branding. When it comes to cars, it's easy to identify luxury brands. Acura, BMW, Infiniti and Mercedes-Benz are known as luxury brands not because everything they make is luxurious, but because most of what they produce is high-quality and pleasing to the senses. The cars look and feel good. If it's been a while since you bought your last car, you may not realize how many unique new features are currently available. We've covered infotainment technology and listed some of the recent safety advances made in modern cars. But our latest list examines some of the new I luxury car features that just make you more comfortable. Active Suspension Most of today's high-end luxury cars boast some form of active suspension, such as air suspension or a system that uses magnets. Active suspension systems use sensors to determine the severity of a bump in the road. Then they adjust the wheel's travel to minimize the bump's impact on passengers, which leads to a vastly improved ride. That's different from a normal suspension system, which doesn't include sensors. As a result, bumps are as harsh -- or as forgiving -- as the road surface allows. Active suspension systems also reduce body roll to provide a more stable ride around corners. Executive Rear Seats Many top-end luxury sedans are now available with executive rear seats -- and they offer much more than the typical heating and ventilating. In addition to those features, executive rear seats often come with a full-length center console, which boasts audio and climate controls. The seats are typically adjustable, as well. They usually can be reclined, like airplane seats. Massaging Seats That's right: Many high-end cars offer you a massage as you drive down the road. Several modern luxury vehicles include massaging seats, which feature air bladders that inflate and deflate as you drive down the road. Most high-end cars use up to 10 such bladders, which provide the kneading feeling you get from an actual massage. Mercedes AirScarf Available on Mercedes' convertible SL and SLK models, the AirScarf system functions like an actual scarf. Located in the front-seat headrests, AirScarf warms an occupant's head and neck when the convertible top is down. As a result, drivers and passengers can put the top down in cooler-than-normal weather, since AirScarf provides a blanket of air that will continually warm them. Remote Start Sure, many of tzoday's cars offer smart-key systems that let you open the door and start the engine without removing the key from your pocket. But some brands take it even further with remote starters. These systems allow you to start the car by using the key fob. That gives the car time to warm up, meaning you never have to sit inside a cold car on a winter day. Ventilated Seats Ventilated seats are one of our favorite modern luxury car features. They work like heated seats, bringing climate control to the seat itself. The result is that most drivers and passengers won't need to use so much air conditioning since they instead can rely on ventilated seats to stay cool\u2026. By Doug DeMuro ",
