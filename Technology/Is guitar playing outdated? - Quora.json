            "answer_text": "That is a great question with passionate arguments on both sides of it. One guy, on YouTube, made a video stating that Taylor Swift was the reason young people bought guitars. He was a music store owner. That\u2019s a great topic for click bait YouTube monetization because of the passion of guitar players. When I was a kid, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, The Who, and Rush were current bands that were played on album-oriented FM radio. The music you listen to when you are young gets ingrained in your brain. I\u2019d rather listen to any of the bands above than Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, etc. It doesn\u2019t mean that they are bad, they aren\u2019t raw and rawk with a tough attitude. If you asked anyone over 50 if they would like to be like Bruno Mars when they were teenagers, the expletives would fly like a murder of crows. That\u2019s just me, an old man from Oldmanistan. There was a lot of great music in the 70\u2019s that wasn\u2019t guitar centric, but rock was king like hip hop is today. Rock was the \u201cvoice\u201d of the generation that was at its peak from the counterculture 60\u2019s with a few extra scoops of attitude. Then, it went to Arena Rock (Journey), punk, hair metal, and grunge. I think grunge was the end of heavy guitar and rebellious attitude rock. Rebellion is the teenage hook, just ask Disney. Is guitar playing outdated? Imagine Dragons have the top 3 hits on the Billboard Rock chart. No guitar heroes there. George Gruhn, Gruhn Guitars in Nashville, has said that the electric guitar is dead because his customers are getting too old. He may be right. Gibson guitars have filed for bankruptcy. Fender is in trouble, too. Here is an article that talks about this subject with much more detail than one guy that grew up in the era of guitar heroes. The slow death of the electric guitar ",

            "answer_text": "Is this a joke or what.? Lets step back a good 50 odd years or so. A little unknown band\u2019s manager had approached the powers to be to sign his band\u2026 One of them laughed and said that guitar music was gone and dead\u2026That band was called the Beatles and were later signed by a producer at that very same company months later and that band as we all know went on to dominate and inspire the world. They are still selling millions of records today, 40 or so years after they broke up\u2026. Yes kids of today have lost their way, young artist have got lazy.. Why learn an instrument (Like I had and 14 more instruments to boot) when I can push a few buttons on a computer and create something\u2026 Personally that is not art or music, As I believe music is an emotion played by a real person not the instrument itself and computerized music is nothing but playing a computer game\u2026 If we were to go back to the dark ages again, with no electricity, then we would see who the real artist are, I don\u2019t need electricity to play my music or create emotion, Just my acoustic guitar, ans my decent knowledge , that I built up over the years on how to sing and tell a story\u2026. Unlike most so called artists of today. But hay, if the kids want to waste their parents hard earned cash on over compressed,loud with no real subject matter in their lyrics supported by a computerized wall of dribble and noise, so be it. But never say, Guitar playing is outdated. For the real music lovers, here is real GUITAR PLAYING , No samples just a Real musician and song smith. Click here. Berthmark ",
