            "answer_text": "That was just one of the best scene in the movie with the soundtrack of \"Hans Zimmer\" (No Time for Caution). Have you ever taken a ride in those roundabouts (carousel) in which you get the puking sensation of being pushed out.. Actually that's just the effects of the centrifugal force which you experience. Due to this force, you hold the bar of the roundabout so that you don't slip away and curse your friends to slow down.... When Cooper's aircraft was in a spin to match the spin of the Endurance, both Cooper and Anne experienced Centrifugal Force.. This force bent them and tried to push them away from the rotating aircraft...    Moreover, the endurance's spin was never constant.. It was increasing.. CASE had a tough time to measure it. 67rpm.. 68rpm... Watch the docking clip again, you'll get it.   ",
