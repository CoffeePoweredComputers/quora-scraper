It's a content management system, and they tweaked it to be a Geolocation Showcase System. Also, why use multiple jQuery versions ?? big people in my opinion. Since Wordpress support MySQL out of the box, my successful guess will be MySQL is the database they are using. I think on the backend other technologies are also attached which probably is not visible while crawling the website. Geolocation stuff maybe SQL based or Geodjango or Rails rgeo, can't able to predict. However by the stack, my most probable guess is they are writing SQL queries and not using ORM. And Please secure your ssh holidify people. It's easy to break. ssh-keygen -t rsa -f <path-to-file>// scp it to server// set Root PasswordAuthentication to No on Ubuntu Server ",
