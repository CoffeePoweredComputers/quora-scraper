            "answer_text": "There probably won\u2019t be, Toyota has been banging the hydrogen fuel cell idea for ages, but it\u2019s probably not going to be a mainstream alternative. I don\u2019t really expect a blanket ban by 2035, that\u2019s only 15 years away, and the infrastructure for electric cars just isn\u2019t there yet, for all needs. I think there will be lots of exceptions, ifs, buts, etc. Farmers etc. in their big diesels, towing big trailers, in 15 years, will there be a suitable electric alternative at a non-crazy price? I don\u2019t know. My next house purchase may well run primarily on solar, so the idea of an electric car is very, very appealing, but the reality for a lot of people is that rural infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist, the range isn\u2019t there, and the types of vehicle they need doesn\u2019t exist in electric form. I\u2019d be really surprised if the 2035 ban isn\u2019t pushed back to 2040, then maybe 2045, and then lots of exceptions you can apply for. I think once you get 90% of diesel/petrol vehicles off the road, going after the last 10% is true virtue signalling, it\u2019s a lot of effort and inconvenience to people to make absolutely no consequential difference. Far better off taking *one* cruise ship off the high seas, it\u2019ll make *far* more difference in terms of carbon emissions. ",

Probably the only thing left would be an attempt to run engines on straight alcohol, and electric on fuel cells, or walk. I can see a big market in moving walkways and replanned boxlike cities with high rise and automated delivery systems. ",
