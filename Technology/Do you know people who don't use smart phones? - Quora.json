            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t use a smart phone. I use a very simple flip phone that makes calls and sends text messages. It\u2019s also only a year old, but that\u2019s only because I moved to Norway so I needed a new phone. The reasons why are very simple: It\u2019s smaller and more durable than a smart phone, and all I need to do to make a call is flip it open and begin pressing numbers. It withstands bumps and spills a lot easier, and the display isn\u2019t all covered in fingerprints. I can drop the phone and the battery will not pop out. The phone itself is a lot cheaper to replace if it ever got stolen or damaged. I also like to have a phone with actual real buttons. Actual, real, buttons, that you can literally push, not a screen that you have to tap and calibrate. It feels better in my hand. I\u2019ve had a touch screen only phone before, and I hated everything about it, and dealt with it for years. I gave it a chance. It never grew on me. And I usually have my laptop with me, if I ever needed to go online or do something that requires a computer. I\u2019m not going to fiddle with a smartphone while I am driving or at work anyway, and at school, I need a full laptop to help me do my tasks. At no point during my day would I need a smart phone. It\u2019s an inferior computer, and an inferior phone. Keeping them separate makes both things a lot better for me. This may not be the case for you, maybe you have a lot of time during the day where you\u2019re standing around and need to get online or tweet or whatever, or maybe you get lost easily and require a GPS to navigate, instead of the old fashioned way of finding out where you\u2019re going before you leave. None of the things you typically use a smart phone for fit easily into my life to justify having an inferior phone/computer, so it\u2019s a personal preference. I also think people treat their phones like they treat their cars, they want to get the slickest newest model that looks impressive and expensive so they can show them off, and then the next year they get the newest model again. I just want a phone that works as a phone, I just want a car that gets me from A to B, I just want a computer that allows me to see the full screen and allows me to type on a real keyboard. I don\u2019t want the latest and greatest gadget that costs 10 times as much, only to get bored with it in a week and replace it next year just for the sake of looking top of the line. People have yet to show me something their smartphone does that would make me want to have one. That\u2019s just me. You do you. ",

            "answer_text": "I know a few people without smart phones. In fact, up until 5 months ago I was one of those people. What changed? I started college in one of the major cities in the US. I'm very directionally and geographically challenged; I have been lost in my own neighborhood more times than I'm proud of. My parents thought it might be a good idea for me to have a navigation system and a device that's more convenient in case of emergencies. I am ever so glad they bought me a phone for my 18th birthday. The person closest to me who doesn't use a smart phone is my boyfriend. He used to own one many years ago, but hated it. He now has a prepaid flip phone phone from Walmart and loves it. Many of my teachers in high school didn't have smart phones either. They had regular old flip phones and knew how to use them quite well. Many of the kids in my high school didn't have smart phones. Granted, the percentage of kids living under the poverty line at my old high school is around 34% and some kids just can't afford to have an expensive phone. I know less people who do not own smart phones in my current community at college than I do back home. I go to an expensive university in the middle of a huge city where most people use smart phones. At home, I live in a small town in a sparsely populated area where cell service doesn't work when you hit outside of city limits. Pretty simple to figure out, if you ask me. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Me. A year ago I had a Samsung, while I was in town I dropped it and needed to phone my Father urgently on a different matter, so I hopped into the EE store and quickly bought this for \u00a310.  A few weeks later I found myself still using the same phone quite happily. I also discovered that I wasn\u2019t constantly pulling my phone out to check Facebook every 10/20 minutes. I would only use Facebook on my mobile if I was out and about, rarely on my laptop in my house, and now I don\u2019t have Facebook anymore, I discovered I wasn\u2019t using it at all and I wasn\u2019t missing anything, so I de-activated my Facebook and haven\u2019t looked back. Also my anxiety and some insecurities have if not all, nearly gone as that what Facebook does to us, we constantly compare ourselves whether it\u2019s consciously or sub-consciously to other peoples (dare I say fake) Facebook life. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Facebook has its good points, but ever since I dropped my smart phone on that wet, Saturday afternoon in Buchanan Street, Glasgow, I have been much more productive in my life. Whenever I sit and wait for the train, nowadays instead of taking my phone out and reading on peoples Facebook posts (which let\u2019s be honest, I honestly do not care about), I sit and read a book which is far more interesting. And for Music? Just bought myself a cheap second hand I-Pod. ",

So people belonging to the low income groups and educational level are also using mobile phones widely. In village level most of the mobile phones using are the ones with basic facilities only. As a senior official I was appointed as the presiding officer for a booth in the election to the state assembly in may 2016. It was mandatory for all presiding officers to have smart phones to down load certain software for the smooth functioning of the election. I did not had a smart phone at that time so I used my colleague\u2019s smart phone. But eventually the down loads failed due to poor net connectivity and instead of that old platforms were used. But later only I bought one and so now I am connected to quora. Thanks to smart phones. ",
