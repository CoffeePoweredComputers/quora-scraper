            "answer_text": "If you mean how can you delete something you've retweeted, click the Retweet button a second time. You will no longer have retweeted it. If you want to delete a tweet of yours that someone else has retweeted, you can delete the original post by going to that person's page, and clicking delete when you scroll to the right of the post, or deleting that tweet directly from your own timeline. You cannot delete someone else's RT of your post, though. ",
