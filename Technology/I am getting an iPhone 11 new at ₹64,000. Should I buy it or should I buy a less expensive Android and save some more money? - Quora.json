            "answer_text": "If you are going to buy iPhone for the first time I would not recommend you buying iPhone 11. There is no doubt that iPhone is slightly ahead in terms of performance ,camera and security compared to Android but it comes with disadvantages which could be a deal breaker. For example it doesnt have headphone jack , no playstore , no sdcard slot , no USB C port , it has big notch. If you have no problem with these drawbacks you can buy it. But in case of android smartphones they are very flexible in terms of specs and has everything that iPhone 11 lacked . If you prefer android I would recommend two smartphones and also providing its link below.

Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite ( doesnt have headphone jack) Samsung Galaxy Note10 Lite (Aura Glow, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers ",

            "answer_text": "I would ask you a question in return. Why do you want that iPhone 11. If your answer is it's the latest model. Who wouldn't? I need to show it off I'd definitely pick some cheaper alternative. You're just digging a really difficult hole to come out of. Save some money. Invest it somewhere. If your answer is that you prefer the fluidity and user friendliness of iOS, I'd suggest you get an older iPhone since you'll still get iOS updates and can save a substantial amount of money. You're not really losing out on much. In the end. Buy it only if you \u201cneed\u201d it or is well within what you can afford. If it's more than a month's salary, it's better not to spend on it. Save up and buy the latest when you're in a financially better position. ",
