            "answer_text": "There really wasn't a consistent starting lineup. This was because A) every player on the team wanted to start B) every player on the team was good enough to start and C) there really wasn't a whole lot of competition to worry about. Michael Jordan started all 8 games, while John Stockton and Christian Laettner didn't start any. Everyone else started between 2-5 games each and everyone played in all 8 games except for Stockton, who played in only 4 due to injury. Coach K used a variety of starting lineups throughout the tourney, though it may be of note that the lineup for the Gold-Medal game against Croatia was Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Magic Johnson and Karl Malone.
