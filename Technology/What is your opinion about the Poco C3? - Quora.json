            "answer_text": "I think there are many smartphone brands that are highly underrated but have really good features and can be considered for buying. One such brand is Poco that brings good smartphones in very reasonable price. The 6.53-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1600 pixels is nice for playing games and watching videos and films. The phone is powered by the MediaTek Helio G35 gaming processor. The HyperEngine gaming technology in the processor gives no heating and smooth gaming experience.  As far as the cameras are concerned, the Poco C3 packs triple rear cameras, that includes 13MP primary wide sensor, 2MP macro sensor and 2MP depth sensor. At the front, you get a 5MP camera for selfies. You can shoot 1080p videos at 30FPS using the primary rear camera and the front camera. The camera has some amazing features like Digital Zoom, Auto Flash, Face detection, Touch to focus. Connectivity options include a 3.5mm audio jack, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Micro USB port for charging. Overall, according to me, this phone is worth buying as at a price of 8k you get a gaming processor with good camera specifications and a powerful battery. ",

            "answer_text": "Poco C3 was announced on 6th October and is expected to be released in the market in a few days. Based on its integrated features I think it has the potential to be a good option for budget users especially gamers. It has a decent gaming chipset - Mediatek Helio G35 supported by two variants - 3GB RAM / 32GB internal storage and 4GB RAM / 64GB internal storage. It also comes with a dedicated microSD card slot that allows users to expand the memory up to 512GB. The battery power is 5000mAh and the triple rear camera includes a 13-megapixel main snapper with f/2.2 aperture, a 2-megapixel macro sensor with f/2.4 lens, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor with f/2.4 lens. There is also a 5-megapixel camera with f/2.2 aperture for selfies and video calling at the front. Overall, a decent addition in the affordable aspect by Xiaomi.  ",
