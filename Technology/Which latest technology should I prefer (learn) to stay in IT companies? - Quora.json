It is developed on Java and uses OOP and java concepts. And the big advantage is we don't have to have to build the system from the scratch like any conventional programming. It is becoming popular because of that, though most conventional programmers would disagree. And also because of it is agile way, Flexibility,and being extensible.We design the Business Process Flow (E.g. Order management System, Call Center Management, Finance, Healthcare anything which has a Business flow) and decide the functionality we need to the Flow. Pega does the rest. But of course we need to think in java and Javascript, JSP in order to fulfill Client's Requirements. Having strong analytical skills, Understanding of Core OO approaches is a must in using this tool. And also there are lot of frameworks built on the Pega Process Commander in order to support various aspects of business requirements.\"Pega has other products, but they seem to by and large be known for their technology allowing the creation of an automated business process management tool. - CRM Applications: Enterprise Software Evolved In the fast paced world everything becomes automatic, Here PEGA helps to build an application automatically without any coding skills.Pegasystems(Software Company) is the leading provider of business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM) software solutions.
