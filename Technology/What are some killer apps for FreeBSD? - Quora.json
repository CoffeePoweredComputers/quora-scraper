            "answer_text": "There are two killer apps installed by default on every FreeBSD instance: pkg and clang. FreeBSD is a unix-like operating system. Being unix-like, it is very easy to port software from Unix operating systems such as Solaris or OSX, or from other unix-like systems, such as a GNU/Linux distro. I say this because the most killer app on FreeBSD is pkg: the FreeBSD package manager. After installing FreeBSD you have complete access to over 25,000 binary installations of every conceivable type of free open source software. Web servers, desktop environments, file servers and tons of applications and services. Using pkg you can transform a base FreeBSD installation (which does very little) into a computing platform of your choosing. Clang the C/C++ compiler tool chain is the second most killer app. That\u2019s because if there is possibly something that you can\u2019t get from pkg, you can get the source code from FreeBSD ports or download it from GitHub and compile it with Clang.
