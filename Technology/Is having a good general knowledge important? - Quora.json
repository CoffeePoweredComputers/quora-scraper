            "answer_text": "General knowledge is an important aspect of human life. If you don\u2019t know what is happening around you, you might come off as stupid and can bar you from being a part of some healthy discussions. Thus, lack of general knowledge can actually constrain your social interaction. A little knowledge of various topics can greatly help you initiate a conversation with people, finding a topic with them having some amount of mastery in that particular topic. At the end of the day, both of you will increase your knowledge. Apart from that, having information about current affairs can actually boost your decision making skills. For example, you can invest in an industry or a firm with no visible prospects of earning profits because you don\u2019t know what is happening in the industry or company. ",
