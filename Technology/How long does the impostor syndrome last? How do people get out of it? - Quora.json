            "answer_text": "Here is my counter-intuitive answer: hopefully, some degree of impostor syndrome lasts forever. Your goal should not be to \u201cget out of it\u201d, but rather to embrace it. Let me start with a personal story. Not long ago, I volunteered to mentor women starting their software engineering career at Hackbright Academy. I have a PhD in Computer Science, many years of experience in academy and industry, and have led teams at great companies. However, on the first day I met my mentee, I felt the impostor syndrome kicking in. Why? I had many reasons for this. I don\u2019t do much day to day coding lately, so I am pretty rusty. The course gives them an impressive dive into fullstack engineering, but I have little experience in front-end. And, so on\u2026 Of course, me feeling this way sounds silly, but it was simply a reaction to the fact that I was putting myself in a \u201cnot-so-comfortable\u201d situation. As funny as it might seem, the impostor syndrome affects everyone despite position, level, gender, and years of experience. I have met many CEO\u2019s and executives that struggle with this. Successful people don\u2019t get out of it, they embrace it, and learn to live with it. As a matter of fact, you might end up eventually chasing that feeling that was once so uncomfortable. Why is that the case? If you think about it, the impostor syndrome is a simple reaction to you being outside of your comfort zone. In other words, it is the normal reaction to a situation in which you are pushing yourself to learn and grow. You don\u2019t feel you \u201cdeserve your current position\u201d? Well, most likely that is because your current position requires you to grow into it. That\u2019s a good thing! The moment you feel you have everything under control and you deserve everything you have you probably should start wondering if you might have stopped growing and learning. Now you know the trick, next time you get that feeling\u2026 breathe, take it all in, and enjoy the fact you are making yourself uncomfortable, just like anyone else who is growing. Exactly as you would enjoy those sore muscles the day after a great workout session. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, impostor syndrome lasts for life and most people don\u2019t get out of it at all. They just learn to live with it and manage it. It helps to recognise how common it is, and how much it is part of being human. In fact, I\u2019d slightly distrust anyone claiming not to have suffered from it. I remember tutoring a group of students a few weeks before their first-year exams, and \u2014 seeing the tension and worry that was filling the room \u2014 took a spur-of-the-moment decision to relate my own belief that I had been admitted to the university solely due to an interviewing error. Cue gasps of recognition from around the room, then exchanges of glances at one another as they all realised that each of them had suspected it of themselves and thought they were alone in this. And then peals of laughter. But realising it and laughing at it isn\u2019t the end: impostor syndrome soon recurs as you see contemporaries learn and develop faster than you, or when you join some new group of people. And then you have to deal with it all over again.  Neil Gaiman, the utterly brilliant author (Sandman, American Gods, Stardust, Good Omens, Coraline) suffers intensely from impostor syndrome, and has written and spoken about it many times. Just discovering that such a manifestly talented person suffers from it helps me. But him telling this story helps even more: Some years ago, I was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people: artists and scientists, writers and discoverers of things. And I felt that at any moment they would realise that I didn\u2019t qualify to be there, among these people who had really done things. On my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of, \u201cI just look at all these people, and I think, what the heck am I doing here? They\u2019ve made amazing things. I just went where I was sent.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes. But you were the first man on the moon. I think that counts for something.\u201d And I felt a bit better. Because if Neil Armstrong felt like an impostor, maybe everyone did. Maybe there weren\u2019t any grown-ups, only people who had worked hard and also got lucky and were slightly out of their depth, all of us doing the best job we could, which is all we can really hope for.
