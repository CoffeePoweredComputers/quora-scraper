            "answer_text": "Wheels, cars, computers, iPhones, watches - all these inventions have brought many unbelievable changes in human life. But the invention which is going to come is to infinity and beyond \u2013 incredible, unimaginable and unbelievable. What is AI? AI is a computer program. How we human beings can learn by observing things, similarly machines too learn from surroundings and are able to think on their own. Normally when we write a program in the system, it gives us output but AI is not like that. When it does things repeatedly it will think and do that work in a better way, in lesser time! What if something like this machine starting to think by itself and learn more things how would be our future Now you may ask \u2013 so what difference does it bring to my life! I would like to tell you all that in daily life we are using AI all the time. I was typing this answer my computer system all the time was recommending how to complete my sentences even before each sentence was completed. Another common example is Gmail. My Gmail account emails are categorized as primary, social, promotional. Who is behind that? It is none other than machine learning. It also filters spam emails and sends me a notification when I receive a mail of an ad. Machine learning detects spam emails by recognizing and understanding the coding patterns. I was recently looking for some Nike shoes online. I closed that tab and opened Facebook. In a while, Nike shoe suggestion appeared at top of the page as a prompt. It is nothing but Artificial Intelligence. Are you thinking - How it works? Friends, it is similar to how our brain works. In our brain, 1 neuron is connected with 1000 different another type of neurons. Similarly, AI connects through the neural network with different types of neural networks and it is connected around the world. In this way, it started thinking by itself without the help of human and started combat with humans. For example, recently google deep mind developed alpha go ai world\u2019s toughest game go\u2019s grandmasters were defeated by ai. How did this happen? Well, Alpha Go played itself some thousands and thousands of times and became expert and now? Now no human can defeat it. It has started writing articles, poems and composes music as well. If we compare the thinking power of living creatures on a scale of 1 to 1000, Rats will come at 1 Dolphin at 4 Chimpanzee at 8 A human being would be at 10 whereas AI will be 1000. humans are just 2 points ahead from animals and we are showing our superiority on them. It\u2019s just a matter of time that AI will be superior to human beings - an invention which is going to be infinity and beyond \u2013 incredible, unimaginable and unbelievable In 2017, Facebook created two AI named Bob and Alice. They both started to talk in separate languages which they created by themselves. No one understood what they were talking and stopped developing. In Saudi Arabia, the first robot granted, citizenship Recently Sophia Stephen Hawking said to be careful with AI, as it will destroy human nature. Maybe he has understood human nature and our dependence on easy ways of life! We can make life very easy by accurate predictions about weather, crime, medicine, banking, research and so on \u2013 by using AI. It is estimated that by 2030, 800 crore jobs will be eliminated under such a scenario. Of all human inventions, if AI will come into existence, that would be the last thing that reaches to singularity. How it is impossible for an ant to control human, similarly it will be impossible to control the ai, unless and until if it is under control. Before I end, I would like to say normally an IQ of 85 is considered below average, IQ 120 is smart. Einstein had an IQ of -180+. AI IQ is 12952. And if AI will come it would be the most powerful thing in the Universe. Friends - an invention which is going to be infinity and beyond \u2013 incredible, unimaginable and unbelievable. ",

            "answer_text": "AI is best understood from those closest to it. Here are three thoughts that give us a window into the complex world of artificial intelligence from titans in the industry: Here is DJ Patil, who lead the data science team for LinkedIn and was the Chief Data Officer for the United States: \u201cArtificial intelligence is a broad term that simply means: any intelligence run by a computer. Machine learning is a subpart of this, but you don\u2019t need machine learning to have an AI. For example, what is an AI that\u2019s not machine learning? Search is a good example. GPS also. In GPS, when you\u2019re given a destination, it computes the best path for you. It doesn\u2019t necessarily require machine learning, since what it\u2019s doing is making computations quicker than humans are able to rather than demonstrating the ability to learn from data. For example, the Google AI that beat Go champion Lee Sedol, didn\u2019t have to consume data to learn and improve.\u201d [1] Here is Andrew Ng, founder of Google\u2019s Deep Brain and former Chief Scientist at Baidu: \u201cI stay up to date on AI. People outside of AI are often worried that they do not understand AI. A dirty secret of AI is that it is advancing so rapidly that there is not any one person on this planet with a complete picture of what is going on with it. There is too much to follow. Working in technology excites me because there is always something new being invented, so there is always something new to learn. It is as if the ground is constantly shifting under you. I find that exciting because it creates vast opportunities to build new teams, organizations and businesses that can help a lot of people.\u201d [2] And my favorite, a short definition of machine learning from Hilary Mason (most followed data scientist on Twitter) via a tweet from Doug Cutting (the inventor of Hadoop): \u201canalytics = counting, data science = clever counting, ML = clever counting + feedback.\u201d [3] Synopsis DJ Patil gives us a broad definition, basically that an AI is anything that can be run by a computer that does an intelligent task (i.e., producing a useful result from a set of information). Andrew NG tells us that AI is too big for any one person to understand\u2014there are so many ways AI can be used and put into practice, it\u2019s nearly impossible to document and understand them all (although we try to here). And then to explain machine learning, which is a major subset of AI and what most people think of when they hear \u201cAI,\u201d Hilary Mason via Doug Cutting tells us that it\u2019s basically just counting with a feedback loop. And at it\u2019s bare metal, AI is simply that. It\u2019s a computer program that has access to a certain amount of information that has been put into a format the computer can understand. In very simple terms for illustration, think of a gigantic spreadsheet of columns of numbers, although the truth is of course slightly more complicated than that. Then the computer does math on those numbers and comes up with a useful result. In complex AI systems, you can have several different AI programs, each with their own giant spreadsheet (so to speak), doing math and passing information back and forth to each other, and then you get something like a self-driving car. A Final Thought from Bill Gates It isn\u2019t directly related to AI, but still fits with our discussion. AI is very hyped right now, so if you are trying to find the balance between what is being under or overclaimed, here is a useful heuristic from the man that built Microsoft: \u201cWe always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don\u2019t let yourself be lulled into inaction.\u201d [4] Sources: [1] The Future of Data Science [2] AI Influencer Andrew Ng Plans the Next Stage in his Extraordinary Career [3] A Tweet [4] How to Prepare Your Company for the Internet of Things ",
