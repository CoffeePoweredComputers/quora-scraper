            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s eaten more than one tape, and sequentially, you\u2019d probably have to adjust the internal feed and takeup reel tensions; you may have a VCR that\u2019s old enough where the friction clutches or rubber idlers or belts have deteriorated, a common problem with age. This takes a repair shop, (it\u2019s not recommended for any but techs with proper tension gauges and a service manual and the right parts to do this) but is a simple enough procedure on many transports to be worth investigating (get a free estimate if you can). Sometimes just giving them the brand and model number over the phone might be enough for them to tell from experience how much work it\u2019d likely entail. Some VCR transports are fairly open, some are buried like King Tut\u2019s sarcophagus! ",

            "answer_text": "You may not be able to fix the VCR if it needs a new part. The take-up mechanism has probably weakened over time so when a videotape is placed in the VCR the take-up mechanism is not pulling forcefully enough to prevent the tape from becoming slack. There could also be a reel motor issue. There is both a take-up reel motor and a supply side reel motor and if one or the other is not working, the reel motor itself has to be replaced. If you value your videotape library then search the internet for VCR repair places, some still exist and the ones who were savvy may have parts inventory or they have alloted space for VCRS that they can cannibalize for parts.
