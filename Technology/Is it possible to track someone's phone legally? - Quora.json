            "answer_text": "\u201cLegally\u201d means by law, and law is different in every country. So by which countries legislation are you referring to? Having said this, there can be several ways: You can always consent. In the terms of Conditions to a number of services, positioning is an integral part.Pure mapping (say Waze) wouldn\u2019t be possible without positioning, and you constantly register position and the traffic situation where you are.Other services with positioning information; Swarm, Facebook and other services allows you to check in. Swarm reminds you of places you were close to and suggests that you should checking afterwards.Picture services; the pictures you take tend to have a geo reference. So they can also position you by every photo.Snapchat has a Snapmap that shows where your friends are.Ad per another answer, if you are the legal guardian of someone then you can consent on their behalf, installing software on their phone so you can track them. (For me this is neurotic parenting, but that\u2019s not part of the question)The government can request positioning under the laws you your country. Normally there are rather strict regulation around this. Here it\u2019s required that the possible penalty is over 2 years imprisonment before it can be used. Balancing the integrity vs society\u2019s need for efficient combat of rime. What it\u2019s like in your country, you have to ask a local lawyer.",

            "answer_text": "Yes - there are plenty of family, safety and professional apps that will track a phone location. Just look at Uber, for example. The important bit is that the person being tracked has given full, informed consent for all uses of the tracking, and that they can modify or remove that consent at will. ",
