            "answer_text": "Did you read that article? In the 1960s at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL) based in Harlow, Essex, England, Kao and his co-workers did their pioneering work in the realisation of fibre optics as a telecommunications medium, by demonstrating that the high-loss of existing fibre optics arose from impurities in the glass, rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself. The key phrase from that citation is \u2026existing fibre optics\u2026. So no Mr. Kao and his team did not discover fiber optics, they very improved existing technology which allowed its usage in telecommunication. He very rightfully got Nobel price for his achievement. And no. Use of fiber optics in telecommunication does not mean invention of the Internet. Fiber optics is enabling technology for communication, any communication. ",

            "answer_text": "As has been mentioned, China didn\u2019t invent Optical Fiber telecommunication. They also didn\u2019t invent the Internet. It is the grandchild of ARPAnet, which was designed and built because at the time ALL the big universities wanted ARPA (Advanced Projects Research Agency) to buy them big computers, which even ARPA couldn\u2019t have afforded. ARPAnet evolved into NSFnet. Eventually legislation was passed (at Al Gore\u2019s sponsorship) to permit commercial network connections and the Internet was born.
