            "answer_text": "With the rate of new innovation in information technology, it\u2019s not at all rare to miss out on the next big in-demand product. Even if you consider yourself a connoisseur of tech trends, it\u2019s easy to miss \u201cthe next big thing\u201d when there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of developments happening almost every single day. In order to avoid asking yourself, \u201chow did I miss this?\u201d you\u2019ve got to stay up to date on the trends that are driving the future of information technology. Here are just a few emerging trends to keep an eye on for what lies ahead. 1. Cyber Security Recently, high-profile security breaches and hacks happen so often that they\u2019ve become almost commonplace in today\u2019s digital landscape, leading to cyber security becoming a greater priority for businesses like never before. Even your average consumer has become more aware of the implications of data breaches, meaning that companies will be forced to beef up the security in their products. However, with new technologies come new security risks, and staying on top of these innovations can be a challenge. Constant vigilance will be needed to keep up with these new technologies being developed, making cyber security one of the top trends driving the future of information technology. 2. Big Data The phase \u201cBig Data\u201d has been tossed around so much recently that it\u2019s become somewhat of a buzzword\u2014and for good reasons. Formerly, big data analysis was generally only used by large corporations to gain insight into consumer behavior, but with all of the new developments available on the market, big data is becoming more and more accessible to your average user. Big data collection strategies and analytical programs are improving, meaning that the struggle to find the most meaningful data is much easier than it used to be. Improved analytics give wider accessibility to big data, making it a huge trend for the future of business. 3. Wearable Technology Recent market research reports have shown that the wearable technology market will be worth $31.27 billion by 2020. Smartwatches, wristbands, fitness devices and medical equipment\u2014all of these things have gained such huge popularity in recent years that it\u2019s hard to ignore the growing demand for wearable tech. Wearable are becoming cheaper, more available, and more functional as the Internet of Things improves usability, and soon enough they\u2019ll be on the Christmas lists of tech lovers around the world. 4. 3-D Printing For the Layman The price of 3-D printers is expected to decline over the course of the next few years, resulting in 3-D printing becoming a commonplace activity. Creating objects with ease from a digital file provides innumerable benefits to any workplace environment\u2014or even any homestead. Even your non-techie average Joes will start to learn how to navigate computer-aided design software, transforming the face of product creation and allowing for greater customization in the formation of goods. 5. Enterprise Mobility With the explosive growth of smartphone and tablet technologies, the motion towards workplace mobile technology is inevitable. Mobile technology is poised to become the primary platform of collaboration in the workforce, with new software making it increasingly easier to participate on projects from outside of the traditional nine to five time slot. When you can now swap data with your team from a hotel halfway across the world in a matter of seconds, it only makes sense for this trend to be a huge influence on the future of information technology.

Information Technology is essentially a capability factory.  We can create capability factories, that create capability factories. We will then be able to produce capability factories -- essentially an entire enterprise.  A capability is made up of people, process, information and technology.   It will be quite possible to clone the Architectures for process, information and technology.  The people part is far more complex and really not cloneable.  The people part can be handled by understanding and creating the life cycle by wich the people will need to operate: Prepare people so they can perform their activiites competently, Have them perform their activities then prepare them to exit and someone else to replace them. Within the context of an orgnaization  there are political, socail and cultural traditions.  Understandinf these traditions and all their interplay is the the difficult part. Much of it can be handled by simplifying the people problemn space, creating an people architecure and producing the end product.  There wll always be variations. It is not a perfect clone, which allow for growth and change in unexpected, unplanned ways -- a good thing. ",

As information technology continues to become cheaper, every object that can conceivably provide valuable information will eventually be equipped with information technology.

Instead, other information technology (what we call AI today) will analyze it and look for patterns. IT will continue to be a good career choice for people with an aptitude and interest for it, but the percentage of the workforce employed in IT will not grow, as more and more systems will be self-learning instead of programmed by humans.

Centralized data is going to be a rarity in future. Trust and business deals , storage can be handled through application based on blockchain technology. ( still a simple word, but in detail very different from each solution) Every device will be connected to the net and soon you will be able to rent a robot on the moon in five or ten years and build there your own structures and mine. Wireles/Bluetooth or whatever will become the defacto standard and without any wires connecting your smartphone to a screen or a beamer will usually be done automatically, so in case you want to use a computer , it is already there in case you need. Now probably you still turn your modem on etc. but in the future WiFi will be probably more a necessity than connection to the grid. There are today even a lot devices which require internet for installation , updates etc. and are quite useless without. Probably programs and apps will call so called Web APIs more often. I mean services through the internet, which would not be effective to run locally. Thus without internet your device would not even work probably. ",

Often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term Information Technology in its moderns sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that \u201cthe new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).\u201d Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs. The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce ",
