            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of smartphone I suspect. The original treo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treo_180) was released in 2002. As far as I remember however, the PDA part had no way to use the phone for a network connection, which to my mind makes it not a smartphone. The Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone) lists some very early devices back to 1992. Personally I'd say that the early Blackberry, Nokia and WindowsCE devices that had a PDA that could use the phone for data networking were the first real smartphones (circa 2002/2003). ",

Considering my years of cellphone using experience I will say NOKIA 6600 was the first one of its kind revolutionary product. It came with a VGA camera, a video player, a music player and a memory card. It is one of the most successful mobiles till date and started a new trend in the mobile phone industry. ",
