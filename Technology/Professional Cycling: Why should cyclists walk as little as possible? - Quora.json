            "answer_text": "In theory, it's all about maximising recovery and eeking out that extra fraction of a percent of performance. But like many things in pro cycling it's also about tradition and the 'proper' way for a cyclist to live. It's part of the 'metier' - the job. Also, ride-eat-rest-repeat is quite catchy. Some pro's have famously bucked the trend. Back in the late 80's the American Greg LeMond was winning Tour de France and playing golf on his days off. I suspect this was partly about annoying the Europeans who saw him as a brash upstart American who didn't necessarily follow the carefully layed-out 'rules'. Anecdotal evidence suggests that another American - George Hincapie - was the master of doing absolutely nothing after a training. He would install himself on the couch, in front of the TV, with all his requirements within his wingspan, and work really hard at expending precisely zero energy. That's one aspect of being a pro-cyclist that we could all get on board with! ",

            "answer_text": "Cyclists SHOULD walk. Personally, I've found low impact activity like an easy 30 minute walk at brisk 3mph pace to be just the ticket after an event or a hard day training to losen up sore muscles, and leave you relaxed and ready for another session the next day. Then again\u2026 that's just me. I'm no pro just a fair to middling cat3 with a full time job and normal guy responsibilities (nor do I have a team masseuse at my beckon call) ",
