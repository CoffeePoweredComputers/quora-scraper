            "answer_text": "I am surprised nobody else has provided an alternate answer. Certain types of weather patterns can cause huge updrafts that can capture insects, frogs and even fish and transport them miles away. Bees and other insects are lighter than frogs or fish so seeing a bee many miles from its home would be much more common. Bees are not really strong flyers which is why beekeepers notice a population drop after sudden bad storms in the summer. There is some debate still how far bees will really fly from their hive. Some report 3 miles but i have heard 5 miles reported too. ",

            "answer_text": "Bees usually fly the distance they must from food source to home hive.My guess is that the bee you saw over the Channel hitchhiked on a ship part of the way, left the ship, and either found another to land on, or some object that was floating.  11 miles is generally much further than most bees fly.  If you and many people see many bees, I may be wrong, but just one bee seen by you, and I think I'm right. ",
