            "answer_text": "The most famous cases that were decided in Chief Justice Warren\u2019s court were Brown vs. Board of Education, and Roe vs. Wade. The Court ruled in Brown that that segregation of public schools under the doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d was unconstitutional. It overturned the previous decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson that held that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d was constitutional. Roe vs. Wade guarantees the right of a woman to privacy with her doctor, and preserves her right to obtain an abortion without unnecessary government interference. In other words, the Court held that a woman\u2019s rights to privacy are guaranteed by the 14th amendment. Roe is one of the most controversial decisions in recent history, and has been a target for anti abortion activists since it was ruled. Opposition to the decision is based both on religious beliefs, and the idea that abortions should be a state by state issue. Note: Roe does not hold that a state cannot enact any abortion restrictions at all, and it does not define unnecessary. There have been countless lawsuits filed against states that have severe restrictions, many of them have been struck down. States are still allowed to ban abortions after a certain amount of time has passed, however, if the restrictions are properly enacted into law. ",

            "answer_text": "Without getting into specific cases, which many others will do, I\u2019m sure, the Warren Court established the SC, and federal courts in general, as being major power in gov not only interpreting and applying law as they are supposed to, but making law according to their own political ideological preferences. That court made the SC a major policymaker, behind, in fact, some of the biggest public policy decisions of all time and usurping the legislative power of Congress and the states to an enormous degree. It really politicized the Court to an unprecedented extent\u2014 to liberals\u2019 delight at the time, their ire no. ",
