            "answer_text": "Mobile computing is when you bring the computer with you. Example smartphones, prisoner anklets. Ubiquitous computing is wherever you go, there is a computer you can use. Example internet caffee, mainframe terminals. Pervasive computing is when computers are everywhere inside all things, maybe also within you. Example IoT, Star trek Replicant.  Differences: Mobile vs Ubiquitous: in Mobile the computer moves with you, but in ubiquitous you have remote terminals to log in into the same computer. Ubiquitous is 1970s dream: access the mainframe everywhere. Mobile is child of 2000s: the computer is always with you. Mobile vs Pervasive: Mobile implies computers are so small and low power that can be carried around, pervasive implies that are so tiny and cheap that can be placed inside things that could need one. Ubiquitous vs Pervasive: in Ubiquitous it may be an only computer with multiple access points and shared user space (cloud computing), in Pervasive computers are everywhere, but they don't have to have an user interface, or necessarily be controllable by users.

            "answer_text": "Mobile computing is a human-computer interaction in which a computer must be transported during normal use, allowing the transmission of data, voice and video. Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware and mobile software. Ubiquitous computing is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computer science appears at any time and in any place. Unlike desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur with any device, anywhere and in any format. pervasive computing, also known as ubiquitous computing, is the growing tendency to integrate computing capabilities (usually in the form of microprocessors) into everyday objects so that they communicate effectively and perform useful tasks in a way that minimizes the need for the user end interact with computers like computers. The ubiquitous computing devices are connected to the network and are always available.
