            "answer_text": "Design without a needs analysis is art. Design with needs analysis is architecture, engineering, or craft of the highest order. To prepare a design of a building or a car or a custom-made suit of clothes, you must find out what the end user will use it for, under what conditions, who else will be concerned with it, and all the safety, structural, cost, durability, maintenance, and adaptability concerns, plus literally dozens of other considerations which will spring from your analysis. Without that, your design will be an ego exercise, and of no lasting or practical value. ",
