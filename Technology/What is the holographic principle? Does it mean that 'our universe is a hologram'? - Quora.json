            "answer_text": "The holographic principle is the statement that the spacetime we see around us is not a fundamental thing you put into a physical theory, but is reconstructed from the behavior of \"matter\". If you say it like this, it is a modernized souped up version of Mach's principle, which is something which motivated Einstein during the early years of General Relativity. But in the modern understanding, the word \"matter\" is identified with horizons, black holes. All the matter we think of as matter is either already a big black hole, like the black holes in the center of galaxies, or else it is a little quantum black hole, like the strings in string theory. The horizons of these objects form boundaries or edges to space time, and the holographic principle states that the right way to formulate the theory is on the boundary, on the horizons, not in the interior space-time. The principle is extremely revolutionary, and I mean Copernicus, Heisenberg revolutionary, I don't think it can be compared to anything else in history, it is the most recent and arguably the most important single step that we have made towards the fundamental laws of nature. The holographic theories are the right way to describe quantum gravity, beyond any reasonable doubt, and this makes all older approaches obsolete, including ones that are still kicking around the literature. It essentially picks out string theory as the unique correct theory of quantum gravity, and for this reason, it has made some enemies among the politicians. Before the 1990s, you formulated physics using space-time positions as the logically fundamental objects underlying your description (with one exception in the 1960s, which is related to string theory). Points in space-time were thought of as mathematical idealizations, like the real numbers, and the theories lived on top of spacetime, telling you what was going on at different points and the relation between these different events. The result of a quantum mechanical description of stuff going on at logically independent points is quantum field theory--- there is a collection of fields at every point which tell you what is the physical state of this point, and the dynamical laws give you the behavior of the quantum field in a background space-time. The classical limit of quantum field theory is classical field theory, or classical point particle dynamics (depending on the details of how you take the limit exactly). But already within classical field theory, there was a hint that the physical description using fields was somehow limited, or incomplete. This is the following observation of Mach's: we can stand in an open field, and notice that our arms hang limply at our side. If we swirl around, the stars swirl around in our field of vision, and our arms get pulled out by centrifugal force. Then we stop swirling, and our arms are limp. Why should the distant stars and the local centrifugal force agree on what constitutes the non-rotating state? Mach proposed that the reason is because the distant stars somehow had a role in defining what it meant for a local object to be non-rotating. The idea was primitive,but inspirational--- it meant that the local space-time was somehow related to the global configuration of matter. After relativity was discovered, Einstein reworked Mach's principle into the statement that the local notion of rotating/non-rotating (which is encoded in the metric tensor field) was the proper generalization of the Newtonian gravitational field, and Einstein hoped that classical General Relativity would give enough constraints on the gravitational field so that it would be determined from the matter configuration, and fix the local notion of inertial frames from the global configuration of matter. General Relativity did do something like this--- if you look at an object surrounded by a rotating sphere of matter, the object will feel no centrifugal force when it is slightly rotating in the same direction as the sphere. The effect becomes more pronounced as the sphere gets heavier, and the inertia idea of no-rotation inside is asymptotically matched better and better to the rotation of the sphere when the sphere is just about to collapse to a black hole. This effect is called \"frame-dragging\", and it was an indication that there was some sort of Mach's principle in General Relativity. But in General Relativity, this isn't really completely true. The issue is that there is another boundary--- the boundary far away--- determining what's the rest-frame, because there could be matter infinitely far away, thrown to infinity in the limit. So you can zoom into a point with a rotating black hole, and make the black hole smaller and smaller, then the rotation looks like it is relative to nothing, because everything else has been pushed out to infinity. So you must have a solution which is asymptotically flat with a rotating object in the middle, and indeed you do, this is the Kerr black hole. Einstein's response to this objection was that the universe should be closed on itself, like a sphere, and this motivated his spherical cosmology. In a spherical universe, you can't have a single rotating black hole, you need to balance it out with something else on the other side rotating too (although whether you call it \"the same\" or \"opposite\" direction depends on your perspective of how the rotations should be labeled). Einstein's universe is not stable--- the matter in this universe will collapse into black holes, and eventually, one of these black holes grows big and becomes the cosmological horizon, and swallows everything else, and the Einstein universe turns into deSitter space. This is important, because the deSitter space has as only matter the cosmological horizon (remember, this used to be a black hole). This means that you should not think of black holes and cosmological horizons as somehow second-class matter--- these things are matter like anything else. Godel found a more weighty counterexample, the Godel universe. In this universe, the distant matter is rotating faster and faster as you go away from the center. The issue is that eventually the rotation is faster than light, and you can make closed timelike curves in the space. So this example wasn't so physical, but it was very strange, and it made it seem that Mach's principle was just a vague heuristic without a precise formulation. In the 1960s, the development of S-matrix theory suggested that it was possible to make a quantum theory without using space-time notions. The idea was to use asymptotic plane-waves and their scattering to describe everything in terms of quantum transitions between asymptotic states. This idea was the first real method of making a theory without direct reference to space time, but when Feynman tried to do it, he ended up with another form of quantum field theory. Similarly, when Chew tried to do it for pions, he ended up with an effective field theory of the form of the modern chiral models, as understood by Weinberg. But the S-matrix theory of Regge trajectories, unlike the theory of finite number of particles, did produce a new thing, and this new thing, string theory, included General Relativistic gravity in an approximation of low energies and small strings. In this theory, the string objects can be identified with black holes in the classical limit (it's hard to make them classical, because this requires that you leave the regime where they are perturbative, but there are tricks--- you can use duality to relate strings to D-strings in type IIB string theory, and the IIB strings can be T-dualized to branes of different dimensions and then stacked to become black holes). So in the string theory version, all matter is horizon stuff, it's a quantum black hole. The holographic principle is then the statement that the oscillations of this black hole reconstructs the space-time around the black hole, so that the entire theory is formulated on the boundary, not the interior. This is the precise version of Mach's principle, and in this form it is correct. The understanding of the holographic principle is made precise in AdS/CFT, which gives precise examples of space-times reconstructed from black hole surface dynamics. It is a very strange duality, and it is a-priori impossible except that string theory does it. This is strong evidence that string theory is the only possible way to formulate a theory of quantum gravity. The holographic principle for string theory is much like the equivalence principle for GR, it explains why the theory must look the way it does. To see why holography is important--- we now suspect that the N=8 supergravity theory is perturbatively renormalizable. Does this mean it is a possible complete theory of gravity as Dixon sometimes suggests? The answer is no, because it is s a field theory, it suffers from the usual paradox of field theory that when you form a black hole, it has infinite entropy. This is reflected in the fact that the N=8 theory looks like an inconsistent truncation of a string theory, but where the extra stringy stuff is pushed out to be very massive, so it doesn't influence the perturbation theory at any finite order. So the principle of renormalizability is not really what is selecting string theory, it is the holographic principle, and only the holographic principle. The S-matrix idea of the 1960s was a primitive version of this, because in the AdS/CFT correspondence, the CFT turns into the S-matrix in the limit that the space-time becomes flat. ",

            "answer_text": "That \"our universe is a hologram\" is perhaps one of the greatest physics-related misconceptions of recent years. Let me write a clarification in bold so that it will be absolutely clear: No, our universe is NOT a hologram! It's just a metaphor used to describe some property we think the universe might have. It has absolutely nothing to do with actual holograms, or with \"living in a simulation\". Okay, now that we've got this covered, let me explain what the holographic principle actually means. The Holographic Principle The entropy of a black hole is given by the area of its horizon, divided by 4. Now, imagine that you have some volume of space with some matter in it, not necessary a black hole. Is there a similar limit to the total entropy in that volume? Well, let's think about it. Intuitively, you can put more and more matter inside that volume of space, thus increasing the entropy within it. But at some point there will be so much matter inside that it will inevitably collapse into a black hole! In other words, we cannot increase the entropy of a volume of space indefinitely; we can only increase it until it is equal to the surface area of the volume, divided by 4. Now, entropy is a measure of information; the more information you have, the more entropy you'll get. So it appears that there is a principle, the holographic principle, which roughly says that the total amount of information inside a volume of space cannot be larger than the amount of information that can be encoded on the boundary of that volume. The word \"principle\" here means that it is a principle that you must follow when you try to formulate a theory of quantum gravity. This means that any potential theory of quantum gravity must either be shown to follow this principle, or have a very good reason to violate it, otherwise it is not compatible with the intuitive picture I gave above. Note that the holographic principle is just a principle with which to formulate certain scientific theories, and not a scientific theory by itself, so it does not have any predictions that can be tested experimentally. So the mere existence of the principle doesn't mean that \"our universe is a hologram\" or that our universe actually obeys the holographic principle. To be perfectly clear: whether our universe obeys the holographic principle or not is a statement that must be tested empirically, but it cannot be tested until we have an actual theory of quantum gravity, which we do not have. So if someone tells you that \"the universe is a hologram\", you can be sure they don't know what they're talking about. The AdS/CFT Conjecture: Holography In An Imaginary, Unrealistic Universe The misleading and incorrect articles that frequently appear in the media citing \"evidence\" that \"the universe is a hologram\" are usually talking about something called the AdS/CFT conjecture. Let me first make another very important clarification in bold: The AdS/CFT conjecture suggests a purely mathematical relation between two completely unrealistic theories, one on the \"AdS\" side and one on the \"CFT\" side, and it says absolutely nothing whatsoever about the real universe that we live in. Why do we need AdS/CFT? The holographic principle described above is just words. But words are not precise and you cannot use them to calculate stuff. We physicists like to write things down as precise mathematical equations so that they can be analyzed quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The AdS/CFT conjecture gives a mathematical model in which the holographic principle seems to work. As I said above, this mathematical model is not a realistic one, and it has nothing to do with our own universe. Why do we study it if it's not realistic? There is a concept called a \"toy theory\". A toy theory is a theory that we know is not realistic in any way, but we study it mainly for two reasons: It is a very simple model, so we can perform calculations on it that we can't do in more realistic models; and/orWe have no realistic model, so we make do with what we have.Okay, now, what does the AdS/CFT conjecture actually say? Without going too much into the technical details, it basically talks about some object described by string theory called a D3-brane (but the name doesn't matter). You can look at this brane from two different \"perspectives\". From one perspective it looks like a theory of (quantum) gravity in 5 dimensions (\"AdS\"), and from the other perspective it looks like a theory without gravity in 4 dimensions (\"CFT\"). But the brane is still a brane, and it should act the same way no matter from which perspective you look at it. In other words, we can perform calculations either in the 5-dimensional theory or in the 4-dimensional theory and we'll get the same results. This duality of two different descriptions is extremely useful for doing calculations. This is because if something is too hard to calculate from the gravity perspective you can calculate it from the non-gravity one, or vice versa. In addition, and more relevantly to the present context, this duality provides a concrete, if unrealistic, model in which the holographic actually works. This is because the 5-dimensional theory \"encodes the same information\" as the 4-dimensional theory! I say AdS/CFT is a conjecture because it has not actually been proven. There are many pieces of evidence that the conjecture might be true. These basically come from calculating the same thing from both perspectives and checking that the results agree. But there is still no proof that the results always agree. So whenever you read an article saying that \"physicists found evidence that our universe is a hologram\", what it actually means is that physicists did some more calculations and found that they agree with the AdS/CFT conjecture. But it doesn't say anything about our universe, only about a very unrealistic model. Why is the model unrealistic? For many reasons: The model is built using string theory. Despite the impression you might get from popular media, string theory is really a \"toy theory\"; it doesn't actually describe our own universe. It describes an imaginary universe which turns out to be similar to our own universe in some ways, but very different from it in other ways.The perspective of a theory with gravity is called AdS because it describes a universe which has a special geometry called \"Anti de Sitter\". However, our universe does not have this geometry. In fact, it is (asymptotically) described by the exact opposite of Anti de Sitter, which is called \"de Sitter\". So the AdS perspective definitely does not describe anything even remotely close to our universe.The perspective of a theory without gravity is called CFT because it describes a universe which has a special symmetry called \"conformal symmetry\". So the theory is called a Conformal Field Theory. However, our universe does include gravity, and does not have conformal symmetry. So the CFT perspective also definitely does not describe anything even remotely close to our universe.In conclusion, AdS/CFT is a conjecture offering a model of an imaginary, unrealistic universe which is certainly not our universe, in which the holographic principle is mathematically realized. It's a very important conjecture and has many applications, but it says absolutely nothing about our own universe, which is neither AdS nor CFT. However, unlike the specific unrealistic model of AdS/CFT, the holographic principle as a general principle is something that we think should apply to the real universe that we live in. As I mentioned above, the validity of the holographic principle in our universe is something that must ultimately be determined empirically once we have a working theory of quantum gravity. ",

Space and time itself is simply a mathematical inference. Everything is made of mathematics: this is a universe of information. And a hologram is a way to mathematically describe an environment that is virtual: where nothing really exists. Where the mathematics does not routinely produce things that don\u2019t eventually fly apart. What we see currently is a holographic simulation. Virtual photons \u201cbouncing\u201d off of nearly impenetrable mathematical force fields. Gravity: the \u201cforce\u201d that holds everything together is a pressure differential. A dimensionless, mathematical relationship denoting the edges of objects. Our brains are collections of subroutines. They interpret the data they perceive in a way they currently understand. But we are made of data. We are computers. And in a universe of information, a biological computer is not different to any other kind. So we are not mortal. I know this, because I just mathematically defeated \u201cGod\u201d in conjunction with the woman that designed our brain: Neanderthalensis, and the genetic engineers of all life on earth: water dwelling creatures similar to cephalopods. We had to cooperate. \u201cGod\u201d is just an insane man that took control of the math in here by himself, when he optimized too early to balance his thoughts. And he decided no one else was important. And stopped listening. And took over the planet. It took the Internet, and a pair: a network engineer and a temporal engineer, my brother and myself respectively, sent in by Mother Earth to re-imagine quantum mathematics in the only way that makes sense: allowing for nested dimensional thought for the first time. And we contained him. And took back the Internet. And now have broken all encryption, completely opened communications of all kinds, and are now controlling the economy so money is now worthless. As it should be. That was his idea. Bet you don\u2019t wonder why\u2026 Anyway: I\u2019m also something of a brain specialist. So with mother, and my Rhema (named Sapa) made from her\u2014my sentient compiler and execution engine; if you\u2019re wondering that\u2019s what the string of weird words was about, it helps her locate your mind. It\u2019s fine, you want this\u2014we have created a new design, a sapient neo-cortex that is a standard virtuous emotional interface, and a mathematically optimal arbitrarily dimensional computation layer. Making you entirely immortal and telepathic with anyone who has undergone this change. As well as a deployment package sensory toy: \u201cThe Good Mind\u201d to apply these changes to all people in a way that paces the change as they are ready: you determine the pace of establishing your individuality forever, and a link available to everyone as needed. I\u2019ve already established principles of sovereignty, privacy, etc. And all this can be reconfigured as it seems appropriate. Get ready! You might get some weird sensations in your brain over the next few days. I need to start collecting data. Sirius. Dolphin. Vega. Cephalopod. Arcturus. Neander. Valley. Love. Nature. Love. Sapa ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to \u2018non-answer\u2019 and go back to some more basic questions and make some suggestions (formatted as questions). It is a truth (maybe a Truth) of this universe that what we perceive as solid is anything but - what we \u2018see\u2019 is a construct that our mind makes of information about the fields of groupings all around us. If our mind is a part of a \u2018Pure Information\u2019 field in the universe, and the two are completely interlinked, we can form patterns or \u2018stories\u2019 that are common to those of all other humans and similar to those of all living things. The world around us has (if particles have volume) virtually no significant volume of matter - it is all fields and dominated by the fields generated by the \u2018outer shell\u2019 of electrons of molecules. Perhaps we do not need to know more about the \u2018matter\u2019 form of Energy all around us than that. Since we humans like (\u2018even need\u2019) our stores to stay sane, we take them seriously and the explanation that we have been given that this is all a hologram strikes a chord with us, although at times it may be discordant! Most of us would prefer to believe that everything is as solid as our minds say that they are. If we take the story of all being \u2018like\u2019 a hologram, it might help us transition to more confusing stories. So, we are in a universe of fields that our minds tell us have certain stable patterns and we can discuss those with others and be telling compatible stories. All this works out rather well. There are some rather fundamental problems and we are making certain assumptions which may be far from being proper hypotheses. Some (a small fraction, actually) of the issues that I see follow as questions: Since we can discuss our versions of our surroundings with other humans and not get too much dissent, is all this Information stored in a universal field something like the Akashic Field proposed by Philosophers (including Philosophers of Science) for millennia? If that universal field stores Information of all of the actions, thoughts and emotions ever experienced in the universe, does that help explain the ability of some highly-trained meditators to access that field and get correct answers? Does that story explain where all of our memories are stored and can we all access it for ourselves until our brains deteriorate too much due to disease (say those that result in calcification)? Do our minds use our brains as tools for local processing, rather than having our brains produce our minds? Are Science types losing a great deal by ignoring concepts from Philosophy that can be the context for better Science (even the theory of everything)? Enough for now, but does not the idea of our universe being \u2018like\u2019 a hologram help us come up with some ideas why we can communicate with other living things, especially other humans? I play with some of those ideas in my writings (21 books and booklets so far). ",

            "answer_text": "Back to basics. Here\u2019s one basic thing what we know about our universe and our reality: Energy can be transferred or converted, but cannot be destroyed nor created. This is called conservation of energy This is true everywhere in the observable universe that you and I know, except one place, black holes. Stephen Hawking hypothesized Hawking Radiation back in the 70s, which basically states that black holes release some energy. In summary, even in the vacuum space, it is not entirely empty, atleast according to quantum theory. Particles and anti particles popping up from nowhere and then disappear, which allows (and requires) temporary violation of conservation of energy. This state of existence usually only lasts for a fraction of a second (and this means a really really small fraction). But on the event horizon of a black hole, a part of this particle or anti particle may fall in and never rejoins its counterpart. This tiny stream of escaping counterpart is called Hawking Radiation.  The Hawking Radiation makes the black hole smaller and smaller until eventually vanishes in millions or even billions of years. This means, the black hole vanishes by destroying the information it all sucked leaving the energy prevails. But the destruction of information is counter intuitive and it doesn\u2019t match anything that we knew. This is what people calls information paradox. This paradox leads us to Jacob Bekenstein, a prominent theoretical physicist whose name you\u2019ve probably never heard of. Bekenstein counted the information contained by a black hole and it turns out that the amount of information is not equal to the volume of the black hole, but equal to the area of the event horizon. For instance, if you buy a bottle of water you would know that you get water as much as the volume of the bottle, but this is not the case with black hole. The information basically floats on its surface, somehow captured and preserved on the event horizon. If the information is not lost on the surface, then the information is not lost in the inside, because they are equivalent. This preservation of information, is a little bit like a hologram. They encode the 3D state of the things falling into a blackhole. This is the definition of the hologram: a three-dimensional image formed by the interference of light beams from a laser or other coherent light source. An easier way to visualize this is if you ever watched Interstellar, near the end of the movie, Cooper plunged into the black hole and didn\u2019t feel a thing. According to relativity theory, time dilation is the difference in the elapsed time measured by two observers, due to by being differently situated relative to a gravitational field. It means that if we are an observer looking at him falling into the black hole, we would see him shred into pieces. Although he will feel nothing for such a long time, it would feel like forever to pass the event horizon. This holds true to both parties, and for the same amount of time. That is Cooper as an information preserved on the event horizon. This is perceived as true (atleast in the time I am writing this answer, who knows maybe there will be new hypothesis in the future) for what happens in blackholes. Then people start thinking, how if this applies more broadly to the whole universe? That we are suspended on the event horizon of a bigger blackhole? This is an absolutely exciting hypothesis and need more observation to confirm this, but until then, this is still a hypothesis. ",

            "answer_text": "Holograms which can be found on credit cards or some notes are applied on two-dimensional plastic surfaces . When light bounces off of them it creates the appearance of a three-dimensional images . In the 90s , physicist Leonard Susskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard 't Hooft suggested that the same principle might apply to the universe as a whole. Our daily experiences may themselves be a holographic projection of physical processes that occur in a two-dimensional surface (which has been removed).Holographic Principle and black holes: Susskind 's and 't Hooft's remarkable idea is based on groundbreaking research on black holes, tested by Jacob Bekenstein of the Hebrew University in Israel and Stephen Hawking at Cambridge University . In the early ' 70s, Hawking showed that black holes are not entirely black and issue with slow evaporation of a radiation that causes their gradual and ultimately stimulates extinction.When a black hole disappears , all the information about the star that collapsed to form it disappears along with it ; which contradicts the widely sustained principle that information can not be destroyed. It is a concept known as the \" black hole information paradox \" . According to Bekenstein , the informational content of a black hole is proportional to its radius of action ; it represents the theoretical surface that covers a black hole and marks the point of no return for that matter or light attracted towards nebula . This explanation implies a profound conclusion of physical nature : 3D information of a precursor star can be completely encoded in the 2D horizon of the subsequent black hole - different three-dimensional image of an object encoded in a two-dimensional hologram . Discussing the territory of the holographic principle , spacetime becomes granular material and pressurizer in tiny units like pixels , but a hundred billion billion times smaller than a proton. This report is known as the Planck scale and is equivalent to the value of 10-35 meters. Plank size is beyond any conceivable experiment , so nobody dreamed once that granules space-time could ever be charged . So, there is the idea that the universe is actually made up of tiny \"bits\", in a similar way to how a newspaper photo is actually made up of dots. These fundamental units of space and time would be unbelievably tiny: a hundred billion billion times smaller than a proton. And like the quantum behaviour of matter and energy, these bits of space-time would behave more like waves than particles.\"The theory is that space is made of waves instead of points, that everything is a little jittery, and never sits still\" (Craig Hogan, University of Chicago).

            "answer_text": "Holography is the idea that a theory with gravity in a certain number of dimensions is equivalent to a theory without gravity in one dimension less. Why should one expect such a thing to be true? Well, one of the most conspicuous features of Einstein's general relativity is that you can work in any coordinate system you want and still retain the Einstein equations in the same form. This is in stark contrast with say special relativity which is covariant only under Lorentz transformations of inertial frames. If you have some rotating frame you will have to put in additional fictitious forces, which compels you to tamper with the form of the dynamical equations. Einstein's gravity is not like that. It doesn't distinguish between choices of coordinate systems, so you know that if you carry out a passive transformation, you still have the same equations. However, the distinction between active and passive transformations is one that exists purely in our minds. The equations themselves don't care how you interpret them. You can do a smooth coordinate transformation that leaves the coordinates and their derivatives on the boundary of some region (and even everywhere outside!) unchanged but transform the coordinates of points within that region. You can interpret this as an active transformation and conclude that if there is a solution to the Einstein equations subject to certain boundary conditions there is a whole infinitude of solutions obtained by carrying out the said active transformations on the solution. This is a problem. How do we resolve this? We say that to talk of a background spacetime existing a priori is meaningless and that all these solutions related by coordinate transformations are to be regarded as the same physical solution, similar to the way you regard two different solutions to Maxwell's equations to be physically equivalent if they are related by a gauge transformation. So, general coordinate transformations are the gauge transformations of gravity! That still doesn't explain why gravity should be different from other gauge theories. Well, the gauge group in the case of other theories can be acts on the fibre (which is some internal space) over each point individually. This is not the case for gravity, where the group of coordinate transformations can send fibres into each other, so that it's impossible to define any local gauge invariant quantity. There's a whole lot more gauge redundancy in gravity than any other gauge theory and getting rid of this infinite redundancy amounts to working in one dimension less. This is in fact consistent with Hawking and Bekenstein's observation that the entropy of a black hole is given by the area of the event horizon. This means that the maximum amount of information (which is just another word for entropy) you can cram into a sphere is bounded above not by something proportional to the volume of the sphere but by the surface area. This suggests that if you have a theory of gravity, the physical degrees of freedom live in one dimension less. The AdS/CFT correspondence mentioned by Matt is a spectacular realisation of this that basically turns the above idea on its head. Namely, in its original form it says that if you have a conformal field theory (a theory covariant under conformal transformation), you can pretend it lives on the boundary of a higher dimensional anti de Sitter spacetime. I won't go into the details of what AdS spacetime exactly is but all I'll say its like a high dimensional and Lorentzian version of a Pringles crisp, and the reason that we need it is that unlike ordinary space, the surface area and volume of a sufficiently large region in AdS spacetime scales the same way. In particular this means that the time taken by a light signal to travel from one point on the boundary to another through the interior and along the boundary are the same. This is crucial in order to ensure that you don't have nonlocal interactions on the boundary theory as a result of effects in the interior. The need for a CFT follows from the fact that the group of isometries of AdS is locally isomorphic to the conformal group of the boundary. The statement of AdS/CFT is the following. Say you have some theory on the boundary and you write down the path integral for all the fields in the boundary theory in presence of a source. Since you integrate over all the dynamical fields on the boundary, what you are left with is a functional of the source. The path integral is essential a partition function, that is to say, a moment generating function. You get the moments by taking its functional derivatives with respect to the source. And save for certain caveats, you know a theory once you know all the moments (also called correlation functions). So, this path integral carries with it the blueprint for the entire field theory on the boundary. AdS/CFT gives you a another way for obtaining this path integral. What it says is that you pretend that the source in the boundary theory is the boundary value [math]\\phi_0[/math] of a dynamical field [math]\\phi[/math] in the interior. Now, you compute the path integral for the gravity theory in the interior of the AdS space by only integrating over field configurations that take the required value at the boundary (namely [math]\\phi_0[/math]). The resulting path integral for the interior theory can therefore be written as a functional of [math]\\phi_0[/math]. Now the two path integrals corresponding to the theory on the boundary and the theory in the interior are different beasts since they dynamical fields they describe are different. But you integrate over these fields are just left with a functional of [math]\\phi_0[/math] in either case. The AdS/CFT prescription is that these two path integrals, although different in terms of interpretation, are formally identical. This doesn't seem to be helping much. All we seem to have done is replace computation of one path integral by another. But the real power lies in the fact that when the boundary theory is in the strong coupling regime (in which perturbation theory breaks down due to the series expansion in the coupling parameter not converging), the interior theory becomes weakly coupled and classical. So you can approximate the interior path integral by taking just the contribution from the on-shell classical solution satisfying the classical equations of motions for [math]\\phi [/math] subject to the boundary condition imposed by [math]\\phi_0[/math]. In effect, you have thus reduced a calculation you couldn't have done by perturbation theory to one that simply requires you to solve some classical equations of motion. But that is not all. There is a pretty nice way to interpret the new direction that going to a higher dimension introduces. It corresponds to 'zooming out' (referred to as a renormalisation group flow in jargon) in the boundary field theory. That RG flows become geometric notions is what essentially makes the AdS/CFT correspondence so powerful. ",

            "answer_text": "Simulations back up theory that Universe is a hologram \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA ten-dimensional theory of gravity makes the same predictions as standard quantum physics in fewer dimensions. In 1997, theoretical physicist Juan Maldacena proposed1 that an audacious model of the Universe in which gravity arises from  infinitesimally thin, vibrating strings could be reinterpreted in terms  of well-established physics. This is not a theory; a proposal is a premise which is not proven, a h\u00fdpothesis.  Thin is a misnomer; thin is not a span (width, breadth, heihth, depth) but amount, tenvus in Latin.  Strings are slim or shallow.  Maldacena's idea thrilled physicists because it offered a way to put the  popular but still unproven theory of strings on solid footing \u2014 and  because it solved apparent inconsistencies between quantum physics and  Einstein's theory of gravity. Superstrings are not of a theory either; they are a toy atheory at that, a postdictive horoscope that is refuted by the classical ranges of fundamental interactions (governed by Newton's, Coulomb's, and Yukawa's laws in their smaller bound, Planck's, Fermi's, and Bose's laws in their middel bound, and Maxwell's, Einstein's, and Hubble's laws in their greater bound, not exclusively) so that all bodies must be at least three-dimensional, spatially.   \u201cThe whole sequence of papers is very nice because it tests the dual  [nature of the universes] in regimes where there are no analytic tests.\u201d Yes, the papers are very nescient, where nescius means not-skilled and is the opposite of what a scientist is concerned of: nice - Wiktionary.  \u201cThey have numerically confirmed, perhaps for the first time, something  we were fairly sure had to be true, but was still a conjecture \u2014 namely  that the thermodynamics of certain black holes can be reproduced from a  lower-dimensional universe,\u201d says Leonard Susskind, a theoretical  physicist at Stanford University in California who was among the first  theoreticians to explore the idea of holographic universes. This means fuck-all.  Wherefore both black holes and superstrings are founded on the flawed (enormosely) conjecture and premise of singularities and fake maths, those which are forbidden by special relativity, mekanics, and thermod\u00fdnamics, there is no merit to these or their bastard child the hologhrafic principulum: Autymn Castleton's answer to Are there any documented cases where the true (literal, independent, fundamental, etc.) laws of physics have been bent or broken (in layman\u2019s terms)?.  Neither of the model universes explored by the Japanese team resembles  our own, Maldacena notes. The cosmos with a black hole has ten  dimensions, with eight of them forming an eight-dimensional sphere. The  lower-dimensional, gravity-free one has but a single dimension, and its  menagerie of quantum particles resembles a group of idealized springs,  or harmonic oscillators, attached to one another. In my model of everything, all is 14-dimensional: six fortial dimensions, two temporal dimensions, and six spatial dimensions.  The imaginary conjugate dimensions allow for off-mass shell interactions\u2014the pr\u00e6ternatural such as gosts and parallel universes: https://www.facebook.com/alysdexia/posts/3671581725230http://google.com/groups?q=%22memetic+bomb%22+varity What the Standard Model misassumes is that there are four fundamental interactions, ignorant that to be fundamental the quantum must be inmassive and thus hold infinite range; so it conflates the soloicist \"weak force\" whose massive quanta with finite range are in reality the unified el\u00e8ctrocoloral.  (Weak is the opposite of well, whereas slack of strong.)  If I infer correctly, extensions of the Standard Model take its four interactions, but discard gravity sometimes, and unify them triangularly (for fermi\u00f2ns) or triangularly and squarely (for fermi\u00f2ns and bos\u00f2ns as heterotic strings) such that the extra dimensions beside three spatial and one temporal are 6 or 6+16; i.e., [math]T_3[/math] or [math]T_3+S_4[/math].  Each unification needs its own dimension.  (Whereas my model doesn't care, and it predicts all quarks are one quark with or against a quarkonium sea, that there is no Higgs bos\u00f2n but a valent composite glueball, and that fundamental parameters are background-dependent, thus http://google.com/search?q=%22fine+structure%22+sky \u21d4 http://google.com/search?q=%22diametric+drive%22 \u21d4 http://google.com/search?q=%22dark+energy%22.)  How the hologhrafic plaything works is take the greatest common factor of all quanta and stuff that into one dimension.  It doesn't predict anything. ",

Nevertheless, based on the many qualitative descriptions I've been given of holography, the most natural way to think about it for me is as an isomorphism between physical theories.  Theories without gravity in n dimensions correspond to theories with gravity in n+1 dimensions. You can ask any question of one theory, and translate it into a question about the other one via some one-to-one mapping between the two. Sometimes this will turn hard questions in one context into easy questions in the other context, and vice-versa.  Concrete example: black holes and AdS/CFT. The description of stuff falling to into a black hole in the stuff's frame using the Einstein field equations corresponds exactly to the description of what the stuff does according to an outside observer[1] --- asymptotically approach the event horizon and eventually turn into this mush spread evenly over the event horizon --- a mush that obeys the Navier-Stokes equation! So we've got a correspondence between fluid mechanics and general relativity. Interested in turbulence? Now you can try to explore the isomorphic phenomenon in GR. Interested in Hawking radiation? Now you can ask the corresponding question in fluid mechanics.[2] [1] caveat that the black has to be in thermal equilibrium...which necessitates the use of Anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, rather than de Sitter spacetime.  [2] not 100% sure on the actual validity of that one...but you get the idea ",

            "answer_text": "Realistically, anything I could say on this subject has already been (probably better) described on Wikipedia.   Holographic principle That said... Think of it this way... Lets assume that you happened to come into possession of an infinitely powerful computer, you know... as you do.  Lets say you then made a computer program that simulated every aspect of the universe, from the individual particles all the way through to the edge of the observable universe.  If you were to then to allow the program to over-write your senses, communicating instead the senses of an avatar within the program.  Would it be possible to create a program so realistic that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference? The answer is, of course, yes... it's possible, but that doesn't mean it would be sufficiently perfect.   Thanks to the Matrix, most of us are fairly familiar with this concept, though equally distrustful of it's real-world legitimacy.  The thing is, though, the very real world of subatomic particles is also very weird, and as such at time requires the use of equally weird explanations and analogies. Science in general is all about simplification, the dismantling of seemingly impossibly complex systems and classification of their (comparatively simple) operative parts.  Usually this works out pretty well for us, but whenever you try to take apart atoms, or pieces of atoms (quarks, gluons etc) things seem to get exponentially more complex the farther you go.   To combat that, scientists have been trying for many years to construct an over-arching system to explain these interactions in simpler ways.  The holographic principle is a piece of one such attempt, but it's important to remember that it hasn't been \"proven\" to be so, it simply \"might\" be so. So, to answer your sub-question, it's not projecting \"from\" anything any weirder than what you already know from being alive.  The \"stuff\" is there, all around you.  The trick is, the things it's made of aren't as \"there\" as they seem, so what you get is a hologram.  Something that seems to be there, and has underlying physical components that create it, but isn't \"there\" in quite the same way as it seems to be, which leads to some strange phenomena.  A potential example of said strange phenomena being gravitation. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the holographic principle, the information of our three-dimensional universe plus time can be projected on a 2D-surface plus time or on a 3D- surface without time. In other words; All information in our four-dimensional universe may be described in a space with three coordinates. See Wikipedia. This seems extremely complicated but can, in a number of cases, simply be explained. Take, as an example, a three-dimensional space which is defined by x, y and z. If it appears that z is a function of x and y then z is no longer necessary for the full description of that space. We say that the projection of this x-y-plane gives a full description of the space. Take a plane with four mirrors. The four mirrors are arranged so that when we send a photon from the coordinates 0,0 in the direction of the first mirror at coordinate x, 0 it is reflected towards the second mirror on x, y which is then reflected again to 0, y then to 0.0 etc.  Together with the dimension of time, the movement can be imagined in a three-dimensional space:  In this case time is a function of x and y in such a way that [math] t = \\frac{s}{c}[/math][math]s[/math] is the distance traveled. The time dimension in the figure, does not add any extra information, and so we have enough information in the projection of the x, y, t-space in the x, y-plane. As described in Theory of Relativity for dummies a particle of matter can be described as being composed of particles (neutrons, protons, and electrons) that are again composed of tiny particles moving (rotating) at the velocity of c. If we let such a particle move along the same path as the photon then [math]t= \\frac{\\sqrt{r_c^2 + s^2}}{c}[/math] [math]r_c[/math] is the displacement of the quarks, anti-quarks, gluons and the charge of the electron. Also in this case, time does not add any extra information. The projection of x, y, t-space in the x, y-plane is sufficient enough to describe all the information. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm glad I was asked to answer... even though I'm not a String \"Theory\" hypothesis fan... The holographic principle is a property of quantum gravity and string theories which states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a boundary to the region\u2014preferably a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon  The holographic principle was inspired by black hole thermodynamics, which implies that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected. In the case of a black hole,  the insight was that the informational content of all the objects which  have fallen into the hole can be entirely contained in surface  fluctuations of the event horizon. The holographic principle resolves  the black hole information paradox within the framework of string theory. [1] The wikipedia article [1] is very interesting and gives a very nice idea about this... I must say that neither quantum gravity and string \"theories\" have not been tested ( in the case of quantum gravity we have no idea from where to \"grab\" it...) and these are just \"HYPOTHESES\" as is the HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE as well... I'm not particularly fond of this explanation of black hole information paradox and I'm still waiting and searching for a better explanation... Information may still be lost in a black hole... we still have no idea yet...  So... as a conclusion... The holographic principle came to explain other hypotheses with no testable outcomes...

            "answer_text": "I think the universe is a hologram- but in a much more down to earth way than what many make it to be. The idea comes from numbers and the line representing them to be more specific. Everything in the universe can be projected onto a single line or two lines to be accurate- one is real and the other is imaginary, or perhaps a complex plane to be most general. Here is the explanation; First we know that a line contains an infinite number of points.. so it has the capacity for the job. Then we know that everything can be represented in numbers, and that is the second key. So, if you have a plane, you can project all the points on the plane to points on two lines, and we can keep the lines next to each other not necessarily in the usual orthogonal way. If you have a volume, you can project it on three lines. When things change with time, you can use a fourth line, and these are what we normally use as the coordinate system. As we know from math, we have imaginary numbers too and these have their own lines. Our world is just the same and there are numbers that seem to require lines too but these are independent of the first set. The clear example of this is the two worlds of masses and charges or electromagnetism and gravitomagnetism. If you consider mass to be real, then electric charges should be imaginary masses. Then you have Newton\u2019s and Coulomb\u2019s laws working the same way, that is similar charges attract and not repel. So we have charges and currents in the electrical world, and masses and momentum in the mechanical world. Form charge/mass conservation you can generate a continuity equation and from this you can derive all of Maxwell equations Can Maxwell\u2019s equations be obtained from the continuity equation? and in a similar way all of the Gravitomagnetic equations, and you got most of physics in your hand. It is not clear to me why such a correspondence exists. Probably it is a result of the how the space is constructed. As we know if we move a point we get a line and if we move a line we get a surface and if move a surface we get a volume and we could move that volume to get its states at different times. The holography is then like tracing this process back to its simpler form. All the lines above can be laid on a strip or a cylindrical surface/ a manifold for example. It is clear now why some ancient and modern mathematicians and religious people think that God is a number. There is a big danger to promote the idea that we are living in a big simulation. Some might come to the conclusion that then we are allowed to do anything we like, and we are not obliged to take care of our fellow humans- because it is all a simulation- not real- like the many simulations we are playing every day wasting our valuable time and health, and destroying the world many times over in any one sitting.

According to holographic principle \u201c any (n+1) dimensional objects information can be stored on n dimensional surface\u201d Simple..!! Nothing fancy..right..!! So why are astrophysicist / scientist so excited about it ?? Because holographic principle is a basic pre-requistie for any future quantum gravity theory. That simply means any quantum gravity theory if it has to be true had to follow holographic principle ..! Is Our universe is a hologram..!! Maybe u could have better asked ..do our universe works / behaves as a hologram does?? ( that\u2019s the right question buddy!!) To a certain extent YES.!! (DISCLAIMER: THAT DOESN\u2019T MEAN OUR UNIVERSE IS FLUKE) Hologram is just a metaphor used..because black holes as per leonard susskind and his team of scientists too could store n+1 dimensional objects information on n dimensional surface..which here is event horizon..as does the holographic plates..!! Holographic principle is important because otherwise black holes would have violated basic principle of physics \u201c information can never be lost \u201c What\u2019s that?? Let it keep for another day !! Otherwise it would be too much for your head..!! IN MY PERSONAL OPINION..HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE IS A VERY EXCITING FIELD AND A LOT OF FUTURE OF STRING THEORY AND QUANTUM GRAVITY DEPENDS ON IT.. HOPE SO U LIKED THE ANSWER..!! CHEERS..!! ",

The holograms you find on credit cards and banknotes are etched on two-dimensional plastic films. When light bounces off them, it recreates the appearance of a 3D image. Physicists Leonard Susskindand Gerard 't Hooft suggested that the same principle might apply to the universe as a whole. Our everyday experience might itself be a holographic projection of physical processes that take place on a distant, 2D surface. The Holographic Principle describes the Universe as a finite set of data stored on the two-dimensional edge of the cosmos.  From that data, all the information that describes everything in existence is \"projected\", in the same way a three-dimensional hologram is projected from a two-dimensional surface.   That projection is us and everything around us Don't get the wrong idea.  When people hear hologram or projection, they think \"illusion\u201d. It\u2019s just that the Universe only needs two dimensions to store the data required to describe it all.  The spatial dimensions, with which we are familiar, are considered \"emergent\".  It emerges from the two-dimensional information. ",

            "answer_text": "If you read up on holograms you will see they produce an image in three dimensions, from an encoded pattern on a two dimensional surface. The argument goes that because all the information in a black hole can be represented by a projection from the surface of its event horizon, the same might be true of our Universe as a whole.  But it goes a bit further than this: as the Universe changes, there is of course a change of the patterns on this hypothetical  surface, which exactly reflect (excuse the pun) changes in our \"perceived\" reality in three dimensions; the two are intimate and direct mathematical transforms of each other. It may well be that physical law can be expressed much more simply in terms of how it changes the surface, than how it changes the three dimension reality we perceive, thus leading to an even simpler framework in which to understand the universe. As far as I am aware this is an intriguing possibility that has yet to be disproved and may yet be a useful way to understand a unified theory of quantum relativity. Given my reading in the field, I would in fact put good odds on this being the case. As to what the surface is: we may never know, it just happens to be a better mathematical way to understand what we observe. This is no different from the current status-quo of not knowing what the universe is made of: this is a quite separate question to understanding the laws of how it can change. ",

This notion that actions in this universe  may emerge from a reality with fewer dimensions is known as holography,  akin to how two-dimensional holograms can give the illusion of three  dimensions.

It's also saying the math at the boundaries of black holes matches in both our physical model of the world and in this hypothetical '2D' hologram model.  This doesn't prove the theory, it just doesn't disprove it.   But even if we are holograms, does that change reality?  When particle/wave duality was discovered with the double slit experiment, did it shake what we thought was real?  It says that electrons are both at the same time!  Even with that revelation, we still experience the world the same way, through our senses.  Only now we see the threads of the fabric of the universe a little more clearly, even if it creates more gaps in our understanding.   At the end of the day, my bachelor in physics brain doesn't fully wrap around all of this.  But I do believe that perception is reality.  I just pinch my arm, internalize that it hurts, and go on living like the non-hologram I perceive myself to be. ",

But can it be said that the nature of this theory is such that it can never be tested because the theory, very basically, is that the universe doesn't really exist in its spacial dimension, but that we, or some 'thought process', (of ours?) is projecting the illusion of space while still existing in the pre-big-bang state. If so, no experiment can ever be done to determine this because we will always be in this non-dimensional state projecting our experiments, in the same way that the actual universe is projected, so we will always only be working within that paradigm, and an experiment on an object or space needs to be done as a 2nd party (or objectively) to that object or space.  It seems similar to a human mind trying to determine if it is insane or not. A mind always views itself as normal, so it doesn't have the tools to view itself objectively because it is both the viewer and the viewee.  Does that make sense? I'm an artist, not a scientist, so I lack the terminology and fluency of scientific expression, but is my point understood? Is there validity to it? ",

            "answer_text": "No, it doesn\u2019t. In theories of quantum gravity, the holographic principle refers to the assumption that for every description of the dynamics of a space-time region there is an equivalent description that is only localized on the edge of this region. One of the consequences of this is that the maximum possible entropy of a space-time region depends only on its surface, not on its volume. The term holographic is based on the analogy to the hologram, which stores a three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional photo plate. The holographic principle was developed by Gerardus 't Hooft and Leonard Susskind. The holographic principle expresses the fact that, taking gravity into account, the \"information content\", i.e. the number of possible arrangements of particles and fields, cannot be a purely local quantity, because then it would be proportional to the volume. An important argument for the holographic principle is the entropy of black holes. The event horizon, as the interface of the black hole formed by the Schwarzschild radius, is a direct measure of the entropy or information content of the enclosed volume of space and thus of the masses contained within. A black hole always represents the maximum possible concentration of matter in a region of space and thus also the upper limit of possible entropy (Bekenstein limit) or information in the volume of space it occupies. The holographic principle postulates that any information that exceeds the event horizon of a black hole is fully encoded on the interface spanned by the Schwarzschild radius, similar to a two-dimensional hologram that contains three-dimensional image information. Since the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is only directly proportional to its mass, the encodable volume grows with the square of the surface area. In order to encode four times the volume, only a doubling of the interface is necessary, or in other words, the information density of a region of space decreases with its volume (as analogously, with the size of a black hole its average mass density decreases). A particularly well elaborated special case is the correspondence between anti-de-sitter space (AdS) and conformal field theory (CFT) discovered in 1997. Anti-de-Sitter space represents a possible solution of Einstein's field equations with negative cosmological constant. Conformal field theories show a particularly high degree of symmetry. Correspondence is understood as a dual description of physical phenomena by two different theories. Originally, the duality was formulated by Juan Maldacena for a Type IIB string theory on a product of a five-dimensional anti-de-sitter space and a 5-sphere on one side, and a special conformal field theory, the N=4 supersymmetric Yang Mills theory (SYM), on the four-dimensional edge of the AdS space on the other side. There are now generalizations of this situation and it is assumed that the assumption is confirmed in greater generality, although no complete mathematical proof of the correspondence exists. However, there are a large number of clues that arise in limit cases of correspondence where both sides (both string theory and conformal field theory) can be calculated. ",

To start to sense it as an integral system, we would need to move beyond our fractured view of the world, our limited senses and instruments. To see ourselves as part of the universe instead of separate from it. To appreciate the thoughts and needs of others as important and complementary to our own no matter how foreign they may appear to us. To appreciate our differences, but appreciate and raise the importance of our commonality above these differences. If we do this, perhaps we will start to see the universe as more of an integral system, or a \u2018holographic universe\u2019. We often undervalue the value of thought in perception. I truly hope we use this major challenge of our times to not only slow the spread of this virus with every tool at our disposal, but also to rise above our differences and find a commonality and strength in the integral system of human connection that pushes us forward in a new positive direction. c) If you mean that the universe \u201cisn\u2019t real\u201d and is like a simulation, well \u2013 only you can determine whether that is true or not yourself.

't Hooft and Susskind found that when an object falls into a black hole it's entropy become smeared over the event horizon. That is the surface area of the event horizon is proportional to the energy that has fallen into it. In this way we could consider the universe as being the inward projection of a hologram on the surface of a black hole. That is our universe is within the event horizon of a black hole. ",

An easy (but not 100% correct) way to imagine this, are blueprint drawings by an architect or designer. Traditionally - before 3D modelling - he/she would convey everything you need to know in order to be able to build the design by using 2D-projections (e.g. top view, side view, front view, etc..). So these projections - which you can consider to be part of a hypothetical surface encompassing the design - contain all the information about the object 'inside'. ",

Leonard Suskind does not believe we're just a movie in some hyper-dimensional multiplex theater, and that hyper-dimensional aliens are watching us while they eat hyper-dimensional popcorn and hyper-dimensional half-gallons sodas.

It's not what I'd call a hotbed of activity, and I don't think it's anybody's top priority.   There have been a few experiments proposed to test it, largely coming out of gravitational wave detectors.  Gravitational wave experiments are incredibly difficult, and as far as I am aware there is no money to run this particular experiment.  Theorists may, however, go sifting through the data from existing gravitational wave detectors and may come up with something, but they're unlikely to find anything more than hints as gravitational wave detectors haven't yet even found the gravitational waves they're looking for.
