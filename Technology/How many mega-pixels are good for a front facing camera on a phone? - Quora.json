            "answer_text": "Megapixels for phone cameras are a distraction from the quality of the pictures. The truth is that a lens 2 mm in diameter is going to have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 250 microradians, roughly the \u201cnormal\u201d visual acuity of the human eye. For a camera with a 70 degree field of view, that works out to roughly 10 megapixels. So with more than 10 megapixels, the improvement in picture quality is very marginal at best. And in actuality, affordable lenses for phone cameras do not achieve diffraction limited performance, so you could argue than anything over about 3-5 megapixels is overkill. The quality of the lens and the implementation of the camera affect the quality of pictures more than those extra megapixels. By the way, I have been doing digital photography in aerospace laboratories since the early 1980s. Incidentally, this is why smartphone cameras will never replace DSLRs or mirrorless cameras. The larger lenses and larger pixels gather more light and produce sharper images, even though they cost a hundred times what your phone camera cost. And with various lenses and aperture stops and processing from raw images, only an amateur that pulls his DSLR out for birthdays would think that a smartphone camera competes with a full frame camera. There is a caveat. What if those extra pixels are used to gather extra light, perform bokeh tricks, and to help with dynamic range? That is what is being done with smart phone cameras now. You may be hearing about 108 megapixels. No, there is no possible law of physics that will let you get the sharpness of 108 megapixels with a 2 mm lens. However, those extra pixels can get you lower noise, better color accuracy, and higher dynamic range. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say 5MP or 8MP. Considering that a front-facing camera has a fixed focus, that your face will be less than a meter away, likely covers more than 50% of the screen and that the camera usually needs to be sensitive enough to work in low light without any assistance, 5MP is already alot. Practically, higher resolution only makes sense on a front-facing camera for cases where you may want to crop the image.So, a 8MP image with a bit of its border cropped (more cropping is unlikely as the photographer usually covers the majority of details in the image already) still ends up being ~5MP. Full disclosure:I would vote for a even lower resolution, such as 3MP, but practically the best front-facing cameras in 2016 are either 5MP or 8MP, which still provides enough resolution to print the image. Higher resolution really makes no sense in a selfie cam, because the bottleneck for more details won't be the resolution of the sensor, but its size, its lens, its fixed focus... ",
