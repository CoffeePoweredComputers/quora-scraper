            "answer_text": "I meditate as part of my spiritual practice, not to improve my health. Having said that, mindfulness is all about paying attention. When you practice mindfulness, what happens is, you notice how spaced out you are, and hos being spaced out affects your day. For example: I was a tile man. If I sent my helper to the truck to get some stuff I need, and he forgets something, he will have to go back to get it. That\u2019s a little bit, depending how far away the truck is from the worksite, but it adds up. Worse, if you are spacing out, fooling around, acting up, that\u2019s when accidents happen. You get the picture. Then, being mindful means you work more efficiently. You make fewer mistakes, and get done faster. That is another thing that pleases customers- getting it done quickly and well. People want a great job, and you out of their house. There\u2019s blue collar, you can imagine similar scenarios. Paperwork mistakes can really cause problems. A lot of teachers try to sell being mindful with a lot of hype of the wonderful feelings you have. Live in the moment- man, that used to confuse me. It\u2019s really more about paying attention, doing a good job, like your coach or junior hi teacher or dad (especially if he's been in the service) yelled at you. It\u2019s not secret teaching, it\u2019s common sense. Mindfulness is about getting out of your head, living in your fantasies, and paying attention. Like when your driving. And also, like when you go on vacation and keep following what\u2019s going on back at the office, and miss the sites. Like being preoccupied and ignoring you spouse, your kids, your friends. There is nothing wrong with fantasizing. We fantasize a little whenever we make plans. Heck, when you have to walk through a construction site, you have to picture a safe path. Working, you have to \u201csee\u201d what to do, and make plans. But if you live there, you make mistakes in the physical world. I hope this helps give you a better picture of the reasons to wake up and pay attention- be mindful. ",

            "answer_text": "Mindfulness is applicable to every aspect of life, it brings a greater sense of awareness and you are more intentional about what you are doing. Whether that is the way you spend your time or your money etc if you are more intentional then you will spend your days more productively and few things will be a waste. Apply this concept to business. You can generate income at an exponential rate by being mindful and inetentional of the tasks you complete and doing the 20% that will get you the largest results (look up the Pareto Principle or 80/20 Rule). You can start better budgeting by becoming aware of your personal/company\u2019s spending habits. Cut down on what isn\u2019t an imminent requirement, allocate more for what is. The list goes on. Essentially actively applying the concept of mindfulness to your business (or your life) will only ever reap positive results, maybe not right away but definitely with time. ",
