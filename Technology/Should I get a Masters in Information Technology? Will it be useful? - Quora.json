            "answer_text": "If you have no work experience, having a master\u2019s degree won\u2019t get you very far. You definitely shouldn\u2019t think of a master\u2019s degree as a \u201cticket\u201d to get a job in IT. It\u2019s probably better to think of it as the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d to further polish your skills after you\u2019ve gained some level of work experience. It definitely is not a requirement for getting into most jobs in IT. It might be more useful to get into a consulting role but then only in conjunction with some level of experience. ",
