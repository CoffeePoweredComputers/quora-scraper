            "answer_text": "I think it would be immature of us to this that these are ordinary spears. Spears as per encyclopedia Brittanica is \"Spear, a pole weapon with a sharp point, either thrown or thrust at an enemy or prey. It appears in an infinite variety of forms in societies around the world.\" However the weapon used by Wakandan soldiers ( even though it looked like spear and called vibranium/sonic spear ) is definitely much more than an ordinary spear that humans have been using in older times.  Being made from Vibranium, Sonic Spears are incredibly durable, able to absorb kinetic energy. They are untraceable to metal detectors and can project a powerful sonic blast, similar to Ulysses Klaue's Prosthetic Arm, which is said to be able to destroy a tank. They also be having some other uses which has not been shown in the movie.  These can also be used in close combat as a melee weapon ( with tip of vibranium, which is nearly indestructible element).  Comment by ultron on Captain America\u2019s shield made of vibranium \"The most versatile substance on the planet... and they used it to make a frisbee.\" \u2015Ultron[src] Their Vibranium composition enables the spears to pierce through other solid materials, from road asphalt to other Vibranium objects. These, even though it looked like a spear, were more like wolverine claws and laser gun combined than a simple spear.Moreover, the spears are more than simple cold steel weapons: their blunt end is capable of delivering electric discharges in combat and utilizes sonic technology to interact with other electronic components. Moreover, when several spears get close enough, they can lock together to form an energy barrier around a target which was powerful enough to briefly incapacitate Erik Killmonger when enhanced by the Heart-Shaped Herb. We need to remember that wakandan army has always prepared to deal with threats not only on earth but also from extraterrestrial. So when arming their infantry they would have though what is the best infantry weapon in this world, a machine gun. what is even better is long range laser/close combat ( highly durable vibranium) weapon in the shape of spear. spear shape might be prefereable as this is a weapon which could be used both with one hand( for mass killing like machine gun) or two hand(for precision). Also when the wakandan army knew that they need to face extraterrestrials unknown species ( or probably they knew about outriders) something like  who knows if shitty things like bullet will even be able to penetrate their armor ( bullet can\u2019t penetrate even lot of earth armor) which weapon you should choose the one that shoots weapon or the one that shoots sonic beam. I think it was wise of Black Panther ( one of the highest order of tactician in earth) to choose the sonic/vibranium spear. Question might arise that why not superheroes using them instead of machine guns.Answer is that these superheroes have always practiced with those kind of weapon and were more efficient with those. It is always who is behind the weapon which matters more than the weapon. Captain america prefers his vibranium shield any day over all kind of offensive,defensive weapon. \"Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon powerful enough to stop a tank. Untraceable by metal detectors and we've got thousands of them.\" \u2015Erik Killmonger[src] ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because there is a difference between having technology and having the culture necessary to make effective use of it. The Wakandans make plenty of tactical mistakes during the fight in Infinity War. Using powerful but slow spear weapons when fast but weak guns are shown to be just as effective. Dropping their shields to close in on an enemy with no long range capabilities. Not using any sort of air support or armor. Out of universe this is for entertainment value. Real life military tactics are kind of boring. The Wakandans standing behind their shield wall, repelling the alien monsters with energy rifles just isn\u2019t as cool as them charging the monsters with energy spears. In universe the Wakandans probably aren\u2019t very good at war. Wakanda is a small, technologically advanced, isolationist country. They\u2019re kept safe mostly through secrecy and subterfuge. No one with a real army would attack Wakanda because (they think) there\u2019s nothing there. Anyone with a \u201cfake army\u201d, such as a local warlord, can be taken out with the energy spears. Or more likely can be destroyed before they get anywhere near Wakanda. Most likely the last time the Wakandans had to get into a real war with anyone it was at a time when the spear an shield ruled the world. And they just never needed to adapt their military doctrine. This actually ties into one of the subtler themes in Black Panther and Infinity War. Wakanda\u2019s isolationism is stifling their innovation and keeping them from using their technology to it\u2019s full potential. Look at the Black Panther suit. It\u2019s made from nanotechnology far more advanced then anything Iron Man has access too. It\u2019s made of an indestructible miracle material that Tony Stark can only dream of getting his hands on. Yet the Infinity War Iron Man suit has way more gadgets then Black Panther ever had. Because the Wakandans never saw a reason to go all out on gadgets. ",
