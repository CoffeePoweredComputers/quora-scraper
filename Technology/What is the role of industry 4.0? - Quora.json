            "answer_text": "Industry 4.0 has another name\u2014Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). The objective of cyber physical system is to add intelligence to industrial products, so that they can do their jobs in a more effective and efficient manner. For example, by adding intelligence to irrigation pump, we can improve our capability of more effectively and efficiently irrigating lands. In order to make machines intelligent, we add sensors, software and also connectivity. When machines are capable to understand the situation and decides by themselves, instead of waiting for human operators to step in, they can take actions to improve the outcome. For example, by turning cars Cyber Physical Systems, we can make them safer and more efficient in getting the job done. Often the Industry 4.0 is also linked with massive data, and data science. As we keep adding sensors to machines they will keep increasing the production of data, requiring science to develop algorithms to interpret them. Basic purpose of the Industry 4.0 is to make machines smarter in getting the jobs done more effectively and efficiently, causing less wastage and pollution. With the increasing machine intelligence, we also keep delegating roles from human to machines\u2014causing job loss as well. Despite the job loss, Industry 4.0 is vital for producing increasing outputs from depleting resources. ",

            "answer_text": "The main motive of industry 4.0 is to reduce cycle time by doing automation, that will increase your productivity.. connecting the machines with Internet. The machines shall interact with each other. Storing database in cloud. Managing large data with the aid of bigdata. Using augmented reality for maintenance and process optimization. Using tools like cyber twin, computer vision etc for monitoring the process. ",
