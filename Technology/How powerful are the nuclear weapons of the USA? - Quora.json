            "answer_text": "Plenty powerful enough to do the job they are deployed to perform. The atomic/nuclear weapons of today make the bombs dropped on Japan to end WWII look like toys. We are now speaking of thermonuclear weapons as opposed to atomic weapons. Hydrogen bombs are much more compact and more easily deliverable than the atom bombs of yesteryear. Today\u2019s weapon systems can deliver nuclear death with great accuracy and damage. Let\u2019s just pray that none of these weapons ever are put to use again. ",

            "answer_text": "Power is not the relevant issue for this discussion. The power of the nuclear weapons used in WW2 was ample for the need and the technology has increased since then. The real question involves precision, reliability and durability. In short, would the ordinance make its way to the intended targets in a time of need? Yes. No real doubt exists that the USA could and would deliver deadly ordinance on target sufficient to destroy any credible enemy - if needed. ",
