            "answer_text": "All The Leaks Found So Far:  Why Should You Wait For The New IPhone 12 And What News We Have About IPhone 12? Usually new iPhone models are coming in like a clockwork, but Apple itself has now said that the iPhone 12 series will not go on sale until a few weeks later than usual, which presumably means in October sometime. Indeed, the new release date leaked is in line with that, as Jon Prosser (a leaker with a mixed track record) said the iPhone 12 range would be released on Week beginning on October 12 (which may mean an announcement on Tuesday, October 13, because on Tuesday, Apple always reveals stuff) Apparently, pre-orders for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Max will then open in the same week-possibly on Friday, October 16, based on the past form from Apple. After that, on the week beginning on October 19 (probably meaning Friday, October 23), the phones apparently will ship. But obviously the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max will not be up for pre-order or ship until sometime in November. However, we would take these statements with a pinch of salt, particularly as Mark Gurman (a strong track record Apple leaker) replied with a thumb down emoji, indicating that Prosser was incorrect. Yeah, when are you going to get an iPhone 12? We really can't tell for sure. Apple 's statement isn't clear, and it might just be referring to when the phones go on sale. The majority of the reports seem to point to a one- to two-month wait, so October or November seems possible-though the phones could well be released before that. How Much Will The IPhone 12 Cost? The iPhone 12 price is something that leaks have made the release date a little clearer, and from what we hear it's likely to remain largely in line with the iPhone range for 2019. The iPhone 11 started at $699/ \u00a3729 / AU$1,199 for comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro begins at $999/$1,049 / AU$1,749 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099/$1,149 / AU$1,899 for comparison.There is no precise information about prices for the UK or Australia, but if the above information is correct, we would expect those to fall roughly in line with last year's versions. That's not to say the phones would cost too much more at launch, particularly because Apple appears to be cutting costs elsewhere, with the battery board reports being much cheaper than on the iPhone 11, and the phones might not be bundled with earbuds or a charging cable, but it may mean a price increase of some sort. In any case, as our guide states, you probably should wait for the iPhone 12 range to launch before purchasing any new iPhone. What Will The IPhone 12 Look Like? The architecture of the iPhone 12 looks expected to be a major change from the smartphone of Apple 's recent few generations. The iPhone 4 and the iPhone 5 remember? Reports say that the design of the iPhone 12 would be partly inspired by those models, and some elements of the iPad Pro 2020 are expected to be mixed in. Specifically, reliable leaks have indicated that the iPhone 12 would have a more flatter metal frame than the iPhone 11 series, with Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who's a very trusted source, being among those to say this. We have heard from Jon Prosser that the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Max will have aluminum frames and the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Max will have stainless steel frames, and that all four phones will have smaller notches than the iPhone 11 series.All that said, leaked renders which are more recent than most of the above display some major variations in design to earlier leaks, as you can see below. Also now Sonny Dickson (a leaker with a good track record) has shared with the iPhone 12 range dummy units that seem to be in line with this-as well as this- having flat edges, as speculated above. This can be seen here. That said, other credible sources tend to be skeptical about these leaks, particularly when it comes to the video, so we would take them with a pinch of salt. For now we would say the leaks and information are more likely to be right towards the top of this section.
