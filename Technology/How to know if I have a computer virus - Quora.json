            "answer_text": "Q: How do you check if my PC has a virus? Good question! It\u2019s important to keep your PC secure. Assuming your PC is running Windows (Mac and Linux users usually don\u2019t worry much about viruses) you have many options. One option is probably already on your PC - Microsoft Defender. Microsoft began including its anti-virus software with Windows Vista. Just look for Defender in your programs menu. Start the program, make sure its virus definitions are up to date, and run a scan on your computer. There are quite a few third-party programs for anti-virus and anti-malware detection, some free, and some that charge. My favorite combination of free software for several years has been AVG for anti-virus, Malwarebytes to detect and remove more obscure malware, and CCleaner to keep my PC free of unnecessary junk. My personal opinion is that the better free anti-virus programs do a fine job, so I don\u2019t often recommend a \u201cfor pay\u201d program such as Norton or McAfee. A further reason not to pay Norton or McAfee for a license, is that in the USA (where I live) most Internet service providers offer their customers a free subscription to Norton, McAfee, or other \u201cwell known\u201d anti-virus programs. Check your provider\u2019s web site for information. All of these programs are easy to use. Just follow the on-screen prompts. The programs also have built-in help, and online support. Good luck, and stay safe on the Wild Wild Web! ",

            "answer_text": "I see there are a couple of reasonable answers already, but I'll put in my two cents.  Antivirus products, in general, are great at catching known malware.  Some of them, like those with a cloud component, are even reasonably good at catching new malware, but antivirus is software, and it can increase your vulnerability to being hacked, just like any software.  See The Antivirus Hacker's Handbook: Joxean Koret, Elias Bachaalany: 9781119028758: Amazon.com: Books  for more detail there. To know if you have malware, you have to look for indicators.  You have to:  Look and see if processes running in memory are significantly larger than they should be or whether they have loaded shared libraries that shouldn't be present.Look and see if there are new files on disk that don't belong there, whether known good files have changed in size or modification time.Look and see if there is new traffic coming from your computer that is not normal.  If your computer is compromised, you may have to look at the traffic from another, known-good machine.Look and see if your computer configuration has changed and find out why.Learning to do all this takes time, and keeping track of all these details is challenging.   Even still, something may change 5 minutes from the moment you check or the next time you reboot your computer. This is why people prefer solutions like antivirus.  Even though it won't catch everything and it may increase your vulnerability at times, it is easier to rely on a reasonably good tool and trained antivirus researchers than to do all this yourself. tl;dr If you want to know if you have malware on your system, you can either: Get a good anti-virus, preferably one with a cloud component (although you should be aware you are giving the antivirus authors direct control of your machine) orLearn everything you can about the way your computer is supposed to work, then check to make sure it works that way, but be aware that this is a life-long journey.",
