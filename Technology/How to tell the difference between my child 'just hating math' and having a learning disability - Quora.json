            "answer_text": "You as a parent may not be able to tell if a child has a learning disability in math versus just hating it, but someone who is licensed and experienced in assessing learning disabilities will be in a better position to help you understand whether there is a likelihood (or not) of you child having a learning disability in mathematics, known as dyscalculia. Others with licenses, and experience with normed testing, may be able to tell, by pointing out strengths and weaknesses indicative of dyscalculia. Some psychologists specialize in diagnosing learning disabilities. These educational psychologists provide a battery of tests known as a 'psychological-educational evaluation' which typically includes IQ tests, achievement tests, and many others. There are no specific tests which 'show' that a child has dyscalculia.[1] This is only determined after a series of tests which can show deficits in maths ability and knowledge, i.e., s/he does not count or compute (addition and subtraction) or understand numerical relations -- and an evaluation of these deficits considered along with other abilities. Sometimes what looks like a learning disability can be attributable to a lack of appropriate instruction. Even if s/he is receiving the 'same' instruction as other kids in the class, if she is not understanding it or is not attentive during math classes and there is nobody or no way to redirect her to task, she is experiencing a lack of instruction. A really good psych-ed evaluation can figure out what she knows, what she does not know, and will suggest ways to remediate the lack of knowledge. If you get your child evaluated, you will at least understand the gaps in her knowledge and abilities, and will be able to find accommodations and have the school implement them (calculator, for example) to help her so that she understands the various maths concepts even if she cannot calculate them.[2] A written psych-ed report will go far during an IEP meeting if it is well written and includes accommodations needed for your child to access her curricula. To start the evaluation process write a letter to the school saying you suspect she may be having difficulties in math and that you would like her to be assessed with a complete psych-ed evaluation for a specific learning disability in addition to the overall ADD diagnosis. Dual diagnoses are more common that one would think, and in my experience as a parenting consultant and former staff attorney for the Education Advocacy Project at the Disability Rights Legal Center, dual diagnoses are often overlooked.[3] Homework should not be a hated thing causing tears and anxiety. Talk to the teacher and ask for recommendations. Also, an experienced 1:1 tutor or an educational therapist may be able to help. There is an organization of educational therapists; see whether you think an educational therapist could be helpful to your child and you. http://www.aetonline.org/EducationalTherapyDefined.html#Definition  [1] Dyscalculia- About Dyscalculia- The British Dyslexia Association [2] As a personal aside, I have dyscalculia and struggled through every math class, taking math classes during summer vacations so I would gain credits needed to graduate from college. Then I attended law school. And I still have dyscalculia. But I know the difference between larger and smaller, and was good at geometry when I could use a calculator, and I'm also good at logic. So understanding maths concepts will help in the future even while calculations are not possible. I figure people have different talents and skills. Mathematics is not one of mine! Knowing this, I was able to focus on reading, writing, history and conflict resolution. [3] There is an art to writing letters to schools. Rule Number 1: nothing you say is ever useful enough to your child. Instead, you want to write letters to create documentation. Keep a copy of everything you write. For more information about educational advocacy for your child, please see the nation's foremost education advocacy website, Wrightslaw Special Education Law and Advocacy. University of Virginia Law Professor Pete Write has learning disabilities and he began this website to help parents and students gain the education to which each student is entitled. ",

            "answer_text": "My first reaction to your question is to commend you for providing the support and guidance your daughter needs.  Doing homework together every night can become a big battle ground for children and their parents.  Congratulations for sticking with it and seeking more answers! There are two important areas to consider when looking at your question.  First, students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) can struggle in math due to the attention difficulties but not have a Learning Disability (LD).  ADD usually impacts working memory which is the ability to hold small pieces of information while manipulating that information to provide an answer.  Math calculations (ie., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are typically negatively impacted.  It becomes a very difficult and slippery slope to perform these simple math operations if working memory is impacted by ADD.  Second, ADD and LDs can also go hand in hand.  Sometimes they are like best friends that ride together and get into mischief!  Studies that consider how frequently ADD and LDs are found together range between 25 and 75 percent!  Therefore, there is a high likelihood that a student with ADD may also have a LD as well.   The complexity of identifying and diagnosing ADD and LDs requires a step by step approach, particularly if both are present.  If the ADD is diagnosed and treated (typically with medication) and the math difficulties continue, an assessment for a Math Disability would be warranted.  This is a very common progression for children who have both ADD and LDs.  Once the ADD is treated and the difficulties persist, an additional assessment is necessary to identify the presence of a LD.   Finding the right person to diagnose LDs can be difficult.  School divisions typically hire School Psychologists who specialize in the assessment and diagnosis of learning disabilities.  However, these systems are typically overwhelmed and may have long waiting lists.  Additional options would be a private assessment by a psychologist who specializes in learning disabilities.  These professionals can be found by contacting your provincial registry or state licensing office for Psychologist or School Psychologists. The importance of your efforts and support for your daughter cannot be overlooked.  It will be important to ensure that the homework battle doesn't overshadow positive interactions and positive experiences.  Students with ADD and/or LDs need support to find confidence in areas of achievement and to build confidence.  They typically have other areas of strength that can be overlooked because of the emphasis on academic achievement.  Paying close attention to other areas of success is crucial for building their identity as a student and young person. ",

Does she know how much change she should get if you give her five bucks for >insert desired object here<? Does she know how much allowance you owe her if you forget one week? Can she make a fair estimste of how many flowers there are in an orderly flower bed? In other words, can she actually do it if it is not a math problem (cue scary music)? This is the age that problems do begin to appear as kids on ramp to more complex kinds of learning. Accelerated learners often decelerate around this age as the other kids catch up and processing problems appear as the work gets more abstract. And in math it all gets less rote and there are more steps to remember and follow, and more options to remember as well -- a lot more if this then that kind of operations to learn. And of course word problems are a special kind of hell for kids with processing issues. Have you spoken to her teacher? Any thoughts from that quarter? And if I may ask, how do you feel about math? How was your own school experience with it? It seems to me that unless she is a child given to drama, nightly tears are a good indication that something needs to change in a hip and a hurry. I am not sure the options are limited to only two, but I would surely not like to see that state of affairs continue. ",

But meanwhile, she may be \"doing math\" without really being aware of it. I should think this might be so with her science, but otherwise one route of exploration is past times and games. Does she play Monopoly? Does she know how to make change and how to handle money? Does she engage in any activity which involves counting and keeping score? Maybe card games? If she does all these things with no problem, than what she might really hate is the abstraction of math as it appears on a sheet of paper, or in tricky \"word\" questions. And it is possible that she does have a deficit which refers not to some math defect in her noggin, but rather to more basic ways of handling information; the \"way she's wired.\" But the point now is to not to let the anticipated drudgery of math homework become a bone of contention between the two of you, such that she identifies YOU as a bearer of bad tidings. Thus I believe a consult and some professional analysis might be a good idea. You make the first move, and meanwhile assure your kid that you would much prefer to share good times with her than to ruin her life with a forced march through mathland. You sound like a good mommy, mommy. ",

This comes from a person who struggled with math in middle school - to the point when some tests could not be graded (all the answers were wrong). My parents choose to the shout-until-it's-done path - yes, some traumatic experiences for a youngster.Still, I made it through - with crying, and threats on a daily basis for several years. Recently, I went through that experience, and self-diagnosed myself (after the fact) with mild dyslexia. I suppose I grew out of it since then. If it is an option and there is a possibility of a proper diagnosis, you are better off making sure that it's nothing too serious, and perhaps just a passing phase.If not, please continue to be a supportive parent.
