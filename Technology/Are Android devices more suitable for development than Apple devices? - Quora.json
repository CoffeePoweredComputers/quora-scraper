            "answer_text": "It depends. Both Android and Apple have some advantages for development. The main advantage of Android is that it\u2019s open source. Not all of the OS is open source and several OEM use closed source modifications, but most of the time you can just google to find either the exact source code or a reference implementation for a specific API. This is very important for development and debugging. Another Android advantage is that you can build your development environment in Windows or Unix without any licenses, without spending a single dollar. Google doesn\u2019t mind people using other OS or 3rd party tools. It\u2019s possible to develop iOS apps for free, but it\u2019s not as straightforward as Android. On the other hand, Apple has the advantage that there is no need to test the app on dozens of different devices to make sure it\u2019s good for production. There are much less version specific and device specific bugs. Typically the revenue from commercial apps for Apple is higher than Android. ",
