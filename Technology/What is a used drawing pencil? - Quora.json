            "answer_text": "If I understand the question correctly, it could refer to a pencil, which has been \u201cused\u201d and is therefore no longer pristine and new. Even if it were used only once, it would still be a \u201cused\u201d pencil. We could also define a pencil, which has been \u201cused up\u201d. This means it has been used so many times, it is too short to use easily any longer. ",
