            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a great scope for AI and ML in India. My favourite part about it is that it can provide easy access to health and financial aid through the use of mobile application chat bots. Since most Indians already own mobile phones, but very few have access to basic amenities, it brings all the services to the tip of their finger. Beyond this, AI and ML will be doing most of the basic, admin tasks and while it would mean overall drop in rate of employment, it could also push for the government to bring about Universal Basic Income. As the money will be generated by organisations, the wealth can be distributed amongst the people. However, this also means that the government could come under the control of a company - which is very concerning. (If you like this answer, please hit follow!) ",
