            "answer_text": "PCB (printed circuit board) prototype, it's all about the blueprint or design of your PCB. You can make your PCB and manufacture it from a different PCB manufacturing company. There are so many software and so many aspects of designing a PCB. You can also design PCB and order it from the manufacturer. I suggest greatpcb; they provide PCB design, PCB assembly, and testing. ",

            "answer_text": "What is a PCB prototype? PCB prototyping is to manufacture a real board from the designed PCB, which is like a product test before mass production. In other words, after designing the PCB circuit, a small number of boards are produced. And in order to test the functional effects, various parameters are tested ( On account of verifying the design). ",
