            "answer_text": "Logically, if the drone flies out of range of the controller, it means that it cannot be controlled, it will fall from the sky, or lost. This used to be the case with older tech drones and some cheap drones of today. But modern drones, especially those manufactured by DJI (having 85% market share) have a feature that prevents this from happening. The modern drone has the home GPS position stored in the memory; it does so when it takes off. If the drone veers off course and outside the controller\u2019s WiFi zone, then the drone flyer gets an alert on the connected device (phone or tablet). At the same time, the drone attempts to retrace the path back till it finds the signal again. The drone also has the RTH or \u201cReturn to Home\u201d feature. This feature function is activated when: the flyer activates it manually from the controllerwhen the drone finds that battery level has gone down and the time/power required to return home may be insufficient.But these safety features are active only in the standard mode of flying - not in the \u2018Sports\u2019 mode. \u2018Sports\u2019 mode is total manual control mode. Even then controller will get a message that drone is out of range and then you must correct the problem yourself. Modern drones will not drop from the sky. When critical errors happen, the drone will attempt to land wherever they are in a safe fashion. All said and done, this fear is slightly hyped. As long as you fly safely (even in \u2018Sports\u2019 mode), there should not be an issue. But do check whether the drone has these safety features - otherwise the drone will fly way, will crash or will be lost. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on whether by \u201cCamera\u201d you literally mean a camera on a drone, or you\u2019re referring to the drone. You may get a mismatched range between the controller and the camera. Often the camera range is shorter than the drone range, but this can be the opposite also. If the camera range runs out before the drone loses range, then you\u2019ll lose video, but the drone will continue to fly. If you can see the drone, then you can fly it and hopefully fly it back into camera range. If you\u2019re wearing FPV goggles, this may be a problem. If you\u2019re talking about receive range ( Controller to Drone ) so that the drone no longer receives signals, then the outcome varies. Some drones will automatically return home. Others will return to radio contact range. Some won\u2019t let you go outside of this range to begin with. Less complicated drones will simply lose control - they may descend to a slow-landing, or may crash down - some could even lose motor power. There\u2019s no single response common to all drones. If you\u2019re worried about this, then best to look for a return-to-base drone, that has the capability to fly itself back to the start position. Usually this is fairly basic - the drone will climb to a pre-set \u201csafe\u201d height, then it will return to the position it started from and enter landing mode. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the drone. The professional drones (the ones that are more expensive) have a fly back home option. The way it works is as follows: Before takeoff the drone/operator save the gps coordinates of \u201chome base\u201d. This is basically where the operator is.In the drone controller/app you set the settings of what the drone should do if it goes out of range or loses signal. Depending on the location you set it so it climbs to a designated altitude as to avoid any obstacles that might be in the way.The drone climbs and then flies straight back towards home base.When the drone comes back in range the operator can take control again and continue flying. If for some reason the operator can't take control (remote runs out of power) the drone will continue and will land pretty much in the same spot it took off.Not all drones have this option/capability.

Depending on the brand/model/company what may happen varies greatly. The worst would lag, lose signal, then drop out of the sky. The next tier of drone may begin to lag then lose signal and hover until a; it is found, or b; the battery dies. The next tier may stop then backtrack until signal is regained. The nicest drones have the return to home feature, they would use their GPS or gyroscope to begin to go to the last known signal location, others may backtrack then once signal is regained return to the owner.
