            "answer_text": "Yeah of course as there are no taxes. However if you buy tv then for personal use within UAE it's good but for taking to home country then after paying the taxes there might not be much difference in price. Buying apple products itself if you compare you will major price difference between UAE and other countries. However from 1st Jan 2018 taxes will be implemented then have to see how much will you be benefited pricewise and then can go for buying the electronic item. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing more to answer as others have said earlier.  In general pricing in India is cheaper, except for TV's - unfortunately now Indian customs are slapping a heavy duty on imported TV sets. Whereas many stores in Dubai do list their popular electronics be it mobile or any other items prices are found on their website. You can actually compare this with your local market price for the same models. (e.g. Carrefour Webstore; Sharaf DG; EMax etc). On a given day any item could be cheaper here or in India, difficult to tell. Be aware some of the items like phones with keypads are designed for local market - in that sense you will find Arabic alphabets or numbers - which may be not preferred by many non Arabs but you have add on apps like extension for different languages as well.  Thanks.  ",

But only of you buy from the wholesale market that generally exports to Russia, Iran amd alot of Africa This is espwcially true if you are going to use it in another country and dont need warranty. The only issue is travelling into the market and parking. Its quite crowded and traffic is bad to and from there. However there are a few wholesalers that also do retail and will deliver to your hotel if you place an order with them, one such company is Ashraf Electronics. You can call them on 04-2552015 or email purchasing@ashrafelectronics.com ",

Now: 10\u201315%. Hardly worth the effort, let alone the cost. Electronics retail has become very competitive in Europe due to easy internet price comparisons. In general I think the era of shopping arbitrage is over\u2026!! I am an economist so am very interested in hearing from people who disagree and why. ",

Some warehouse sales for gadgets also provide bargain deals. Price differential is particularly high in case of TVs and cameras, and almost zero in smartphones and tablets.
