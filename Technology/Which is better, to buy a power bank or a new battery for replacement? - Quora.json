            "answer_text": "It's always better to replace your battery with original one. Because using the power bank to recharge your phone is not at all a good option compared to replacing the battery. Power banks are designed to charge your phone in the case of emergency as a backup power supply. Power banks should not be used to charge your phone daily, as power banks charge your phone with either 1A or 2A maximum current. But your phone may need 1.5A etc. Low quality power banks use low quality or recycled Li-ion batteries which lasts for few days. The charging circuit in some of the low quality power banks are not able to provide even 1A current. This damages the battery as our phone needs high current when the battery is too low. You can check this by installing an app called ampere which shows the current consumption in real-time. The current is an entity decided by the load resistance. If the current required is high and supply is low it may damage the supplier such as charger or power bank. In summery I suggest you to replace the battery and use the power bank only in emergency conditions where you don't get ac power ports. ",
