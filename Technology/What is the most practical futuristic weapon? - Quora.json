            "answer_text": "I think that the most promising practical future weapons are going to be non-visible spectrum lasers. The problem with most future weapons is that they are all energy based, not gunpowder based. The major problem with any weapon that\u2019s energy based is the energy. On a vehicle, you can draw that energy from the vehicle\u2019s main engine, or even a secondary generator if necessary. As a foot soldier, you\u2019ll likely be relying on batteries, and batteries still suck, and likely always will. (Although I will admit that they suck less than they did even 10 years ago.) So, you might get that laser sniper weapon, since you only really need a limited number of shots, but it\u2019s very unlikely to be a main battle weapon, such as a replacement for an M-16 or AK-47. Tank weapons, though maybe not replacing the main gun at first, other turreted weapons in lighter vehicles, like the JLTV and the HMMVW, and so on, can be replaced with directed energy weapons, I just think that the laser technology is coming along a lot faster at the moment than the technology for rail guns, coil guns, microwave, or particle beam weapons. Rail guns will very likely do quite well on frigates, destroyers, and cruisers, since they have the capacity for great big power generators to sling those huge weights long distances, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll work anywhere else for quite some time. Another place laser weapons might find use is as emplaced crew served weapons. If you\u2019ve got a base that will need defense, and you\u2019re currently using M2 emplacements, and towers with heavy machine gun mounts, many of those could be replaced with laser weapons with power cables running off to a generator further behind the lines, or even just semi-buried just over that a way. The real question will come down to \u201cIn what situations are they more useful/powerful/\u201dprovide tactical advantages\u201d that overcome their disadvantages, and is that advantage/disadvantage ratio higher than it is for gunpowder weapons?\u201d Only time and specific implementation will really tell that tale, sadly.
