            "answer_text": "SSDs do not make a computer run faster. Instead, they make a computer feel \"snappier\". In very specific circumstances they may also make it complete tasks faster, and we'll look at that. But the thing is, the CPU runs at the same speed, the memory is no faster and the programs run just like before. The reason why the computer feels faster is because software loads a lot more quickly than with HDDs. That is, when you start a PC, Windows and other software needed for the PC's operation is copied much more quickly into memory and the computer is ready much quicker. When you start up an application, the required files are likewise copied into memory in a fraction of the time it would have taken with an HDD. Reading user data (e.g. documents) or saving them is also a lot faster, but the impact is rarely felt since they tend to be small amounts. And here's the thing. What we notice is not so much how fast a computer is, but rather how long we need to wait. Whether Word is running around in circles or plodding along is invisible to us as long as there's no perceptible delay between keystrokes. But when you start your pc you need to wait for a minute, maybe two, so shortening that delay to ten or twenty seconds is very noticeable. When you start a program and it takes ten seconds to get ready, that is ten seconds of you sitting in front of the screen twiddling your thumbs. If it takes only a second to start up the software, you really notice the difference! The one exception to all this is in disc intensive operations. If you're copying a lot of data, working on a large database or doing some serious data analysis then the software has to wait a lot less for the drive to finish doing its thing and the entire operation takes less time to complete and in this case you could say that \"the computer runs faster\".

            "answer_text": "For some tasks, definitely, for others not so much. The SSD is just a faster storage device. I.e. it makes opening programs, opening files, saving files, go quicker. I.e. whenever something is read or written on permanent storage, a SSD makes that process go faster than a HDD would. But for stuff not actually saving or reading the drive, it makes no difference. E.g. downloading some file from the internet is governed by how fast your internet connection is - little to no influence from your storage device. Or calculating statistics from a set of data in RAM is not reading or writing anything on the storage so the SSD isn\u2019t even used. But for most people, at least some of their tasks means they perform some reads and writes on the storage device. These times can be reduced by making that storage device faster, and a SSD is one alternative over a HDD which does exactly that. How much your specific tasks rely on reading / writing such storage varies greatly by the exact programs you\u2019re running. So the speedup could be enormous or hardly noticeable, or any variation in between. For most people they see a benefit of the entire operating system booting quicker, and starting programs quicker. But thereafter not a lot of difference. For someone running a database program there could be an enormous increase in speed overall, while for someone just playing a game which doesn\u2019t need to load several files over and over again they\u2019d hardly see any difference whatsoever after starting the game.
