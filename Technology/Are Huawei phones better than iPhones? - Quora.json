            "answer_text": "Well, I have used both, let's see\u2026.. Price, MUCH better. The best that Huawei can offer is the P30 Pro, which costs 8990 Norwegian kr. The best that Apple can offer is the iPhone 11 Pro, which costs 16000 Norwegian kr. The phones are pretty much identical, though Apple may have tiny miscellaneous advantages. Any options to chop down the price? Huawei can offer you the P30 Lite, which will cut down battery power by 25, RAM from 8 to 6 GB, but lowers price to 2990 Norwegian kr, which is 30% of a Pro. Yes, I bought the Lite, and there are some problems, which are understandable since It\u2019s cheap and should be worse. Huawei loses a big aspect to Apple, which is device capacity. Some games on Huawei are limited to 30 FPS, which is quite a bummer. The iPhones takes the crown, as they can offer 60FPS on almost everything. But, this is a hollow victory, as games will add 60 FPS to more devices, so sooner or later, Huawei will also gain 60 FPS, and this advantage will be gone. Another notch Huawei seizes is Battery capacity. (To make a fair fight, I\u2019m comparing the iPhone X to the P30 Lite, as I couldn\u2019t dig up capacity for the 11 yet.) The XR packs 2900 milliamps The Lite packs 3300 milliamps. They are quite the same, but Huawei has the edge. Wait, I found the iPhone 11 Pro capacity. Let\u2019s do the proper comparison! The 11 Pro packs 3900 milliamps The P30 Pro packs 4200 milliamps. Thumbs up, both Apple and Huawei, that was a quite large improvement from one development! Again, they are quite similar, but Huawei has the edge. Another important aspect is storage, and it\u2019s\u2026\u2026.a mixed bag. It\u2019s in Apple\u2019s favor if you wanna toss money around, and in Huawei\u2019s, if you need a cheap phone. Apple starts at 32 GB and 64 GB and ends at an Impressive 512 GB Huawei starts at 64 GB and ends at 256 GB. The P20 Lite has the lowest at 64 GB, but then, they are priced nearly the same (P30 Lite is 400 kr more expensive) as a P30 lite, so why not get the newer? So, if you are a rich son of the mayor, and need a humongous storage, the iPhones are the better, but if you are a college student scraping together money for a phone, the Huawei phones are better. Theoretically, Huawei is better, but they won\u2019t gain much more former iPhone users unless Apple tragically fails them, or gets obviously behind on quality, which I honestly don\u2019t think will happen. If I had mistaken anything, do please tell me. ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion is yes. 100%. Here\u2019s why: Price: I always start with price, because that is simply the worst simple thing about iphones. Iphones are actually terrific phones, the problem is, they can never (and have never been able to) justify it\u2019s status giving price. Huawei phones are always better priced than iphones, even if huawei\u2019s latest flagships have also been expensive devices.New technologies. You always see huawei implement new technoloogies in their phones, trying to innovate and offer new things. Apple does almost never do it. Apple is rather slow while implementing new technologies, they don\u2019t try, they wait for others to test it and then introduce it.The wide variety: If you want an iphone, you either have to spend somewhere around the 1000 USD or settle for an older device. Nobody should spend so much on a phone and nobody should buy a phone that is over 4 years old. (Look at how many people still buy the terribly slow iphone 6 from 2014 just for the sake of having an iphone). Huawei on the other hand has a phone for every budget, current phone, with newer specs and software.Staying in the variety: With iphone you have 3 phones (finally, they used to be just one). So you have the big one, the smaller one or the cheaper one. That\u2019s it. With huawei\u2019s many many options you can find the one that suits you best.I will leave it at that. There are so many many reasons why huawei and many brands are infinitely better than apple. But those for another time. ",

I\u2019m not a fan of any of the them, or any other manufactures or software house. What I can do is find the logical behind the way this two companies are managed and the core industrial strategy behind them. Please disregard any answer that\u2019s to aggressively in defense of one or the other and never mind the childish persecution of Huawei by the USA administration. I suppose everybody can understand what\u2019s behind this absurd claims (Apple also makes their phones in China). Both manufacturers are week established ones, with very good products. The advantage Apple has is the fax they developed a system, rather then just the hardware. They are able to perfect the fusion between software and hardware in a way that no other manufacturer can. The develop and test the bonding of the os with the equipments close to perfection. They are surely not the most innovative or revolutionary but what they implement normally becomes the industry standard regarding that same implementation. They are not in \u201c\u201cthe lead\u201d, they do not take many risks and they are have a very well thought off marketing strategy that\u2019s been working for them, for ages. One additional point is the fact that they have a all ecosystem that involves softwares and all the hardware you use for work and leisure everyday, in a very integrated and easy way. They have MacBooks, imacs, iPads (and this is a implementation nobody could even get close to), iPhone, Apple Watch etc. Huawei (and all of there competitors) don\u2019t have that (yet). They still rely on third party software and have to implant adaptation measures, filling the phones with bloatwate). Huawei makes great phones, with amazing cameras and good battery life. They are very good quality and if you don\u2019t mind all that\u2019s said above, and is not inside apples ecosystem, you cannot to wrong with Huawei. Apple and iPhones are just a world apart, not in terms of sheer quality or \u201c\u201cbetter of worse\u201d, just very different. Ps: do you think Huawei could release a phone that\u2019s 4/ 5 year old design and make it a sales success (iPhone SE 2)? No! It\u2019s just another dimension of the same industry. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of tech innovation, Huawei has come from behind to beat Apple.  Huawei launched its new big-screen flagship smartphone series, the Mate 30, in Berlin on Thursday. During the launch, the Chinese phone-maker bashed U.S. rival Apple for copying its iconic \"bathroom heater-shaped\" rear camera module on the Mate 20 series, and introduced a new round design which looks more like a standalone camera. In CGTN's Mate 20 X 5G review, we mentioned the possibility that iPhone 11's camera module design was inspired by Huawei. Watch the full review here and find out why the Mate 20 X still matters. The iPhone 11 series not only has a similar camera module to Mate 20, but an identical triple-camera setup: Main, telephoto and wide-angle cameras. Huawei claimed in 2018 they were the first to bring such a setup to a smartphone. The Mate 30 series In addition to the leaked information reported on Wednesday, Huawei revealed more details about the series. Screen: The Mate 30 Pro has a 6.53-inch screen with 88-degree double-curved edges. Huawei calls the design \"Flex OLED,\" though it's more commonly known as \"waterfall.\" The screen of Mate 30 is bigger than Mate 30 Pro, at 6.62 inches. Besides using it to replace the volume rockers, Huawei said it also added a camera shutter button on the edge, making it easier for users to take photos with one hand. Weight: The Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro both weigh a little under 200 grams, about 88 percent of the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Yet Huawei's consumer product CEO Richard Yu said the Mate 30 has a longer battery life than Apple's product. Color options: In addition to traditional black, silver, purple and green, Huawei also added two \"vegan leather\" options. The green and orange leather will not break as easily as glass and is more skin-friendly. Chip: The Kirin 990 5G chip has already been made known to the public. Yu said the 5G version of the Mate 30 Pro can make use of the 5G network around the world, unlike Samsung's limited 5G capacity or iPhone 11's complete lack of 5G. Charging: Contrary to leaked information, the Mate 30 only supports 27 watt wireless charge, but the Mate 30 Pro can be charged wirelessly at a speed of 40 watts. Huawei also built in-car wired/wireless chargers for car owners to enjoy faster charging time. Camera: Huawei upgraded the triple-camera set to enable a 45-time zoom, from 30 in the P30 series. They also imported P30's RYYB sensor to the Mate series to let in more light in dark places. The sensor size is \"137 percent\" larger than the iPhone 11 Pro Max, according to Yu. The Mate 30 Pro takes one step further with higher specifications. Check the picture below for details. These enable the Mate 30 Pro to use night-shot and HDR functions on the wide-angle camera.  On the video side, Huawei said they have reached the \"world's highest video light sensitivity on smartphone.\" Bokeh video can also be taken with the faster sensor and CPU. Huawei even challenged the GoPro on extreme sport videography. Source:Huawei bashes Apple for copying camera module design at Mate 30 launch ",

            "answer_text": "It is highly subjective, but if you take face-value alone, see for yourself: The iPhone XS-Max with 512GB storage (the best iPhone available) retails in the UK for \u00a31,449. It has two cameras, with 2x optical zoom, at best at 12 megapixels, 6 CPU cores, 4GB RAM and a 3174mAh battery and a 6.5\u2033 OLED 1242 x 2688 screenA Huawei P30 Pro with 512GB storage (arguably the best phone available) retails in the UK for \u00a31,094. It has three cameras, with 5x optical zoom, at best 40 megapixels, an 8-core CPU, 8GB RAM and a 4200mAh battery, 6.47\u2033 OLED 1080 x 2340 screenThe iPhone has half the RAM, 75% the battery capacity of the Huawei, and the Huawei camera setup is MILES better than anything else on the market, yet the iPhone is nearly 40% more expensive. Both the above phones are furiously fast, and the battery would easily last more than 24 hours in all cases, as you would expect for a top-of-the-line phone, but you get better bang-for-buck with the Huawei. Having owned and used devices from Apple, Samsung and Huawei, I can categorically state that my P20 Pro (last year\u2019s model) is the best phone I have ever owned in almost every respect. The photos are breathtaking, the device NEVER slows down, and the battery reliably lasts more than 24 hours even with heavy use, and I have 80+ apps installed. I tried an iPhone for 6 months last year, and though it was fast, I was constantly frustrated by the poor usability and the lack of innovation. See my other post Are Samsung phones really as good as iPhones?. I suggest most new phones are good, so go with what you know (and can afford) unless you are prepared for the pain of switching and trying to migrate all your stuff across!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I have been an iPhone user for almost 6 years. My favorite phone (that I currently have) is the iPhone SE. I even find the iPhone 7 a little too large to easily hold in one hand and use comfortably. Once Apple discontinued the 3.5-inch screen size with iPhone SE and replaced the whole batch of iPhones with outrageously expensive models, I was so pissed that I started looking for an Android phone. There were no compact smartphones with 3.5 to 4-inch display sizes anymore and I purchased a Mi A2 Lite (that costs about 1/10th of the cost of an iPhone XS) with AndroidOne installed in it. The phone I tested at the shop was running Android version 8. After I purchased, I upgraded it to version 9. After the update, the phone started experiencing some lags while scrolling. Besides, Android doesn\u2019t give the feeling that iOS gives. I can\u2019t explain it well but there is something either wrong or missing. The Android settings are far more complicated than iOS. There are more features but they are complicated to set and for the first few days, you may not get them right. Your phone may not come out of the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode or may vibrate while it is supposed to ring only. I was thinking that AnroidOne, which is the purest form of Android, would be better than some third party user interfaces (UIs) developed by the phone makers. I might have been mistaken. UIs developed by smartphone manufacturers for Android may actually give a better user experience but I recommend you to read all comments before you proceed with buying one. Because some users say those UIs don\u2019t get as many updates as AndroidOne gets. So, you should definitely study before buying an Android. You have asked if you should get an iPhone or a Huawei but the answer I gave was all about the operating systems. In terms of hardware, you can\u2019t go wrong with Huawei or Samsung. I tested many phones before I decided to buy this very affordable Mi A2 Lite and they were all great pieces of hardware. Even this Mi A2 Lite has 3-day battery life with a 5.84-inch screen. Now I use it as my Netflix remote at home and I do some browsing on it and its great. I charge once a week. Under daylight, it takes better photos than my iPhone SE. But iOS gives me a smoother user experience in my daily life. That\u2019s why I replaced my iPhone SE\u2019s battery and I am back on it. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a subjective topic but as per current scenario iPhone is better placed than Huawei and there are so many reasons for that: Huawei is a Chinese company and iPhone is an American company and as per country laws, iPhone doesn't share any private data with any government body whereas all the Chinese companies are supposed to share whatever data government of China asks them to.China secretly uses its companies to spy on other people and country, so reliability issue will always be there.iPhones are more secure than Huawei phones but if you want an android phone then there are other alternatives to Huawei like Samsung, LG, Asus, Google Pixel and Sony.If budget or features are your concern then Android phones are cheaper than an iPhone. Recently Apple came up with a new phone which is quite similar to iPhone 8 but it comes with the latest hardware like new camera sensor, new chip, more ram and its name is iPhone SE 2 or 2020. It'll still cost you somewhere around $564 or \u20b942,500. There are so many Android phones that come cheaper than iPhone SE like: Samsung Galaxy A10s - $119.2 or \u20b98,989Samsung Galaxy M21 - $168.6 or \u20b912,699Samsung Galaxy M30 - $172.5 or \u20b912,999Samsung Galaxy M30s - $199.1 or \u20b914,999Samsung Galaxy M31 - $212.3 or \u20b915,999Samsung Galaxy M40 - $239 or \u20b917,999Yes, they all are Samsung midrange smartphones but the best things about them are they come with a super AMOLED screen, 15/18 Watt Fast Charger, at least 4000 mAH battery, triple or quad-camera setup and on top of that with their new One UI 2.0 which runs on Android 10.

First of all, the battery life is far superior, she needs to start charging her phone around 2\u20133pm at the office, my Huawei can get through the entire day without a top up. My call count is on average 185 per day. Plus what's app groups and messages, plus \u00e9 mails. Very hectic, but the device handles all this activity at great speed and with ease. The I phone XS is definitely noticeably slower when multitasking. One disappointing feature that Android 9 (Pie), brings is that call recordings are now disallowed. Its an important feature for business to be able to have back up conversational evidence. The I phone has never allowed call recording. In summary, I would choose the Huawei above the I phone. ",

If your looking at spec quality (camera, display, etc) then Huawei does a better job. Their camera uses Red,Yellow,and Blue while iPhones use Red,Green,Blue. This allows the Huawei to do 40% better in low-light. And Huawei\u2019s display is slightly better. But you have to consider the price, the P30 is about the price of a S10 in China, but a iPhone can be hundreds more expensive. ",

I own an XR and I\u2019ve never had to charge it during the day even after extremely heavy use. I\u2019m still amazed by it. iPhones are quick. iPhones are generally more secure. The App Store is a lot safer than Google Play. This is because of Apples strict control over it. Some people have a gripe with this and I\u2019m not sure why. Support and updates for iPhones go well beyond any other manufacturer. You could receive updates for up to 5 years. iPhone apps generally tend to be better than their android equivalent. Although this gap is reducing. iPhones do cost more initially. But when you consider the support. Long life and resale value is greater. It can make more economic sense. So I\u2019d say go for an iPhone. If you must have Android though. Pick Samsung or a Google Pixel. ",

If I lived in certain countries or travelled across borders this would be a big plus. Resale - Apple has a known resale. App Store - apps that are not buggy. Apple often repairs stuff long out of warrantee. Example iPhone 6, Apple just announced they will do a out of warrantee fix. Apple has a history of supporting their phones for years. July 22, 2019 they released 9.3.6 and 10 something for almost pre-historic iPhones. Consumers reports (which I do not trust) just rated the iPhone as the best phone. And many of my friends have them and we often help each other. Apple phones come with a lot of free usable software. There is enough there so you will never have to buy anything else. repair parts available for years. My iPad got dropped. Smashed. They did not repair it. They gave me a brand new one. And then there is the Apple Store. I have a friend who I think would live there if they had beds. ",

They also have expandable memory which is a must for me (though the Mate series uses a proprietary card, which is a very bad move, non standard accessories always are) Honor View 10,Mate 10, mate 10 Pro, magic 2,honor play etc etc they have an excellent phone for every need. I regard Huwaei as the best phone manufacturers on the market (Samsung now being too expensive) Apple make phones that are very highly priced, totally restrictive (can't replace the Launcher, expand the memory, tinker generally) but are part of a larger Apple ecosystem. If you like Android and the ability to tweak everything about your phone, Huwaei is a very good choice. If you have a lot of Apple gear or like the image and have cash to spare, buy an iPhone. ",
