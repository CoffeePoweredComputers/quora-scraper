That would be 6,720lbs by a legend named Paul Anderson, and the lift is the back lift.  The man himself. Note, this is not the back lift. The back lift is depicted below:  This is not Paul, this is just a picture I took from Google. Paul has many other feats of strength that are absolutely nuts, read up on him, you won\u2019t be disappointed! ",
