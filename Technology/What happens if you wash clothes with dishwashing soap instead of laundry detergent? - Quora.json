            "answer_text": "Dishwashing soap has lots of suds, they are very hard to rinse out of clothes. There could be so much suds a washing machine pump could overheat. At the very least the suds are going to push out of the machine and make a mess, and you'll probably have to run at least one extra rinse, but most likely two. If you are washing by hand or treating grease stains it isn't much of a problem but adding a similar amount of dishwashing detergent as you would laundry detergent, is a bad idea. If you are talking dishwasher detergent, that has bleach in it and that can damage clothes. And both those substitutions are considerably more expensive than laundry detergent. Be careful. ",

Believe it or not it\u2019s better to use something other than dishwashing soap . Even Lysol,floor cleaner is better to sue than dish soap . Also dish soap can leave white spots on you clothing . I ruined a load of black ski clothing when in another country as there was laundry detergent with the condo but there was a washer and dryer . I used dish soap and I needed up with bleach spots all over my black ski clothes . If you do use dish soap which I often do with hand washable in the sink then make sure it is completely diluted with a water before adding your clothing . ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming that you are using a washing machine, you will over-fill the washing machine with suds. Suds will spill out from under the lid onto the floor. Possibly there will be enough to reach the active components of the equipment and cause damage. Because we watch it while it works, dish-washing liquid is intentionally very sudsy in order to give the perception that it is still working. The suds indicate there is soap still working even though the water might not be clean any more. Under the lid of the washing machine there is no need for a visual indicator, so the soap does not need to create lots of suds to indicate it is still working. Laundry soap is designed for low suds because the machine cannot efficiently remove suds with its pump. ",
