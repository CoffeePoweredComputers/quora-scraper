            "answer_text": "The wavelength of light at the red end of the spectrum is around 700nm. Sony already has a 48 megapixel camera sensor for smartphones with 800nm pixels. So this is about the limit -- you can't go smaller without affecting color sensitivity. That's really too small anyway. A camera built from such a sensor will be diffraction limited below about f/1.3. The fastest lens right now on a smartphone is the f/1.5 lens on some of the Samsungs. They took enough of a sharpness hit on that lens anyway that those recent phones also have an f/2.4 aperture, the only regular phone with even two aperture settings. I can't imagine f/1.3 would be any better given tiny phone physics. These sensors use quad Bayer color filters to offer both 48 megapixel and 12 megapixel shooting modes, so getting a true 48 megapixels is probably not that important. The other use of such resolution is delivering a digital zoom that can stay at 12 megapixels withough geeting pixelated. You still have 12 megapixels at a 2x crop. Very few professionals have any use for 48 megapixels of resolution, about as high as high-end full frame cameras currently get. Of course, professional cameras have much larger sensors, so there is plenty of room to scale down if more resolution is needed in larger sensors -- companies do target higher resolution as a competitive point. But you are ultimately trading off sensitivity for resolution, even in a large sensor. Maybe full frames hit 100 megapixels, but they are not going to push against this limit. ",

            "answer_text": "Pixel size ranges from 1.1 microns in the smallest smartphone sensor, to 8.4 microns in a Full-Frame sensor. As an example, the 8 megapixel sensor above has a resolution of 3,264 x 2,448 pixels, with 327,184 pixels in an area just 1mm x 1mm in size. Simply stated, pixels capture light and turn it into data. ... All pixels collect the same amount of noise, but larger pixels collect more of the \u201cgood\u201d data than smaller pixels. With all else equal, a larger pixel will result in a higher quality image (less noise) than a smaller one. Why More Megapixels Is Better The higher the megapixel count on a camera sensor, the greater amount of detail that can be captured in a picture. For instance, a 6MP sensor captures roughly fifty percent more detail in an image than a 4MP sensor and double what a 3MP sensor has and four times that of a 1.5MP sensor.
