Maybe play a board game or something outside.. maybe get him a lego set.. get him in a sport\u2026 But dont force him, just make it sound really fun and maybe use reverse psychology lol And if that doesnt work. Use your tough love and Turn it off/take it away till he starts having other fun which will bound to happen some time or another after. Just let him know your doing it because you love him and its for his own good lol (As long as you have something else for him to do of course\u2026 something he would like! GIVE OPTIONS) ",
