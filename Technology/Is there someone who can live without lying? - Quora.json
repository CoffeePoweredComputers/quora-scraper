            "answer_text": "Yes. In fact, living an honest life, without lies will help reduce anxiety, stress, and other problems in whatever form they take. A person who does not lie will have a reputation and a specific set of personality qualities that many people just don't have. The sad thing is, most people lie. Many people lie daily. Some even fabricate false lives for whatever reason (guys usually to attract a girl, sleep with her, and when the lie falls apart, dumps her for a newer younger girl)(women from what I have seen, lie to their \u201cfriends\u201d because it is a social standing game. Lie to the guy they are with to either milk them or get a easy route in life). Most people in our world lie, regardless of income, social standing, sex, or age. If you find someone who truly doesn't lie, you will notice that they are responsible and upfront about the situation. They will gauge a situation and deal with it. They will not let things be, and they tend to act if an injustice is happening. Because they don't lie, they accept life as is, and live their life, with honesty as the best policy. Finally, honest people gain people's long lasting trust, which obviously, the biggest companies in the world are built on trust between the customer and the brand. If you can live an honest life, do so. If you feel like you are missing out on many things, know that many things are really not worth the effort since they have hidden pitfalls. Here is an honest truth for you, \u201cPeople bring about their own misery\u201d if you don't understand this saying, I would suggest you to get to know yourself better in full honesty thru raw unbiased introspection. Hope this answers your question. Good luck, God bless. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody can live without telling lies . It is just another side of truth : another side of the coin . The two sides of the coin must exist together ; one side can't exist without the other. It is like light and dark , white and black , sunshine and clouds , life and death . The existence of the other side is recognised only when the positive side is given primacy . Darkness is realised only in relation to the light. Black is contrasted only with white . Death is feared only when one is bubbling with life . You have to analyse ' lie ' in that context .So long ' truth' is there , ' lie' must exist . When ' lie ' dies , truth looses its significance, its primacy , its value, its weightage . That's why those who speak the truth is venerated with such reverence . But ordinary people can't live like a saint . They have to be practical . And therefore they have to take recourse to occasional falsehood . But falsehood for what ? It must not be self - deceiving , self - destructive . If you don't understand a subject in the class, you must have the courage to admit it ; otherwise you never learn . If you are addicted to drugs , you must admit it before the doctor ; otherwise how can he cure you ? But in order to come out of a tricky situation , all of us tell lies ; but these are white lies , though children shouldn't be encouraged to adopt such tactic . But we should never take recourse of falsehood when it has direct bearing on our future life . ",
