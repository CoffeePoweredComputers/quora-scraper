            "answer_text": "Need? Maybe not. The better question is whether humans will still find a need to do math. One area that has long interested me is the unfortunate \u201crediscovery\u201d of already long-established theory, simply because of terminology differences and the the sad tendency of academics to be excessively cliquish. Once developed, papers on rarified subjects are often indecipherable to folks coming upon them from other disciplines. This causes a huge amount of unnecessary reinvestment of effort. A time-lapse photo of an equivalent phenomenon is the ceaseless hammering of waves on the same beach, only to see the tide go out and the subject matter fall out of favored popular interest. Fifty years later another academic finds an unrelated problem in another discipline which leads back into the same methodology, but without a continuity of practice the original grounding is lost. Some subjects have been lost and found four or five times over. I\u2019ve no doubt that simply relinquishing control of academic pursuit of mathematics to clever computer tool-sets will only make this problem worse, not better. ",

Most would think that you are crazy for even asking the question. Without mathematics none of that would be possible. Humankind will continue to push forward. Every new thing there\u2019s always gonna be someone who will say \u201cthat\u2019s silly, I don\u2019t need that\u201d. But a lot of people will and it is likely to soon be taken for granted that one can buy it. ",
