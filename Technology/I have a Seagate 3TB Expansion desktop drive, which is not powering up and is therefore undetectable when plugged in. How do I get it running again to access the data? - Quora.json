            "answer_text": "It\u2019s likely the control board inside the external hard drive went on you and the disk is not getting any power. You would have to take it out of the enclosure and place it into another enclosure that you can buy on the shelves for relatively cheap. Or if you particularly don\u2019t care about having an enclosure (of course this means you have other means of protecting the disk from ESD and shock for when you are taking it with you) you can always get those SATA to USB interface adapters, which most will come with a power adapter.

            "answer_text": "You can try to take it out of the enclosure and connect it via sata cable or USB sata dock. It's always important to consider the possible causes: power surge, if it was dropped, faulty power cable. These will help determine the best course of action (including contacting a professional) depending on the value of the data. If you try the above and still no power then you have a hardware failure.
