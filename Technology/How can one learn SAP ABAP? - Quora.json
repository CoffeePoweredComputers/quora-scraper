            "answer_text": "ABAP is one of the many application-specific fourth-generation languages first developed in the 1980s. It was originally the report language for SAP R/2, a platform that enabled large corporations to build mainframe business applications for materials management and financial and management accounting. ABAP used to be an abbreviation of Allgemeiner BerichtsAufbereitungsProzessor, German for \"generic report preparation processor\", but was later renamed to the English Advanced Business Application Programming. ABAP was one of the first languages to include the concept of Logical Databases (LDBs), which provides a high level of abstraction from the basic database level(s). The ABAP language was originally used by developers to develop the SAP R/3 platform. It was also intended to be used by SAP customers to enhance SAP applications \u2013 customers can develop custom reports and interfaces with ABAP programming. The language was geared towards more technical customers with programming experience. ABAP remains as the language for creating programs for the client-server R/3 system, which SAP first released in 1992. As computer hardware evolved through the 1990s, more and more of SAP's applications and systems were written in ABAP. By 2001, all but the most basic functions were written in ABAP. In 1999, SAP released an object-oriented extension to ABAP called ABAP Objects, along with R/3 release 4.6. SAP's current development platform NetWeaver supports both ABAP and Java. ABAP has an abstraction between the business applications, the operating system and database. This ensures that applications do not depend directly upon a specific server or database platform and can easily be ported from one platform to another.

            "answer_text": "Learning SAP ABAP is incomplete without actually practicing it. If you are serious about learning ABAP and foreseeing it as a possible career option, then better join a full time class room course with an institute. This way you apply the subject information on the very same day of learning and hence gains subject understanding. Moreover they will support you with preparing for SAP ABAP certification and in some cases will assist you with a job placement. If you want to explore SAP as one of the career options, but not fully sure about it, then try joining an online course on ABAP (the cost of online training in online mode is less compare to class room time mode). Here I am not sure if you will get full time support on the subject but indeed your doubts and queries will be addressed. You will also system availability for hands-on for a define period. There will be hardly any assistance for Job placement. If learning SAP ABAP is just coming out of curiosty, and you are not much interested in taking it as a career option or practicing on system, then you can start with Youtube videos, buy a book on SAP ABAP, register yourself on SAP Community | SAP and start reading issues and comments posted by consultants round the world. This way your information will increase but understanding will not be much (as you are not practicing). ",
