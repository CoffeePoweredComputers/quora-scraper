The high-tech field is China\u2019s biggest weakness in its industrial structure so that facilitate the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan. Over the past years, China\u2019s reliance on U.S. telecome technology is not overhyped and make it the first target of Trump\u2019s trade war. check ZTE\u2019s Collapse Reveals China\u2019s Over-Reliance on U.S. Technologies However, China has surpassed the U.S. $24 billion since 2015 and has built 350,000 new cell sites to support 5G communications, while the United States has built less than 30,000. U.S. spending on wireless infrastructure is reduced by $8 billion to $10 billion annually since 2015. The Deloitte also notes that compared to the U.S., the equipment required to install 5G in China is about 35% cheaper.  Source: Deloitte China\u2019s 5G Arrangement China is firmly pushing ahead with its plans for commercial 5G services in 2020. Both China Telecom and China Unicom have clearly defined their plans to build a 5G Standalone network. China Mobile not only launched the \u201c5G SA Takeoff Initiative\u201d plan with major equipment manufacturers, but also released the \u201c5G Device Guideline\u201d with detailed specification requirements and procurement schedules, thus playing a leading role. It is worth noting that the Trump administration\u2019s ban on ZTE may bring additional impetus to the positive development of China\u2019s 5G. The U.S. government\u2019s short but effective ban on ZTE has indeed brought panic to the Chinese market. Chinese officials are now increasingly aware of their over-dependence on the U.S. technologies and economy. Also Read: After ZTE Supply Ban, China\u2019s Chip-making Will Step Up ZTE is also accelerating the promotion of 5G in the second half of the year as the U.S. lifts the ban. Recently, ZTE successfully completed the 3GPP R15 NSA mode 3.5GHz indoor cell site and 5G core network test. All projects were tested smoothly, fully reflecting the business capability and maturity of ZTE\u2019s 5G system. In the coming 5G era, ZTE is indispensable to the entire industry. U.S. 5G Status Industry giants in the U.S. such as Intel and Qualcomm are working to develop top 5G technologies. It helps that this country won the 4G competition earlier this decade. U.S. wireless providers such as Verizon and AT&T, the parent company of CNN, have said they will launch 5G technology in specific markets by the end of 2018. The Trump administration has positioned 5G as a national security issue. Earlier this year, President Trump prevented Broadcom from acquiring Qualcomm for $117 billion, as U.S. officials feared that it would give China an edge over 5G technology. There is no doubt that 5G is an important factor affecting the social and economic development of China and the United States in the next few years. In the process of race, various means and tactics will be employed. The Chinese industry needs to maintain its strength and self-confidence and take every step in a down-to-earth manner. ",

However, notable exclusions from this list are: In the US : West Palm Beach, FL has deep enough pockets with which to deny 5G, and has, based on aesthetics. Apparently since Big Telecom wrote their own law in 1996, no city can refuse cell towers based on health concerns. Official: Palm Beach exempt from 5G wireless law AND - Deep in the heart of Silicon Valley - notorious for being at the center of global telecommunications - A couple of their own communities have also blocked 5G. Again deep pockets and insider knowledge came together for a big win here. California city blocks 5G deployments - Smombie Gate | 5G | EMF California Community Mounts a Fight Against 5G Infrastructure 5G - City of Sebastopol, California - Telecommunication Ordinance Russia - Did a lot of groundbreaking research back in the 1950\u2018s, 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s on the effects of microwave radiation on the human body\u2026which the US military chose to ignore in order to be number one in technology. Russia has continued to hold their exposures down, presumably preferring to let us weaken our population before they take us over\u2026.laughing at the out-of-control Capitalists all the way of course. Belgium - Opts not to allow their citizens to be guinea pigs and sell out their public\u2018s health to Big Telecom. How\u2019s THAT for a government with integrity?! Due to Health Concerns, Brussels Stops 5G Installation -- For Now Israel - One of the largest propagators (and inventors) of 5G technology and hardware on the planet - it has not rolled out in their country as of yet and they have banned WiFi in their schools. Something we really need to do here in the US! Rabi Yaakov Litzman, Pm, deputy minister of Health asking to rethink the deployment of WIFI in Israeli schools Because\u2026 don\u2019t forget\u2026you currently ARE getting hit with 5 Gigihertz (billion beats per second) of millimeter wave radiation through your WiFi at home or school. The NEW 5G is purposefully misnamed to confuse you and will begin at frequencies much higher than that. The FCC's 5G FAST Plan \u201cThe FCC has made auctioning high-band spectrum a priority. The FCC concluded its first 5G spectrum auction this year in the 28 GHz band, and its auction of 24 GHz spectrum is taking place right now. Later this year, the FCC will auction the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands. With these auctions, the FCC will release almost 5 gigahertz of 5G spectrum into the market\u2014more than all other flexible use bands combined.\u201d Basically the US, the UK and Canada allows Big Telecom to irradiate their populations 100 to 10,000 time more than any other country on the planet!  They do this by basing their \u201cscience\u201d on old, outdated, ionizing vs non ionizing theories and thermal effects from the 1970\u2019s that never took into account the effects from PULSED microwaves on biological cell structures, or a lifetime of accumulation, or children and their developing brains, or the 24/7 exposure that we all get today. OR the cumulative exposures from so many sources all at once. U.S. 200 microwatts/cm2 to 1,000 microwatts/cm2 Canada 1,000 microwatts/cm2 China 10 microwatts/cm2 Russia 10 microwatts/cm2 Italy 10 microwatts/cm2 France 10 microwatts/cm2 Poland 10 microwatts/cm2 Hungary 10 microwatts/cm2 Switzerland General 9.5 microwatts/cm2 Switzerland Schools and Hospitals 4.25 microwatts/cm2 Belgium 2.4 microwatts/cm2 Bulgaria 2.4 microwatts/cm2 Luxembourg 2.4 microwatts/cm2 Ukraine 2.4 microwatts/cm2 Lichtenstein 0.1 microwatts/cm2 Austria Outdoor 0.001 microwatts/cm2 Austria Indoor 0.0001 microwatts/cm2 And Big Telecom has no intentions of studying the effects of the NEW 5G before they unleash this on the public.

            "answer_text": "5g is the next generation of wireless networks. Its not just faster-lower latency and more flexibility mean it could start an era of augmented self-driving vehicles and other applications whose potential has not yet been fully realized. While the pace of today\u2019s enterprise innovation is gradually and constantly moving upwards, network providers are racing to deploy the next transformative technology: 5G. The United States and China are tied for the first place in 5G readiness, according to a report released by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, which represents the US wireless communications industry. 5G is the platform for tomorrow\u2019s economy and it is going to transform everything from education to AI to medicine and that becomes the reason behind everyone being so competitive. South Korea has become the first nation to officially roll out commercial 5G systems after successful 5G tests involving varied autonomous vehicles, virtual reality games. However, the current position of South Korea doesn\u2019t ascertain the end of the global network supremacy war. This is just the sign of what seems to be tears-long competition for businesses and wireless carriers all over the world. As one of the world\u2019s largest and advanced nations, the US wireless technology industry supports almost five million employees and contributes roughly $475 billion every year to the American economy. 5G could help bring up those numbers to sky level in a flash speed. Experts believe 5G has the potential to create up to three million new jobs- in addition to adding $500 billion to US economic growth. With proper and favorable network operator infrastructure policies, this next generation technology has the potential to give out every 100 Americans a new, 5G-enabled jobs. However, all these still needs time to get US into the global leader board in this category. While the US receives a lot of attention for its mobile technologies, Asia isn\u2019t much far behind. With the growing technology market, it is quickly leading the way where 5G is concerned. In fact, four of the world\u2019s five most 5G ready nations are Asian countries- China, South Korea, India and Japan. The ever increasing technological development and the government policies in China has led the nation to become a major influencer in the 5G spectrum. With a dozen tests already done, the carriers have promised to create a fully operational commercial networks for the general masses by 2020. In lieu of winning the 5G race, China has also outspent the US by almost $24 billion in order to construct more than 350,000 new 5G compatible cell towers all over the country. To join this very said race, Europe too isn\u2019t far behind. In Europe, governments are joining forces with network operators to establish 5G testing regimes that not only upgrade the existing connectivity but also do so while trying to protect systems in a way that doesn\u2019t require the inclusion of foreign vendors which comes as a response to the US pressure to ban technology providers in the grounds of national security. Wireless carriers in this region believe these bans are not only highly unsubstantiated, but could negatively impact the supply of 5G enabled equipment, increases costs for the industry and consumers, also delay the rollout of future 5G services by several years along with the handicap of the existing networks- which in turn threatens to jeopardize the billions of investments Europe expects to make by 2025. As 5G grows more permeating, the demand for mobile data will only keep increasing at a constant rate. If the promise to provide 100 times faster speeds for 100 times mire devices at a more receptive rate, they will need the spectrum and infrastructure to accommodate all the next-gen needs of say, higher spectrum. At the end of the day, 5G can only be as successful as government allows. Policies that allows and prioritize innovation, technology as well as enterprise growth must not only be promoted but also be put up as the highest leader on the score board that is set out to win the 5G race. By putting legislation in place that rationalizes infrastructure planning mobile network siting, and operator licensing processes, a nation can dramatically hasten the deployment of it 5G enabled technology initiatives.

            "answer_text": "As others have answered, 5G is not available yet. In order for transactions to be completed in the speed set out in the technical specifications (currently Ericsson claims to be able to round trip a transaction in 9 milliseconds yet the industry target is 1 millisecond!), the territory needs to be blanketed with cellular sites. To get to the next site, and back again within that 9 milliseconds means that the signal cannot have far to travel. Achieving the necessary densification will cost billions and it is not at all clear where the return on investment will be generated. We have not yet tackled the real problem - it is not just getting a signal there and back within an incredibly short period of time, it is that something is supposed to be done with that signal. A useful analogy: you ask a question and get the answer in 9 milliseconds. Obviously, asking a question and getting an empty answer packet back in 9 milliseconds will not be helpful. So, 5G compliant applications must be able to receive the \u2018question\u2019 develop and send the \u2018answer\u2019 and still stay within the 9 millisecond limit. So, while many countries and companies are talking about rolling out 5G radio technology, customers are not going to experience anything like 1 millisecond response, or 9 millisecond response for many years to come. Faster than current 4G/LTE yes, but not close to the spec anticipated by the standards groups for 5G. ",

Here is the Pie chart which shows the comparison of the geographical distribution of 5G (in percentage).  First adopters embracing 5G will gain a competitive edge over the others, and it looks like China is currently leading the way. According to the various source, Asian countries like China, South Korea, Japan, and the US (outside Asia) are investing and building 5G infrastructure. Since 2015, China has spent the most money on 5G and the amount is about US$24 billion which is more than any other countries. These numbers are momentous, as the potential economic impact of 5G far outweighs the improvements recorded when the industry transitioned from 3G to 4G.  Hope it helps you! OKportal Technology ",

Its being anticipated that with 5G, operators aim to cross 1GBps mark and first such commercially viable network might be created by 2025. ",

Photograph: The Guardian The future of mobile phones is finally here. You can go out and buy a 5G phone, and if you happen to be in one of the six cities across the UK (London, Cardiff, Belfast, Edinburgh, Birmingham, and Manchester) in which EE\u2019s 5G network is up and running, you can get the blistering mobile broadband speeds we\u2019ve been promised will revolutionize our mobile lives, again. But should you? I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks equipped with the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on first-out-of-the-gate EE\u2019s 5G network. I streamed 2K HDR movies, downloaded whole albums in seconds and generally used it on my extremely fast 350Mbps home wifi \u2013 data caps be damned. So what is 5G like, and is it worth buying into? The answer to both those questions is \u2026 complicated. See Also: How govt. can encourage innovation.  Speeds in St. Pauls were some of the highest in London. Photograph: EE Is 5G faster than 4G? Absolutely. Day to day in the most congested parts of London, it was at least double the speed of EE\u2019s 4G, sometimes up to 10 times faster. That meant speeds varied wildly as I trundled through patches of 5G on the train. At Elephant and Castle in the morning rush hour, I got a full 5G signal, but only speeds of about 3Mbps \u2013 still double the 1.5Mbps 4G could produce at the same time. A few hundred meters down the tracks stuck outside Blackfriars, speeds in eoverMbps were routine, with 4G capping out at less than 30Mbps. A similar experience was had outside Victoria and several other central London stations. Read More for Further Details: ",

The truth is: 5G first wave addresses industrial applications and fixed line broadband supply for undersupplied regions. For the consumer there is still LTE. And that situation will not change for the next 5 years or so. LTE will start using the new 5G frequencies, and thus be sold as 5G. The full strength of 5G can only be seen when the radio nodes are (software) upgraded to support New Radio, AND we have the new core network in place. ",

Kolkata, a city in India was the first one in which it was launched after that banglore and many more. Since than it bought hilarious changes in its Technology. Since it came on mobile as a network like other one, it became easy to use. And most awaiting all the new features of the so called 5G network. It would be providing approximately more than 10GB per second of data rate. AS comapred to 4G and 4.5G its improvement rate would be more than 10-100x better than both of them. And with this speed everyone one would be curious to use it. It would be consuming 90% less energy usage. The advanced billing interfaces of 5G technology makes it more attractive and effective.
