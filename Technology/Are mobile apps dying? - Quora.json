            "answer_text": "Will Native Apps Actually Die? Even if they will eventually die out, it promises to be a slow death. The existing web pages won\u2019t go anywhere and a lot of traditional websites will still be created. However, the more tech and business-savvy people and especially companies will adopt at least one of the two practices we described earlier at an even faster rate. As a result, this is a trend you will definitely see more often.  The democratization of technology is already happening. These practices will become more and more accessible in the future. Soon there simply won\u2019t be a legitimate enough reason to create an outdated and inferior web app. One thing left to consider is the mobile marketplace. There is money to be made there. As a result, established brands like Twitter, for example, will use both native and PWA versions of their service. Also, companies with complex apps that can\u2019t be easily converted into a web page will still be a fixture of any app store. In fact, they will dominate the field of mobile software since more providers will switch to PWA or React Native for Web instead. It won\u2019t be a momentary change. Old habits die hard after all. Instead, it will be a steady trend that people will discover more and more as this technology advances. More in article ",

Here are some reasons: It is not just about development anymore. Exponential scale is almost impossible to reach on your own. A team performs better.

So switching into a job would be hard as well unless you are good.So unless you have a decent idea, killer execution and thorogh game plan for hiring people when you need them, going indie will not be a good choice.

I think webapps are becoming more popular and (for developers) its handy not to have to give Google or Apple a percentage of every sale made through an app. Webapps don't have to do that, native apps do. I think you may want to look at SeattleClouds because it lets you get an app out the door that works great for next to nothing. I don't get a kick back from them, but I've used them to deploy a number of apps in days that would have taken months otherwise . . . ",
