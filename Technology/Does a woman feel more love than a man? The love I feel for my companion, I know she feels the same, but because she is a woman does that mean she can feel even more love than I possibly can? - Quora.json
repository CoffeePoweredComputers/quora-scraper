            "answer_text": "You may be surprised to learn that women,although they are emotionally motivated and act according to their emotions and men by and large act on logic and reason, men actually feel emotions on a deeper level than women. It is engrained from primitive existence, in which the men would provide for and protect their clan and the women had to smooth and comfort any discord amoung the group and raise the young children, teaching them the ways of how life would be. You can\u2019t be quarrelling about hard line differences with a task like that. You need harmony and community or at least a strong illusion of it. What depth of emotion do you think it takes to be more than willing to die to protect your family or clan? You would have to have an incredibly strong emotional connection to take on that role. Women might understand and utilize/control their emotions infinitely better than men, but don\u2019t kid yourself, men feel as much, likely more than women. We just don\u2019t have a fucking clue how to express what we are feeling and if we can we can\u2019t control it like women. Usually making asses of ourselves in the process. ",

            "answer_text": "Ricky, No. Women tend to be much more EMOTIONAL, and are much more likely to actually express love than men, or appear to, but that doesn\u2019t mean their feelings of love are deeper or more abundant. Love is an essential, fundamental force of human life, neither male nor female. ",
