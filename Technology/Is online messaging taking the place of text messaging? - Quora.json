Very less people are using text messages at this time for some obvious reasons. Technology is changing and improving day by day. Text replced by online msgs, voice calls replaced by video calls. Chatting, dating sites, photo sharing apps and so on. Remember! Only change is constant. Enjoy! Thanks again Peeyush ",
