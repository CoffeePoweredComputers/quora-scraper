            "answer_text": "Frequency reuse: a given set of frequencies is used over and over again by a service provider in order to cover a large geographical area keeping in consideration no two adjacent frequencies are assigned to two adjacent cells. The frequency reuse is done in such a manner that minimizes the cochannel interference (CCI) the same frequency assigned to faraway cells and the adjacent channel interference ( ACI) between any two adjacent cells. Typically a cluster of 7 frequencies is used for this. The cells are roughly hexagonal in shape that maximizes the coverage area for a given basestation that is normally placed at the center of the cell. ",
