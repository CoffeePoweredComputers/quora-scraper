            "answer_text": "Interesting that you should, ask as Cyberpunk 2077 isn\u2019t releasing until 2020\u2026 So are you preparing your Santa List in readiness, because they had such a good trailer? Can-you-run-it believe that the minimum GPU for Cyberpunk might be somewhere closer to the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. This is much higher than your 1060 in GPU power, but, given those E3 videos/trailers, it is likely that your will need quite a hi-spec computer to enjoy this game to its fullest.Cyberpunk 2077 Requirements Test Having said that, it is unusual for any games to be released which require too high a spec, as it narrows the potential sales market and, as we all know, sales are what drives the companies who produce the games. So the final outcome may be that it will run on, for instance, your 1060, (depending on the rest of your kit of course) but only as a \u201cstandard\u201d (minimum) spec. If you want to start turning up the fps, detail and shading goodies they build in, then you will be looking to progressively raise the computer specs accordingly. It could be that they will have considered RayTracing and you can expect even more amazing eye watering screen goodness from a RTX 1070 Super. (1440p gaming with ray tracing) Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super vs RTX 2070 if you have the odd \u00a3600 to spare (less Black Friday discounts of course) \u2026 Worth noting though, that UserBenchmark report: Rapidly diminishing returns lie beyond the 2060\u2019s price point of $325 and they are not worth it for the majority of gamers that play on or below 1080p. Nvidia GTX 1060-6GB vs RTX 2060 So, although the RTX card is at least 15% better on almost every score point, other than price, it might not be worth stepping up higher than that \u2013 just yet. (Unless Santa has some very deep pockets?) ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll have to wait and see but my bet would be on \u201cyes\u201d. I\u2019m waiting for the release with a GTX970 and I hope to be able to play it, even though there is a chance I might have to go for minimum instead of medium settings. For context I should add that when TW3 came out, I was using a 770GT (if I remember correctly). My GPU was below what was considered minimum requirements. I didn\u2019t have money to spare back then so I was thinking about saving up and upgrade my PC. I somehow decided to try the game first and see how it would work in my PC and I was shocked to discover that it ran 100% smooth on lower settings and still looked and felt amazing. I have my current GPU for more than 4 years and even though there is a lot of pressure to upgrade from the gaming community, I don\u2019t really care about that. I run most games, even those from 2019 on medium without much of a problem. Even if I have to run a game on low settings, it doesn\u2019t bother me. In the long term you will enjoy the game a lot more because of gameplay rather than because of graphics. So if I ever decided that a game was shit (I\u2019m looking at you Far Cry 4), it wasn\u2019t because of the graphics on lower settings. The first time I\u2019ll want to play a game and it won\u2019t run on my PC, I\u2019ll consider upgrading my GPU. I have money to spare now but the way I got to this point was by not throwing it away just because people say I must absolutely have the latest from Nvidia. So my advice to you is: if you have the money for both the game and for a new GPU but aren\u2019t 100% willing to spend all of it, then buy the game first and see how it feels. If it doesn\u2019t satisfy you, then by all means go and get an upgrade. If not, keep the money and spend it on something that would actually make a difference in your life. ",
