            "answer_text": "The original Nintendo Switch model released in 2017 was indeed discontinued by August 2019. However, it was replaced by the new 2019 Nintendo Switch model that same month which has improved power efficiency, allowing the battery to last on average an hour longer. On top of that they released the Nintendo Switch Lite, a handheld-only model that also cuts out some hardware features to reduce the cost of the device. Now, in 2020, rumors are heating up that the on-agin-off-again rumored Switch Pro is nearing mass production. All signs point to this model being a more expensive premium SKU that is more comparable to a Switch 2 that will be backwards compatible with past Switch titles and all first party Nintendo games being released on all Switch systems going forward for at least a few years.
