            "answer_text": "I have not seen any such research. The main hurdle in trying to apply r-type k-type selection theory to states is that most states do not reproduce. (there have been colonial periods in the past from time to time but the goal was usually not an attempt to make a new state even if that was the eventual outcome.) Since states do not commonly create new states the analogy doesn't really work. The fact that states don't have a naturally determined life-span also contributes to this. ",
