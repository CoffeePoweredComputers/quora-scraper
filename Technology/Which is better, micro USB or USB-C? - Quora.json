            "answer_text": "Well there are a lot of factors which makes usb type C better than USB B\u2019s and here are some of those -  (Source - Google) Durability - This is a point which is very essential to those who mistakenly try to force plug the USB-B with wrong sides, C as being reversible type that\u2019s not a matter of concern. For me its not a thing because in my usage I have never faced this problem and Last time I broke a cable because of this was about 3 years back when I was 12, but it can be a thing for people.Built for speed - Usb C is built to be fast, it\u2019s designed to run speed of usb 3 gen 2 which is about 10 gbps, in technical term and about 2.6 GB per second, which is blazing fast.Not just speed - Usb, as a standard was not only built to transfer data as fast speeds but also a good amount of power through it at the same time. Usb C takes it to a new level, not only send data at very fast speed but also send as much as 100 watts through it.God of thunder - Thunderbolt 3 is a standered which embraced USB type c, its an addition which increases the ability and usage of this usb a lot, when I say a lot, that means about 40 gbps data transfer speed + running 4k monitor at 60hz + sending 100 watts of power+ extending PCIe connections and using External GPU\u2019s, all at the same time , yeah all at the same time which opens a lot of things which we could do. Mr.B definitely can\u2019t do this.TL;DR - USB C is a next gen usb standard and it is supposed to be better at everything that its predecessors are meant to do.
