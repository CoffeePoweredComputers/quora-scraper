            "answer_text": "When first read about computer science and IT, I had similar question in mind, as no matter what field is you choose(CS or IT), you end up getting same or similar jobs.But after bachelor\u2019s degree in CS I realized, although IT and CS look similar they are different in terms of knowledge you gain and future opportunities which are open. Now, getting to your question, whichever word you use you\u2019ll end getting similar job but type of knowledge will differ ( w.rt. depth, breadth etc). CS is more inclined towards Mathematics, basic understanding towards how computer works and how system works, why etc. You end up answer to one of the question based on your specialization. Research will based on exploring new branch of algorithms, AI etc. CE is more towards how to make computer system, what combination is more effective etc along with essence of CS.Exploring hardware that is biggest impact on world of Computer and Internet. Research includes IoT devices, specialized hardware and software that use CS knowledge eg. improving Computing (GPUs, CPUs )etc. Information Science(IS) is inclined towards, how to process, store, move and handle information in computer world along with essence of CS.Exploring new ways understand data (Data science), Network Security, Protocol drafting etc. Information Technology, is special branch of CS where is deal with applications of above 3 i.e. CS, CE, IS and few more. where you handle web science (websites, web-services etc), Databases, networking (IS + CE + CS) {this might include network management hardware or software, handling traffic and information translation, security etc}. So, IT, IS, CE, CS are different, but they are inter-dependent. I know, I\u2019m not 100 % correct but I tried to put it in simple words, and might have missed few points in doing so. Comment, if I\u2019ve missed something. ",
