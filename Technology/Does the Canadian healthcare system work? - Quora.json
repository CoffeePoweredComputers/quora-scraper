            "answer_text": " The Canadian healthcare system \u201cworks\u201d though probably not in the way foreigners might think. Since I am going to get into scenarios that may confuse those who are less familiar with the healthcare system in Canada, I am going to mention two different terms off the bat which are both used interchangeably, yet have very different meanings when placed in context. UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE: The belief that healthcare for all is a right. SINGLE-PAYER HEALTHCARE: The belief that everyone should get the same healthcare. Here is why single-payer healthcare is actually a bad thing: The waiting times for even the most basic things are atrociousYou are stuck with the hospital staff, no matter how lousy and unpleasant they may beWe have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes per individual for when an appointment that is likely to cost under $100 in a private healthcare setting comes aboutThere is no market competition amongst healthcare workersI don\u2019t think I am being too extreme in my views when I say that the four things mentioned above \u2014 and I assure you, that I am probably downplaying how broken our system is \u2014 is not something we would go bragging to everyone as though we are the beacon of light that everyone else should envy. If you are a low-income citizen, or someone who needs an operation that could literally bankrupt them, then yes, the \u201cpublic\u201d healthcare system is a necessity, and that is why it was introduced in the first place. The public system can even be beneficial if someone has been shot and is bleeding on the sidewalk. What point is there in deciding if he should go see a private or public doctor when the person is mere seconds away from permanently losing consciousness? However, just because the public system is better than the private system under some circumstances does not mean that we should jump aboard and make everything public in the same way we wouldn\u2019t want everything to be privatised without exception just because the private system actually works in at least as many (if not more) cases than the public system. Here is what is included in Canada\u2019s current healthcare system: Medical checkupsSurgeryMental health serviceSubsidised medication (for those under a certain income)I am certain that there are other things which are technically included, but I wanted to divulge on the four examples above, as I feel as though they need some correcting from those who believe that there isn\u2019t some fine print in between. First of all, while medical checkups, such as severe colds, minor injuries, headaches, chest pains etc. are in fact \u201cfree\u201d the cost for this so-called free service is that you have to wait in a depressing-looking emergency room for a period which can range from as little to four hours (if you are fortunate) to as much as forty-eight hours if you aren\u2019t. All cases are done based on urgency of a patient. So, if you come into a hospital emergency room with a fractured foot, yet several other people come in with severed limbs, guess who is going to be seen as a priority? And, like all humans, doctors have to go to sleep. So, if you were next in line after waiting around for a good twenty-four hours, there is a good chance you will wait an additional eight to ten hours in the emergency room, as all the doctors taking in waiting room patients have gone home for the night, and they rarely notify you of this reality (you sort of figure that out when you noticed that nobody has been called in after several hours). Quite often, people literally die during those hours, (I have personally been in rooms with people who later died for those reasons), and I am certain that it is worse if you happen to be in a waiting room on a Sunday, or a holiday, as even fewer doctors are present. In my home province of Ontario, there even used to be a policy where doctors were given a weekly pay based on how many patients they saw. It did not matter if they went beyond their \u201ccall\u201d and did more than the bare minimum. If they were only required to see fifty people between Monday and Friday, and they saw their fiftieth person on a Thursday, and there were still dozens of more people waiting to be seen, they would be SOL until Monday, as all provincial doctors got paid the same amount once they met their quota. There was literally no incentive for these doctors to continue seeing additional patients, when they could just take Friday off, and come back to work on Monday (by which time, some patients may have already died). I don\u2019t think our healthcare system is quite as socialistic as it used to be (thank God himself for that), though it is still very hazardous and socialised, nonetheless. Does this mean that I think we should just give up on the public healthcare system altogether? Not at all. In fact, here are some areas related to healthcare which I think should be included into our public healthcare system, yet are currently excluded: Dental servicesChiropractor servicesVeterinary servicesPlus a few other areas which I forgot to name on the list. This does not mean I expect everyone to start going into waiting lines to go get their teeth properly flossed by a dentist the way we are expected to wait for over a year just to get a cancer appointment. All it means is that I think that the public healthcare system should exist as a safety net for those who fall on hard financial times in the same way we currently give financial subsidies to lower-income individuals and families. Even though it is not as common, there have even been times when hospitals have been so over-flooded with hospital patients not being properly churned out, thanks to the lack of proper doctors, that even our own local Tim Hortons restaurants have been known to be turned into temporary ER\u2019s, usually after even the hospital hallways no longer suffice! On a more general note, here is where I think Canada\u2019s healthcare system works better than in the USA: Low-income individualsProhibitively expensive healthcare operationEmergency services (in general)Medicinal needs (if one is low-income)However, here are the areas where the USA is definitely better: Basic appointments (except for low-income individuals)Waiting times (this was especially true before Obama Care)Medicinal needs ( for everyone not deemed low-income)As one can see, both have their advantages and disadvantages. If you are someone who earns more than $100,000, then the only time you \u201cmight\u201d benefit off the public healthcare system is if you are someone who needs one of those rare million dollar operations. Someone who earns between $20\u2013100,000 would probably be better off in private healthcare for most cases, though their breaking point for special operations would obviously be far lower than someone with a more substantial income. As for those earning under $20,000 a year: there is probably not much which they could benefit from the private healthcare system, and that is fine, as Canada still has the private healthcare system. Nonetheless, let me state clearly why I think that reducing the number of \u201cpublic\u201d services in Canada would actually benefit the lower-income individuals more than anyone else: Fewer people using the public healthcare system (especially for ordinary checkups) means a lower waiting time for those who cannot afford the private healthcare systemReducing the number of people in the public healthcare system means reducing the tax on our public healthcare system to be spent in other areas our budget currently cannot afford (homelessness, or some of the other healthcare services mentioned above which even our \u201cfree\u201d system \u2014 dentistry, chiropractor, veterinary \u2014 cannot afford to include being obvious examples)Having less money wasted could mean reducing the overall tax rate on the general population, which in turn may help the market in combating inflation and unemploymentOverall, it costs far less per individual to go through the private healthcare system than it does to go through the public healthcare system, since you are not going to have a private doctor taxing you $500 a year for that appointment you might have ten years down the line which may cost only a few hundred dollars for a one time fee from a private doctor. Imagine how much better off you would have been with just that few thousand extra dollars? Having privatised doctors also means we are not obligated to pay each doctor a flat rate in our provincial healthcare system $100\u2013250,000 plus a year (depending on their speciality). Private doctors can now compete with other doctors, and let the market itself decide what their true income is really worthy. As a matter of fact, I would even help make it easier for them, as well as other aspiring doctors to do just that by also removing the mandatory Bachelor\u2019s Degree required to even APPLY to get into medical school. Like seriously, I don\u2019t see why a doctor needs to learn about Romeo and Juliet when they are trying to get into brain surgery. Furthermore, an older person might be willing to spend a couple of years in medical school before going into residence. They might not be so willing to spend an additional four years to even get to that point, especially when medical schools on average turn away far more people than they accept. Reducing costs for useless Bachelor Degrees would also mean the potential creation of more medical schools, which would allow doctors to survive on a lower annual wage, thanks to their reduced time in school away from the workforce, while also allowing some genuine competition in the market. We also wouldn\u2019t need to worry about doctors walking off the job earlier in the week after they filled some silly government quota, when they could be actually earning more money. (Yes, in an ideal world, their Hippocratic Oath would bound them to perform such medical services for \u201cfree\u201d though we don\u2019t live in that type of world\u2026 yet) Public health doctors would still be around for those cases where the private system is not practical, and it is inevitable that we would have to pay them a flat salary based on their experience and working hours. However, their numbers would be limited to mostly older doctors who are known for having a good reputation in dealing with their patients (a win-win scenario for those not able to get into the private healthcare system). One incentive I would use in order to encourage people \u2014 especially those within the $20\u2013100,000 a year range \u2014 to go into the private healthcare system, is by offering significant tax reductions, based on how much they spent at their private healthcare location, and give them a small amount back every year over a period of up to a decade as both a reward for not going public, and also as a way for the system to be able to steadily return that financial favour without feeling pressured to give the full tax break all at once. Here is an example of what I mean: Someone in a single year has spent $1,000 on multiple appointments, and their income is around $50,000. They might receive up to $100 a year back in tax breaks from that single year alone, which would be approximately the same costs they had spent a decade earlier (minus the inflation). An individual with $100,000 might not be rewarded quite as generously (they would obviously get some of their investments returned) though people in a two-tier system are already far more likely to go with private healthcare than someone earning half their annual wage, so the necessity in getting them off the public healthcare system is not as dire (there are also only a comparable handful of people even earning $100,000 in the first place). Many Canadians have waited over a year for hip surgery, or cancer treatment. Even though Glenn Beck was indeed misinterpreting, and even over-simplifying, when he claimed that Canadian names are \u201cdrawn out of a hat\u201d based on who will live and die, he was also not completely wrong when the literal interpretation of what he said is looked at as more of a hyperbole. As mentioned earlier, the current Canadian system goes by URGENCY. This means that in theory, the law strictly prohibits hospitals from deliberately \u201callowing\u201d someone to just die the way Glenn Beck said. On the other hand, people who had medical conditions that were easily treatable in its early stages, end up dying anyway, because they have to wait for so long on some broken waiting list, that by the time their conditions worsen enough to get them on the top of the waiting list, it is oftentimes too late. Many of the financially better off Canadians have been known to go down to the United States and pay a salary out of their own pocket in order to get the cancer treatment that would likely never come in Canada. Some readers may say: \u201cOh, well good for them if they can afford it!\u201d That\u2019s not the point! Our system, when it is claimed to be \u201cfree\u201d, must also be feasible. How does turning people away due to lack of beds in hospital settings after they had waited for over a year for an advanced cancer operation a sign of feasibility? And why is our system so socialised, that our government would rather let people spend their healthcare money in another country, when they can spend it back in Canada the moment the government chooses to be more rational, and loosen up our single-payer healthcare system? Fortunately, all hope is not lost. During the 1990s, when many of the things I mentioned above \u2014 such as doctors fulfilling some sort of weekly quota \u2014 were at their heights, the negative effects of that era caused even the more radical supporters of our socialist healthcare system to ease off the tension, and acknowledge that there is indeed such a thing as having a worldview that is too \u201ccommunistic\u201d. The Conservative Government of Stephen Harper really pushed the agenda in making the debate for private healthcare far more publicly discussed than at probably anytime since the late 1960s, when national healthcare started to become enforced on a federal level (provinces themselves are, however, responsible for budgeting costs). It seems that even Justin Trudeau \u2014 despite being quite obviously the most left-leaning Prime Minister in our history \u2014 has not been too aggressive in pushing back on the recent expansion of private healthcare in Canada, as it seems more and more Canadians are choosing their right to go for private healthcare just as passionately as those who defend the right to public healthcare. To conclude: I agree with those who regard the United States\u2019s overall lack of disregard for those left with medical necessities which they cannot afford to be inexcusable, especially for an economically industrious country as the United States (even many African countries provide more for their low-income citizens). On the other hand, I am quite happy to know that in Canada, our government has finally acknowledged that our extremely left-wing healthcare system of the past was probably not such a good idea (in general) and have entertained solutions in reducing the burden of public healthcare costs by allowing more realistic private healthcare plans, which were next to impossible to attain for all but the wealthiest Canadian citizens until fairly recently. The capitalistic healthcare system of the United States is a blemish for those who cannot afford the most basic healthcare, let alone, getting surgery. The same was and is, to some extent, still true in regards to Canada\u2019s more socialistic approach. Who says we cannot just take the best out of both worlds and disregard the rest of it? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In terms of general practice and emergency visits, the care is free and easy to access  and in my experience, quite good. This means that no one needs to think twice about going to confirm if a flu is really something worse or getting routine treatment for chronic conditions. For most of your routine medical needs, you're extremely well cared for in Canada compared to the US for example. Healthcare costs are not downloaded on to your employer so you can go to school, take a job at a start or take time off without fear that your a sudden health-crisis will doom you. The problem though is that once you go beyond the most common healthcare interactions, Canadian healthcare becomes more uneven. If you need a hip replacement, you are in a long wait list at times upwards of an year since it's not considered a life-threatening issue (even though the loss of function as immobility takes a toll may render you in dire condition a year from now). Also, if your child has a rare dietary condition, the treatment to diagnose her may be covered in your province, but the special food to keep her alive may not be. Further, if you suspect you need an MRI for a sports injury, you're not covered at all and will need to pay out of pocket. In effect, specialist treatment in Canada is quite difficult to access compared to the US. While you are insured in Canada,  you aren't guaranteed quick access to care and the publicly-funded system is not under any competitive pressure to make sure your concerns are dealt with with as quick as possible. You're in a queue that is ultimately controlled by regional health authorities and, ultimately, politicians in charge of funding allocation. That's an incredibly frustrating position to be in if you've ever seen the standard of specialist care delivered by America's better HMO systems. It may not be cheap or accessible, but if you've got good health insurance in the US, I can't see you ever wanting to give up relatively instantaneous access to care compared to a Canadian queue. The lack of a well-developed market has really hurt the ability for Canadians to access cheaper and adequate non-emergency healthcare. For example, if you hurt yourself playing a recreational sport, the public system is unlikely to address more than the emergency of a broken bone, and private MRI clinics to get your ongoing issues diagnosed are still few in number and expensive due to high demand. We're beginning to move slowly towards a model that incorporates both a public and private mix of care options, but it pales in comparison to options available in other countries. As a result, the notion of health tourism has become a growing option for the middle class who can often get treatment and post-recovery vacation time in India or Hong Kong far quicker and for a comparable premium compared to waiting months or years for surgery in Canada.
