            "answer_text": "Things big tech blogs cover badly (as in: subjects they ignore):  1. \"Hidden Champions\"  Editorially, almost all tech blogs gravitate towards star power, meaning companies that have a lot of social proof behind them (investments from very visible VC's).  Blogs are mainly click & SEO driven, and the temptation to blog about big consumer brands is strong. A company like SAP generates a lot less interest (both in search and in viral clicks) than Nokia or Apple, although it is clearly a business that is extremely well managed (see: SAP is betting the company on realtime tech SAP HANA).  Given the scale tech blogs have to reach to become and remain successful, they will gravitate towards the common denominator.  Going a bit outside the scope of tech blogs, this is also why Business Insider blogs about the official portrait of Kate Middleton. It's just click whoring: Kate Middleton Portrait Artist Lashes Out Against 'Vicious' Criticism 2. Life sciences and health  Also, I have yet to find a tech blog that does life sciences really well.  Life sciences will produce major scientific, technological and business breakthroughs in the next 20 to 50 years. But for some reason they are not in the usual scope for tech blogs - maybe also because TechMeme won't cover them.  Companies like Biocartis, founded in 2007 (\"Biocartis (molecular diagnostics) raises \u20ac 34,5 million in new financing\") will probably IPO this year. Have you heard of Biocartis?  Now compare to Acquia's recent $ 30 M round that was covered everywhere.  3. Technology transfer from universities and public innovation agencies Most tech blogs are focused too much on entrepreneurs of the type \"3 friends with a Mac start an e-commerce\".   In Europe especially, a lot of great companies are spun out at impressive rates from universities. The technology transfer departments of universities will also provide help to secure public funding often.  This leads to a lot of companies starting inside universities, getting public funding and becoming major players. The first time you see them in the media is when a CEO's in a suit talks about big deals in China and India. They skip the \"entrepreneur\" press and are picked up when they become interesting for the \"finance\" press.  They skip the \"startup-in-a-garage\" phase that tech blogs love. In short: tech blogs are often not about tech, they're mostly about founders stories. ",

            "answer_text": "Current technology blogs (like Techcrunch, Mashable, etc.) don't cover these tech topics well:   Non-IT technology startups. There's a universe of startups in pharmaceuticals, materials science, manufacturing systems, industrial robots, and other segments. Pre-startup innovation. Academia, government and private research institutions produce a wealth of discoveries and breakthroughs, fund major programs, and set the tech agenda for the next five to ten years. Regional public policy. Lobbying happens in D.C. and other national capitals, but influence is being peddled in states, provinces, and larger cities for quick action on privacy, safety, and internet freedoms. Product, Business and Market Segment Failure. Coverage is haphazard, anecdotal, and unsystematic. This is intelligence everyone needs. Industry Economics. We don't see hard numbers on sales, employment, profits, balance sheets for the IT industry as a whole or by segment. This business reporting is costly and requires skill and training. Technology infrastructure. Plumbing isn't sexy but wiring of the Internet and telephony, including last mile, wireless and interchange, affect everyone. Laggard users and the working poor. Nearly all coverage assumes readers are middle class adults spending lots of disposable income on gadgets and software costing more than many Americans make in a month. Report on the technologies and businesses serving seniors, the working poor, the mentally ill, the disabled and promote affordable innovation.Activity where the first language isn't English. Half of all stories on Techcrunch and Mashable could be covering technologies, startups, venture firms, consumer behavior, and popular culture from Asia, Latin America and Africa. This bias leaves news and money on the table. Social gossip. Dating, marriage, divorces, affairs, and launch parties. Politics. National, state and local elections have a direct bearing on the infotech industries. Yet we don't see the major tech blogs interviewing candidates for senate, governor, prime minister, president, vice president, and other important positions about their qualifications, views, and intentions. We sure don't see them endorsing candidates. History. I've met young engineers who don't know the technologies that led to the ones they use today. So they don't understand the trends and forces driving changes to those technologies. Missing context means they may be doomed to repeat history's failures.",

            "answer_text": "The most remarkable yet easily explainable thing that the existing major blogs do not cover, but should, are the companies that do not have \"heat\" on them.  Lord knows I love Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Foursquare, and all of the other super-hot companies that draw lots of press/blog attention, but there are lots of other companies that are outstanding at various stages of growth that are not as white hot from a public perception standpoint and therefore get covered much less. I would love a blog that covers, in depth, growth companies in tech across all the important categories with the same enthusiasm and commitment as Techcrunch, Mashable, etc.  Including cloud computing, infrastructure hardware and software, security, and so on.  GigaOm is part of the way there but is still too limited in scope for what I want. As an aside, the major frustration I hear from som excellent people who work for the major blogs is that they have to focus on the hot companies because those are the companies that drive page views and therefore revenue.  While that makes sense, I think there has to be another opportunity covering the less hot but equally high quality companies that will be equivalently lucrative -- the audience for the blog I want to read would have a highly qualified and attractive audience for certain categories of advertising, plus other revenue streams like conferences, job boards, and premium content. The other thing that the major tech blogs simply do not do enough of is quantitative analysis.  In other words, what are the actual facts of a given situation as shown in the numbers.  It's not that hard to hire people who are good at number crunching and such analysis would be highly differentiating.  Business Insider does some of this but I wish even they did more. ",

I also figured it was time to switch channels when twerking and other entertainment related news was getting coverage. http://Startup88.com is primarily focused on Asia Pacific early stage companies or even projects which are pre company coming out of the Universities or local startup scene but increasingly traffic and stories are coming from US and Europe as well. Its growing strongly though would still be considered a rounding error at TechCrunch :) We have about 10 regular contributors from Australia, Singapore, India and US and are more focused on long form stories about entrepreneurs and their experience and cool things they are building rather than \"news\"  If Angellist and Medium had a Lovechild it might look like what I am aiming for with the pre digital long form versions of Inc magazine, Fastcompany and Wired as its grandparents. I invite anyone who has a cool project or startup to share to drop me a line here http://startup88.com/tell-me-a-story I am also happy to discuss collaboration or co-founders as it is still very early days Thanks Mike ",

A year ago, you could have said Mashable's niche was social media, and while it may still be a major traffic driver to the site, we've added to the team and expanded our scope.  Now we cover technology, gadgets, mobile, media, business, marketing and dev topics with increasing regularity. There are still thousands of topics that are underrepresented, though.  There's more than enough Twitter/Facebook/Foursquare/Quora coverage now (I'll be the first to admit that the tech press often over-reports on these topics), but we do need more on topics like enterprise, web development, international coverage and deeper analysis of the top tech/VC/entrepreneurship issues. These can be hard sells to advertisers though -- they want pageviews, not pontification.  You're going to have to find a niche that you love, is underrepresented and that advertisers will pay for.  Trust me when I say it's incredibly difficult. Good luck. ",

Understand the business models - it is the least interesting part for most tech startups but the part that matters most. Don't be seduced by 'got $xx million in funding'. What does that really mean? 3. Cover the ultra small and below the radar stuff.

TechCrunch, etc. have a laser focus on that geography but many cities I visit in North America and Europe have a thriving startup scene, but the big tech blogs are blind to them. TechCrunch has one-day parties in various cities, but they focus their reporting only on northern California. A blog that reported on European startups would be fantastic (especially if it was written in English please?). Estonia, Germany, even Bulgaria - great stuff is coming from many countries. But the reporting is limited. 2. Investigative reporting. Ninety-plus percent of tech blog posts are just knee-jerk reactions to boring corporate press releases (OMG! Apple changed their accounting from cash to accrual. We'll examine what this means to their customers...). I'd like to see bloggers who spent time on their stories, figure out odd relationships between companies, ferret out secret innovations, and look at trends that we're all missing. 3. Looking at the technology behind the companies. I find it interesting that Facebook is primarily written in php (really??), or that Netflix uses somebody's cloud. I also find it fascinating that Silicon Valley is so far behind areas like the American Midwest in terms of engineering practices (TDD, CI, BDD, etc.). I've worked in both geographies and I find it so strange. I would love a tech blogger to dive in and figure this out. ",

This is clearly a US-centric game - and this explains, logically, the main focus of existing major technology blogs. That's business efficiency and this is good. If the mission of this futur blog is to uncover and discuss innovations and inventions from a more scientific or speculative standpoint, there is an opportunity to cover other topics (there are many which do not make the headlines everyday; nanotech, optical, energy, materials) and other geographies (China has invested more than any oher country in cleantech last year, for example).

We often find out about ideas and startups when they are translated into products that become popular. Many, many ideas fall through the cracks for lack of a proper implementation team. This can be remedied if more number of people are aware of the idea. If more people know about it, higher the chances of a good implementation coming through. Another interesting avenue to cover, could be research publications. These are good sources for new ideas. There should be a blog that explains the contents of these papers to the more general CS population, possibly with demos and test outputs, and even interviews with the authors. Very few entrepreneurs actually browse through research publications to find inspiration for new ideas. Obviously, only those papers whose authors do give prior permission to such exposure. ",

Top blogs talk about the conferences and seminars but they have any opinion of the product from customers point of view. They talk about the features that are present but not whether the feature has any true benefit for the user. They don\u2019t take any interest in whether the product solves any real world problem or not.

I don't want to know more about Marissa Mayer, I want to know more about the women who are doing the hard work behind the scenes, who are launching startups (not like Lulu, the so called \"First Ever App for Girls\", I think this has only been detrimental to everything they claim to support and simply put, it's a poorly executed and careless app). Whether it's critical or positive coverage, I'm sick of women in tech being brought to light only when public pressure deems it necessary to give them their allotted spotlight or because of a heavily publicized scandal - as if female recognition in this industry is a simple issue that just requires a quick band-aid every time someone publicly voices their concern. I would elaborate but I'd like to keep my answer short, but you can always ask me why I feel this way or even care ( no I'm not an aggressive or angry feminist in the sense that most people have come to understand it in at all) and I would be happy to explain.

            "answer_text": "I took a slightly different route when I started 'Startup Intelligence' last April. I initially thought the way to complement TechCrunch coverage was a blog with high-quality, long-form content about European startups. Actually I found that this has limited value because when writing about a startup without benchmarking it against other companies, professional readers don't know whether they should care enough to read the articles.  If the company was picked randomly, probably not. But I agree with Marc Andreessen: if there is quantitative evidence that the company is gaining real market traction then they will care. We developed a model of corporate-targeted reports and have Google, IBM, UK Gov etc as clients (see http://startupintelligence.net). To support this we're building a software solution too called 'Growth Intelligence', which also does what it says on the tin. I believe the only way to target a professional audience is by being 100% data-driven. This automatically differentiates you from TechCrunch. ",
