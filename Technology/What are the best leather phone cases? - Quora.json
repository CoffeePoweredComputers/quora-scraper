            "answer_text": "I hope you are looking for great looks and want something that\u2019ll last you a lifetime. If you are looking something cheap, that will wilt away in a couple of years, this may not be the answer for you. My intention behind a case was to provide optimum protection while not hiding the phone behind ugly looking material just because it is sturdy. The cases that I rejected for some reason may be appreciated by somebody else as they may be looking for different features in the product. But not this guy. This guy wants something that will protect the phone and look great while doing so. And when you have such specific requirements, the search can get messy. As true quality is hard to find. So while looking, I came across some big names including case-mate, casetify, bellroy, spigen, noreve and many others. However the ones that stuck with me was one design from Bellroy, a couple of high end pieces from Casetify & some designs from Noreve. Bellroy: Their website was a treat to visit. Their pages were beuatifully designed to explain all the features of the case. Which felt great to look at. Plus the minimalist feel goes great for them. I would have gladly gone with them, if not for one odd thing. Their product looked great on screen but looking at the case images (without the fancy background) felt like they were trying too much. Not with the website, but with the product itself. For e.g. Their phone cases have a space for cards. But what if you don\u2019t want to keep a card? In this case, the case felt odd, as the card holder is not snug. It has been designed keeping in mind the cards. And unless you are comfortable leaving your card with the phone, it can feel bulky. Casetify: Although known for their cheap and customisable cases, they do offer some quality pieces, but they are not easy to find. These looked great, but by the time I reached them I had my heart set on another one by Noreve. Noreve: Now these guys are something else. They don\u2019t do cheap, and having gotten their case a year ago, I\u2019d say rightly so. This case has seen a whole lot and is still going strong. And all I have to do to make it look great it wipe it with a dry cloth and it is ready to go. I am in the habit of carrying my phone with me in the kitchen and have a YouTube video on play while a cook. If you use your mobile in the kitchen, you would notice that a sticky layer settles on the phone and is very difficult to get off. Unless your phone is waterproof, it is a bad choice to take it in the kitchen, as cleaning it afterwards can be troubling. But this case is truly great as once it is closed, does not allow steam and other oils to get to the screen. I had a cheaper case in the past, which did. And I came to know of the issue when I accidentally broke my screen and had to get it replaced. The technician working on it informed me of the water inside the display. Luckily I have not faced the issue with this one. You can check out their leather cases for the iphone or the samsung galaxy or some other phone you may have. They are highly reliable. ",
