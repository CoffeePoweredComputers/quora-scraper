            "answer_text": "Future of an automobile engineer is very bright. Even if we say engines are replaced by motors that is fully electric vehicles still an automobile has a lot other things which needs engineering and for that we need engineers. Even if there is rise in self driven vehicles still we need automobile engineers for it. And automobile engineering is not limited to cars trucks and buses. There is a big market of construction site vehicles which have large industrial applications. For example, road rollers, JCB, tractors, other earth moving equipments. Farming equipments like harvester and many similar things to it. All comes under automobile branch and have wide variety of application and at least for the coming 100 years I dont see any jobless automobile engineers. The reason we are seeing jobless engineers is because in the last decade there have been number of new engineering colleges with very poor education. Students from such colleges whos basics aren't good don't get hired. My advice for you is if you really want a job in automobile field. Expand your horizon widely. While doing engineering pay attention to all basics of studies you should know all the formulae and derivatives. Your industrial exposure should be good. You should be aware of the new concepts and technologies of the field. Edit 1: 25/05/2017 This answer has been sent to 1000 plus people in quora digest. ",
