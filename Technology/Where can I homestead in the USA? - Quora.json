            "answer_text": "As a lifestyle choice, you can homestead anywhere in the United States. Homesteading is simply living a life of self-reliance/self-sufficiency while living off the land. Homesteading, however, also has a legal designation that is sought for tax purposes. This is where each state approaches designation of a property a homestead differently. The owner and/or the property may have to meet certain requirements before the State will designate the residence a homestead, ultimately reducing the property tax or conferring other property benefits to the owner. Depending on the State, you may have to submit a series of forms each year to retain homestead status. www.campfirehomesteading.com/blog/homesteading-rights-not-equal ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t become a homesteader in the US any more. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ended homesteading. The only exception to this was in Alaska, which allowed homesteading until 1986. See: Homestead Acts - Wikipedia In Canada, you can still get homestead land in Yukon Territory. Free land is only available for Canadian citizens and permanent residents who have been living in the Yukon for more than a year. Don\u2019t rush out to homestead land up there unless you know how to grow crops in sub-Arctic conditions. See Yukon Agricultural Land Program: Energy, Mines and Resources ",
