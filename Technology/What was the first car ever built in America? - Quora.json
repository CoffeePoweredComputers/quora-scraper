            "answer_text": "As I recall, two bicycle repair mechanics: J. Frank and Charles Duryea of Springfield, Mass., made the first successful American automobile in 1893, then won the first American car race in 1895, and went on to make the first sale of an American-made car the next year. By the end of 1896, they sold 13 vehicles. The car had a 1-cylinder, 4 HP engine.  By 1899, there were 30 US car manufacturers who produced almost 2,500 automobiles. ",
