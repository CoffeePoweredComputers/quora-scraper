            "answer_text": "Surveillance: n. very intense and detailed observation of ((a human(s) who is frequently suspected of criminal and/or subversive behavior) and/or a subset(s))) Subversion: n. trying to radically change or destroy a human organization(s) Ideally we should only have surveillance of humans who are suspected of criminal and subversive behavior. Ideally the privacy of law abiding citizens should not be under surveillance because we may have personal or commercial secrets which give us a competitive advantage over others. The world is a very competitive place where almost everyone is trying to survive and prosper in their own manner. Unfortunately due to an increase in immorality in western society everyone is suspected of criminal and subversive activities and there will soon be cameras and microphones almost everywhere including personal homes and buildings housing human organizations. Eventually we can all look forward to the day when we will have physical implants on our bodies to monitor our every movement, communication, and thoughts. Fear of getting caught or saying the wrong thing will guide our behavior and not an impulsive moral code with which we have been indoctrinated as young offspring. This is a scary prediction of what kind of a future awaits future generations if we all succumb to an automaton type of existence where we are all led like sheep through our daily lives doing everything which authority figures request from us. A true master slave relationship in society may eventually exist between the ruling and ruled class but the truth is that we are already slaves of human propaganda which permeates society and deceives almost all the humans in it and predictably will only get stronger with the passage of time. I am also guilty of subversive activity because I am trying to radically change society in this world by publishing the truth as I see it. Fortunately the truth is not something the general public wants to hear nor will I make any money publishing the truth so that the power structure has little to fear from my writing because money is power and I don\u2019t think I will have enough of it in my lifetime to make a significant impact on the world. Words and ideas are sometimes more powerful than money or the sword so I am not entirely convinced that my writing will not influence more than a handful of human lives for the better. ",
