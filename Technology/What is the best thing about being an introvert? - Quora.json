            "answer_text": "Ricardo, I no longer answer questions about introverts or extroverts, but I will answer yours. I am an introvert so my response comes from that perspective. Firstly the answer is a resounding NO. There is nothing bad or negative about being an introverts. It does not make us different as human beings. Does being left-handed or right-handed suddenly make you less or more of a person? It\u2019s the same with being an introvert or an extrovert. My children are either introverted or extroverted, and I can confirm that they are no different to anyone else. And, by the way, they are all highly successful individuals, they are all university graduates, and they are all highly regarded as professionals in their sectors as well as in the community and our society, for the work they do. What\u2019s bad about that? Their interaction with people of all kinds, regardless, is highly appreciated and they have been honoured with recognition in their communities for the contributions to society in general. My youngest daughter just returned from the USA about 3 weeks ago, as world champion in her discipline. What\u2019s bad that?. Recently, there has been a spate of questions on Quora about introverts and extroverts, and for the life of me, I cannot imagine why this is suddenly flavour of the month! Except for one obvious fact, of course. Ignorance! Lots of ignorance. Instead of doing some basic research, people rush to Quora as if they are going to get the definitive answer to their questions. Quora is not an academic platform, so what they are going to get are lots of unsubstantiated responses, mixed in with a few from professional people, like psychologists who can provide a decent response. But, this is not where you are going to find informative, reliable information. I\u2019m speaking as an introvert, from my personal perspective and stance, and my experience with raising children in a very normal and balanced family. If you really want information of substance, meaningful responses, completely devoid of guesswork and idiocy, then speak with a professional. But, I repeat, there is nothing bad or negative about being either an introvert or an extrovert. Maybe we all just sleep on different sides of the bed!!! ",

            "answer_text": "There are many misconceptions about introverts like they are antisocial, unfriendly, shy, lonely. But in many cases, being an introvert can actually be an asset. Introverts are the people who gets energy by spending time alone. And then they can go out into the world and connect really beautifully with people.
