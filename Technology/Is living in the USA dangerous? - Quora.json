            "answer_text": "Is living in the United States dangerous. NO, just because you hear about the shootings and all the other negative stuff everyone from around the world says about us, it doesn\u2019t mean that your gonna get shot on the streets or anywhere. I\u2019m sick and tired of all these people treating the United States and it\u2019s people like shit. Yes I know we are not perfect, but then again neither is Europe or Canada. No country is perfect everyone has people who act stupid and selfish. The rest of the world needs to realize that all of the United States is not what they say it is. The media is only going to of course tell you everything negative about us, you have to see it for yourself instead of being so quick to judge all the time. The one thing that makes me think is that people from Europe always seem to think they are better or smarter than us. In reality each and every country is just like each other. Nobody in this world is perfect not the Americans, Canadians, or Europeans. Everyone has a side that they would get hate for. The United States of America is not a bad place like everyone assumes it is. Americans are some of the most friendly people you will ever meet, we as Americans are just like everyone else in this world. Like I said before America is not great and neither do many American citizens think it is either. Another thing to know is that not every American thinks they are above everyone int he world that is just utter bullshit that people say to make us all look bad. The United States is not the only culprit either when it comes to shit going down in the world. Europe is just as responsible for their own shit that they cause which by the way everyone makes mistakes so don\u2019t go saying I\u2019m just bashing on all of Europe or any other continent. Americans when maybe not everyone here are just as mart as anyone else in this world. So to answer your question no America is not a dangerous place to live, though it may have all these problems that occur I know for a fact that Europe and a whole bunch of other places in this world have just as much shit wrong them as anyone else. You ask me Europeans are just as rude, and ignorant as us here in the United States. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are referring to violence\u2026 no, not really. The only guns I have ever seen have been carried by the military, police, or hunters. So if you do not want to get shot, do not invade, commit a crime, or look like a whitetail deer.  (don\u2019t be this!) I contend the most dangerous part about living in the US is its weather. Sure, you get the occasional torrential rain from a hurricane such as Harvey, but it is the everyday weather that can kill you, too. The summers in most of the US are extremely hot. There are very few places in the US that do not regularly see 100\u00b0F/38\u00b0C temperatures at least once during the summer months. And when you do, more than likely it is extremely humid, as well. With that extreme humidity, the chances for convection thunderstorms are always prominent. Although not as large or devastating as the aforementioned hurricanes, they produce a lot of rain locally. They also indicate a greater chance of a tornado being produced.  The winters for the northern half of the US are also dangerous. Temperatures well below freezing are frequent - usually in the 0\u00b0F/-17\u00b0C area. And those are not the extreme temperatures. It can get to -30\u00b0F/-34\u00b0C fairly easily.  And there are many parts of the US that see both of these extremes. In most of the US, you have to pay attention to the daily weather report, otherwise you are taking a big chance. ",
