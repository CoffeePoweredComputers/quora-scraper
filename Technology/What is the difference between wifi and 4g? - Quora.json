            "answer_text": "4G LTE is a service offered by cellular operators, making use of LTE architecture (with an eNodeB connecting to a Mobility Management Entity, serving gateway, etc.). Cellular operators generally make use of licensed radio spectrum at various frequency bands, generally ranging from 450 MHz to 5.9 GHz (and with many blocks licensed between 700 MHz and 2.1 GHz), to deliver LTE. An LTE modem in a mobile device or other user equipment is required to authenticate with and transceive LTE services. Signaling and authentication is increasingly performed by the Diameter protocol.  5-GHz Wi-Fi makes use of the 802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax, or another protocol standard. Channels used range from 4.91 GHz to 5.925 GHz. The vast majority of these channels are unlicensed and within the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, with strict regulations concerning radiated power. The protocol, carrier-sensing rules, and hardware all differ from LTE. As an example, a smartphone would modems and transceivers for LTE that are separate from its Wi-Fi radio module. Certain LTE specifications allow for usage of several ISM frequency bands also used by Wi-Fi channels. LTE-U and License Assisted Access (LAA) operate in these 5-GHz bands, using different carrier-sensing methods to determine if a channel is idle before transmitting (\u201cListen Before Talk\u201d or LBT). Depending on the country, LBT may or may not be required, which could potentially create interference for Wi-Fi users and reduce their transmission-success rates. ",

            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi is just a wireless network created by a router or by a smartphone. But the thing which matters is the broadband speed which is the source for the router. 4G cannot be compared to broadband connections, as broadband is more reliable and maintains a constant speed(if you have opted for 5Mbps you will get 5Mbps day and night). Whereas this is not the case in 4G, it depends on your smartphone\u2019s compatible LTE bands. Then the ISP too, how many people are connected to tower which you are connected to, plus the coverage in the area you are using 4G. As a bottom line : 4G cannot be strong, but could be fast. ",
