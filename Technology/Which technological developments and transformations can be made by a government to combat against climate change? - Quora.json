            "answer_text": "and as always i must chime in and say no there are not any tested solutions put fourth by engineers and most of the solution theories they have floated all have the fatal flaw of no off switch. we would need to come up with another solution later to deal with the problem created by the engineers. what we do have that is proven is to put the damned carbon back in the ground the way it was put there in the first damned place. make/restore wetlands and stop cutting our forests and jungles down. nature has done this before and if we get out of the way, it can do it again. it is the only proven method we have on a global scale. but what the hell! machines and brute force have gotten us to this point why not use them again\u2026. it\u2019ll really work this time. you cant use the same thinking that got us here to get us out of here. somewhere along the line you have to take into account that we are killing off the life support system and suddenly forcing a large chaotic system that has inertia back the way it came might just cause more problems than it solves. every thing has an effect in a chaotic system, its kind of the point of it all. but by all means lets take the word of a little desktop box as gospel in engineering an entire planet. lets not address any of the other things or the reason why we are here, instead we use a hammer and dont worry about the results.

            "answer_text": "Government didn\u2019t deliver the first railroads, smart phones, cars or light bulbs, so I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re looking to them for clean technology innovation. The first ever research quantifying how to shift to an economy that consumes greenhouse gases instead of emitting them was released in April 2017. Solutions | Drawdown One of its key findings was that the top 80 currently practical solutions for getting to drawdown (drawing GHG out of the atmosphere) within 30 years were all open to business/community collaboration today. And there\u2019s a further twenty \u201ccoming attractions\u201d close to being ready. 2017 is also the year that Apple joined The Circular Economy and Google launched a renewable energy startup (geothermal), both following the lead of corporate climate leaders like Interface and Dell. If you\u2019re in government and want to accelerate this economic transition, then Drawdown\u2019s prioritised solutions list is a good starting point. Summary of Solutions by Overall Rank | Drawdown If you\u2019re not in government and you want action, then take an entrepreneurial look at the same list and find your own opportunities to do well by doing good. Beware of succumbing to Bystander Effect and the media mythology about cost, consumer guilt and government action. If you can run a project, you can be part of the fun - and part of delivering the savings of $74 trillion in costs avoided that Drawdown\u2019s 70 advanced researchers estimated to be available over the next 30 years.
