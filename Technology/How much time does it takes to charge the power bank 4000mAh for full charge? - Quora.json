            "answer_text": "It depend of 3 things: The real unit of the capacity of the power bank. Internally a power bank use lithium cells working with voltage between 2.4 and 4.2 V. As the charge input and the output have a voltage of 5V there is a charge regulator in input and a boost converter at output. In most power banks, the constructor give the capacity of the internal lithium cell instead of the output capacity. it means that most power bank labelled 5000 mAh has a true capacity measured at USB output close to 3200 mAhthe efficiency of the charge regulator and the efficiency of the cell itself which is usually between 85 and 95 %, and the algorithm use for topping cell(s) load. When loading a Li-ion cell there is two phase: a constant current phase where the load given to the cell is : current X efficiencies X time, and then a topping phase those duration depend of regulator algorithm, usually between half's an hour and one hourthe maximum current that can deliver the power supply Imaxat the end the loading time is Imax / labelled_capacity * (V moyen cellule/5) / load_control_efficiency + topping_time for instance I have a power bank labelled 5000 mAh from Amazon the real capacity at USB output is around 3300 mAh with a 2A loader the charging time at full current is 1h40 and the charging time for a 0 final current (fully loaded) is 2h20.
