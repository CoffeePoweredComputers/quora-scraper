            "answer_text": "HP Elitebooks & Latitude 7 series. My elitebook 840 is about 5 years old and retains 80% of its battery capacity (4 hours max now vs 5 hours when new in i7 and switchable graphics configuration on 45wh battery, now battery states it has 38.5Wh capacity left) . All hardware works except fingerprint reader misses sometimes when it is dead cold (it is cold due to metal casing). My friend has an 8470p (a model launched a year or 2 before mine) and it works and has 2 hours of battery life on win 7 and 1 hour since I installed win 10 (though it is because I haven\u2019t installed proper chipset and graphics drivers on it). All and everything works on both our laptops. Mine has a matte black lid which seems full of scratches but its finish is like a very fine blackboard so rubbing each scratch by finger heals it. And I installed latest bios update today which other than containing intel spectre security bug update also provides other fixes which means it is still supported by hp today. Now waiting on latest amd graphics driver as current ones are 6 month old now and those on amd\u2019s website don\u2019t work with switchable graphics. Dell latitudes have better keyboards because those are similar to traditional desktop keyboards though HP has best island style keyboards. My typing speed is 70 wpm average if I know what I\u2019m gonna type (faster than I can think as English being my non native language, my best was 90 wpm) on my laptop. 8470p has a better keyboard. People say HP laptops overheat. Wrong, HP Laptops allow performance. My cpu and gpu has been upto 90 degree C (shutdown occurs at 99 C) yet other components that maybe affected by heat remain cold (at 90 C, battery was at room temperature, hard disk is adjacent to battery so slightly hotter maybe but only due to heat expelled by itself and not from either gpu or processor.) I don\u2019t find newer thinkpads as tough as other competing laptops except for t440(I guess) carbon model. IBM designed and early lenovo thinkpads were monsters though, same is the case with newer 14\u2033 elitebooks (no maintenance hatch even) but still better than most) ",
