Indeed it has good performance and camera for the price but it is not at all durable. Just don\u2019t let it fall from more than roughly 3 feet. ",

If you play memory consuming games then it will last for 2 years. So it\u2019s totally depend on uses. Now a days people change the bikes according to trend. that\u2019s only mobile. no one is perfect. Thanks ",
