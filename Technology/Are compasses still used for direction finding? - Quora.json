            "answer_text": "Of course they are used for navigation, especially in conjunction with traditional paper maps. Google Maps hasn\u2019t reached that coverage level yet. It doesn\u2019t cover much of the world (nothing on oceans, deserts, forests etc.). It covers only the areas that have recognizable roads (even that is not covered 100%). It is also possible to navigate long distant voyages over oceans with the help of maps, stars and a sextant, and seafarers still use this method. On land, magnetic compasses used with maps provide navigation - those who travel to areas that are not covered by Google Maps or Garmin and such devices still use them. ",
