            "answer_text": "Manufactured in the home and be a competitive price to the market? Not many things. It has to be a unique market and a product with a high perceived value. I have sold LED lights and staffs to Renaissance Faire people for a while. A Merlin\u2019s Staff sells well. Since they don\u2019t always have electricity high power LED lanterns sell. Art work with electronics might sell. Maybe star constellations with LEDs. Various colored LEDs for red giants (Taurus) or blue giants. Flickering or fading LEDs are on the market. Multicolored fading ones for variable stars. Electronic Goldmine has a lot of flickering, blinking and fading LED of all colors. Orion would have a popular recognizable pattern with a good variety of stars in it. Most people would not recognize Draco or Taurus. ",
