            "answer_text": "The science fiction in movies and tv of holographic phones and screens looks cool but in reality no , it would suck with the exception of being in a dimly lit room . In daylight if outdoors or even in a brightly lit room the image would be unusable . Its hard enough to view things now on screens unless the brightness is way up . Take a flash lite and hold it to the light sensor on your phone for a few seconds and watch the screen become bright . Now think of how hard that is to see in daylight under regular usage . A hologram is see through , in a dim room they look great , but are completely washed out in bright light . There have been displays in some places that have tried and to so success but are placed were the light won't be so bright or it is in front of a dark background . Contrast is the key here . The battery drain would be huge . Way more than what could be useful now . Not until we find a better way in display efficacy will the tech become available . Maybe it will happen but just like flying cars I wouldn't hold your breath for it . ",

            "answer_text": "Capability to build something and market acceptance are two different things. Google Glass is a revolutionary product, but almost no where to be seen. Apple Watch should be a nicety to Apple fans, but not every IOS fan is in favor to the wearable. Nintendo Wii was a nice concept, but people only got it for curiosity. I only turned on my Wii about five times since 6 years ago. I am for sure do not like the idea that others can see what I am browsing, who I am calling, personal info such bank account and so on in hologram. I will never use holographic mobile phone, even when it is available. Maybe as PC at home. But again I am just a traditionist and maybe just a small percentage of current mobile users. ",
