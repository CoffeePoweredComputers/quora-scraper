Compact, adjustable, and requires only minimal power. Caveat: not a full-on SWU fanboy here; it\u2019s possible lightsabers require some element of Force-manipulation, that is, they must be operated by a living, sentient, being. I\u2019m going to ignore that. \u201cPaging Mr. Musk, Mr. Elon Musk to the white courtesy telephone, please.\u201d \u201cMusk here.\u201d \u201cHi, Mr. Musk, we made your light-cutting things, they work exactly as you specified. We\u2019re ready to go ahead with full production.\u201d \u201cExcellent, you\u2019re fired. Tell your replacement to redesign my Tunnel Boring Machines and refit the steel cutting heads with light-cutting thingies. Your check is in the mail.\u201d A tunnel boring machine (TBM to you) using lightsaber technology would be limited only by how quickly dross can be removed from the tunnel face. Drilling tunnels could literally be done at nearly freeway speed (and even in Los Angeles, freeway speed is fast enough for a TBM.Dentistry. No more drills. (Think about that.)Art and sculptureIndustrial-scale metal cutting\u2014no more snapped CNC blades! Yes, water-cutters and plasma torches are pretty damn fast\u2014but both need a lot of support system (blade lubricant, waste handling, water supply), and both use a simply obscene amount of energyDemolition.The list goes on and on.
