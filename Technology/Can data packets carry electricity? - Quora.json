            "answer_text": "I am good in Networking & bad in Physics & Electronics. Let me try to answer this question. I don\u2019t think data packet can carry electricity. because data packet is not any capacitor or battery where you can store the electricity. But other way around is possible. that is electricity can carry data packet. yes you read it right , when you try to sent data packets over wired channel ( Except OFC) your data is travelling in the form of Electricity. Thank you Pradeep.G ",
