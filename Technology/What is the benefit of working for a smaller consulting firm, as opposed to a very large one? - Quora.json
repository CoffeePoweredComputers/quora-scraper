            "answer_text": "I have had the benefit of working at large and small consulting firms over my 40-year consulting career. Travel was not an issue except for my first job in consulting, where I worked for a small firm specializing in State and local government consulting. Advantages of Working at Small Consulting Firm In no particular order: In many cases, are given more responsibility earlier in career. An example is business development.In many cases, may be able to stand out and be recognized more on performance.May find it easier to move between practice areas. This is offset somewhat by the fact that there are a greater number of practice areas in a large consulting firm, and more projects which may involve several disciplines.In most cases, there are fewer required approvals of work.Lower administrative overhead may increase competitiveness for certain types of work.Less competition to advance and absence of up or out policy may reduce stress.Disadvantages of Working at Small Consulting Firm In no particular order: There may be less diversity, breadth and size of consulting engagements.Less availability of resources- people and information.Usually fewer training opportunities.Usually lower compensation and benefits.Less name recognition with clients.Exit opportunities may be less than for larger consulting firms.I could list more advantages and disadvantages, but I think I\u2019ve covered the major points. As to whether it is better to work for a small consulting firm before or after a large consulting firm, I see no clear benefit to either order. ",

            "answer_text": "Much like everything else in life, with every choice made there is a trade-off. Benefits Better visibility, more responsibility and direct accountability of the engagements and their outcomes.You get to achieve 3\u20135X more in 1/3rd the time than a consultant from a reputed consulting practise. This means you are able to showcase more value to the client. Hence you can create your brand and increase your dependence with certain clients.A solution if not delivered & managed End to End may not be so effective. Bigger firms shy away from a lot of implementations and operational issues. They hide behind the tag of \u201clow-value\u201d work. In reality, those are difficult problems to solve. Smaller firms offer a lot of such challenges and one can actually build a reportoire around that.Gains can be higher too in terms of share of the pie created and going up the ladder. I know of a few individuals who were able to become a partner from a consultant in 5\u20136 years flat.You can truly practise your entrepreneurial flair working in a smaller set up. You raise a problem and mostly you'll end up solving the problem too.Hope this helps. ",
