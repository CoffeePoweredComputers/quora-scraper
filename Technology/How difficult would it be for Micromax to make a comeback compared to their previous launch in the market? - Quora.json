            "answer_text": "Well, to answer your question we would like to say things will depend on two conditions. They launch online only value for money smartphonesThey launch offline centric smartphone with more investment on marketing.In both the cases they will attract decent number of buyers due to current situation, where many people are boycotting Chinese products and want to buy an Indian alternative. This will help the brand to get initial boost, but this will not remain for long time. But, if they went for online only decent products with aggressive pricing, timely software updates and good after sales service then there is high chance for the company to get good amount of market share in the coming months and even this will help the company in a long run.

I would be amazing for Micromax to become a king in Indian smartphone market. I have no idea why Micromax isnt launching any kind chinese smartphone competers into market. This would change Micromax\u2019s fate. I feel like this present situation is a golden chance for micromax. ",
