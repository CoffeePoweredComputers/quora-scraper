            "answer_text": "They did work on a faster 4G. First, there was LTE and more recently LTE-Advanced or LTE+. LTE+ uses the same basic communication format but was able to squeeze more speed, but now in order to go even faster, there is 5G New Radio (NR). This required changes that make it somewhat incompatible with LTE, to get better, and not just at a faster speed. All I ever hear about from regular people is that they only understand and perceive that 5G is faster. Thus, that is all they talk about. There are 8 metrics that 5G improves over 4G and they are not all related to a faster speed. Even many of the experts have the same continuing myopic focus on the mobile device that\u2019s 10 inches in front of them, i.e. the smartphone. Meanwhile, the true impetus for 5G is to handle the tsunami of IoT devices with 10x lower latency, coverage density, longer range, etc that will be 10x times more in devices than the total world population.  Notice that \u201cArea Traffic Capacity\u201d is 100 times. ",

            "answer_text": "Good morning, I'm not technical, but for whatever reasons 4G LTE has a problem with capacity; it works great with a strong signal in an area with little congestion, but in crowded situations like at a concert or sports event or even on busy freeways in Los Angeles, the network gets very slow, even with a full signal. I guess with 5G\u2019s bandwidth or the frequency used, it is not as big of an issue. ",
