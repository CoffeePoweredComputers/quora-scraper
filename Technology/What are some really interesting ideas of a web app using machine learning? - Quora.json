            "answer_text": "Top 5 Machine learning project ideas for Beginners 1. Iris Flowers Classification Project Project idea \u2013 The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals. This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower. 2. Emojify \u2013 Create your own emoji Project idea \u2013 The objective of this project is to classify human facial expressions and map them to emojis. We will build a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions. Then we will map those emotions with the corresponding emojis or avatars 3. Housing Prices Prediction Project Project idea \u2013 The dataset has house prices of the Boston residual areas. The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. It is a good ML project for beginners to predict prices on the basis of new data. 4. MNIST Digit Classification Project Project idea \u2013 The MNIST digit classification project enables machines to recognize handwritten digits. This project could be very useful for computer vision. Here we will use MNIST datasets to train the model using Convolutional Neural Networks. 5. Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning Project idea \u2013 There are many datasets available for the stock market prices. This machine learning beginner\u2019s project aims to predict the future price of the stock market based on the previous year\u2019s data. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A:Create an App that tracks the users time on a particular website or other app.let the app notifies the user if the user is overusing a website like people are so involved in Social networking sites that they forget other things.This app is more like an assistant but for a start It can be good and useful for those who are very much distracted by social websites/games/music etc.The app can be made to learn the users track record as to what the user is mostly using and if a user overuses a website or game etc. the app should notify the user .\"You are spending too much time on this.\"Would you like to continue?More like a Mom na?The app may seem to be annoying but it is very much useful concept that can be build.you may get more strict with the app and let the app block the website for 5 minutes or 10 minutes or even hours :p (depending upon users setting) Look,this will be very helpful during studies,exams,while doing important projects etcand it is just a suggested app that has very much to do with machine learning.Good luck ",
