            "answer_text": "Any Windows laptop will support two screens \u2013 at least, I\u2019ve never heard of one that won\u2019t. Supporting three screens can be just as easy, or much trickier. It depends on the laptop, the graphics card (or integrated graphics), the graphics drivers, and perhaps the amount of memory available. There\u2019s no easy way to tell in advance. However, if you search online for your exact laptop, you may find that someone has already tried it, and this is probably the best guidance you can get. Some laptops will support two external monitors if you can find a way of plugging them in. For example, you could plug one into an HDMI port and the second into a VGA port. This is not quite as good as using two HDMI ports because HDMI and VGA are different video standards. The two screens may have slightly different colour renderings, or other differences (brightness, contrast etc), which could be annoying. Alternatively, if your laptop has a DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort, you can buy a splitter or multi-monitor hub that will drive two or three screens. These are usually used to \u201cclone\u201d screens, but Windows should be able to set up an extended desktop that bridges two or more screens. Using USB If your laptop only has one video port, you can use a USB display adaptor instead. Amazon searches find lots of examples, none of which I\u2019ve ever used. From a position of ignorance, I looked for better-known brands such as Plugable, Kensington and Climax Digital, but readers with experience of multi-monitor laptops are welcome to suggest alternatives below. Advertisement I expect you will need an adaptor that includes an external graphics card. One example is the Plugable UGA USB 2.0 to DVI/VGA/HDMI Adaptor, which costs \u00a337.95. (Although the spec says it supports Windows and Linux, it is clear from the Amazon comments than Mac OS X owners are also using it.) Alternatives include the ClimaxDigital USB 3.0/2.0 to DVI, VGA or HDMI Adaptor (\u00a329.99), the Plugable USB 2.0 to VGA/DVI/HDMI Video Graphics Adaptor Card (\u00a342.95) and the Kensington Universal Multi-Display Adaptor (\u00a365.99). You need one adaptor per USB monitor. Although an external graphics card will usually solve the three-screens problem, there may be limitations. The bulk of the work is still done by the laptop\u2019s processor, which can mean that everything else slows down. The extra screen may not be fast enough for gaming, but it should be fine for normal office purposes, such as email or news feeds. You will generally get better results with USB 3 adaptors, because USB 3 is about ten times faster than USB 2. However, it shouldn\u2019t make much, if any, visible difference if you\u2019re only driving one extra screen \u2013 see some of the YouTube demos mentioned below. Hub or dock You don\u2019t say whether you move your laptop around, though I assume you do. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s a very bad idea to use a laptop for work. You should replace it with a desktop PC, which provides more power for less money, is easier to expand or repair, and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 has much better ergonomics. With a standard laptop, it is impossible get both the screen and the keyboard in their optimum ergonomic positions without adding either a separate keyboard or a separate screen. The other problem with connecting multiple screens to a laptop is that you have to unplug them all when you take the laptop out of the office, and plug them all back in when you return. The solution is to use a docking station or a USB hub. For ergonomic reasons, I\u2019d recommend plugging an external keyboard and mouse into the hub, as well as your two screens. That way, you will only have to plug one USB cable into your laptop to make everything work. Advertisement For example, you could buy a Plugable UD-3900 USB 3.0 SuperSpeed Universal Docking Station (\u00a399.95), and use two external monitors via its two video ports: HDMI and DVI/VGA. Your laptop would provide the third screen. The UD-3900 is a USB 3 hub, but it will work with USB 2 ports on Windows laptops and tablets; it just won\u2019t be as quick. This particular range seems to be popular with Microsoft Surface Pro owners (which is how I know about it), but there are no doubt many alternatives. Plugable has a short YouTube video that shows an 8in Windows tablet \u2013 a Dell Venue 8 Pro, which only has a microUSB 2 port \u2013 working as a desktop PC with four monitors, an external keyboard and mouse. This demo uses a Plugable UD-3000 hub. Plugable\u2019s founder Bernie Thompson has also produced YouTube videos showing a multi-port USB 3.0 hub running seven monitors from a Windows 7 laptop and, more recently, running 14 monitors from one tiny Windows 8.1 PC, a Core i3-based Intel NUC. The increase came from changes in the DisplayLink technology used by Plugable and other suppliers, not from any changes in Windows. A hub is obviously not the cheapest option, in hardware terms. However, it is a lot cheaper than a course of physiotherapy. And, sad to say, I have had more than one experience of that. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Plug in the first monitor into the power outlet. Connect the VGA cable from the monitor to the VGA input on the laptop. 2. Power on the VGA monitor. Enter the system configuration preferences. On a PC, enter the system preferences by clicking the Start button, then \"Control Panel\" and \"Display.\" On a Mac, enter by clicking the apple icon. Once in the display settings screen, click \"Detect\" to have the laptop find the first external monitor. 3. Power off the second monitor. Connect the monitor to the computer through an available HDMI port. Power on the monitor. Enter the display preferences panel and detect the second external monitor. 4. Connect the second monitor to a USB slot, if no HDMI slot is available. Repeat the process of entering the display preferences screen to detect the monitor. 5. Install an extra monitor PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) card into a free PCMCIA slot on your computer. Power off the monitor, connect to the card and turn the computer on again. Detect the external monitor through the display program. 6. Connect a dual monitor expansion box to a USB port on your laptop. Install any additional software as required by the manufacturer. Connect the two external monitors to the expansion box and turn on the power. Run through the device detection, if needed, to have your laptop locate the external displays. ",
