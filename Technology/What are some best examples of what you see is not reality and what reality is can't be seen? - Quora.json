            "answer_text": "Do you know this plant?   Now, this is such a beautiful plant and it's name is pitcher plant. This is a carnivorous plant. This beautiful flower eats insects for its living. It attracts insects by its beautiful fragrance and then eats them by trapping them in itself. Now another flower,   Its probably more attractive flower than the above one. It\u2019s name is drosera. Beautiful name, isn't it? It is also a carnivorous plant but could possibly eat more than pitcher. Now a beautiful frog, trust me it does not kill anyone for its living.  This is a golden dart frog, it does not kill for living but could kill for self defense:) . This little thing has toxin all over his body who can kill by stopping impulses or by heart failure. This mushroom is also poisonous(don't know its name:))  Nature has it's own rules and one of the most important rule is bright colour living organisms may be poisonous. Do not touch or eat until you know about them. It is also applicable in our life. Some choices of our life are short and easy for a reason. For every attractive person or thing there is its own big disadvantage because no one is perfect in this world, believe me no one. This are some of my examples where reality hides behind beauty. Reality could always be found, sometimes it takes time. But, reality cannot be kept hidden. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question, Well the question is a best example of it in itself, because after all what we face in life is a reality, no matter how much illusion fools us. It varies from day to day life to professional or may on spiritual level. The best example of this is we all come alone and we all go alone, and we live alone as well, people around us are a part of an illusion which looks like a reality. And if you don\u2019t believe then test people, they will help you till certain extent because everyone is busy in engaging a comfortable life for themselves and they are ought to. People use (so called help) one another, and that is what whole world is doing, So ask your self are you building your life or helping others in building that of theirs. ",
