            "answer_text": "TRUE. Sorry, a little computer engineer humor. See if you treat your question as a conditional (SRAM OR DRAM) the answer would be True it it used either one or both. The actual answer is both. The \u201cRAM\u201d you think of is DRAM, but the cache in the processor itself is typically implemented as SRAM. ",
