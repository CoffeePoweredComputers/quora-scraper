            "answer_text": "You don't. The days of struggling to edit your video because your PC lacked enough power are over. If you have the equipment to shoot 4k stock video then do yourself a favor and either buy or build out a performance video editing server or PC and do it correctly. There is no reason to try to edit 4k video on a low end PC. It usually ends up with encoding errors or crashing the low end PC all together. If you cant afford an appropriate PC to edit 4k video (which isnt very much money anymore) then try looking up an online service that allows you to upload your stock video and use their servers to edit and encode. I have stopped listing specific services as some people take that to mean I am personally recommending those services. Instead you can search for these services online and find a budget servcie that fits your needs. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are trying to edit 4K on an extremely low end PC say 4 cores, 8GB RAM and using a HDD then you are going to struggle quite a bit. Here is the solution I used when I had my old PC: Proxies - Proxies are a good way for you to scrub through your content without having to deal in full resolution. Proxies are used to create lower resolution clips of your content so that it can increase performance during the editing process. So if you have 4K footage you can create proxies of that footage with a resolution of 1280x720 and whatever you edit on that proxy it will then be passed on the the origional media when exporting. ",
