            "answer_text": "People suffering.Health and life hazards on hospital patients, posed by HA Infections.Hospital function cost.UTI.All above there is the chance, could be faced by the use of the $14 VERTICAL jet bidet, instead of t. paper, for comfort, dignity, 100% cleaning, even on hemorrhoid presence, time sparing, ecology, water economy and mainly hygiene ( it reduces: fecal dust and so UTI, HA Infection, antibiotic resistant microbes, as MRSA etc).Related facts : \u201c99.000 DEATHS EACH YEAR IN USA FROM HA INFECTION. ABOUT THE SAME IS THE CONDITION IN EUROPE. A SIMPLE TEST COULD REDUCE THOSE HAI RATES. WHY CDC OR SOME OTHER HEALTH CARE INSTITUDE DOES NOT DO IT? WHAT DOES IT STOP THEM? Years before, dr Semmelweis saved millions of people since, by doing this simple test: In few words (to shorten the whole story), in order to show the need of hand sanitization in hospitals, he selected two similar clinics. In first one, drs and other staff were sanitizing their hands, while in the other, following the then usual practice, were not. The results are known. The death rates were much less in the first clinic. It is worth noting that Semmelweis's hypothesis, that there was only one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest. Semmelweis was outraged by the indifference of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European drs at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, believed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly twenty years after his breakthrough, he was committed to an asylum. Now, let return to our contemporary problem of high HAI rates. The causes may be many. But it seems one is more prominent: The human FECAL DUST in hospital wards. \u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left after wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through hair is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a 4-6 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density in the wards is a one more factor that increases their chance of developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers. CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust\u2019s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative. That means that nobody had done any relative research work, as anybody could see in internet. The test, I am suggesting is simply a repetition of about dr Semmelweis\u2019s method: a hospital, that takes all the specials measures to prevent human fecal dust forming and then a comparison is made on its HA Infection rates with those of other hospitals, in which no special care is taken. If the answer is positive, imposing those measures would naturally be the next step to all hospitals. On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong and very suspicious reasons, for somebody to ignore so many deaths, suffering and high hospital function cost.

            "answer_text": "Our unwillingness to control and reduce Co2 levels in the atmosphere. In the last 25 years half of all the C02 ever emitted has been produced. In spite of all the solar, wind, tidal power and the ever greater use of lower carbon nat gas instead of coal, C02 emissions continue to rise. We are rapidly heading for the cliff. The level of Co2 in the atmosphere is now over 400 ppm and increasing at an ever increasing rate. The last time Co2 levels were this high, sea level was 75 feet higher. The sea level too is rising at an ever increasing rate. We need an all out worldwide effort to save ourselves. Antarctica is melting and starting to breakup. As Co2 levels have gone up, temperatures rise, sea levels rise and weather becomes more intense. The hot will become hotter, the rain heavier, the dry dryer and the winds much stronger. To those paying even the slightest bit of attention; they can see this happening already. I feel sorry for the young folks alive now. It\u2019s going to get rough. The US military saw this as a national security issue 50 years ago. They saw the potential for reduced crop yields when things get extreme enough and wars over food and water. Despite ever growing evidence, somehow we as a species have gotten collectively dumber over the last 50 years. Denial isn\u2019t going to make America great. ",
