            "answer_text": "Sure, but I would think a news report should state if it is opinion and allow the other side to offer a opinion. Studies have been done and most of the news media has a 99 percent negative reporting on Trump, of course this is not a accident. fox news has a 40 percent negative reporting rate on Trump This is why the only news station worth watching is FOX NEWS, for over two and half years CNN and MSDNC have been carrying water for the democrat party on a story that has been proven completely fake, all the while patting one another on the back and giving one another Pulitzer\u2019s for their great investigative reporting , What a complete joke. The news media that has been reporting the Russian collusion illusion story\u2019s look like complete idiots. The only news station that got it right was FOX news , I am sure this gets some liberals in a wad over this but oh well, the truth normally does annoy them ",

            "answer_text": "Don't see why not. Newspapers have editorial and \u201cLetters to the Editor\u201d pages. Most news websites have comment sections. Of course, reporters have the responsibility of making sure that when they editorialize, their opinions are informed and are distinguishable from the story. One of the main problems with the legacy/MSM, is that all too often they present their ooinion, or just plain opinion not necessarily theirs, as news. They make their opinions the story. More often than not, their opinions are wrong, ignorant, and uninformed. Some good examples:\u201dThe walls are closing in\u2026\u201d, \u201cThe beginning of the end\u2026\u201d, \u201cTrump is a racist\u2026\u201d, etc\u2026 ",
