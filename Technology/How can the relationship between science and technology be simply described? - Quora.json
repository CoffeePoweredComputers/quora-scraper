            "answer_text": "The relationship between Science and Technology can be described as non-existent. There is no relationship whatsoever between Science and Technology. It is the mathematical so-called \u2018physicists\u2019 who convinced the world that Mathematics and Technology are related to Science and Physics. The problem starts with the definition of so-called \u2018science\u2019 that the mathematicians imposed upon the world. \u2018Scientists\u2019 don\u2019t seem to know what science is Dictionary.com defines science as: science: a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws\u2026 systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. The Wikipedia defines science as: science: a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe These are the notions just about everybody on the planet has of what science is or is supposed to be. Most of us learn this by rote in high school, college, or by browsing the internet. Nobody questions them. And yet, we do have a problem right up front in that no one has ever been able to define the word knowledge unambiguously. No one knows what it means to know. But even if someone were able to define this enigmatic word it wouldn\u2019t matter anyways. Is science about knowing? Is science a collection of knowledge? Is it like stamp collecting? Is this what scientists do? Accumulate knowledge to build useful gadgets? Or is that the task of technicians and engineers? Here we are in the 21st Century and not one so-called \u2018scientist\u2019 or \u2018mathematical physicist\u2019 at any university or think tank on the planet can tell you simple things such as how a magnet attracts another from a distance or the physical mechanism of gravity? So the results are clearly there. We have technology, but the \u2018scientists\u2019 and mathematicians who call themselves \u2018physicists\u2019 have no understanding of the simplest invisible mechanisms that Mother Nature uses to do her daily chores. Not one mathematician at any accelerator on the planet \u2013 CERN, SLAC, Fermilab, UNILAC, KEK, etc. \u2013 can illustrate the simplest atom for you. Not one professor at any university can give you a rational physical interpretation of ANY invisible phenomenon! Therefore, the question stares us in the face. What do these so-called \u2018scientists\u2019 and \u2018mathematical physicists\u2019 really\u2026 \u2018know\u2019? What is Science? Let\u2019s capitalize the word Science to distinguish it from the so-called \u2018science\u2019 that mathematical so-called \u2018physicists\u2019 do and define it rigorously and unambiguously\u2026 Science: rational explanations As it relates to the real, physical world, Science is about explaining mechanisms in a rational manner. The theorist is saddled with the burden of making a movie of the mechanism he proposes. We should understand the mechanism by merely watching the movie. Do we perchance need anything other than our eyes to understand how a brick broke the window? If you watched the movie of the brick going through the window, do you think you would understand how the glass ended up on the floor? Would you be able to explain it to a 10-year-old? You may think that Mother Nature\u2019s invisible mechanisms are a very different story. Phenomena such as gravity and magnetism are impossible to figure out, right? Or are they difficult to figure out simply because we can\u2019t see the invisible mediators? If a magnet attracts another from a distance, clearly there is some invisible, intangible entity between them mediating the transaction. Otherwise, the theorist is explaining the phenomenon with spirits and black magic. Likewise, if you jump and always fall back towards the center of the Earth, there is an invisible entity mediating between the Earth and you. As one professor put it:  So what can you think of that can pull on every atom of you while you\u2019re pulling on every atom of it and goes right through things? You clearly must brainstorm elongated mediators that interconnect atoms. Without some kind of object, the theorist is introducing spirits again and \u2018explaining\u2019 action-at-a-distance with miracles. Is Science an indefinite search? Once we figure out the invisible entities that Mother Nature uses to do her invisible tasks \u2013 light, gravity, magnetism, electricity, atomic behavior, cosmic phenomena attributed to magical black holes and dark matter, etc. \u2013 we\u2019re done with Physics. There is no more to learn about the Universe after we figure out the invisible stuff. Is it difficult? Is it beyond human comprehension? Let\u2019s see\u2026 The Universe consists of space, dead rocks such as planets and asteroids and comets, many stars, and clouds of gases. That\u2019s it. Now, how difficult can it be with all that inert, ordinary matter? We just have to figure out what invisible mediators prevent the Earth from flying out of the Solar System. So again, how difficult can that be? What is Technology? To figure out what technology is, we merely need to quote one of the leading technologists of the late 19th Century and early 20th\u2026 \u201cI have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\u201d Thomas Edison Technology is about developing useful gadgets by trial and error. You do not need to understand what a magnetic field IS. You simply need to be familiar with what it DOES and apply it in some way in the lab. Edison died without ever having the foggiest idea what a magnetic field or what electricity is. He simply tinkered in his workshop with behaviors of invisible entities that others had discovered and written about. Science is about explaining and understanding how \u2013 causes, mechanisms \u2013 the Universe works. Science is not about developing gadgets or calculating or making predictions. These last two are actually the tasks of astrologers. . . . ",

            "answer_text": "Technology results from engineering, invention, as creative processes and engineering has its foundations in scientific or physical, and mathematical principles. Engineering is about designing, planning and implementation of a solution that is fundamentally mechanical, electrical in nature. This is not to say that engineering is purely creative such as with invention or creation of something [patently] original, previously unseen, whether as material substance or revealing a suitable or superior process. Not all inventors are trained in engineering, for example. Tesla had studied engineering, to note Arguably both engineering and inventing involve an innate curiosity about how things operate or function, how things work; how things can be done differently through specialized methodology, problem solving, creativity or imagination. I\u2019ve hear engineering described as the process of using best known or available practices. These practices ultimately have a foundation in science (mathematics) and the application of mathematics in physics and chemistry and biology. Engineering principles can be demonstrated mathematically, either explicitly or by way of mathematical model, for example, modeling through differential equations, or scientific paradigm as both and metaphor. Engineering has a foundation of scientific principles derived from foundational physics. This is similar to how the field of medicine is also considered an art-form by many, also relies on innovation or serendipitous discovery; and has science as its ultimate foundation in scientific or clinical reasoning. Perhaps: Science \u2190 \u2192 Engineering - Invention - Improvement \u2190\u2192 Technology Plus other elements such as: a solution to a problem, either with pressing need or one previously not considered or visualized: machines, computers, bridges, energy and its transmissionpotentially useful: such asa specific tool for a specific task, including devices both mechanical and electronicdesigning and building a copycat or perhaps improved version of a device already inventedmechanical principles applied to making certain work tasks easier, better, or possible at all (the laborious or tedious), for example automationcomputational principles through algorithms which solve problems involving information and its processing, instead doing so regarding physical, material processes.requires creativity and is considered an art, much as science is often compared to art (Doing science is more art than science).the innovation becomes common or widespread in adoption or use to be considered \u201ctechnology\u201d as opposed to \u201cnovelty\u201d or \u201cimpractical\u201dmathematical principles serve as the foundation to support the creative reasoning involved in developing a new or improved technology.The meaning and usage of 'technology' is changing. I came upon an article on Pocket which describes the problem of how technology possibly is controlled or will be controlled, and by whom, once viewed as a commodity for the public good or as necessity, or even its own market index as a \u201csector\u201d in the jargon of market speculation. Addressing the problem of technology regulation requires a precise definition of technology, whose scope can include a carved stone wheel to a giant particle accelerator for research curiosities, leaving the definition as somewhat ambiguous especially because we can imagine that there is technology that is necessary or becomes necessary as policy, e.g. airbagstechnology that is convenient, useful but not dire to survival, e.g. computerstechnology that is frivolous and temporarily amusing yet clutter, e.g. Sharper Imagetechnology that is presented as beneficial but is not, e.g. the so-called Green revolution was beneficial mostly to petroleum corporationstechnology meant to destroy the planet and all life on it. e.g. nukesTechnology is not an easy term to capture within a single concise definition. The article describes technology sufficiently well in terms of its current significance and meaning in order to address the question of regulation of technology. \u2018Tech becomes a regulated industry - Benedict Evans (link to article) Technology has been the driving force of industry and modernization long before the industrial revolution. After AC electricity was invented and implemented by Nikola Tesla, technology has not changed that much. Not much has been new under the sun except information exchange and data science The game-changer for \u201ctechnology\u201d came about when information was quantified into units called bits and suddenly information became known to be a really real thing. I recommend a physics documentary called Everything and Nothing, it\u2019s on YouTube and does a good job explaining the realness of information. Technology is re-ified in a sense as a real thing or viewed similarly and therefore devices begin to drive whole industries that are powered by consumer\u2019s perceived need to \u201ckeep up.\u201d Mechanical technologies and even power generation have remained largely unchanged for a long time. The significant change to our meaning of the word technology occurred with computing power (processing capability and volatile memory capacity) sufficient to produce devices that more effectively deal with information and data structures, thus serving its usual purpose, as a tool, specifically for use of networked software, Silicon Valley type. For example here is an article that uses \u201ctechnology\u201d in it\u2019s current and common meaning or sense: How technology literally changes our brains The image for the article:  Thanks for reading ",

The technology changed and the reason it was able to be improved upon, is because we learned more science. Science is the word used to describe the breath of knowledge held by the human population. Thankfully, people are always trying and learning more things. The more they learn, the more the subject of science grows.

It is deduced truth. A possible truth, truth is that \u201cthings change\u201d and \u201cwe exist\u201d. Mathematics and the Universe are one in the same. Every approximate action observed in the Universe is the physical manifestation of proven mathematical perfect equations. Mathematical truth is all we have. We have no other truth. Life is different for everyone. The Normal Distribution Bell Curve( The Probability Curve) revels that Truth of the Universe. Biases \u201cnaturally occur\u201d.

If you are in the wrong spot at the wrong time, the curtain in the \u201cstage of life\u201d comes down. 100 billion Homo Sapiens have come and gone in the last 200,000 yrs. 7 billion currently exist. They will all be history in a measly 110 yrs. Very, very , very few have lived or will live the LaLa Life. You can like it or not. Universe does not care. There are no fairytales. There is no god. There is no luck. There are only probabilities. The fact that you even exist is a super small, small, small, small probability. ",
