            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence is just crawling into our life and affecting how we work and do our business. Some of us are not even aware about how it can be effectively utilised, and some of us are assuming this technology to be a threat. However, this technology isn\u2019t in the slightest bit as threatening as people think it is, although it is very new and it\u2019s changing the world faster than any technology has managed to up to this point.  Artificial Intelligence has significantly helped us in growing our businesses. Here\u2019s how: Smarter Email MarketingSome research shows that Email marketing has the highest return on Investment. So we all know how important email marketing is for a business. AI helps us to automate emails, these emails are sent on anniversaries, birthdays, whenever a customer creates account on our website, so on & so forth. Also it helps you in segmenting your customer list according to your needs. Effective Customer ServicesThe most effective way to engage your customers the most is by interacting with them directly. It is believed, people tend to understand what you do and what your business is about, when they get are told personally. Chat bots are the answer, which are enabled with the help of AI. Reduce Repetitive TasksYou can always eliminate the work load from your employees by freeing them from something that is need to be done regularly. AI helps you automate the process, and hence other employees can work on what is more important. Business ManagementFrom scheduling conferences and team meetings to programming business trips and decision-making support, AI can help with business management activities. One such example is DOMO, it is one of the fastest growing business management software company that helps company make decision faster. Finance and AccountingAccording to a research by Forbes, it is believed that in coming few years, most of the accounting work will be transferred to AI. It will be able to perform all accounting tasks. Currently, AI is helping to interrogate, assess and challenge the predictions that underpin the valuation of assets on their clients\u2019 balance sheets.  Research suggests that AI doesn't always perform best on its own. AI technologies are great at driving or even replacing the lower-level, repetitive tasks, but businesses often achieve the greatest performance improvements when humans and machines work together. ",

            "answer_text": "How does AI help business? Let\u2019s look at an example. HR processes despite having \u201chuman\u201d in the name can also be transformed into an automated AI operation. One of the core tasks of an HR department is hiring new employees. Decisions of this caliber may seriously affect the business of a company of any size. To minimize the risks, artificial intelligence can analyze all of the potential candidates and present you with the most optimal choice.  It can be based on their skills, need for a certain specialist in your organization, and even biographical facts. AI eliminates any bias a recruiter may or may not have. So will AI replace all recruiters? Not in the near future. While it certainly makes their job easier, the machine cannot yet tell whether or not a person will be a good fit. The company culture and interpersonal relationships are also huge factors in the hiring process. While AI is able to scrape for \u201cmanagerial experience\u201d it can\u2019t differentiate between a supportive and a tyrannical leader. The same principle works when applying AI to other business areas as well. One of the most substantial impacts is on the analysis of Big Data. Such huge amounts of data are impossible to process as accurately and effectively by hand. Often the work that can be done in minutes by AI may take months of human labor. As long as the information is objective, the results you receive have an extremely low margin of error. But that\u2019s just descriptive analysis. Behavioral and historical patterns provide you with even more useful insights. That\u2019s the most beneficial aspect of AI in business intelligence systems. More in article ",

            "answer_text": "1. Improving personalised shopping experiences Providing customers with personalised marketing increases engagement, helps generate customer loyalty and improves sales. This is why companies are putting so much effort into it. One of the advantages of using AI is that it is able to identify patterns in customers\u2019 browsing habits and purchasing behaviour. Using the millions of transactions stored and analysed in the cloud, AI is able to provide highly accurate offers to individual customers. 2. Automating customer interactions Most customer interactions, such as emails, online chat, social media conversations and telephone calls, currently require human involvement. AI, however, is enabling companies to automate these communications. By analysing data collected from previous communications it is possible to program computers to respond accurately to customers and deal with their enquiries. What\u2019s more, when AI is combined with machine learning, the more the AI platforms interact, the better they become. One example of this is AI Chatbots which, unlike humans, can interact with unlimited customers at the same time and can both respond and initiate communication \u2013 whether on a website or an app. It is estimated, that by 2020, 85 percent of all customer interactions will be taken care of by intelligent machines that are able to replicate human functions. The days of using a call centre look like they are coming to a close. 3. Real-time Assistance AI is also useful for businesses that need to constantly communicate with high volumes of customers throughout each day. For example, in the transport industry, bus, train and airlines companies, which can have millions of passengers a day, can use AI to interact, in real-time, to send personalised travel information, such as notice of delays. Some bus companies, for example, are already tracking the location of their buses and using AI to provide travellers with real-time updates about where the bus is along its route and its estimated time of arrival. Customers receive this information on the bus company\u2019s app. 4. Data mining One of the biggest advantages of using cloud-based AI is that artificial intelligence apps are able to quickly discover important and relevant findings during the processing of big data. This can provide businesses with previously undiscovered insights that can help give it an advantage in the marketplace. 5.Operational automation AI is able to operate other technologies that increase automation in business. For example, AI can be used to control robots in factories or maintain ideal temperatures through intelligent heating. In Japan, human-looking robots now serve as receptionists in some of the countries\u2019 hotels automating check-ins, booking services and dealing (in four languages) with customer enquiries. In retail, AI is also being linked with RFID and cloud technology to track inventory. In China, police forces use AI to catch criminals. The country has a vast CCTV network and AI uses facial recognition to spot and track suspects so that they can be apprehended. 6.Predicting outcomes Another advantage of AI is that it is able to predict outcomes based on data analysis. For example, it sees patterns in customer data that can show whether the products currently on sale are likely to sell and in what volumes. It will also predict when the demand will tail off. This can be very useful in helping a company purchase the correct stock and in the correct volumes. It is predicted that, within 10 years, the days of seasonal sales will be over as AI will mean there is too little leftover stock to sell off. This ability to predict is not just useful in retail. AI is also being used in many other areas, for example, in banking where it can predict currency and stock price fluctuations or in healthcare where, remarkably, it can predict outbreaks of infections by analysing social media posts. 7.Improve the recruitment process It may be bad news for recruitment companies, but AI is now helping businesses automate the recruitment of new employees. It is able to quickly sift through applications, automatically rejecting those which do not meet the company\u2019s personal specification. This not only saves time (or money spent on a recruitment agency), but it also ensures that there is no discrimination or bias in the shortlisting process. The AI programs available can even take care of the many administrative tasks of recruitment. Conclusion As you can see, AI systems provide businesses with a wide range of benefits, including personalised marketing, customer service, operational automation, inventory management and recruitment. And these are just a few of the many ways AI can be used. What\u2019s remarkable, however, is that many of the AI apps, which are designed specifically for cloud-based systems, are quickly and easily deployable. Companies whose systems are in the cloud can be benefitting from them in no time at all. Source: 7 Benefits of Artificial Intelligence for Business AI for Insurance Executives ",

            "answer_text": "AI is a scientific art of creating human-like intelligent machines. And is proactively being used in businesses everywhere. Apple is one big example. Any Apple product owner is very well versed with Siri, which is nothing but sheer AI. Siri is a voice interface that surfs through playlists, attend calls on your behalf, have entertaining conversations with you and much more. AI can be considered as a parent concept to many baby concepts, machine learning, robotics and many more. We will emphasize on artificial intelligence and machine learning in this post. 1. Can retarget customers with ads On E-Commerce Sites As a business owner, targeting the right set of audiences online is very important. Using machine learning, which is one of the most vital arenas of AI, proves to be of great advantage here. Machine Learning (ML) overtime learns user habit, behavior, preference and accordingly segments them for better targeting. For e-commerce sites, ML maps your audience, studies them and assists you with clever product re-targeting wherever your audience is on the worldwide web. For example, a potential customer searched for a mobile phone on your e-commerce website. He found a good handset on your site. He checked out the price, features and other specifications of that particular handset. ML studies this behavior and further retargets him by showcasing ads or other product promotions of the same handset on other websites he goes.  Also, machine learning can be used to target your customers at the right time so that they will buy. For this, ML finds out the time they are most active online and targets them at that time. 2. Chatbots can be used for Customer Service & Care Chat + Robot = Chatbot! The chatbot is a software that communicates with humans through text messages, answers their questions and even performs actions when asked to. Chatbots can be integrated with your website and mobile applications externally as they: Stay with you round the clock for prompt customer support.Empower your employees by assisting them.Promote quick customer call transfers. For example: When you call your service provider, most of the times you will hear a mechanical voice asking your perform certain actions like, press 1 for bill payments, press 2 to continue in English and so on.Chatbots are mainly used to stay in touch with your site users at every step. It is a great customer engagement and care tool of artificial intelligence in business! 3. Can Convert Visitors To Customers Using CRM AI is revolutionary when it comes to selling products to your customers! All that is needed for this revolution is your customers\u2019 data stored in your customer relationship management (CRM) system. CRM is actually a technique that compiles customers\u2019 information like their email, phone, & social media and their interaction with the company. When you integrate AI tool into your company\u2019s CRM: It analyzes your customer\u2019s dataSo, your sales team understand your customer betterIt predicts whether he/she will be lead or notFor example, the AI tool predicts that the customer is a lead by analyzing his personal details, interest, and activity. Now, you can turn this lead into a customer by targeting him with marketing strategies like promotional emails and various offers to increase their engagement. 4. Get Marketing Analytics with AI With artificial intelligence in businesses, you can market any of your products at a much lower budget. This is possible through AI tools that manage marketing campaigns. These tools analyze your ads\u2019 performance on various parameters which includes reach, users, bounce rate and more. The tools also prove helpful as they suggest campaign budgets, keyword bids and so on. Similarly, you can also pull out vital marketing metrics, for example, email sent, clicks and open rates, the best time to post, etc.. This data then enables you to increase your customer database and provide the best services to them at the perfect time! 5. AI can Build Customer-Centric Products You should know whether your customers like what you are selling or not. If not, you are missing out on ways to make your product better. Using tools of artificial intelligence in business helps you with this! For example, AI tool like Keatex shows customer feedback with green and red tabs. The tool basically alarms you with customer feedback you received for your product or service. The red tab indicates negative feedback and the green tab refers to all the positive feedback. Now that you know your product negatives and positives from your customers\u2019 point of view, you have the potential to change all the red tabs into the green ones quickly and easily using various efficient marketing strategies. Here are some of the ways Artificial Intelligence can be used in business. To read more interesting stuff like this:  ",

            "answer_text": "When considering AI adoption, it is crucial to first identify the right use case for your business. A lot has been written about AI and it is considered a buzzword in tech industry. AI can do a lot varying from customer experience to reducing churn. The key in looking for the benefits of AI is not in what other people think about it \u2013 it\u2019s about finding the value it can bring to your organization. My advice would be to reach out to more AI resources, get some inspiration and filter what is applicable to your company. Start with the following: 1.Predict future events and generate business insights Whatever question you need AI to answer, it can do it and it will keep getting better at answering. What movie will Jane like? Will customer X churn? Will this item sell out? AI can provide accurate predictions about future outcomes based on historical data. Artificial intelligence converts information into knowledge and even gives you insight into the future! Of course, AI is no fortune-telling technology but it can support your business with predictive analytics. Predictive analytics is a form of analysis with the use of machine learning \u2013 the algorithms analyze historical and current data to make predictions of future outcomes. With the use of relevant historical data AI can: reduces churn by identifying the clients who want to leave,increases sales by suggesting what the customer wants to buy and determines how much they will buy,identifies employees who are likely to leave the company,predicts demand for resources, product, and inventory,identifies the risk of breakdowns, failures, malfunctions, and errors.As an example, read this case study of one Polish telecom that used predictive analytics to reduce churn by over 20%. 2. Save time AI is automating routine process much like industrial era machines automated labor. It takes AI systems a short moment to make an informed decision \u2013 a human will need more time. It\u2019s an obvious time-saver. Let\u2019s have a look at the data from Deloitte\u2019s How much time and money can AI save government? report. The figure below illustrates the most time-consuming tasks of government workforce and the automation potential of these activities.  3. Save money Coming back to the example of government workforce time savings, Deloitte estimates that even low levels of effort behind AI adoption could save government workforces between 2 and 4% of all their labor hours. With medium involvement, AI and machine learning could bring savings of 13 to 15% of time requirements within five to seven years. And with strong support for AI adoption, the potential benefits are 27 to 30% of time savings within five to seven years. Look at the table below to see the numbers:  What\u2019s more, PwC Global estimates that by 2030, the potential contribution to the economy from AI will be 15.7 trillion dollars and the global GDP could be up to 14% higher as a result of AI. 4. Reduce error Artificial intelligence isn\u2019t error-free. It can make mistakes but generally speaking, it\u2019s much more accurate than humans. In many cases, the accuracy is around 99%, even for very sophisticated systems, such as Google\u2019s LYNA (Lymph Node Assistant) that achieved the accuracy of 99% and 69% sensitivity in metastatic breast cancer detection, according to VentureBeat. Artificial intelligence is not as prone to errors as humans are \u2013 its great advantage is that it makes decisions based on the available data only. 5. Enhance customer experience In the times when the market is extremely competitive, AI-powered solutions help create great customer experience which helps increase customer loyalty and boost sales. A study conducted by Zendesk shows that 42% of B2C customers purchase more after a good customer service experience, while bad customer service interactions result in 52% of customers not buying. 59% of shoppers who experienced personalization think that it has a big influence on their purchase decisions.

In the automobile sector, AI-equipped software and systems are helping to design the model and test the vehicle. 3D printings are helping engineers to look at the vehicle model in real-time, and make effective decisions. In other manufacturing side, companies are employing AI to deliver customized products to needy customers on time. I recently viewed a video on twitter platform, where a customer is entering the retail showroom and complete his purchase within seconds, and leave the shop, without making payment in real-time. Here the payments are done through mobiles using a QR scanner. The AI can also be used in the coffee vending machine and other vending machines. Facial recognition and gender recognition are used in the machines to memorize the customer's previous choices. When they approach the machine again, the system looks for previous data and brew coffee for the customer, literally automatically.

            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence allows machines to sense, comprehend, act and learn. Whereas Machine Learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. They both, together with Natural Language Processing (NLP) can transform any business and thus can help in solving many business problems. Lets see where you can use Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning in your business : 1. Detecting User Intent You can use Machine Learning together with NLP to identify the sentiment, language and topics from any given text. This can be useful in call centers or customer service department where you want to analyze customer interactions by using support tickets, emails, social media posts and phone transcription. 2. Classifying Images Correctly If you are manually classifying images then you know how time taking it is. But with AI and ML, you can classify large number of images appropriately in no time. Infact you can detect any inappropriate content without involving any human eye. It can be used to identify the objects, people, text, scenes or faces. So, if you want to try new generation of attendance system in your office then Machine Learning can detect, analyze, and compare faces for you. 3. Predicting Results No, Machine Learning is not a fortune teller but yet it can help you to predict the outcome of your activities. If you supply it past few years sales records then it can predict how much you are going to sell this year! The more the data, the better would be the prediction. It can also be used to predict the customer churn based on statistics and customer pattern. 4. Matching Candidates You can use AI and ML for matching the best resumes for your job requirements. With use of NLP and ML, you can easily classify the resumes based on experience, skills and regions. Infact you can automatically filter out all the in-appropriate resumes based on your rule sets and can select the best one that matches your requirements. 5. Analyzing Videos AI and Machine Learning can be used to analyze videos in your organization. You can do people counting, gender identification or even user tracking by analyzing videos in your office or store. Check the interesting Case Study where we did customer counting via webcam in retail stores in Australia. The analysis can be done on real-time videos or pre-stored videos in batches from a cloud storage. It can be used to automatically detect explicit or suggestive content in videos too. With the new set of frameworks and tools, gone are the days of costly and lengthy implementation of AI and ML applications. Now any experienced developer can design and deploy AI/ML application within two-three months time. And you need not to have big budget for such application as there are plenty of affordable API based options available for use. Amazon, IBM and Google are the leaders in this space but there are other small but very specific providers too like if you want to build chatbots then you can quickly use Wit.ai or Gupshup - Bot Builder Platform.

Since there is no information about your business, answering this is just a shot in the dark or a referral to something that might be generic enough to be a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d program. There are any number of AI type programs on the market today. There are any number of qualified programmers that can write a custom AI just for you (if you have enough money and time). There are any number of People like myself that would be happy to research the market for you if you want to provide more details about your question. Yes, AI helps businesses. I worked for a large company in the beginning of the internet as we see it today and during my time there we acquired a program that self-taught itself solutions to common questions from the field where the actual work of the company was active. It was a major help. Since then all sorts of AI enabled programs are running and they help business. ",

            "answer_text": " Coming-of-age technology, which is also referred to as artificial intelligence, has been sweeping across different spheres and triggering knowledgeable discussions regarding the fate of humanity. The current buzzword concerning AI is \u2018robots are taking over.' Is there truth to this assertion? If the findings of McKinsey Global Institute Report are anything to go by, certainly, the answer is yes. According to the study, by 2030, a large number of current employees will be required to learn new skills because machines will handle their duties. This is one of the challenges associated with the adoption of artificial intelligence. However, like the two sides of a coin, this technology portends positive outcomes for businesses. The primary ones are: Enhancing personalized shopping experiencesReal-time customer supportStreamline the Hiring processMinimize time wastageIncrease precisionReduced overhead costs| Enhancing Personalized Shopping Experiences It is a no-brainer that personalized marketing improves a brand\u2019s engagement with its clients, which translates into consumer loyalty, and better sales. This aspect is facilitated by the fact that AI can monitor consumption trends among consumers as well as their browsing habits because it can collect Big Data and analyze to facilitate the personalization of offers to the specific needs of each client. | Real-time Customer Support This technology is practical for enterprises that need to engage with high volumes of clients every day. For instance, airline companies that serve millions of travelers daily can use AI to send real-time alerts to the customers such as delay notices. Similarly, some businesses have already started chatbots on their websites to assist visitors to navigate the page. All this is possible because of the growing influence of AI in business. | Streamline the Hiring Process You may be surprised, but yes, AI is helping companies in the selection and recruitment of new staff. Primarily, AI can wade through several applications and rejecting those that do not meet the firm's requirements automatically. What does this mean for businesses? Essentially, using AI for recruitment is both cost-effective and time-saving because companies no longer require the services of a recruiting agency. Similarly, it eliminates cases of discrimination or bias during the shortlisting phase.  | Minimizing Time Wastage According to a report prepared by Red Letter Days for Business, workers in the UK commit over 400 million days annually on unproductive tasks. Likewise, a workspace research carried out by AtTask and Harris Interactive indicated that US workers only spend 45 percent of their time performing their core duties. What these studies imply is that business owners are paying employees for not working as much as they are expected. With AI, productivity in the workplace will be optimized. | Increase Precision Successful enterprises are built on practical decisions. Precise business intelligence facilitates good judgment. When data lacks accuracy because of mistakes, failure is always imminent. The risk of inaccurate data is enhanced for businesses that deal with large volumes of information. This is because humans are prone to errors. For corporate insights and information collection, AI will come in handy for most enterprises. | Minimize Overhead Costs Data from a US study shows that companies spent more than $70 billion on staff training and development. Apart from this obligation, they also incur costs related to staff benefits such as health insurance, paid vacations, and overtime payments that are geared towards improving motivation and productivity. Automating some of the duties with the help of AI tools means that companies can reduce their headcount, which translates into minimization of budgets set aside for employee benefits. ",

This course has a strong curriculum that ensures every candidate gets a deep understanding of the concepts of AI to implement it in their daily business requirements. The course has a flexible schedule in which one can learn the concepts during the weekdays and ask for doubts on the weekends. The classes are taken by faculty with years of experience and industry experts. At the end of the program, every candidate will be awarded a certificate from the University of Texas at Austin. The best thing about this program is that it doesn\u2019t demand any prior experience in programming. ",
