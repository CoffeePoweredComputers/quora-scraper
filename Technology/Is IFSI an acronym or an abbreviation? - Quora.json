            "answer_text": "Dear M. Anonymous, We already know IFSI is at least an abbreviation (all acronyms are abbreviations), but your real question is, \u201cCan this qualify for the vaunted title of acronym?\u201d There are multiple definitions for IFSI, so which one is yours? I cannot answer your question intelligently without knowing the context of this. Is it a government agency (from which country?), a company (again, which country or product), or something else entirely? See the list here.  However, since you have not told us where you saw this string of letters, we cannot know how the owners of your \u201cIFSI\u201d pronounce it. They might pronounce it as a word (IF-see), in which case it qualifies as an ACRONYM. Some well-known acronyms are NASA, radar (formerly \u201cRADAR\u201d), ASCII, NOAA, and scuba (originally \u201cSCUBA,\u201d an acronym for \u201cself-contained underwater breathing apparatus\u201d). However, IFSI could also be one of those alphabet soup creations that their owners spell out letter by letter when pronouncing it (\u201cI - F- S - I\u201d), in which case it is an ABBREVIATION but not an acronym. If it isn\u2019t already confusing, every acronym is also an abbreviation. The umbrella term is \u201cabbreviation,\u201d and acronyms are a subset of abbreviations. An acronym must be pronounced as a word. That is the only thing that differentiates the two labels.  Here is a tidbit about the acronym \u201cradar\u201d from Wikipedia: \u201cRadar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. A key development was the cavity magnetronin the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization.\u201d \u2014Sarah M. 8/10/2018 \u2014 I answered a truly similar question about IFFSI last night, so \u2014 apologies to my readers \u2014 this answer is an almost total ripoff of that one with minor changes. PRO TIP: Spelling counts, even for anonymous questions about acronyms \u2026  QUESTION: Is IFSI an acronym or abbreviation? ",
