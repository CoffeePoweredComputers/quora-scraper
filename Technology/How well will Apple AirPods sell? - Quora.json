            "answer_text": "It Will Happen Right Before Our Eyes Yesterday, September 16th, 2016 I conducted field research at 9 Apple Store locations around Southern California with the purpose to surface the desire of new iPhone 7 owners to acquire AirPods.  I had 9 researchers at 9 lines formed at 7 a.m. PDT. The research concluded at 2 p.m. PDT. This is part of an ongoing study I am conducting for a group of private parties centered around my Voice First hypothesis [1]. The early results are: On average one out of three iPhone 7 purchasers would purchase AirPods today if available (700 person sampling)Eighty Percent of iPhone 7 purchasers at the Apple Store at The Grove near Beverly Hills would purchase AirPods if available today (131 person sampling) AirPods were not available for purchase or pre-order on the release date of the iPhone 7 and may become available in October. Based on this early sampling I think the trend line will point to a few conclusions: AirPods will likely sell out for the holiday season of 2016AirPods will likely become a most coveted consumer itemAirPods will become available in a wide range of colors made from a wide range of materials including Jet Black, Matte Black, Gold, Rose Gold, Silver, Translucent, etc. Confounding Observers These conclusion will confound observers that rightly so present data and specifications on Bluetooth headsets that show other products will sound better. Some observers will also be confounded by the overt visual appearance of AirPods, e.g. \u201cThey look weird\u201d. However they would have missed the point that has driven Apple\u2019s success since their early inception shaped by the instincts of Steve Jobs. I wrote to this a few minutes after the Apple Event of September 7th, 2016, particularly the section on \u201cBrand Signaling\u201d [2]. On the choice of \u201cwhite\u201d cabling and ear buds of the first iPod head set: Apple literally overnight was able to distinguish uniqueness, exclusivity, quality and brand communicated by the White headphone cabling and ear buds. Over night this became a fashion statement. By 2002 the phenomena could be observed in large cities as people proudly presented iPod ownership via the brand signaling that was build into something as simple as the color of the cabling. AirPods are not about the height of the Audiophile experience. They are about a shift to a new computing platform I call Voice First [1]. In April 2016 I wrote about how the Voice First platform will span from the macro of an Amazon Echo to the micro presented in the form of the wood and aluminum ear monitors I presented in the article. AirPods present Apple\u2019s first step in this direction. The Voice First Platform they are creating will ultimately have no need to be tethered and will include Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS and Cellular radios. Of course this is on a 10 year arc but we are well on the way.  Thus viewing AirPods through the lens of an Audiophile product misses the point entirely. It is like viewing the iPhone as simply a cellular phone in 2007. It turned out to be more, far more. A few minutes after AirPods were announced I wrote [2]: AirPods Are The Beginning Of Apple\u2019s Audio Augmented Reality Platform Today (September 7th, 2016) marks the beginning of a new device platform centered around AirPods, advanced bluetooth audio and the elimination of the 3.5mm audio jack. This is also Apple\u2019s first big step into a Voice First platform centered around Siri. Although many will focus on the first take on what AirPods mean, the long view is quite fascinating, indeed a true paradigm shift. AirPods Represent A New Form Of Functional Jewelry. AirPods occupy a new space between an electronic accessory and jewelry\u2013functional jewelry. Wrapped into this is part actual functionality mixed in with the very personal and human need to present themselves to the world with some statement, achieved by placing objects on our bodies. This is not a new phenomena it spans back the ages to over 50,000 years. Today we, all of us in some form continue this tradition of jewelry, albeit functional jewelry.  Will AirPods sell well? I assert they will sell out in the first few months and spark a new product category of functional jewelry.
