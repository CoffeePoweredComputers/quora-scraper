            "answer_text": "It was 1999, I had been 12 months in my start up and things had taken off. I wanted to trade in my old Suzuki for something nice and I settled on a SAAB Convertible. We agreed on a trade in for the Suzuki of $5000. I ordered the SAAB and had to wait for delivery as I wanted a black one and they did not have one in the showroom. The wait was only 4 days. Unfortunately during that time our city was hit by a severe hail storm which saw the Suzuki damaged. I rang the dealer. \u201cHey you know how we have done a deal on the trade in? \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cThe car was caught in the hail storm, it has suffered severe hail damage.\u201d \u201cIs it insured?\u201d \u201cYes it is. \u201cNo problem, just give me details of your policy and we\u2019ll handle everything.\u201d Sure enough, on picking up the SAAB I left them with a potted Suzuki and signed over the policy to them washing my hands of the Suzuki. Unexpectedly the next day I got a call from the car yard. Mind you now the deal is done and they can leave me alone. \u201cHi Lee, It\u2019s Tony. I just wanted to see when you\u2019re free today so I can come out and run through the features of the car with you.\u201d I had to admit there were buttons on the dash I had no idea about and appreciated not having to spend hours huddled over the user manual. He came out to my office and stayed about 40 minutes showing me how everything worked, what to watch for, servicing, etc. By the time he left I was a SAAB expert. 3 Weeks later I get a cheque in the mail from the car yard for $3,700. I was not sure what it was for but an attached note said, \u201cResidual for Suzuki claim.\u201d I rang to inquire what it was all about. \u201cWe agreed on a $5000 trade in on the Suzuki. Apparently you had an agreed value policy of $8,700 so when we claimed they wrote the car off and paid out $8,700. That\u2019s the difference, so we are refunding it back to you.\u201d Wow, talk about honesty. I was so impressed that when my GM wanted the new BMW 3 series convertible I rang Tony to see if they had a used one on the floor. \u201cRare as hen\u2019s teeth as a used car , but as luck would have it we have one coming in next week with the optional hard roof attachment. What\u2019s your guy\u2019s name?\u201d His name was Anthony and he picked up the BMW from them a week later for $50,000 less than they were new. As the SAAB neared the end of the lease, I rang Tony. \u201cHow\u2019s business Lee? \u201cCan\u2019t keep up Tony, listen, you remember the BMW you sold Anthony? \u201c \u201cYes, very well, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 \u201cBloody great. Have you got a black one by any chance?\u201d \u201cI do. Things must be good huh?\u201d \u201cLook hold it for me, I\u2019ll be round to have a look tomorrow. \u201c \u201cConsider it done. I\u2019m going to take the for sale sign off the car now. As I drove in Tony was standing in the yard. \u201cHere he is, the successful entrepreneur. Sick of the SAAB huh? \u201cHi Tony, good to see you again.\u201d We shook hands, \u201cNo just the lease is up and it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d \u201cMy goodness, can\u2019t believe you rocked in here 4 years ago in that old suzuki. Seems like yesterday.\u201d \u201cYeah the years fly by these days. Wow is that a 911?\u201d \u201cYeah nice huh. It\u2019s a Taraga, one of only 5 to be brought into the country.\u201d I was hypnotized. \u201cYeah, I love it but can\u2019t see my wife agreeing to it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cNot roomy enough for the kids; it\u2019s a bit showy.\u201d \u201cHow old are the kids.\u201d \u201c3 and 6.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. There\u2019re two seats in the back. Want to take it for a run?\u201d \u201cLet me try the Beemer first.\u201d \u201cAlright.\u201d The BMW was as you would expect. Drove well, had only done 20,000km and the final price was $55,000 less than a new one. They would take the SAAB back at residual value which according to my research was a little more than market value. OK let\u2019s take the porsche out. This was slightly older than the SAAB but you could hear the engine rumble with the distinctive sound of a pre-2000 911. A Harley Davidson on 4 wheels. Sure enough the back seat was tight but very comfortable for 2 kids. The roof was a full glass roof that doubled up on itself when opened giving that convertible feeling. As we cruised the area, every head on the sidewalk was turning. \u201cTony I dreamed of owning a 911 since I was a kid but I know this is going to cause problems with the Missus. But let\u2019s say I took it. What can you do on price?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll make it the same as the BMW for you. Tell you what, leave the SAAB. I\u2019ll prepare the paperwork for the BMW and get it detailed. Take the porsche home for the weekend, and come back Monday if you change your mind we\u2019ll do the Porsche and if not, the BMW will be ready. Trick is, if you want the Porsche, make sure your wife gets to drive it.\u201d Sure enough as I arrived home my wife was in the garden. \u201cWhat are you doing with that?\u201d It was not a happy look on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s a loaner for the weekend, they are just getting the Beemer ready.\u201d \u201cOhhh. OK.\u201d Next morning my wife says, \u201cI\u2019m ducking over to the supermarket for a few minutes.\u201d \u201cHere\u2026\u201d I say throwing her the Porsche keys. \u201cTry the Porsche.\u201d She comes back with a huge smile on her face an hour later. \u201cWow,\u201d she says handing me back the keys, \u201cHave you thought about that instead of the Beemer?\u201d YES! Way to go TONY. 2 months after buying the Porsche it broke down during peak hour on a busy road. I rang Tony. \u201cTony it\u2019s not enough that it has a blown gasket and there\u2019s steam pouring out the back, it\u2019s happened on the busiest road in the city and everyone passing has something to say.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cLike \u201cnext time get a Toyota\u201d or \u201cDid you get a tow truck with it?\u201d \u201cStay there, I\u2019ll be there in 15 minutes.\u201d And 15 minutes later he shows up in his 300 Lexus. \u201cHere take this, I\u2019ll wait for the mechanic and call you when it\u2019s fixed.\u201d I got the Porsche back a week later with a new head gasket and never had a problem with it again. I traded it for another Porsche 911 4 years later and we bought a Lexus SUV from Tony for my wife. All in all, over a 10 year relationship as the business got better, I spent around $500,000 in cars with Tony and my staff another $300,000. It all started with him coming out to go over the SAAB with me and returning the additional $3700 of insurance money. I often recounted that story to my team as an example of how excellent customer service makes for loyal customers. Their motto was \u201cExcellence without Compromise\u201d and Tony certainly lived up to it. Tony left after 10 years. By then they had also acquired a Honda Dealership and dominated both sides of a busy highway. The yard shut down 3 years later, after Tony left. Edit: I have had a few people ask where and who the dealership was and since it has been some years since they closed down I see no problem in identifying it as a Sydney dealership that most long time residents of Sydney would recognise. Rick Damelian Motors on Parramatta Road. The yard became a Sydney Icon having been in operation for decades. Here is a link to the news story about the demise of the business in 2011. The Damelian brothers' nasty spat . I can also say that while not his real name, Tony in my OP worked directly for Robert Damelian. Many will also recognise their tag line \u201cExcellence without Compromise\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "My wife and I decided to take a trip to Napa Valley without the kids. We love wine and good food and Napa has plenty of both. The centerpiece of the trip was our dinner reservation at Tom Keller\u2019s French Laundry, which has been a bucket list item for both of us. As many know, you have to make reservations several months in advance to the very day, and these precious spots fill up within minutes of being available. So there was great anticipation for this culinary experience. So we planned to fly in to San Francisco, go to our hotel, casually unpack and change, and then take a car service to the restaurant - about 45 minutes away. We flew United Airlines into San Francisco, and that is where things started to go wrong. Our luggage, and more importantly, our clothes, did not arrive at Baggage Claim. We joined a long line of people who also had lost luggage from this flight and spent over 90 minutes determining our bags were not there. We left SFO airport quite unhappy and unsure of what to do. The French Laundry has a strict dress code for men and women, and in short, our casual clothing would not do. We were faced with the prospect of giving up our dinner reservation, and we came up with a plan. We drove to our hotel in downtown San Francisco, dropped off our bags at the hotel lobby, and walked straight into Neiman Marcus. We told them our situation, and that at this point, we had less than an hour to pick out clothing (and makeup for my wife), have it altered and delivered to our hotel. They were up to the challenge. While there may be cheaper places to buy clothing, those places did not exist in the neighborhood of where we were, and we decided, if we had to buy new clothes, it might as well be nice stuff that we can keep a long time. My wife and I had wonderful service in getting reasonable outfits picked out, and in short, they delivered! They had the altered clothes in the lobby of our hotel in a little over an hour! Many thanks to the fantastic Neiman Marcus folks in San Francisco. We made it to our dinner reservation on time and had an absolutely incredible meal with a personalized tour of the kitchen afterwards. Our bags did eventually arrive the following day. After returning home, I decided I would reach out to United Airlines to see if they would reimburse us in any way. Knowing this would be tricky and that they have limits on reimbursements, I submitted our story and our pricey receipts to United. And without any difficulty, they sent us a check fully reimbursing us for all of our costs for the new clothes, make-up and other sundries we required for the dinner. I was shocked and incredibly grateful to United Airlines. Overall, despite the initial trauma, it was a great trip. ",
