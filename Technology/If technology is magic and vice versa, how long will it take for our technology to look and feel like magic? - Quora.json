            "answer_text": "It doesn't already? I am guessing you can't remember or even imagine a time when if you had a question that your parents could not answer you went to a building called a library, looked through a drawer of index cards to tell you were the books you wanted were, looked for a set of books called encyclopedias, searched the shelf for the proper volume, took down and opened the book to check the index to find the article, then read the article and look at still picture thay may or may not have been in color. I am guessing that you have never had to examine a paper road map in advance of your trip and had your passenger unfold it and try to figure out where you were based on symbols on the paper matching the landmarks, so that they could tell you where to turn. I assume you do not remember when if you wanted to talk to a person you were not in direct contact with at the moment you had to be at home. Go to a device that was wired to the wall, most homes only had one if they had one at all. You had to memorize a digital code or look it up in a book, you had to spin a dial that would send the proper number of clicks over the wire until it made contact with a similar device in the other person's home. If they were not at home you did not get to talk to them. If someone else in the home answered the device you had to request that they ask the person you wanted to contact to walk over to the device on the wall. And you could not even see them. You probably do not recall a time when if you wanted to remember a moment with a picture you had to load a camera with a special photosensitive substance called film. You would have to aim the camera, push the button, then wind a crank to the next frame on the film. You could take 12 to 24 pictures depending on how big of a roll of film you bought. Then you took the film to a drug store who would process it in a vat of chemicals to create negatives. Then they would shine a light through the negative onto photosensitive paper and process the paper with chemicals to get your picture. This process could take a few days. If you wanted to share these pictures you had to go back to the store with the negative and have them shine light through them again onto photosensitive paper to create another copy of the image. You had to pay for each copy. If you could afford to spend the extra money you could use special film that would make color pictures instead of black and white. Then you would have to take one of those paper copies of the picture, put it in an envelope, put a stamp in the envelope, give the envelope to a post office employee and several days later it will be delivered to the home of the person you wanted to share the picture with. Then they would either write a message on a piece of paper, put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it, give it a postal employee and several days later it would arrive at your home. Alternatively they could walk over to the device wired to the wall, dial the digital code that would signal the device wired to one of the walls in your home. If you were home you could speak to them, but you had to pay for every minute and you had to pay more the further away they were from you. You probably do not remember a time when if you wanted to watch a TV show you actually had to be at home when the show scheduled to be shown. Most homes had only one TV screen if they had any. The screen only showed black and white pictures. You had a choice of 3 channels in most parts of the country and one or two more small local stations in some bigger cities. You all had to sit in one room and you could not move your TV because it was wired to a large metal structure on your roof top called an antenna. You had 3 or 4 choices of what you could watch. You could not ask for any shows or movies you wanted. You watched the show when they aired it. If you were not sittting in front of the TV when it was being shown you missed it. You might be able to see the same show again during the summer reruns. But if you missed an episode of your favorite show you had to ask soneone who watched it to tell you what happened because there was no way to go back and catch up. There were many parts of the country wherle there were no TV signals and you could not watch TV even if you had one. There was a time when the only way to see a movie was to go to the theater. If you did not get to the theater before they stopped showing the movie you did not get to see it. Some of them might come around again or in a few years they might show up on TV (heavily edited to make room for commercials) but usually if you missed it the first time around there was no chance of your seeing it, ever. You probably don't remember when computers were large machines costing several thousands of dollars and only big businesss or governments had, or needed them. If you needed to solve math problem you calculated it with a pencil and a piece of paper, or looked up the answer in a book. You may never have seen a catalogue. If you were a good customer of certain large stores they would mail you a paper book. You looked through the book and either wrote your order on a piece of paper you put in an envelope with another piece of paper that had your bank account information on it called a check. Then wait a week or two for your items to be delivered. If you were one of the fortunate few who posssed a credit card you could go to the device wired to your wall and speak to a human being who would take your order. You probably do not remember a time when if you wanted entertainment away from home you had to carry a bundle of printed paper called a book. Can you imagine a time when if you wanted to listen to music you had to have a special device called a radio? And you could only listen to what that radio station was sending out at the time? You might have a choice of a half dozen stations and again you could only listen to what they chose to play for you. If there was a song that you liked you had to go to a store and buy a piece of vinyl called a record. You took the record home and had to have a special device called a record player to listen to it. These were expensive and big. Most homes only had one if they had any and you could not take it with you or listen to it anywhere else but at home. If you wanted portable music you carried a small transistor radio and listened to whatever the radio was playing. Not necessarily what you wanted to hear. Imagine when if you wanted to know the time of day you had to look for a clock or at a smaller clock attatched to your wrist and look at where two hands were pointed on the dial. You had to wind up a spring on you watch or wind up the weights on your clock every day. If you forgot to do so you had to find someone who did remember to keep their clocks wound up. And this my friend is all within my own life time. Before me there was a time when if you wanted to go somewhere you walked or rode on the back of an animal. You found your way looking at the stars, remembering land marks or following trails. If you wanted to hear music you made it yourself or be with another person who was making music for you. If you wanted entertainmemt you listened to someone sitting in front of you telling a story. If you wantef something you made it yourself or traded something you could make with someone else who could make what you needed. If you wanted a picture you had to find plants or minerals the colors you wanted. Mash them up and smear them onto a cave wall or a cloth or paper you probably made your self and wait for it to dry. If you wanted the answer to a question you would either explore and do your own experiments yourself or ask the wisest and most experienced person in your tribe. If that person died before passing on what they knew to someone else their knowledge was lost and had to be discovered or figured out again. If you wanted to know the time of day you had to look at where the sun or moon was in the sky. And if you wanted to talk to someone you had to know where they were or find them,walk over to them and speak to them face to face. Now please take a moment to look at the device you are holding in you are holding in your hand reading this answer. Tell me that when I was born 60 years ago this device would not have been the stuff of magic. ",

            "answer_text": "I hold in my hand a glowing crystal slab. I can use this to talk to someone on the other side of the world. I can also use it to watch a crystal clear live video of a man inside a floating metal palace hundreds of miles above the surface of the earth. The same magic crystal box can tell me what the weather will be like tomorrow, or tell me the fastest way to get to a place I\u2019ve never been to on the other side of the state. In the next room, I have a machine which can make any shape I can describe to it, given a few hours and a supply of plastic filament. It\u2019s making some objects right now, intricate sculptures that would have taken a skilled craftsman days to hand-carve. And I use this magic machine to make toys. There are cars that you don\u2019t even need to steer. You just get into them and tell them where to go. Granted, these are in limited experimental use, but they\u2019ve appeared faster than anyone expected them to. Computers can recognize your face, tell if you\u2019re sleepy and read your emotional state. Tiny flying machines with miniature video cameras can be purchased for the cost of a good dinner at toy stores. If you took any of this technology and showed it to a person 100 years ago, they would find it to be so far advanced beyond any technology they know of that it might as well be magic. If you even showed it to me when I was a child, I would find much of it beyond the wildest imaginings of anything I expected to see in my lifetime. To me, we are already at the point of technology seeming like magic. Of course, to someone growing up today, it all seems normal. But the technology thirty years from now will probably be magic compared to what they\u2019re growing up with. So it\u2019s all relative. Every technology can seem like magic if you compare it to what was around long enough ago, but magic will seem mundane if you\u2019re used to it. ",
