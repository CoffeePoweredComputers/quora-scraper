            "answer_text": "The only advantage I can think of for old laptops and iphones is that they are cheap.  But their original battery will be almost, if not totally, dead.  If you're willing to keep a laptop or phone plugged in all the time, it might work for you.  But you can get a much better computer or phone or a little more than the cost of replacing its battery. Music equipment doesn't change so much, so holds it value better.  But if its so old that it has vacuum tubes, it will be more expensive to run and harder to maintain, because tubes burn out like old light bulbs. ",
