            "answer_text": "In the West some might call it IP theft but here in the East, what it's called is technology transfer. Basically, it is the transfer of advanced technologies two countries that don't have them. So what you might do working in technology transfer which frankly is what I do and it certainly is not theft is work in your industry in a country that is not your own and help people from that country to learn the things that you do at work. Just for example I transfer a great deal of cloud technology knowledge to the people I work with here in Vietnam. In some context, technology transfer can refer to industrial espionage. That is not a nice business, and I have no involvement in it. In my mind technology transfer is inevitable and essential because without knowledge transfer without interacting with one another, we will continue to live in a world the strikingly unequal, driven by corporations that have an illegitimate monopoly on knowledge granted by governments that are being very short sighted. On the other hand I should also say that many so-called developing countries are doing quite well all on their own and that the entire idea of technology transfer could really be a kind of colonialist hold over. As to which of these three scenarios for technology transfer I am involved in, I would have to say none, precisely.... I'm pretty sure. I only take work that I deem beneficial to the world and if I don't feel that my work is beneficial to the world I just don't do it, because the number of good choices for work is much larger than those with unclear ethics.   In summary:  Many expatriates are engaged in technology transfer.Students who bring knowledge home, engage in technology transfer.Governments and corporations sometimes use the phrase as a euphemism for outright industrial espionage.  Both the USA and China have been caught red handed in this game in recent years.Governments have a legitimate interest in encouraging technology transfer because it benefits the people that they govern.I just read tthis https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/a-battery-revolution-in-motion article, which referred to technology transfer in the context of academia to business regardless of national context.",

            "answer_text": "Technology transfer, also called transfer of technology (TOT), is the process of transferring skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing and facilities among governments or universities and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) knowledge transfer. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present[when?] transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments. Technology brokers are people who discovered how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances. A related term, used almost synonymously, is \"technology valorisation\". While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, Archimedes was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at Xerox PARC and elsewhere, has led to a focus on the process itself.
