            "answer_text": "Good Morning, Go to YouTube and type in \u201cHomesteading\u201d, there are some good videos there. In the mean time here are some thoughts I picked up. 1. How Self-Sufficient Do You Want to be? This is the most important aspect to consider before launching your homestead. Some people just want to grow their own vegetables with self-sufficient gardening. Others want to raise their own animals. Some take it even further and want to be even more independent and have a complete self-sufficient living lifestyle, by living totally off the grid. It is important to have a goal in mind before getting started so you can create a more accurate plan. 2. Gardening: How do I Make This Plant Grow? If you are starting a homestead, you need to know how to start something from a seed and make it produce. It is all about how to produce healthy plants that can feed you and/or your family with as little dependence upon the outside world as possible. You\u2019ll need to do lots of research to decide which methods you would like to try. For instance, you can choose to till your garden or apply the no-till gardening method where you pile your compost and woodchips on top of the soil and let it compost. You can choose to use pesticides or go completely organic. 3. Preserving Your Food Most people go into the lifestyle of homesteading because they want to know that they can survive regardless of their circumstances. Whether you are concerned about a time that there will be no grocery store available and you should be capable of survival cooking, or tough financial times, being able to grow and then preserve (i.e. can) your own food are some of the most essential parts to homesteading. It is important to learn how to process your food safely. You will also need to know what materials you will need in order to preserve your food so that way you can begin stocking up on them. When canning your food you will need lots of Mason jars. You will also need lids and rings to seal the jars. A pressure canner is an essential part of canning so that way you have the option of pressure canning or water bathing in order to preserve. 4. Start Searching for Land It is important to understand you can homestead on a full fledged farm with acres and acres or something as small as a half-acre or less. You will need to go back to step one and assess how far you want to go to determine how much land you think you will need. If you want a milk cow obviously you will require more land. If you think you just want a garden and some chickens, you can get away with having less land. The most important thing to understand when searching for land is that everything must have its place. When looking at land, map it out and see if everything will fit. You will be surprised at how little land homesteading can actually take. You can also research and find that there are still some areas that give away free land. When searching for land, it is also a good time to decide what type of home you want to go along with the land. Some people are choosing to build inexpensive tiny houses, others buy old mobile homes or RVs and fix them up, and some choose to place their dream house on their dream land. The main thing is to map everything out to be sure you can fit all that you want in that space and leave yourself with a little room to grow. 5. Learn to Build Anything and Everything Don\u2019t let this tip discourage you.When homesteading, it is important to develop carpentry skills, but you don\u2019t have to be an expert. You will soon learn that functional homesteads are not always pretty, and they don\u2019t have to be. However, if you know how to build things you will save yourself a lot of money. You will be able to upcycle many items as well. Carpentry is what will give your homestead character. 6. Research Livestock A lot of homesteaders choose to raise livestock. This can range from a cow to goats, chickens, ducks, rabbits, pigs, honeybees, and so much more. Research all that homesteaders actually raise. You will be surprised! Then it is important to learn all about keeping as many animals as you fancy. It is trial and error when keeping animals, but the more knowledge you have beforehand the less painful the learning curve will be. For instance, many people don\u2019t know that you can raise chickens and get eggs without a rooster. This is important to know because if you just want to raise chickens for eggs then you won\u2019t have to worry about buying a rooster. However, if you want to raise chickens to hatch then you will need to make the investment and buy a rooster. 7. Upcycling Homesteading is all about utilizing EVERYTHING! You will be amazed at how much you currently waste once you begin this journey. Scraps are now compost that can be fed to the animals or used for dirt. Chicken manure and rabbit droppings are now fertilizer. Ashes from the fireplace are now thrown out on the garden to enrich the soil for better growing in the spring. I can\u2019t stress enough the importance of researching through the internet. You will find all kinds of amazing ideas that people have used to upcycle items that are able to meet a legitimate need for little or no cost to them. 8. Equipment\u2026and Pallets You will need very little equipment to get started homesteading. You will need the basics like hammer and nails. As time goes on you may consider investing in an old tractor, tiller, and other tools that might make your life easier. However, I don\u2019t recommend purchasing a lot before you get started because your plans will change. You will make many mistakes and learn what works. With that being said, you will find that you will need different things. So make sure you have the basics in order to build with but not much more. Do start stocking up on pallets. You can find them for free at many businesses. They are magnificent, cheap items that can be used to build pallet fences, make gates, buildings, walkways, and a lot more. They are usually very sturdy and a great thing to have on hand when you need to build something and don\u2019t want to waste money on different materials. 9. Money\u2026Don\u2019t Sweat It Homesteading is an investment. However, do not let the financial side of things stress you out. Many people think that they have to have all of this money upfront in order to go about starting a homestead. That is incorrect so please don\u2019t go take out a massive loan to fund your journey. Homesteading is about simplicity so don\u2019t complicate it. Develop a plan (see step 1) and take it one step at a time. This is a lifestyle so it will take patience and ingenuity, but you will be amazed at the homestead you can create for very little money. 10. Say Goodbye to the Jones\u2019s The last thing you will need to know before starting a homestead is to adjust your attitude. When you decide to homestead your priorities have to change. Your mindset turns from the \u201cfiner things in life\u201d and starts looking at the simpler things in life. It is no longer about keeping up with your neighbors but about doing more with a lot less. This is how you gain knowledge and learn how to survive without being dependent upon all of the things modern day society has become dependent upon. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very helpful, no\u2026it's imperative, to know what you are getting into. It requires a lot of planning and vision. If you are with a SO, I hope both of have reasonable expectations, and equal commitments to each other, and your shared goals. Team mates. Partners. Parents. I have spent nearly four year's of my life, building and restoring what was once our working family farm. Much of it needed demolished, remodeled, updated, rewired, re\u2026everything. 1888. That property marker takes on a whole new meaning, when it's you carrying the baton. 132 years. I knew it had been done before\u202650 years previous. A tornado had leveled this place, 20+ years ago. The \u201cnew\" house survived. It needed a new roof\u2026but, the orchards, vineyards, barn, were never replaced. Homesteading requires a broad skill set. It is not just about \u201cfarming\"\u2026it is about all of the subspecialties of farming practice, and the working trades. Your a mechanic this hour. Next, your a vet. A carpenter. On, and on. It helps to be highly educated. This isn't for dummies. Modern homesteading, if you want \u201cmodern\" lifestyles, and creature comforts, and entertainment it helps to be book smart. Saavy. Putting in a geothermal system\u2026or passive heat collection, newer wind and solar devices? Homesteading is not monocropping. You have a lot of plates, your meals on those plates, that need juggled. Chickens should be your first livestock. Fish help. Four legged animals\u2026start with sheep, goats, or\u2026but work your way up. It's taken me four years, to move past\u2026chickens. Dairy is next. To eat a broad variety of foods, to gain independence\u2026it is very helpful to acquire an existing or once a previous, working farm. Infrastructure like barns, fences, ponds, creeks, timber, wells are all helpful capital assets. A temperate to warmer climate and longer growing season is helpful. I am very happy with my decision, to first tackle planting perennial types of food sources. I am also very happy with some rather drastic soil building and amendment practices I undertook\u2026and that are ongoing. I am an avid composter, and composting site. I have many of my raw inputs often delivered to me\u2026like manure, woodchips etc. I am a dump\u2026for quality inputs and waste byproducts. Soil health was my most immediate item in need of attention. Outdoors. There is no such thing as \u201cvacation\". By that, I mean there is always something to be done, fixed, painted, trimmed. But, I feel like I am living, working very hard, but on vacation everyday. I have a healthy dose of serenity, and increased confidence in \u201clife acquired skills\" Muscles too. Physical labor has transformed my body. I was getting weak, despite \u201cthe gym\". Mechanical skills. If you don't have them\u2026thank God for YouTube. You will need tools. Self sufficiency is also for me, getting off of the energy grid. This takes money. I have taken this in progressive steps. Insulation first. Wind breaks\u2026natural landscaping to pick up heating and cooling properties. Planning ahead. I knew where I was going to position solar panels\u2026no trees were planted that would block my future installation. I can tell you, with each progressive step, it is getting easier. It was overwhelming at first. I sincerely wish I had planned and actually done this in my early 20s. For one reason, my cost of living continues to plummet with each passing year. Investing all of the money, I spent keeping up with the Jones' wasn't really a good investment. This is. Porsche's rust. Trucks do too, but they seem to have 9 lives. Tractors. 1952 Massey Ferguson. If you get a good tractor, and keep it well maintained, it's worth it's weight in gold\u2026for another 50/60 years. I can't say that about\u2026no names will be mentioned. Btw. Many farm implements \u201chave\" to be repaired by the manufacturer. 1952 MF, I can work on it, and get inexpense parts for it, next day delivery:) Many, I can even source at the car parts store. Food security. Low(ering) overhead. Drastically lowered carbon footprint. 80% independence. I knew\u2026\u201dthis\" is how I wanted to live. I just didn't know all of the how to's. I try to produce a great deal of food, very close to, and even trellised on my home. My home landscaping is my herb garden, etc. Anything I use often, I try to put it in close proximity. Efficiency matters. I can make a meal, three seasons+ of the year, by merely walking around my house, or nearby ooutbuilding. My beds include fruits, vegetables, herbs, mushrooms. It is a really cool way of living. My urban rat race friends, still marvel that I work remotely and do this too. ",

            "answer_text": " Homesteading Off the Grid Regardless of what others might tell you, it isn\u2019t that difficult. Homesteading of course requires a specific set of skills, but so does driving a car. There is a near-infinite community both in your locale and online that will help with last-minute questions and sage advice. Homesteading is about making a schedule and sticking to it, but not necessarily about making a rock-solid plan. Nature happens, and when it does, be prepared to adjust accordingly. Our tactic, and this worked extremely well for us, was not to rush into anything. Going big out of the gates would have meant going back to our old urban home after a month. There is simply too much to accomplish all at once. By taking our time, we were able to smoothly integrate different elements and see how they worked before moving into the next thing. We started with chickens and a garden. Then, we learned what would work for our situation and expanded from there. Baby steps. Use any and all resources at your disposal. YouTube and Reddit are great, but did you know assistance from your local land-grant extension office was free? Also, the USDA has a great resource specifically designed for new homesteaders and farmers. Homesteading is a way of life, not a side-hobby. To be successful, you have to be focused and in control. Take your time, be patient, and most importantly, be creative. Best off luck! ",

The only exception to this new policy was in Alaska, for which the law allowed homesteading until 1986.

He fulfilled all requirements of the homestead act in 1979 but did not receive his deed until May 1988. He is the last person to receive title to land claimed under the Homestead Acts. ",
