If you want to do BTech to get a good job then, Remember 92% jobs getting generated in India are in coding! Is IIT everything? No, Coding is everything! And the way to learn coding is not WhiteHatJr, its maybe taking freelancing projects on Fiverr/Upwork , doing a coding internship or contributing open source or building your own Apps!! ",
