            "answer_text": "I have to qualify this answer. What do you mean by Radiation??? if you mean RF (Radio Frequency), you can shut that off with one easy step. put it in \u201cairplane\u201d and it will stop pinging the nearest \u201cCell Tower\u201d to provide it\u2019s (the cell\u2019s) location and to establish and maintain a constant on connectionif you just put it in a \u201caluminum\u201d cover without putting the cell phone in \u201cairplane mode\u201d it will quickly run down the battery BECAUSE it will keep \u201cpinging\u201d the nearest tower to try to establish it\u2019s location. But since it cannot because the aluminum is shielding (blocking) the signal it will keep trying the ping and run down the battery in a few hours: I know I tried it.If you have an LG or older model Samsung you can put it in Airplane mode, then open the back cover and remove the battery and voila, no radiation and no signal to the nearest tower.If you\u2019re concerned about the N.S.A listening to your device or law enforcement tracking your where abouts, (using a device and program called \u201cSTINGRAY\u201d) just putting the phone in airplane mode (the cell will NOT PING and not give it\u2019s location) will defeat that because where it cannot ping it provides no location, metadata or eaves dropping on your conversation or text. That said, you will \u201cNOT\u201d be RECEIVING any TEXT or PHONE CALLS while it\u2019s in this \u2018airplane\u2019 mode. I will be held by your providers system and as soon as you take the phone out of \u2018airplane mode\u2019 and put it back on to the cell tower connection, a flood of text that you received and voice mails will be coming through bing-bing-bing-bing-bing while you were away.- Watch this program (\u201cSTELLAR WIND\u201d on the NSA spying and \u201cSTINGRAY\u201d) they can listen in on your \u201ccell phone call\u201d even when the phone is \u201coff\u201d and track everywhere you went and metadata (\u201cStingray\u201d via Triangulation of the three nearest cell towers); the exception is if it is in \u201cairplane mode\u201d and / or the battery is removed. YOUR CELL PHONE IS ALWAYS ON AND TRANSMITTING (this is also true for you home land line using it\u2019s Cat3 wires - it is ALWAYS TRANSMITTING EVEN WITH NO DIAL TONE AND THE RECEIVER HANDLE DOWN, as long as that Cat3 has a low voltage it is always transmitting-the dial tone just tells it to listen for the dial numbers) (you have to disconnect the RJ-11 wire from the phone land line for it to not listen) when ever it\u2019s on with the exception of \u201cAirplane mode\u201d so you don\u2019t interfere with your flight while on the flight it blocks your cell signal. So whether you are on the flight or not \u201cairplane mode\u201d will block all call signal and pings to report your location and metadata. William (Bill) Binney was America\u2019s top code breakers.The man with the white hair in the video at about the 1:50 minute mark in the Stellar Wind video is the famous Danny Ellsberg from the Rand Think Tank Corporation in Santa Monica, CA. Ellsberg was the \u201cWhistleblower\u201d who outed the \u201cPentagon Papers\u201d during the Vietnam War that the whole VN war was bogus and the \u201cGulf of Tonkin\u201d incident never happened. LBJ & Nixon & McNamara all KNEW \u201cGulf of Tonkin\u201d incident never happened and the U.S. Pentagon manufactured that incident to start VN war and get U.S. into that war to attack the North VNese. Nixon was going to have Ellsberg tried for Treason under the \u201cEspionage Spy Act\u201d but right then \u201cWatergate\u201d break-in happened and Nixon ran for his life and resigned so no charges were ever filed U.S. vs. Ellsberg. Unlike Edward Snowden who\u2019s wanted under the same Spy Act for whistleblowing on the NSA.

('Truth and Power': Episode 3 Clip) if you are concerned about \u201cEMF\u201d Electrical Magnetic Field \u2018radiation\u2019 that all electrical devices give out. Once the phone is on it will always produce this whether in airplane mode or not. Just being on it generates this EMF field. You can test that with the right tester. The only way to stop the EMF is to either remove the battery or shield it in an aluminum wrapper. Then it\u2019s pretty safe from EMF radiation.On EMF, I once worked right next to this software programmer / developer and he had these two HUGE 24\u2033 old TV style monitors RIGHT in FRONT of him just a few inches from his face and chest: (not the LCD/LED flat screens most people have now). And I casually mentioned to him, \u201cyou know your cooking yourself and Irradiating yourself with those two monitors right???\u201d And he whipped out his EMF tester and turned it on and tested the EMF to show me his tester showed no signal and he was \u2018getting nothing\u2019 in \u2018radiation\u2019. I laughed and said wait until I bring in my tester tomorrow. The next day when I turned on my tester, it went \u201cEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u201d with the SOLID & CONSTANT audio signal and the LED went solid all the way to the RED. His face lost all color. I said you should be getting nothing, it should read ZERO with no Audio signal. Not a solid constant \u201cE\u201d beep. I said, your tester is \u201clame\u201d because it\u2019s testing the \u201cwrong\u201d frequency so nothing will show up. Mine tests the right frequency.",

            "answer_text": "Cellphones do not emit ionizing radiation, at all (X-rays etc, that give you cancer). They emit visible light (from the screen), thermal infrared radiation (unless they are cooled to absolute zero) and radio waves (cellular, wifi and bluetooth). None of that is dangerous; it\u2019s at much too low a power to cook your eyeballs. As Stanley says, when the phone is on (not in airplane mode) it transmits every 10 minutes or so to stay in contact with a tower. The closer the tower, the less power it uses (it adapts to the cell size to save battery and to minimize interference with more distant cells). It\u2019s not at all dangerous - there is no physical basis for any biological effect - though if you think it is, the nocebo effect can perhaps make you sick, and worrying can cause stress and physical symptoms.
