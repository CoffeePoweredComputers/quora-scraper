The speed and accuracy is fully software dependent, and can be optimized with software updates. The face unlock thing, that Oneplus is using in it\u2019s Oneplus 5T - is faster than the face id !! ",

            "answer_text": "No. Timing FaceID versus TouchID with a stopwatch is not a proper comparison. FaceID is a passive unlock while TouchID is a deliberate unlock. That has to be taken into account. Once you factor in ease of use and \u201cconsciousness of action\u201d FaceID is far superior. ",
