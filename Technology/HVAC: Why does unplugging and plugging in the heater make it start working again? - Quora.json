These kinds of problems can be quite tedious to isolate (even for a trained professional). It essentially requires checking each component in the hopes of catching the malfunction.  It may also have something to do with a safety control.  A safety control is a type of device that shuts the system down if certain tolerances are not met for safety purposes.
