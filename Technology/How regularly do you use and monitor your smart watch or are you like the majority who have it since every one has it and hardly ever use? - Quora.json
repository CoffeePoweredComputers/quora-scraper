            "answer_text": "I\u2019m of the type who can afford any smartwatch but don\u2019t have any. Because just like phone I don\u2019t want to be a caregiver to another device. Look after it, protect it, charge it every day, check of its efficiency, compare with latest and greatest releases etc. No ways. If I ever get a smartwatch it will be just to try it. So I\u2019ll get a used one and I\u2019ll never use it regularly. As I told I don\u2019t want a job that doesn\u2019t pay. Job = caretaker of smart watch. I\u2019ll use it if I have to go out once a week or month to show off. And strictly make sure not to use it everyday unless I\u2019m free and have a lot of time to waste. ",
