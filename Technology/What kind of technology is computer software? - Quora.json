            "answer_text": "Computer software is, in a sense, a branch of mathematics, dealing with numbers and symbolic logic. But, above all, it is an adaptive technology. A computer is a versatile machine, perhaps the most versatile ever invented. It goes far beyond other multipurpose tools, like a roofing hammer, with a head that drives nails on one face and splits shingles with the other, sharpened face, or the Japanese farmer\u2019s hoe that digs rice paddies with its edge and fries noodles over a fire on its flat back face at lunch time. A computer does whatever its program is designed to do. The same machine can be used to create or watch videos, play or compose music, read or write a novel, or balance your checkbook, buy and sell merchandize, or talk to someone on the other side of the world, depending on the program it is running. Computers have replaced complex manual controls in our transport systems, with their programming making decisions about fuel flow, spark advance, and gear ratios in response to the difference between actual speed and desired speed set by the user. A century ago, the user had to control all of those manually, based on mechanical switches, levers, foot pedals, analog gauges, and the sound of the motor. Software now does all of those things, but currently still depends on the user to monitor road conditions, obstacles, and other traffic, as well as following signs and maps to navigate, using another computer not yet integrated with the control system. For most of the history of computing, software was able to count things and perform specific transforms on the digital representation of those things, according to a fixed plan. With interest and research in neural networks and machine learning, modern software can create its own plan, and adapt that plan over time, with experience, just as can its creators,albeit within the limitations of its input and output capabilities.
