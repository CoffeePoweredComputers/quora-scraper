            "answer_text": "AESA Radars, Solid State LIDAR and Multiple Spot Beam Satellites use similar concepts. A Frequency Beam (comprised of one or multiple frequencies - radio or laser media) is transmitted multiple times with different phase shifts. The receiver interprets the received beam (radio or laser media) based on its specific phase shift using matching filters. Its a simplistic explanation and the implementations vary, however the concept is identical.
