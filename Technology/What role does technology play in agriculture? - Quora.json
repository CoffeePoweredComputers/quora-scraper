            "answer_text": "Technology plays huge roles in agriculture. Ever been inside a modern combine? They were very early adopters of laser rangefinding and GPS, among other things. Technology is deeply intertwined with modern agriculture at every step of the process. Modern farm equipment often adopts new technologies quickly, including everything from the aforementioned GPS and rangefinding to environmental monitoring. Seeds are produced with biotech engineering to create plants with traits that are desirable to farmers. An obvious example is GM technology, but seeds that are not GM are still high tech. For example, conventional breeding involves exposing seeds to radiation or chemical mutagens, then planting them and looking for individuals with desirable traits. Monsanto has developed seed chipping technology that speeds up the process of looking for desirable traits in non-GM seeds tremendously. (Ironically, if anti-Monsanto/anti-GM activists get their way and ban GM tech, Monsanto\u2019s seed chipping will give them an even stronger hold on conventional plant breeding.) Seeds are coated for easier planting, sometimes with pesticides to prevent them from being eaten after they\u2019re planted, often with inert powders to make their handling in planting machines easier. Many important food plants have had their genes sequenced, so that we can better understand what genes make them desirable plants. Irrigation systems in most farms aren\u2019t terribly high tech, but more and more often, low-tech irrigation systems are being controlled by high-tech sensors and computer controls that monitor and record the soil conditions. These also provide analytics to the farmer. ",
