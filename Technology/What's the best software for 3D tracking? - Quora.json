            "answer_text": "in general Nuke has one of the best tracking software by far but if we\u2019re talking 3d I would say Cinema 4d(more here on offical website about c4d Tracking) Thing is why do it in a 3d software? You can export tracking data from better suited application for this task like Mocha, AE or Nuke and import it in to a 3d software for further work. For sure it will be faster more efficient to do it in dedicated compositing software. Easiest (cheapest thanks to cloud) to obtain by far is After Effects it has great camera tracking tools and can be used free of charge for first 30 days with all functions available :) Whats more you can export tracking data in to your 3d software with cameras and continue work from there.

            "answer_text": "I'm only using MatchMover because it comes with Maya... Its not the best software, but it does the job. Autodesk clearly dropped support though, I guess that is because other softwares are better.I hear Boujou has a good reputation, but there are some other really insane high end software out there, certainly out of my price range!
