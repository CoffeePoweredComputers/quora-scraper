            "answer_text": "Most wired controllers will have a male USB connector at the end of the wire. This plugs in to one of three female USB ports on the Switch's dock (Two USB 2.0 ports are at the left side, one USB 3.0 port is at the back, in between the USB-C in and HDMI out ports). Unless you buy a USB to USB-C adaptor, there is no way to plug a wired controller into the Switch in Portable or Tabletop mode. Of course, if the controller has a USB-C connector at its end, the reverse will be true and a USB-C to USB adaptor will be necessary to play in docked mode. ",

            "answer_text": "Err, one of the two USB ports on the dock? So long as the Switch is in there, you can plug a controller in that. Now your question is: what USB wired controller works? Answer: pretty much all of them, though you may need to adjust yourself to the button layout of a Nintendo controller vs an Xbox One or PS4 controller connected that way. And you'll likely need an adapter to make it work. Like this one: How to use PlayStation or Xbox controllers on Nintendo Switch \u2014 Kelleher Bros. ",
