            "answer_text": "As part of the official process of getting a new National Identity Card, I was waiting to get my citizens\u2019 data verified, from the database of National Registration Authority. After verification, the data was to be printed on paper and hard copy submitted to the officer incharge, for his sign-off. I was 3rd or 4th in the queue when the printer (An old HP Laserjet) ran out of toner. The guy took out a new toner pack (well, not brand new, but a recycled and refilled one) from the cabinet and clumsily tried to put it in the printer. Apparently something went terribly wrong, because one of the plastic gears on the side of toner cartridge came off. As luck would have it, it was the last toner cartridge in the cabinet. Work stopped because he was the only clerk who could take printouts and without hard copies, officer sign-off was not possible. He called somebody and cheerfully informed us that a replacement was on the way, but since it was from the other side of town, the rider would take at least one hour to get there. The prospect of waiting for so long was not promising. Then I remembered something\u2026\u2026. I asked the clerk if I could look at the printer and, maybe, try to fix it. He was reluctant to allow me to touch State Property. But then, after looking at so many disappointed faces, he decided to elevate the matter to higher authority. He went to his officer, who was sitting in the famed glass cabin. We could see that the clerk was explaining the desperate situation to Boss Man - pointing to the printer, to me and then to the waiting humanity. After some discussions, he summoned me to the exalted presence of The Boss. The interview went like this: \u201cAre your from HP company?\u201d\u201cNo\u201d \u201cAre you a printer repairman?\u201d\u201cNo\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that you can fix this?\u201d\u201cWell, I didn't say that I can fix it but I did volunteer to have a look at it and maybe try to fix it\u201d He looked at me with suspicion. But then my grey hair (ok, ok, they are not grey anymore. They are white) probably lent me an air of creditability, because he allowed me to look at the printer, after I had promised that if I break it, I will pay for it. I carefully took the seemingly depleted toner cartridge and shook it a few times, in a 3-D figure 8 (or what is called Torus, by mathematicians). It was a complex manoeuvre and would have looked something like this.  I then carefully put the cartridge back in the printer and confidently asked the clerk to take out the prints. He looked at me incredulously, but hit the print button. Lo and behold. Crisp printed copy came out from the guts of the rickety old printer. The people clapped at my ingenuity and might have recommended me for the Nobel Award for technical innovation, if there was one and, if they knew how to go about it. I discreetly told the clerk not to press his luck because the printer would only do 10\u201315 prints. This was a cool hack which I had learnt from a young intern in my company and it had saved the day for me (as well as for a few others, before and after me in the queue) Imager Credit:  ",

One of the most common problems we face during WFH and calls is that annoying noise in the background, right?  Image source: Google Well, I have a cool tech hack that can pretty much help you with the complete noise cancellation for seamless communication. There's an app available that eliminates all the background noise when communicating with any software like Zoom, Google Meet, or Skype. But, it's only available for Windows and Mac! What about normal phone calls? \ud83e\udd14 (Well, I have done something to make it work for phone calls as well!) Link to the software: krisp.ai Here's that cool hack that I have done to get noise cancellation on phone calls. ;) Download Krisp software on your Windows laptop. Open it and register your account.Once logged in, enable the \"Remove Noise\" option.Search \"Your Phone\" on your laptop and open it. If it's not installed on your laptop already, get it from Microsoft store. [This software makes your phone virtually visible on your laptop.]Now, download \u2018Your Phone Companion App' on your smartphone. (Play Store link)Open it and follow the on-screen instructions. Connect your phone by giving all permissions.Now your phone must be visible on your laptop screen. You should be able to access Photos, Call Dialer & Contacts, SMS, etc.Plugin the earphones to your laptop. [else call will be on the laptop's loudspeaker & mic] and make a call from 'Your Phone' software.Voila! The other person will get a crystal-clear voice because of Krisp running in the background. Note: This software gives 120 minutes of free noise cancellation per week (which should be enough) If you communicate a lot, you can opt for their paid plan. :) If you liked the hack, do upvote the answer so that someone who can't afford noise-canceling headphones can use this hack and get sorted with the issue. Signing off. Take care! ",
