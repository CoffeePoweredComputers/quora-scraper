            "answer_text": "There are many ways in which science and technology can enhance learning activities! I will provide a list here Virtual Labs  Using the virtual lab technology, students can perform experiments virtually on a computer! This will train them for the real experiment that has to be performed by them in the lab. Mistakes that are likely to happen can be predicted and care can be taken to avoid it in the actual lab experiments! The Language Tutor  We can use softwares that teach us pronunciation of a particular language. All you need to do is put on a headphone, and listen to the voice reading a sentence given in your screen. Repeating the sentence with the correct pronunciation will take you to the next lesson. Frequency Modulation System  Have you seen tour guides using this fm system to communicate better with the people in a noisy environment? Well, think about using this in a classroom. Children will be able to hear the teacher better, along with helping the teacher to talk normally and still communicate with the students. It also helps the students keep their concentration from wavering, since outside noises are minimized. Presentations and Videos  Using a presentation will help the students to grasp the subject better. However, presentations should include more pictorial representations of what the teacher wants to convey, rather than just bullet points! Videos relating to any concept that is being explained is a huge bonus! Reproducing Simple Experiments in Class This method is very helpful for the students who are unable to visualize the concepts! Go through this video to get an idea about the difference that such a visual experience would make! When a physics teacher knows his stuff !!.. Open Courseware  Websites such as NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) [1]and MIT opencourseware[2], help students learn from the professors of some the best universities in the world.
