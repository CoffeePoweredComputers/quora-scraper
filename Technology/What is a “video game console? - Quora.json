            "answer_text": "What does game console mean? The typical meaning of the term in modern usage is typically referring to a Video Game Console. System like the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One are examples of video game consoles.  (I\u2019m a Playstation owner, so that\u2019s the picture you\u2019re getting. XBox is a fine system, just not my personal preference.) You will sometimes hear the word \u201cconsole\u201d used with regard to computing, where it is used to refer to a text input used to monitor the status of a system, often at a very low level compared to what the user would normally see\u2026. but you won\u2019t usually hear that in conjunction with the word \u201cgame\u201d, so if someone mentions a \u201cgame console\u201d, it\u2019s a safe bet they\u2019re referring to something like the above. EDIT NOTE: \u201cGame Console\u201d and \u201cConsole Game\u201d are not the same thing. Word order matters. Do not merge this question with the similarly phrased \u201cWhat does console game mean?\u201d question, because they are not the same question. ",
