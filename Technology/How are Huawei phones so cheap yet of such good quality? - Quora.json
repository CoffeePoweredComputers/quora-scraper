            "answer_text": "Chinese labor. Factory workers can get paid between $1.75-$2.50 USD per hour (average Foxconn pay).. PLUS they have a longer work schedule, working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. So they have very strong pricing power.. all Chinese phones can afford to sell smartphones at a very low price.. other companies like ZTE or Oppo can push out low costing phones as well as Huawei. Huawei actually doesn't sell \u201ccheap budget phones\u201d anymore under the Huawei name.. instead they created \u201cHonor\u201d to sell cheap Android phones under. In regards to build quality, keep in mind, iPhones are all made it China\u2026 just because it's made in China, that doesn't mean the quality is low. A lot of phones and phone or computer parts are made in China.. especially motherboards and lithium batteries. Chinese phones are good, it's just that their software lacks and Chinese phones tend to lack style and originality because phones like Google and Apple does a good job with style and they create some of the best software in the world because they have Silicon Valley engineers who help make the software. But Chinese phones are built well, I have a ZTE budget phone and the build quality is very good.. the screen looks excellent and the hardware inside the phone itself is the same quality as any other phone.. smartphones use parts all from the same companies: Samsung makes RAM, SSD, cameras sensors, and AMOLED screens.. LG makes OLED and LCD screens and sometimes assemble entire phones for other companies\u2026 Sony makes camera sensors.. Taiwan makes SSD and batteries all come from various companies in China.. SanDisk and Corning's Gorilla Glass is from the USA however. Even computers and computer parts are all made in China or Taiwan, but the computer sometimes gets assembled in the USA and the software usually is always made in the USA. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they\u2019re manufactured from China. But Huawei isn\u2019t even the cheapest out there. Companies like Oppo and Xiaomi are probably the best bang-for-buck out there. For example, last year, the Pocophone F1 had the best processor on the market with cameras outperforming the iPhone X (in most cases) and good speakers for only 300$. The OnePlus 7 Pro (Oppo) was the first consumer smartphone with UFS 3.0 and the second to get a 90 hz AMOLED in their phones, even though it was only 700$ And there are many other companies like Nubia and Vivo. Huawei is more of an expensive flagship company that sometimes does budget smartphones. ",

            "answer_text": "It's cheap if you are living in a high standard of living countries otherwise it is considered well priced in Asia. Since Huawei and Apple phones are built in China, why Apple phones so expensive yet they are in similar built quality. ",
