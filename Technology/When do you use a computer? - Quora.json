I\u2019m also watching TV. There\u2019s a computer in the TV that lets me watch catchup TV from the internet. There\u2019s a computer in the TV that changes the standard definition broadcast stream and upscales it for the UHD screen. The computer in my phone told me about an appointment today. The computers in my car let me save on fuel and reduce emissions. When I come out to the kitchen at night to get a glass of water there is probably thirty LEDs I can see connected to various computers. Did you mean a computer I have to sit in front of to use or anything that does computing? ",

Even things like email & web searches I prefer doing on something with a decent screen and a full keyboard. The only things I tend to use my phone / tablet for is ebooks, now and then forum (though I also prefer to have a \"real\" keyboard for this), short messaging, photos (only quick low quality stuff - much better results with a \"real\" camera) & sharing. Of course, I do still use the phone to ... uhm ... use it as a \"phone\". ",
