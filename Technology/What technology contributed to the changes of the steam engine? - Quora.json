            "answer_text": "The reciprocating steam engine that was widely used in the 19th century on steam locomotives, ships and in industry evolved from the atmospheric engine of Thomas Newcomen. The main technologies that contributed to its improvement were various patents to make the engine more efficient, to convert its motion into rotary motion and to introduce linkages to alter the valve timings, allowing, amongst other things, the reversal of the engine. James Watt was one of the noteworthy contributors in these areas, and came up with the idea of a separate condenser and the application of a crank to produce rotary motion, as well as several other developments. One of the main limitations of the steam engine during the 19th century was the steam pressure. In the early to mid 19th century, boilers simply weren't strong enough to withstand the pressure required for efficient operation. This was due to the inherent weakness of the materials used as well as the boiler design itself. Boiler design gradually improved throughout the 19th century, along with improvements in metallurgy and with the introduction of steel. This led to the operating pressure increasing from around just a few psi in 1800 to around 200 psi by the 1900. The higher pressure meant that the steam could do more work, and this was achieved by using several expansion stages\u2014a design with high and low pressure cylinders, with the higher pressure cylinders exhausting into the lower pressure cylinders. This improved efficiency considerably. The peak of reciprocating engine design was probably the quadruple expansion engine that was used on the great German liners at the end of the 19th century. In the early 1900s the steam turbine was developed and was put to use on early ships like the Lusitania. The turbine rapidly became adopted as the choice means of power in larger ships and also in electricity generation, while the reciprocating steam engine was gradually phased out. Development continued in the efficiency of steam plants. Modern turbines can have a high-pressure stage of up to 2400 psi, and the steam is often generated by nuclear power. ",

            "answer_text": "Starting from earliest times, the ability to cast metal into cylinders and beams for beam engines, the ability to bore a true cylinder all came together by 1860/70. Boiler design and development led to higher steam pressure resulting in either more efficiency and/or use of smaller cylinders for the same work output. Higher boiler pressure led on to compounding and triple expansion engines for all sorts of duties. Superheating of the steam supply led to greater efficiency but required oil lubrication of the cylinders. Exhaust turbines and second cylinder re heat improved efficiency even further, This was about as far as simple steam engines got but detailed developments in machining and valve gear, engine design (willans, uniflow etc) raised the standards even higher and refinements in bearing metals and machining. They got BIG. ",
