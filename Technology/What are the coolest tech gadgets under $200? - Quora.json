            "answer_text": "Best VR Headset: Oculus Go  See on Amazon With an affordable price tag, the Oculus Go is the headset that\u2019s going to bring virtual reality into homes and dorm rooms far and wide. The device is the standalone, wireless alternative to the Oculus Rift, and is nearly comparable to its older sibling, ideal for those who don\u2019t want to spend the extra money or are looking for a more casual VR experience. The Oculus Go secures to your head with soft, adjustable straps and boasts a plush inner lining for comfort, although wearing it for long periods of time can be fatiguing. It comes equipped with an intuitive 3DoF controller and hidden speakers built into the straps for more immersive, dynamic audio. Expect high-quality graphics thanks to wide quad, fast-switch LCD for sharp visual clarity, and the next-generation Oculus lenses will reduce glare. The Oculus Pro is available with memory options of 32 GB and 64 GB, and while it has received some criticism for light leakage, the engaging audio and visual distract from this minor drawback, especially as you are able to dive into your favorite film, app, or game for an accessible price. Best E-Reader: Kindle Paperwhite  See on Amazon There are more than a few models in the Kindle line, from affordable Fire tablets to the basic Kindle e-reader. But if you\u2019re looking for the best option for a long-lasting e-reader as a gift that just works well with some great features, look no further than the latest gen of the Paperwhite. The 300ppi resolution on the e-ink screen gives a clean, clear and super-legible look to the display, bolstered by a bright backlight for night reading. And because the screen is just simple e-ink, Amazon promises that the device's charge will last for weeks at a time, whether it\u2019s being read or in standby. The newest generation of Kindle steps up the previous one by doubling the storage from 4GB to 8GB, giving you even more space for books. You can also choose a 32GB option if the reader is someone who likes to read more data-grabbing media like magazines and comics. They\u2019ve also included an IPX8 waterproof rating, meaning the Kindle can be submerged up to two meters in freshwater for as long as 60 minutes. That makes it a great gift for the travel-enthusiast in your life because it\u2019ll work on the beach, in the rain, and can withstand a spilled water bottle when they're on the go. Plus, with Wi-Fi or cell connectivity and a super-slim frame (only half an inch thick), it\u2019s the perfect size to toss into a carry-on or commuter bag. Check out our other reviews of the best e-readers\u200b available on the market today. Best Bluetooth Speaker: Bose SoundLink Color II  See on AmazonSee on WalmartSee on Best Buy The Bluetooth speaker market is clogged to the brim with cheap, low-quality devices that aren\u2019t likely to last well into the future. If you really want to surprise the music lover in your life with something that\u2019s sure to deliver long-lasting, high-quality sound, you need to check out the Bose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker II. The battery offers up to eight hours of continuous play; it features voice prompts for simple and easy control; and it fits in the palm of your hand. Interested in reading more reviews? Take a look at our selection of the best bluetooth speakers. Best Digital Assistant: Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Generation)  See on Amazon Don\u2019t let its compact size fool you: The Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation packs a punch. At a surprisingly affordable price point, this Alexa-enabled digital assistant and smart home hub makes a perfect gift that\u2019s fit for any room in the house. Need to add something to your shopping list? Alexa can help. If you want to call or send someone a message, just ask Alexa.

Once they connect their service of choice, all they have to do is ask Alexa to play their favorite song, album, or genre and the Dot takes care of the rest. With speakers that are 70 percent louder than the previous generation, this diminutive tool is louder than it looks \u2014 but if your audiophile friend has their own set of speakers they swear by, the Dot can easily be connected to an external speaker over Bluetooth or with a 3.5mm cable. And of course, the Echo Dot is an obvious choice for a smart home hub. Need a gift for someone with a Nest thermostat, Ring doorbell, or another popular smart home device? The Dot consolidates control for all kinds of devices using Alexa. Ask it to turn on lights, start the coffee maker, or adjust the temperature, all without leaving the sofa.

Throw in three available colors and a mesh design that blends easily in any room and you\u2019ve discovered the only gift you need to give. Best Streaming Device: Roku 4  See on AmazonSee on Walmart The first thing you need to do when you decide to finally and permanently cut your cable TV subscription is to choose a streaming media device. Your best bet is to go with a set-top box, like Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV or Roku. We recommend Roku. The newest generation Roku 4 connects seamlessly with all your favorite apps (Netflix, Amazon, HBO GO, YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, etc.). It\u2019s quick and easy to install, and it even features a USB drive, allowing you to play personal files from hard storage. An awesome gift for anyone who is just about fed up with their cable company. Interested in reading more reviews? Take a look at our selection of the best streaming devices. Best Speaker Design: Harman Kardon Soundsticks III  See on AmazonSee on Walmart These are some speakers out of Minority Report or something \u2014 they look more like chemistry equipment rather than computer speakers. But don\u2019t be too distracted by the futuristic look. The Harman Kardon SoundSticks are some awesome-sounding speakers. They include four, 1-inch full-range transducers per channel powered by a 10-watt amplifier, as well as a one 6-inch low-frequency transducer with a 20 watt amp for room-filling bass response. With the 3.5 mm stereo connection, you can connect the speakers to virtually any device. This is a great gift idea for design-conscious music nerds.

What to Look for in Tech Gifts Under $200 Smart devices - When you\u2019re buying a gift for someone who\u2019s really into tech, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019ve already jumped into the world of smart devices. If they haven\u2019t, look for a starter kit that includes a hub and a few devices like switches and light bulbs. If they already have a hub, look for smart devices that work with that hub. Gifts for audiophiles - If the person you\u2019re buying a gift for loves music, then look at high-tech speakers. Smart speakers come with integrated virtual assistants, but they can also stream music and do a whole lot more. For a more portable option, look for a Bluetooth speaker. Readers - The best gift for a tech-lover who also loves to read is an e-reader.
