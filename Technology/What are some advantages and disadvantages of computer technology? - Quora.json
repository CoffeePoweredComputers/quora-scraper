            "answer_text": "I'm not a business owner, but I'll try to put myself in your shoes.The advantages and disadvantages depend on what your business is all about. If well implemented, technology (anything from automation of the office or work buildings, backup power systems, down to servers, PCs, tablets, smartphones, etc) can help employees and managers achieve optimal productivity (the sweet spot, not the maximum), business owners/administrators can keep track of everything that happens, you can keep in touch with customers and perform analysis on feedback data to establish the list of priority changes to increase customer satisfaction, and so many other things that take a lot of time to enumerate.Disadvantages can become trade-offs instead of bumps on the road, as long as you have a competent CTO that leads a dedicated and highly-skilled team of engineers and technicians. Disadvantages can stem from poor management, investments done with little or no planning and troublesome deployment, not training workers to use the full potential of the technology infrastructure, not having a BYOD culture, allowing unnecessary distractions, etc. You can also get problems from complicating things too much, which can cause slow-downs, downtime, etc. Blind cost-cutting and cheaping out will always have a negative effect, and the same goes with over-spending on things that don't make sense for your business.  That being said, the question is very broad, and so is my answer. An IT consulting firm can give you a much better answer, one that is in tune with your specific needs. You won't get it for free from someone on Quora.TLDR: The question is very broad. The advantages and disadvantages depend on implementation, business size, employee skill levels, sector/sectors of activity, etc. In the right hands, technology can work wonders (pun intended), but it can fail miserably or make no difference if you don't think about every detail and how it all fits into your business strategy.
