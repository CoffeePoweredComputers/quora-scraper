            "answer_text": "He might have counted achievements but his achievement in life is unpredictable.... His only thing that is loved the most is he never give up. I know some of his achievements, When he was at very small age (I don't know at which age, you need to search for that) he made his own game and sold it out. He is indeed a tech entrepreneur. He is CEO of his technology corporation named Space X. And he also has a great influence in the Tesla and the boring company, paypal or something, sorry I don't remember the names properly. Recently, he has worked on his project of reusable rockets... Means you can't just imagine this idea even I would not. He also made a solar city with electric cars, I guess . And he also has a plan to take people on Mars. This is all I know about this man. Truly, name for the caption, You say me know you can't, and I will do that. Elon Musk on the top. Thanks. Edits are always welcome! Edits - The name of the game is blaster, he cried at the age of 12 and sold it for 500$.It's PayPal not Payday I have corrected it. Thankyou @Priyanka Dwivedi . ~Ishwari DHALE. ",
