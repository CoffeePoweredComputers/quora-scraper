            "answer_text": "Much the same way you \u2018receive\u2019 citizenship for any other country \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of work and requires special circumstances and/or skills. If you marry a Faroe Islander, you can apply for residency. Same if you get a job \u2014 but it will have to be a very good job that \u2018only\u2019 you can do, otherwise they will hire a Faroese person (or a Dane, or a Norwegian\u2026 all of these will come before you in line because of language/cultural/legal reasons). A very few people also come through other circumstances. Once you get residency, you can work your way towards citizenship over the course of many years. There are no shortcuts. If your goal is to move to the Faroes, you should start by learning Faroese. Danish and excellent English are also recommended if you will be competing there for jobs, since most everyone on the islands speaks those three languages. ",
