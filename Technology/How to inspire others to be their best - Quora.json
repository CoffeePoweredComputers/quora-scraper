            "answer_text": "The key is not to try to inspire anyone . Just be kind to people and it will take notice. Law of attraction. Eventually if you try to seek out others or try to inspire people, you will get caught up in just trying to inspire people and it will take away from the good you're doing because it will no longer be your main focus. Key factor , do good things to help others, and that one person you wont even see, will take notice..they will then remember that moment and do the same\u2661 ",

            "answer_text": "I feel when you inspire others you should not only talk about the success stories but also make them understand the importance of failure and how failing is natural and everybody fails in some or the other point in life , sometimes what happens is that we always try to tell the positive things and make that person live in a delusion world, now I am not saying to not speak positive things or anything. What I am trying to say is that you need to make that person know that when you do certain things which you have never tried or experienced failure might come and they might feel sad and hopeless but they should keep moving and try to take the positive out of every negative situation. One of the best ways to inspire others is giving them a real life example, quotes r something which can connect with you but if you give real life example like if someone has gone through the same thing in your friends or someone you have heard of have gone through the same thing and overcame it then you should try to relate the things and tell them. Best line which i feel is that \u201cDon't search for inspiration, Do something or overcome the problems in your life in your own ways so that you can be someone else's inspiration to succeed in whatever thing they do.\u201d ",
