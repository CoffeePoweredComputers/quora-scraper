            "answer_text": "In my opinion; the ability to convey speech over wires was a natural consequence of the success of the telegraph- in which coded signals were transmitted - and an operator converted words into coded signal at transmission and vice versa on receception of a coded message. The next level of telephony came with combining wireless transmission with speech in the form of one way flow at a time( so between two connected sets only one person could speak at a time- unlike on landline based devices). This morphed into the two way capability. Improvements in computer processing capabilities made possible the switch from physical location based devices ( the landline model) to devices capable of being carried by the user - with the ability to keep real time traxk of its location from tower to tower in cell phone networks.
