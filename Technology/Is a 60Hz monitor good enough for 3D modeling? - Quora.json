            "answer_text": "Yes. For modeling and content creation, the color gamut and color accuracy should be more important because you need the monitor to display your content as accurate as possible. You only need high refresh rate when you watch content that is moving fast like playing eSports titles (especially for shooting games) like CS:Go, Fortnite, etc. For normal use, 60Hz is perfectly fine. Maybe you will need a 144Hz screen for content creation if you want to create content that display 144 FPS but the standard content (movies, tv, youtube) is still 24\u201330\u201360 FPS. ",

            "answer_text": "yes. actually what is more important is that if you will use that monitor to other graphic design tasks? if so make sure it has 10 bit colour connection instead of 8, refresh rate at 60 Hz is absolutely enough for work with 3d. ",
