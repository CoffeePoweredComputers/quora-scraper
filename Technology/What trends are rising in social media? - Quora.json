            "answer_text": "You often see familiar topics such as how to make money online, how to achieve great traffic, problems with using social networks. But almost no one is interested in the development trend of social media marketing, these are the orientations and platforms for you to learn about the issues on what I have said. Just like you must have a cake, you know whether the inside is meat or jam. So, what are those new trends? 1.Social Listening Social Listening is a web-based data collection and social media platform to find all the mention of a brand. This includes mentioning a brand that is not tagged on social media, referring to industry keywords that signal interest in buying a product, mentioned on blogs, forums and news sites. The current main objectives of social listening are customer service and reputation management.  While using social listening for these two reasons is expected to grow even further, the real trend will be to use social media to understand and sell based on insights. So far, only a handful of brands do this, but that number is gradually increasing as marketers discover that they can find people looking for the exact services they offer superior social media. 2. Video content In fact, according to some experts, 80% of what we consume online will soon be the form of video content. This is especially true with live video. Always popular on YouTube, the trend now dominates Facebook and Instagram, so much so that every day we go to social networks, live videos will immediately appear on our bulletin board. The authentic nature of live video makes them particularly attractive and meaningful for social media users. Live videos increase the credibility and relevance of a brand and that is the trend you don't want to ignore. The main reason why videos are becoming popular is because movie recording becomes easier, even at a good production level. Although the brand's audience will forgive by understanding that live video is spontaneous and everything may be wrong, the brand should still find ways to avoid intermittent technical errors that make users feel uncomfortable.  3. Micro-influencers In the past few years, influential people on social media have become a big trend. We have Instagram stars, influential people on Twitter or YouTube. These people have millions of followers - each of their posts, or vlogs or tweets are immediately visible - more than those who make TV ads can hope. Those influencers make a lot of money, you can see in this article to know how much they get from social networks: https://www.quora.com/How-exactly-do-people-on-Instagram-get-hundreds-of-thousands-of-followers-There-must-be-an-art-to-this/answer/Olwen-Stephen However, as the number of people with social media influences increased over time, their service prices also skyrocketed. That leads to many businesses looking for other alternatives, including micro-influential marketing. Contrary to the influential people, small influencers exist in all areas of marketing. They have followers of less than 10,000 people, but most of their followers really care about what they say. And they are very attached, even considered experts in their field. 4. Personalized With the huge amount of information uploaded by social network users every day, it is very easy to get detailed information about all kinds of information about them. This opened the door for enhanced personalization, thereby increasing consumer expectations. Content, products, emails - all can now be based on consumer purchase history, clicked links, social media posts and other behaviors. For example, Netflix offers programs to watch based on your interests, Amazon products and eBay display products. Same product as you previously purchased. Although personalized marketing can be frustrating, it is also really convenient for users. Up to 96% of marketers believe that personalization promotes customer relationships. Customers may worry about vague privacy risks, but they still appreciate the proposed product they've been looking for, as well as announcing the products in their favorite stores. 5. Real-time communication The almost immediate future of marketing is real-time communication. Social media trends in marketing are 24/7 customer support, real-time social sales, chatbot and continuous tracking for a potential social media crisis.  Social media never sleeps - customers continue to use your product, talk about them online and buy new items at any time, so real-time communication is extreme period needed. Now we have the tools to search for brand references in real time, the content scheduling tools will be posted at any time, the chatbot provides immediate help. Marketers need to find ways to adapt, but new tools and options will enhance the consumer process and provide new ways for marketers to have more ways to communicate with consumers. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Great answers from Kristy and Outi-Maaria - a few other thoughts.  1) Mobile is ramping up extremely fast - incumbent on bigger brands to embrace (as many are doing) mobile marketing and smaller brands moving forward.  2) Google and Facebook are sucking a great deal of the oxygen out of the marketplace, requiring start-ups to niche in and even this is not a safe strategy. Facebook's Social Deals good example of classic brand extension and \"Microsoft like\" market dominance through new application and services focus (or exchange Microsoft for Google). Groupon, Foursquare, Yelp and others have much lower valuation as a result of Facebook's move into Social Deals space.  3) Much more smoke and mirrors around Social Media Marketing and many companies (big and small) don't understand baseline marketing skills and how to measure ROI.  4) SEO optimized Content Development is not going away - critical for companies and brands to leverage content costs and re-purpose across the social web.  5) Brian Solis coined the term \"social consumer\" - this paradigm shift is right on the money - we are moving from ad driven world to \"social consumer\" driven, but still a place at the table for traditional, online and social advertising.  6) Look for LInkedIn to make more strategic shifts - the market is moving fast under them and they need to upgrade their platform/feature set to stay vital.  7) Global localization still lags across the Social Web - if you are an American or speak English it's easy to move around in a digital context, but much harder if English is not your primary language. The Social Web is global - we all need to figure out how to localize it better to drive usage, interaction, engagement and social commerce.  8) Facebook's Social Graph is now a commodity and a necessity - usage adoption will only accelerate moving forward as they continue to leverage economies of scale with brand/feature set/apps extensions.

            "answer_text": "1. Less is more, better is better. Social media is a crowded world already\u2014there are billions of users with social profiles, and they all follow hundreds to thousands of different accounts. On top of that, most platforms\u2019 newsfeed algorithms now sort posts based on a degree of perceived relevance, rather than based on the time of publication (in fact, Instagram just changed theirs over recently). Add in the fact that users are beginning to prefer hyper-relevant, in-the-moment content to regurgitated updates or retrospective posts, and you have a perfect formula for users to prefer fewer, but better posts. Quality has always been more important than quantity, but now social platforms and users are further cementing that fact. 2. A shift is happening in platform dynamics. Until recently, the three big players of the social media game were Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn\u2014almost indisputably\u2014and all three platforms served similar functions for slightly different niches. Today, those positions have changed and diversified; Instagram and Snapchat are newer players in the game, but each serves a niche role despite having massive user bases. 3. Live streaming is getting bigger. Video content has seen a huge spike in popularity over the past few years, in part because it has become a more accessible medium, and in part because users are growing tired of older mediums. Combined with the trend of users demanding more \u201clive\u201d and in-the-moment updates, live streaming video has seen a major increase in popularity; especially with the recent release of Facebook Live. 4. Buy buttons are becoming more common. Advertising on social media has always been around\u2014it\u2019s how they make money, after all\u2014but only recently has the advertising experience become something more akin to a shopping experience. Ads and products available to purchase are starting to work their way into users\u2019 newsfeeds and profiles more smoothly and with fewer distinctions from organic content. These are typically associated with the simple addition of a \u201cbuy\u201d button, which leads to an integrated cart to make it easier than ever to convert followers into real customers. 5. New applications are changing social interaction. The entire motivation behind social media\u2019s existence is the \u201csocial\u201d element; these platforms were developed for people to engage with one another, directly and for the most part, in conversational form. Now, forms of interaction are starting to diversify. Platforms like Snapchat are allowing more one-sided conversations, in a more fleeting, temporary context. Platforms like Facebook are launching new communication channels like Messenger for Business, which serves as a kind of customer service wing. Brands and consumers are able to talk to each other in new, more diverse ways, and that range is only broadening. 6. We\u2019re seeing a push for more personalization. Users are tired of seeing the same types of content populate in their newsfeeds, and they\u2019re tired of seeing posts they don\u2019t care about. There\u2019s a greater demand for personalization and customization, and platforms and publishers alike are doing what they can to cater to that demand. In fact, Facebook was recently accused of having a political bias because its personalization algorithm tended to display stories with a political leaning already similar to its targeted users\u2019 preferences. 7. We\u2019re getting broader app functionality. Social media apps are developed and owned by companies, and those companies need to make money to survive. They can sell ad space and user data, but they lose attention and user potential every time a user clicks out of an app. To remedy this, social platforms are doing more to keep users involved in-app for the longest time possible, offering peripheral functionality to keep users contented on more fronts. Some of these functions include in-app search functions, embedded content, and in Facebook\u2019s case, even a personal digital assistant. ",

Termed as \u2018\u2019in-the-moment\u2019\u2019 updates, this feature is sure to gain prominence in the year 2016. You\u2019ll experience live video broadcasts from users. Social Media Examiner reveals that Periscope and Meerakat are already providing this feature and are seen as major trendsetters. Instagram and Snapchat also allow viewers to post their in-the-moments updates.   2. New Buy Features - Hootsuite reveals that Pinterest and Facebook recently introduced new \u2018\u2019buy\u2019\u2019 feature for their users and advertisers. These buttons allow users to purchase a product that they see in a sponsored post right from the \u2018buy button\u2019 without having to leave the page.  3. New Functionalities Added to Apps \u2013 In 2015, Facebook introduced \u2018Instant Articles\u2019, which revolutionized the way of publishing. In addition, videos that automatically start playing as you come scrolling down to them also became a fad in 2015. 4. More Publication Options - After Facebook successfully launched \u2018Instant Articles\u2019, a number of social media sites started working on their own publication options. Twitter will soon come out with its \u2018Project Lightning\u2019 to allow its users to publish content in a dynamic way. 5. Users Concerns on Privacy - With growing technological advancements, more and more users are growing impatient and worried about privacy and security of data on social channels. In the coming days, this concern will become even greater for users and the social media platforms alike. This is where channels like Snapchat come into play. 6. Emojis and Emoticons In Messages   This is raising nowadays in every social platforms. Highest use ratio in Instagram, Twitter and then to Facebook. Instagram\u2019s Hyperlapse app, states that nearly half of the text on Instagram contain emojis. This includes comments, captions and the recently-introduced emoji-capable hashtags. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some social media trends to look for in 2016: Emojis everywhere Emojis are spreading everywhere. Brands started talking the language of emojis. They are even in hashtags. I guess we'll see more of them as the social media content and not just as a funny additional text.  Read everything in the social app Publishers get it that people don't want to leave their social apps to read another click-bait. So they move inside the app. Facebook started it this year and I guess we'll see more of it (like LinkedIn pulse, and even Pinterest and Twitter will have to figure out how to serve their users with content instead of links).  Power-users serving sponsored content With the rise of AdBlocks and the native difficulty of effective online advertising, the sponsored content is going native. They call it Influencer Marketing and its buzzing now. Basically, it means that brands are looking for niche-influential users to showcase their products. It's the time of Instagram fashionistas, YouTube unboxers, and Twitter techies to be approached by brands, test products and share their thoughts. The more authentic and free-thought it is, the more likely it to succeed.  Content with expiration date The Snapchat vibe is spreading to other social platforms. Twitter adopted that mindset with the Polls feature that lasts for 24 hours only. The social video platforms like Periscope and Meerkat are also doing so with framed timed content access. The main goal is to force the user to engage NOW (and not save things for later).  I hope we'll see some of these things mentioned here in 2016. The big players in the industry are constantly implementing interesting changes in their products.  But the thing I most excited about the upcoming future is to see new players in town and feel how they game-change the industry (who's gonna be 2016's Periscope?). That can't be predicted. ",

Videos and Social Media Artists Let the experts make the campaign for you If it\u2019s too late for you to get organic reach on a social media network but you still want to have reach there because it\u2019s where your audience is hanging out. You can reach out to influencers on this platform, those who have succeeded in gathering a big number of followers across different platforms. You can find many with over 10K followers on Youtube and Instagram and you can work with them as content creators as they obviously know how to create social content as well as a media channel to talk to their followers in a fun and engaging way. These influencers have a big role to do in the social media addiction. They are just addictive to watch      Social sales and social ads  If you are placing ads on Facebook or Youtube it does not mean you are doing social media marketing. It means you are placing an ad on a social media network. Social media marketing is when you place an ad on a social network and it performs better than the average ad performs elsewhere because of virality. If your ad is being shared and liked and reposted after you spent a relatively small budget to promote it, then you are doing social media marketing the right way. Placing ads that are social by design or traditional ads on social media networks will get you good results. However social by design ads will outperform the traditional ones. Social network ad spending will reach $23.68 Billion Worldwide in 2015. The main driver and winner is Facebook . It\u2019s just been announced that there are currently 2 Million active advertisers on Facebook. Customer interface  \u201cUber, the world\u2019s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world\u2019s most popular media owner, creates no content. And Airbnb, the world\u2019s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate.

            "answer_text": " It would not be an exaggeration to say that the majority of people spend a large part of their days on social media. Not in the contemporary world. Social networking has been an important part of the everyday activities of people's lives. Some are so addicted to it that their first thing to do when they wake up is to update their social media feeds. Bearing in mind the role of social media in the lives of consumers, advertisers and companies flock to social networks in the hope of communicating with their target customers. Nonetheless, social media is flooded with content, and the competition is very strong. Unless you have a simple plan for social media marketing it can be incredibly difficult for you to stand out. Staying updated on the latest social media trends can help fire your strategy and make you stand out in the crowd. We need to be aware of the budding social media trends of 2020 and beyond to reach far better productivity and much better ROI. Plug Into the Power of Micro-Influencers Communities are a platform for engaging with micro-influencers who help their favourite brands already. It also enables to get these supporters to share truthful views about your goods or services and experiences. Active individuals like Frank Body\u2019s supporters want to create content about your brand, who will be enthusiastically applying chocolate scrub to their bodies and faces and sharing selfies with the # letsbefrank tag on social networks. Currently, smaller influencers \u2014 who seem to be probably a part of your communities \u2014 usually have stronger ties with their followers as they often see big influencers as disingenuous. Smaller influencers will increase brand interaction at a lower cost with the advantage of higher confidence rates as well as raise brand confidence, leading to more sales. Using Different Online Platforms For quite a while now Leviathans like Amazon, Facebook or Google are at the top of the sport, monopolizing most internet traffic. The main platforms used by B2C brands are usually Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, yet many users are getting tired of such platforms. Meanwhile, brands more than ever fail to achieve respectable levels of organic penetration and interaction. Channels such as TikTok and Pinterest help level the field of play by targeting users who move away from more conventional social networking sites and gain higher returns on ad expenditure. This influences how users communicate with the web as Pinterest is not only about posting content but about finding new stuff. In reality, unlike other sites, Pinterest users are twice as likely to claim that their time has been well spent, helping them learn new things (84%). In addition, 58% of Pinterest users say they are shopping using the app, more so than other sites. Social networking as a means of customer service will be a major phenomenon by 2020, because not only do consumers find it easy, but it\u2019s also a perfect way for them to get 24-hour support. Final Thoughts\u2026 \u201cSocial networking is now associated with digital marketing, with most \u2013 though not all \u2013 digital campaigns moving down like a lead balloon,\u201d says Smart Ideas. That being said, social media is far from static \u2014 strategies that operated a couple of months ago now do not always produce the same results. Today, finding more successful ways to reach your followers is important, so that you can skip the digital detox movement and use your platform to better communicate with your audience. It will also boost the online marketing strategy for a more productive 2020 by leveraging the power of micro-influencers, tapping into alternative channels and improving customer support through social media.

So to really keep up with the new trends, we need a company to help us with social media management. For me, I can say that one big trend now is Social Promotions. Well, you've probably seen this on your own Facebook or Twitter feeds. With this, companies are using different social contest like sweepstakes, group deals, discounts, freebies etc. to market their products, brand and even special events. It's really a better way to engage consumers with your brand, reminding them to buy your products and rewarding them at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "1. More User-Generated Content Have you heard of influencer marketing? That\u2019s all I read about when the topic of social media marketing arises. There are several success stories and some marketing campaigns have seen a 60% increase in engagement when using micro influencers. But I\u2019ve also read about disasters. Disasters leading to countless dollars poured into this form of marketing and seeing no results. Influencer marketing can be very beneficial still, but in 2019 I see a different form of influencer marketing being much more effective. I\u2019m talking about micro-influencer marketing. The use of a smaller scale influencer to promote your product or brand. More specifically, I\u2019m talking about using your audience as a means to promote your content to their personal connections. This can be done through user-generated content and brands that can figure out a way for their audience to generate content on their behalf will see a significant amount of success. Brands like Daniel Wellington and Starbucks who dominate the social media realm with their products are prime examples. Regardless of whether they promote it or not, there is this culture built around sharing the brand and product. Expect to see more companies trying to do the same in 2019. 2. Incorporate Video Content and Use Strong Visuals Visuals. Visuals. Visuals. The key is to capture your audience\u2019s\u2019 attention and we can\u2019t emphasize enough on how important visual content is. Statistics everywhere are proving that visual content is more engaging and has a greater effectiveness than non-visual content. Now the question then moves to, what type of visual content will be the most beneficial in 2019? The answer to this is; higher quality visuals and using video as a source of content in your social media marketing strategy. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and most other large social platforms have implemented video in their applications. There is a reason for that and if that\u2019s not an indicator of a trend moving to more video, then I don\u2019t know what is. YouTube isn\u2019t one of the biggest social platforms for no reason. If you have the resources or the time, focus on producing strong video content for your brand. Include content that is relevant and will catch the attention of your audience. Instagram video is emerging and we wrote a blog post explaining what Instagram video format is recommended! 3. Live Video and Real-Time Content Are you sick of getting the notification from your phone that your classmate in second grade has gone live on either Instagram or Facebook? Well, hopefully you aren\u2019t because social media is moving to more real-time content and you\u2019re about to see a lot more of those notifications. When Snapchat started, you could see what someone was doing almost instantly. It was as close to real-time as you can get and this was very unique. This is something that Instagram initially started as, but moved away from because users prioritized quality in their posts. Now we have near real-time content with Snapchat, Instagram stories, and even Facebook introducing a story like feature on their messenger. And well, the closest thing to real-time is actual real-time\u2026 Since we now have the resources to go live and be face-to-face with our audience, you can expect a lot more live notifications. And don\u2019t be surprised if you start to see Snapchat implementing something similar down the road since they have added video calls. 4. Engagement with Audience and Being Personable We\u2019re in a generation where automation is so prominent within companies, that we forget that there are actual people working within these brands. Whenever we get a personalized message or a human response, we\u2019re genuinely surprised and we\u2019ve grown to appreciate the interaction so much more. Applications like Slack and Facebook Chat bots are automating customer service, which in my opinion is fine. But, social media should be different and you should be having real conversations with your audience. Create a human side to your brand. Remember, those double-taps on Instagram and those Facebook likes are (most of the time) real people. You should make an effort to remind the faces behind those likes that you are also a human behind each post. Engage with your audience and build a close-knit community of raving fans that actually enjoy when you post. Ask questions to your audience, but more importantly, answer them when they ask questions back. Final Thoughts It\u2019s difficult to narrow down exactly what will happen in 2019 because honestly, anything is possible. The social media environment changes so quickly and it seems like there is always a new trend that surfaces throughout the year. What I can tell you is that the ball is fully in the court of the consumer. The audience now dictates the game and we have to cater our content to fit their needs. If your audience enjoys seeing your content, they will distribute and promote it to their own network for you. It might take a hundred interactions to get their attention, but all it takes is one poor interaction to lose their trust. ",

            "answer_text": "The unique aspect about Social media marketing as it moved from erstwhile Web 1.0 to its present much advanced avatar, has definitely been the rise in interactivity, lead generation capabilities and now social commerce. With social media applications taking turns to reach the podium (from ICQ to Orkut to now Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc) this landscape has witnessed an incredible change based on the nature and type of social interactions consumers have thrived for. Globally there have been many interesting trends which are helping propagate social media platforms and revenues. The most common among them include: 1. Experiential and native experiences: Social media marketing is moving from image to video to real-time experiential content which is highly native to the platform. Gone are the days of passive content and creativity for the sake of it. Brands these days need to start combining mobility, augmented and virtual reality, location-based updates to both intrigue and connect audiences across their social media presence. The future of social media hinges on experimentation and high adrenalin akin to the excitement of online gaming. In the not-so-distant future social networks will be able to both chaff and integrate social media activities of multiple individuals with common interests and showcase it to those who have an affinity for similar themes. Platforms which are already suggesting us posts we might like will also be able to guide us and connect to brands which we would have an intent to buy from (based on our earlier brand interactions across specific categories). Firms need to think deeply on creating such native experiences which are meaningful and at the same time can guide social commerce to make social media marketing a top channel for monetization. 2. Changing course of organic traffic: Social media is going the paid way, similar to all other traditional platforms which started in an organic manner. But the lure of executing marketing on social platforms is only rising. With Facebook\u2019s latest announcement on promoting posts across an individual\u2019s social group (friends and family), it is placing a premium on brands to incorporate more social media advertising in their mix. Brands now need to think how to best integrate their organic and paid social media efforts in the most productive manner. While we believe we are doing our best to generate organic posts, which are high on creativity, the glut of Facebook pages and content posted on them is also impacting this shift. Brands thus need to put in not only higher efforts to increase organic effectiveness but also invest in paid social media advertisements so that they are able to target audiences in the most integrated manner. Brands need to go back-to-basics and develop not only incredible content but also test their audiences for specific preferences to make the most of their investments. 3. Rise of \u201cthe disappearing content\u201d: Also known as \u201cEphemeral Content\u201d or content which disappears in 24 hours (on Snapchat), this has been one of the most interesting additions to social media platforms. Such visual content became a trend which Instagram also adopted (along-with the option to share live ephemeral video). Also known more popularly as \u201cStories\u201d these days, this content format is trending heavily owing to high consumer engagement for such authentic, cutting-edge, unscripted content. Stories typically have a fun element and allow addition of multiple filters, text and tags. In Instagram, discoverability is a key feature which means users can view and interact with brand stories even if they are not following the brand. Major types of stories include: (a) Live events (b) How-to videos/behind-the-scenes looks (c) Contests and giveaways (d) Interviews (e) Takeovers (different user decides what content to share) (f ) Daily or weekly video series (g) Announcements or product reveals 4. Influencer as the new celebrity: Influencer marketing, is one of the fastest trending areas across social media marketing. With a lot of advertising dollars chasing multiple influencer types across multiple vertical and hobby-related areas, it is essential for firms to get on to the bandwagon to leverage the large followership across this channel. While it is a growing trend, there are also major challenges which brands face in terms of identifying influencers who are effective and can be trusted. Influencers need to provide the right face-lift for brands in terms of authenticity. While a lot of money is targeted in an effective manner, a lot of it is also thrown around in the name of a large followership, which does not exactly yield desired results. Brands need to make sure they are associated with the right experts and should have a clear plan on how to best engage them for successful campaigns. 5. Prominence of video and live content: While video as a category has been trending heavily since the past two years, attention is now shifting on how to make videos really count. Also, the changing nature of video itself is a feast to track. There is live streaming, deferred videos, expiring videos and most of all silent videos (which are trending strongly). According to Digiday, more than 85% of videos on Facebook are watched without sound which talks a lot about how people want to consume video content sans sound in an already loud environment. Captions too are getting importance in this context and are a must have. Live streaming is another important trend in video-based marketing. With tools like Twitter\u2019s Periscope, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live gaining importance, marketers can now showcase live product demos, stream live events, execute Q&A sessions and even generate buzz through live contests and giveaways in a targeted manner. 6. Messaging apps becoming critical: The biggest social media trend apart from video is undoubtedly the universal acceptance of messaging apps. What grew as just popular interest in terms of WhatsApp has now grown into a phenomenon, wherein most of the social interactions today are growing across this platform. While messaging apps are also termed as the \u201cDark Social\u201d (because brands are not able to trace conversations to monetize them), there has been strong interest of late in utilizing messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, WeChat and even WhatsApp for brand marketing innovatively. Some common ways include missed calls, specific groups, customer assistance, real-time reservations/bookings, etc. 7. Regional and local connect: With vernacular opportunity knocking doors, the time is ripe for regional players to venture into local social media network platforms. With regional language stickers and filters being launched for multiple festive occasions by brands, multi-lingual content has proven to be highly popular. According to an article in Economic Times newspaper, the potential market size for non-English social media and digital content platforms is 300 million currently and is expected to grow to 700 million by 2022. Few examples include Mooshak which has 20,000 active monthly users and supports Hindi, Kannada and Marathi languages. Others include ShareChat with 17 million monthly active users and Gutrgoo with 5000 registered users. 8. Rise in social media e-commerce: According to Shopify, \u201cFacebook dominates as a source of sales and enjoys the highest conversion rate for all social media e-commerce traffic at 1.85%. In addition, an average of 85% of all orders from social media comes from Facebook\u201d. With Facebook launching its Marketplace and Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest following suit, social commerce is turning out as one crucial trend which is pulling social-media up the holy grail of digital commerce. According to a survey from Aimia, 56% of consumers said they followed brands on social media to browse products for sale, and 31% of online shoppers say they are using social media specifically to look for new items to purchase, which means that the trend is here to stay. 9. User-generated content (UGC) promotion by brands: Another very interesting development is the promotion of user-generated content on brand\u2019s own handle. Brands these days are encouraging highly active followers to share pictures and videos with their brand names/products embedded within. For the ones which are good, brands share the messages across their social audience, which not only gives authenticity to the brand but also uplifts the user who generated the content in the first place. 10. Social media getting younger and older together: The most interesting trend is how social media at one hand is generating engagement across Gen Z (born in the late 1990s/early 2000s) and at the same time getting older. It is all thanks to Facebook where 53% of U.S. social media users are now 35 or older. With older generations taking social media in their stride and younger audiences flocking to newer platforms, brands investing in social media need to keep close track of their audiences across the platforms being targeted. More importantly, social media platforms need to be aware of specific features to target both kinds of demographic lest they entirely lose the plot with one of them. ",

Start by scrolling and see what you find, or you can start in the Following tab and sync your contacts to find your friends who are using the app. The Discover tab is also a good place to find content. See what hashtags are trending and search for what you're interested in. If you like a video, double-tap it or hit the heart button. Most of the ways you can interact with a video are on the right side of the screen. The creator's profile, the \"like\" heart, the comment section, share options and the rotating icon that will show you other videos that use that particular song. If you long-press the screen you can save a video, add it to your favorites collection or say you're not interested in it. You can also access the creator's profile by swiping left. From there, you can follow that creator. The layout is similar to Instagram, except its only videos, so it shouldn't feel too foreign. As you get more involved in the platform and engage with more people, you can find likes and comments from your followers in the Notifications tab. Your private-message inbox is also in the Notifications tab. To make any adjustments to your account, like privacy settings or push notifications, for example, tap the profile icon. How to make a video on TikTok Tap the white \"+\" at the bottom center of the screen and give TikTok the necessary permissions it asks for. You can either film something new or upload a video. You can trim a video immediately after uploading it. Your sound editing options are at the top right, and the video editing controls are at the bottom left of the screen. To add a song to your post, tap Select Sound in the top right. From there, you can search for songs by playlists, popularity or hashtags. Once you find the perfect tune, tap the red checkmark to add it. Use the Mixer tool or Trim to get the song just how you want it. Tap the smiley face to add stickers, GIFs or emojis. Some of the stickers are animated. Once you drop one in your video, you can drag it into place or, if you'd rather delete it, to the top of the screen where a tiny trash can will appear. Also, you can use Effects. Here you'll find more visual filters to drop over your video like Rainbow, Water, Snow, and Feathers. The cool part is, you can change filters as much as your video allows. Simply long-press on a filter to apply it and let go to stop. Tap Stickers to add Snapchat-style face filters to the video. In Effects, you can add transitions like Scroll, Rotate, Slip and more. Finally, you can add reverse effects, flash or slow motion to your video. Before you publish, tap Select Cover to create a thumbnail that other people will see when they find your video. There's a text box where you can write a bit about your video, add some hashtags or tag friends. Customize your preferences by tapping Who Can View This Video and choose between public, friends only or private. You can also toggle comments on or off. Save your video to drafts, automatically post it to Twitter or post it to TikTok only. Trending Videos What's trending is important to a video's success on any social media platform. Pay attention to hashtags, what's popular right now and what's trending in the Discover tab. You can stick a hashtag on your video to make it more findable. The more relevant your content is, the better it'll do with your audience. More Interesting Articles Profits Online ",

Measuring ROI is the One of the Top Challenges Faced by Marketers. It was found that most businesses know how to track their social presence and traffic, but the confidence declines when measuring lead generations and sales. 4. Marketing Agencies View the Value of Social Media Marketing Differently It was found that social media clearly helps search results for many businesses, but the largest majority of companies benefit from posting content on their company blog. This is especially helpful when integrated with social sharing buttons. This survey perhaps clarifies why many businesses are reluctant to invest their advertising dollars on social sites. Marketing agencies see the least value derived from advertisements. 5.

Live streaming won't be limited to Twitch and Periscope - even Facebook rolled out a live streaming feature for fan pages just now. Also, with Facebook, HTC and Sony working harder than ever on Virtual Reality headsets, things are bound to undergo a huge change.  The biggest of them all is definitely YouTube, with over 500 hours of video being uploaded every minute. Vloggers are now becoming sensations overnight, people like Lilly Singh are selling out tour dates left and right and girls posting make up tutorials are earning enough money to travel to exotic locations every couple of months. For businesses this has enormous implications, as it's important to get on board before you're the last one in the industry to do it. Many companies are using YouTube videos or investing in vloggers for getting their products or services out there and building a reputation. Indeed, it's going to be an interesting year!

            "answer_text": "Trends such as influencer marketing, niche social platforms, ephemeral content, social communities, video content are not uncommon nowadays in the social media world. However, there are also future developments that may follow on from these trends which could cause social media to have an even bigger impact on our lives than it does already. Social commerceBrands and retail commerce is already prominent on social media, which is only set to grow in the coming years. There are already shops who rely on Instagram only to conduct business. This market will expand, with more and more brands aiming to sell their products through \u2018shoppable\u2019 posts. Video ContentA one minute video is said to be worth around 1.8 million words, holding an individual's attention for 2.7 minutes compared to the 10-20 seconds spent reading a webpage. Considering this, no wonder marketing experts are focussing their attention on videos to advertise their products. It is predicted that around 82% of online content will be video by 2022. PrivacyNiche social networks that capitalise on privacy, safety and security will become successful and more widely used. Current social media networks may also alter their features to reduce the likelihood of targeted ads, tracking and data collection. Social media is considered unsafe by many people, and social networks and regulatory bodies will have put more policies in place. New social networks will continue to appear (Openbook, Squadroon, Fourview) because the existing have not been able to offer safety and security to users (MeWe, Vero). Social media trends like those mentioned above are likely to continue to grow, whilst developers may also introduce new ones that we have never even imagined. ",

Really taking a look at social media and seeing it less as pieces (here's my Twitter account, here's my Facebook page, here's my YouTube channel, etc.) and thinking, \"How can I incorporate these and others into my site?\" For example, e-commerce companies should be thinking about incorporating social media into their shopping experience - letting customers tell their friends what they just bought, or seeing what friends bought that item and what they have said about it, etc. I see the TripAdvisor model as a good example of this. When you search for tips on a hotel or a location, if you sign in using Facebook, you see what your friends think before you see what strangers think.  I also think the idea of social search is going to change the way consumers use Google, Bing, etc. The idea of SEO will have to change to include SMO. I mean, who are you more likely to trust? Marketers or your friends/networks. ",

This also challenges the thinking that online business is somehow different than offline. 2) Facebook Open Graph and others are challenging search engines and also SEO markets. People have more power than planned optimization activities which in turn forces businesses to provide better service and build stronger brands. 3) People have to re-think their personal information in social media. What to reveal, for whom to give permission to this personal data, which services to use, and so on. Critical thinking in social media will rise and it's a positive thing. We have to start thinking who owns the data. ",

            "answer_text": "Google My Business. That is how people find local businesses. Not Instagram or Facebook. Some studies have shown that consistently posting on Google My Business helps business improve their local search ranking and show up in the Google Maps \u201c3-pack\u201d. If you need a way to post to Google My Business and social media at the same time, I am the founder of a social media tool called OneUp that allows you to schedule and automatically repeat your posts on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram (including Instagram Stories) and Google My Business for only $4 per month. I am obviously biased, but I think it is the best tool for posting to Google My Business and social media at the same time. Here are some of the features: Direct scheduling to Instagram from a computer - OneUp allows you to schedule and post directly to Instagram and Instagram Stories from a computer, no push notification necessary. Posting to multiple pages - For people who are posting to more than one social network at a time, OneUp makes it easy to post to FB Pages and Groups, LinkedIn profiles and pages, Twitter, Google My Business, Pinterest, and Instagram (including Stories) all at once.  Repeating post - OneUp gives you the option to repeat your posts automatically. This allows you to resurface old posts that otherwise would have never been seen again. Also for anyone that has a Facebook Group with daily themes that repeat every week (such as \"Make it happen Monday\"), OneUp makes it easy to entirely automate this.  RSS feed automation - If there are any blogs, publications, podcasts, or YouTube channels that put out good content consistently, you can add the RSS feed links in OneUp, then whenever new content is posted from those places, it is automatically shared to the pages you select.   Chrome Extension - Using the OneUp Chrome extension, you can easily schedule many images at once from any website, such as sunsets for example. You can choose which images from the website you want to post to social media, bulk update or individually update the descriptions and links for each post, then schedule them to be posted with a set interval (such as every 60 minutes), or choose custom dates and times for all of them.    Customizable UTM parameters - OneUp lets you customize UTM parameters so you can keep track of how your links are performing in Google Analytics.  Link Shortening - Connect your Bitly account and OneUp will automatically shorten any links and allow you to track clicks through Bitly.  ",
