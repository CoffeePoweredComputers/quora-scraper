            "answer_text": "Technology innovation differs greatly across technologies. For example, IT innovations diffuse much faster than biotech ones, and also likely have much shorter lifespans. So they need to be managed differently. In my opinion, what you learn from successful IT innovations may be somewhat useful in biotech. Understanding their differences may well be as important as their similarities. Recently, there's an emerging movement to open source genomics by borrowing from a well defined open source software development model. In a master's degree on technology innovation management, you are likely to be swarmed with case studies of success stories and occasional failures. To benefit from such cases, you should have a solid grounding and significant experience in at least one tech sector. This enables you to relate to the cases and make meaningful contributions to class discussion. The so-called theories of innovation that you may also be exposed to in the course are likely to be trend analysis, diffusion models, strategic market analysis, etc, and are likely to originate from top consulting firms like Mckinsey, BCG, and their ilk. It's good to learn a bunch of these tools if you plan to go into consulting later. A cautionary note here is that academics are unlikely to be very familiar with industry tools, preferring to teach using their self developed ones. Since the course is likely to be delivered through a business school, there will be several core management subjects and electives. I would recommend that you take these subjects seriously as well. You can't manage just using knowledge encapsulated in the case studies however well articulated. That's to say, if you plan to go into investment banking with a technology bias, you should also work hard on the financial and accounting subjects. If your aspiration is to go into research on innovation strategy or an academic career, such a course is a reasonable start. If the aim is to get into a top university for the sake of getting to know some smarts and subsequently joining a powerful alum network as a springboard to an entrepreneurial career, it is fine too.
