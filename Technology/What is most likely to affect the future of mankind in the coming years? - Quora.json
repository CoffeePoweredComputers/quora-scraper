            "answer_text": "The BIG ISSUE and one that is not even recognized properly yet even though it has been a growing problem in the last 50 or more years is that of toxicity in society. There is now a huge subculture of evil people in society, which judging from the damage they do, amounts to around 15 to 20% at present. This is a huge minority group and it is growing fast. If you consider that in Nazi Germany before Hitler became chancellor, there were only around 1% who were registered Nazis. After he was elected the number rose to 10% and I would say many of those were Nazis in name only, in order to get some gain for themselves. But even a 10% minority there can be enormous harm. However there is an added problem. In our times it is not simply the minority of a country or even a group of countries that we are talking about. Evil people are all networked and they are networked seamlessly across every border in the world. So the conflicts we see are false flags aimed to attract attention in some skewed direction while the real aims are about dismantling humane rights and freedoms regardless of country\u2019s system of government. There is a huge struggle for power, which is not fully appreciated by the bulk of the population. However this struggle for power is not only on the political and economic scene. It is also at the grass roots level. On this level the enslaving of the humane is done from within the family, socially and in the workplace. A person is threatened covertly so that they may unsuspectingly react adversely and suffer health issues. And here too there are false flags. We are bombarded with false information that disease is caused by physical causes and that the body is a machine. When I was at school cancer ran at 20%. Now it is around 50% and getting worse. Heart disease in women was unheard of. In fact we considered that heart disease was a man\u2019s disease. Now it is the number one killer of women. I can assure you that the sun is not shining any brighter and the food we eat is not much different and if anything better. There are less toxins in the environment. The reality is that the body is purpose driven and not a machine. Disease is a nocebo effect. There is both a massacre going on, on the one hand and a massive conditioning strategy on the other, while those that should be speaking up, the biomedical scientists and doctors are feathering their own nests and pampering to big pharma. However I am certain that while it will take a lot to raise awareness of the humane, this will happen. Things may get worse before they get better but the awakening will happen. ",

            "answer_text": "With the Industrial Revolution in 19th century, our capacity of production and fulfilling the demand increased drastically. And technology advancements happened faster than ever. Mass production of arsenals during WWII was an example of our production capacity. As the technological and scientific exploration increased at the pace never seen before, but our social, economical, political structures remained the same. This created a void, which is now being exploited by politicians, corporates etc which collectively can be called elite as this handful of population holds most of world's wealth. In our coming future, we will see a great increase in human workers being replaced by machines, due to full working hours, electricity cost whuch is lower than human labour wages, making people jobless. With such high rates of unemployment people will finally starting thinking about alternatives, and then either 1 of the 2 futures are possible. Either human race will turn more ignorant diving deeper into aimless consumption, finally coming to an end with destruction of environment, and destabilized race. Or, people will realize that a saner world of cooperation and abundance is possible and finally world will resume its long time stagnant evolution. With current trends, the latter one seems more feasible future as we have some people doing this great work of educating people and some of these efforts are The Zeitgeist Movement Global , The Venus Project , TROM .
