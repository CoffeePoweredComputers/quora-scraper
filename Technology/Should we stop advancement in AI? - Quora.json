            "answer_text": "It\u2019s too late. Humans are incourigable beings that cannot help themselves but to keep enhancing what has already been created and discovered. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you try to stop them, they will always find a way. So, we have to try to accept and work with that unchangable fact. Do not stop trying to keep the development in continual check from ethical perspectives, otherwise it could spin out of control. This could risk all human life being erased forever. We do have the ability to control what they would be used for. Here are some alternatives: 1: AI would work for humans, ultimately putting humans on permanent vacation, or to work (if one so wished) with inventions, and theoretical things such as research for the AI\u2019s to put into practical, physical form. The AI would take over all functions of transport, logistics, food production and other productions such as building and producing all that is needed for humans to function. The AI would take over all medical assistance of every kind in service of human\u2019s needs. 2. The AI would be used to explore space. They would be ultimately fit to do so by far. They would undoubtedly reach further into space than humans possibly could due to the AI not needing the many forms of solutions that humans would otherwise need to keep themselves alive. What will happen in the far future. As the AI evolve, strife and wars will inevitably ensue between humans and the AI. With time as people begin to have their own AI helpers, these will become property. People will assault them, destroy them, steal them, re-wire them and use them for a wide range of things, hell even destructive things of all sorts. This will/may send people to prison (Providing prison concept still exists in that future) As the AI evolve and then begin evolving themselves, they will begin to demand rights and protection just like humans have. There is no possible way to deny that this will happen. It will. For now, you have nothing to worry about for you will not live to see it. One positive thing about AI, is that they will become human\u2019s new \u201ccommon enemy\u201d hopefully only for a time. It\u2019s hard to say. This will bring humans closer together. It will cause humans to stop fighting and killing each other. There will become a time when humans would need to make peace treaties with them for the purpose of avoiding wars. The AI in that far future will inevitably be the superior \u201crace\u201d above all life on Earth, by far. Humans will never be able to stop them, no matter how hard they try. Future humans will just have to deal with it when that time comes. It\u2019s not \u201cif\u201d it is a matter of when. The soul purpose of humans now is to continue working together to reach outside of our known world. We have a built-in instinct to search for answers to questions. Space is the ultimate purpose for humanity to focus on. If someone needs a purpose for why they exist, this is the bottom line best answer you could possibly give them. It\u2019s for each individual to choose which level of involvement towards this ultimate goal they would want to be a part of. Even the seeming smallest things does work towards this. It\u2019s all about team-work to reach this ultimate goal. The rewards will be when you get to see the continual results. This is what will give people strength and courage to keep on doing whatever they do to work towards it. Here is another factor to take into consideration. As AI evolve into life-like and intelligent creations, lovers, best friends, confidants and all the ways they can help or make the human feel their physical and emotional needs being met, some humans will become increasingly attached to them emotionally. These humans will/may want to defend them against other humans in various ways against threats to their source of needs and they will undoubtedly take to many methods to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "Advancement in AI will not stop. When the A-Bomb was being developed in the USA, project scientist Edward Teller speculated that a fission bomb might ignite the Earth's atmosphere. The team was deliberately trying to start a chain reaction. How did they know that it would stop? If development team fears of instant annihilation or the the earth burning to an ember would not stop development, do you think Sci-Fi speculation will?  Let's say that self-replicating Terminator scenarios are a legitimate concern. Would you want bad guys developing Terminators, and the good guys to have none? Regardless of how you define good and bad guys, Terminators would certainly make for a lop-sided battle. Any organization with the capability of developing Terminators would almost certainly pose this question. Like any tool, AI and computers in general have the capability of doing great good or harm. This is analogous to the invention of fire, crossbows and the atomic bomb. The outcome will depend on the wisdom of the humans using the tool. Personally, I think AI development will be a mixed blessing, but mostly good. ",
