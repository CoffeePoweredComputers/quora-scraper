            "answer_text": "When I was a boy, I was often a student leader - school librarian, scout patrol leader, prefect, you name it, I was even the Deputy School Captain. Yet, I didn\u2019t have a terribly good rapport with my classmates, I was the quintessential unpopular senior prefect that everyone loved to hate. What I learnt then was integrity - one needs to have the courage to ram through what one believes to be right, regardless of how many people oppose you. I believe the same applies to teaching. You cannot be your pupils\u2019 friend. You are their teacher first and foremost and that means you are in a position that is senior to them. Your job is not only to impart knowledge but to instill values such as discipline, dedication and hard work into the hearts of your students. You prepare the students for the world of work by making them realize that in life, you cannot always enjoy what you do and sometimes you have to do things that are tedious, boring, stressful, unpleasant etc. Apart from a strict no-nonsense approach, I believe that a good teacher must be dedicated (you do whatever it takes to get the job done, there is no such thing as a day off and if you have to work till 3am to meet a deadline, you do it), caring (pastoral care is forming an increasingly large part of an EFL teacher\u2019s role these days), fair and always behave in a professional manner (dress appropriately for class - no Bermuda shorts, t-shirts or sandals), be well-prepared for class, always be punctual and never turn up reeking of booze or half-asleep. You can hear a pin drop in my class. Some students fear me but everyone respects me. Having said all that, a good teacher should also try to make their classes as fun as they are educational though I very much dislike the term \u201cedutainer\u201d. Use a variety of class activities by all means - games, debates, discussions, projects, movies, student presentations etc. But whatever you do, always make sure that the students are clear that their purpose is to learn, not to be entertained. What the \u2018edutainer\u2019 camp doesn\u2019t realize is that students know and respect a professional teacher when they see one. I have seen edutainers lose control of their classes. I have had students who used to hate me say that they appreciate my approach once they graduate and become teachers themselves. I have had numerous former students come to me for advice, long after I stopped teaching them. My students trust me with secrets that they can\u2019t talk to their parents or partners about. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I've already posted several times about being a teacher in general, so I'll make this English-specific. An English teacher cannot just be in the business of education; an English teacher is in the business of edutainment. English is an odd subject in that we wind up picking up lots of duties outside of teaching English. We teach study skills, computer literacy, etc. We also wind up teaching a very broad subject. We teach reading fiction, nonfiction, writing several different kinds of papers, creative writing, research, citation, plus all of the kinds of literature, and grammar.  First, you're going to have to master that. You should preferably have mastered all of those items first, but you have to be at least amazingly competent at them before you step through the door on day one. Second, become a good storyteller. Coming into this job, you have to remember that the deck is stacked against you. You have to be really good at selling English. It isn't easy. My typical conversation with strangers starts like this:\"What do you do?\"\"I'm a high school teacher.\"\"Oh! What do you teach?\"\"English.\"\"English was my worst subject!\"Students who aren't good at English don't like English. Students who are good at English still likely aren't big fans. The best in this business tell stories. Lots of them. When I explain to students that we no longer use pencils in English, I tell them about my professor who ridiculed me in front of 75 other students because I'd turned in a quiz in pencil. When I explain to them about why we need to write in properly constructed English, I show them an online post I ran across once about song lyrics which was so embarrassingly, badly written that I've rarely run across a worse example of writing. Students love a good story. Third, have an overall plan. I teach seniors at present. I construct my year so that there is an overall plan and buildup. We talk about the development of the English language from Old English up through the 1800s. We talk about a variety of genres. We learn a variety of writing styles. I know exactly what skills and content my students need before we hit the end of the year.  Hamlet is sort of the big show. I'll get to it around February and spend around two months in it. We'll use it to practice skills relating to reading, studying, writing, speaking, etc. Before I get to the first act, I need my students to be able to research college-level material. I need them to know what a ballad is. I need them to understand Renaissance science and history. I need them to know some of the Iliad. I need them to understand psychology, tragedy, poetry, and a whole lot more. One last thing I would suggest is that you get a master's degree in English. It seriously does help you understand what you're doing. ",
