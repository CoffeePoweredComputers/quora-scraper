            "answer_text": "In my honest opinion, the news is full of advertisements about how much advantage there is by getting the latest communication devices, and I take all this as hype and do not let it persuade me to buy. I for one, am purposely one full generation behind in buying these well advertised things like digital TVs, smart phones, smart watches, because I am not convinced of it\u2019s immediate benefits TO ME. Rather, I prefer to believe all these new items are being pushed onto curious users as a way to recover manufacturing costs quickly. Prices will come down about a year or so after, for the same unit. For example, four years ago in HK, a good tech market, Digital HDTVs were pushed at prices more than three times of normal Analog TVs. Today they are almost giving it away to seniors because these older locals who cannot afford it are still holding onto their Analog TVs. Low earners to get subsidies for digital TV sets when analogue ends in 2020 Same with Cellphones. HK is the best Test Market for electronic goods, and if a newly produced communication device in 5G works here, with the congestion, the mountainous terrain, the busy airwaves, the thousands of multiband cell towers, the millions of users in a pencil.point on the map of the World, it would work anywhere. The only overseas concern is the suspicion by the FBI and CIA that China made 5G devices from the Huawei factory, and funded by the Chinese Government, has an unconfirmed and suspicious unidentified secret chip in its circuit that tracks its users and could spy on any user's text or voice communications, which is not impossible with the technology of today. Huawei ban: Full timeline on how and why its phones are under fire Whatever the implications, I do not buy into new technology right away, preferring to wait it out, till prices drop, possibly until 6G comes to light, unless I absolutely need it so badly. Why 5G phones are so expensive -- and what has to change ",

            "answer_text": "5G is a set of internationally accepted standards. Phones are just now coming out that support those standards, and the cellular networks themselves are also just starting to support them. The standards and the overall design are stable, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of construction of the networks. If you buy a 5G phone now that your carrier supports, chances are good that it will work now and when as the carrier continues to build their network. It will also likely work on other carrier networks that you might roam on, once the networks support 5G roaming (this is a year or two off, at least). And all 5G phones support today\u2019s LTE networks. If your carrier doesn\u2019t yet support 5G, you need to wait. That\u2019s because they probably are still working with the phone manufacturers on the details of programming them for their specific network. Even within the standards, there are many details to work out in the programming. ",
