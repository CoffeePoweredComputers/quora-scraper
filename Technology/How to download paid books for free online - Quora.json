            "answer_text": "Downloading paid books for free is cheating the author out of their paycheck. If you have a job, you know how much you wait for your salary. An author also waits for payday. Don't cheat someone out of an honest living. Buy the book. If you buy toothpaste, food and other items necessary for daily life, then buy the book too. Nothing useful is available for free and nothing should be taken for free. Also book piracy is a crime. Don't propagate the criminal tendencies in yourself. All the best! ",
