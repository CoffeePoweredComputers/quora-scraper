            "answer_text": "Scientific discoveries and technologies they inspire can be additive, or symbiotic. As an example - electricity. First, it was a scientific curiosity, then a novel thing to do at home. Then scientists (Hertz, Columb, and others) found out that electricity could be transmitted over a distance. this lead people such as Marconi to make a radio transmitter that could span the Atlantic Ocean. Along the way, vacuum tubes were invented. This allowed the radio waves to be amplified, and audio to modulate the radio signal. This allowed for things like radio and television broadcasts to be made available to the general public. And we figured out how to make solid-state devices (transistors, and diodes) that made items smaller and use less energy. So smaller desktop computers came about, which helped in making better electronics to the point where we are today. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about it like this: even a century ago you most likely had no electricity at home. So let\u2019s do math\u2026 wait for the Sun to come up. You also need paper\u2026 or a stick and the dust. But then an infection gets to you and since no antibiotics, you die. No invention, no progress. And all that\u2019s left is a stick you used to draw circles in the dust and some thingies resembling paper but with washed out writing done with pieces of coal or tin or lead, cause no ballpoint pens were introduced yet. It\u2019s easy today, when we don\u2019t have to invent all the tools to invent something useful. We have the internet to exchange ideas. A tad more efficient than a telegram stop. New discovery stop. Iceberg stop. Sos. ",
