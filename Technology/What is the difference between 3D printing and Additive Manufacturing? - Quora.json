            "answer_text": "Between the terms 3D printing and additive manufacturing, there is no difference. It is the equivalent of one saying automobile and car. 3D printing and additive manufacturing are synonyms for the same process. Both terms reference the process of building parts by joining material layer by layer from a CAD file. This is as opposed to a traditional manufacturing process, like CNC Machining , where a part is built by subtracting material from a block of material. 3D printing and additive manufacturing can be used regardless if the parts are fabricated in plastic, metal, or rubber. Based off our general perception, it seems as though people who work in an industrial or manufacturing setting prefer additive manufacturing since it sounds more formal. In comparison, the media and hobbyists prefer the term 3D printing. The term 3D printing has been used more ever since inexpensive desktop printers became more popular. People in the industry generally prefer additive manufacturing while the general public generally prefers 3D Printing. Defining a difference between the two is like splitting filament. The technology has made great advancements since its inception, and it will be exciting to see how it advances. The simple answer is that at a technological level, very little \u2013 the differentiation is bound up in both the application of the individual process and machine and the end result. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer, nothing. Long answer regarding the history of terms. When SLA and SLA first began being marketed and sold, they were to major corporations to replace prototyping. Thus the term rapid prototyping came to be. This was the predominant name for all printing tech for some time. That is because for the first 10 to 15 years, it was really only good for prototyping. As things advanced, the paradigm began to change. Small scale manufacturing using the technologies, including the metal sintering tech gave way to the concept of additive manufacturing. Which really means \u201cgrowing\u201d your part vs the traditional removal of material via some type of machining operation. The professional world slowly adopted \u201cadditive Manufacturing\u201d Next we come to the expiration of the FDM process. Since FDM is the most \u201cconsumer\u201d friendly tech, the maker movement started to take hold with the very first machines, and these adopted the term 3D printer. It is still an additive manufacturing process, but what was once a point of entry that cost more than 99% of the cars available, it wasn\u2019t consumer friendly. The maker movement brought additive manufacturing to the home workshop and office. Today 3D printing is what most of the population know of. Additive manufacturing is what you hear if you work with these technologies on a professional level. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s all the same thing. ",

ITEC blog: People in the industry generally prefer additive manufacturing while the general public generally prefers 3D printing. Defining a difference between the two is like splitting a filament. Joris Peels at Luxexcel blog: Because the term 3D printing appeals to journalists it is used incorrectly to describe any and all 3D printing technologies as well as the industry as a whole. The correct term is actually additive manufacturing as defined by the ASTM 42 subcommittee on Additive Manufacturing. The Technology House blog: There is no difference between the terms 3D printing and additive manufacturing. But people who working in an industrial or manufacturing setting prefer additive manufacturing while the media and hobbyists prefer 3D printing.
