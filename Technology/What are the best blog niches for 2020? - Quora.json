            "answer_text": "We want to demonstrate that choosing a niche doesn\u2019t mean reinventing the wheel. 1. Languages Did you know that English is only the first language of 21% of the world\u2019s population? In fact, by 2050 the United States will have more people speaking Spanish as their first language than English. Canadian schools now teach Chinese as a subject because of China\u2019s growing economic power. People like to learn new languages. But, over the next few decades many of us will have to learn a second language besides English. The world is changing. Maybe we\u2019ll all eventually speak a language like Cityspeak from the movie Blade Runner? That would be confusing\u2026but kinda cool. That means a ready market exists for language tuition software, online language coaching services, and everything else related to learning a new language. 2. Pets Here\u2019s a market that\u2019s not going away anytime soon, and has massive potential for all kinds of niche businesses. Companion animals are very much a part of Western life, and are becoming so in other parts of the world. We\u2019ve already looked at a bunch of pet affiliate programs here. No sense in waiting to start profiting from this market. There\u2019s a generation of people not having kids and raising pets instead. They refer to them as \u201cfur babies.\u201d Note: The author of this piece has to admit he treats his dog like a child. Her name is Butters, and she\u2019s amazing. You could start a niche website about a specific breed of cat. Another option could be a YouTube channel reviewing dog chew toys. Or you could start an authority site about caring for exotic birds. You could also go offline with your niche business by starting a pet sitting service. Pet owners in some cities are willing to pay up to $100 per day for reliable pet sitters. Pet owners are fanatical about giving their companion animals the best of everything, from food to toys to health treatments. Why not tap into that? Market value: $66.75 billion per year 3. Prepping If you listened to the news you\u2019d have to at least suspect that the world is getting worse by the day. (That\u2019s good enough reason to not listen to mainstream news.) But even if there\u2019s isn\u2019t a zombie apocalypse, there\u2019s no denying that it makes sense to be prepared to take care of your family. Our planet\u2019s weather patterns do seem to be changing, for example. So, why would you not prepare for situations where extreme cold or a violent storm might pose a risk? You could choose to start a full-blown ecommerce or FBA business drop-shipping prepper supplies. If you aren\u2019t sure what those supplies would be, you can figure out some low hanging fruit with Jungle Scout or Helium10. Or you could start an affiliate marketing niche site about prepping for complete newbies. The neat thing about this niche market is that it expands beyond just buying freeze dried meals and shotgun ammunition. It also includes topics such as gunsmithing, blacksmithing, knife making, food preservation, etc. 4. Relationships & Dating Until there\u2019s some massive evolutionary jump where we become an asexual species, relationships are going to matter for a long time to come. And what\u2019s the biggest problem most people have with relationships? Finding somebody to fall in love with. It\u2019s kinda funny looking back at how far online dating has come. There was a time when anyone using online dating was the butt of jokes. Now, it\u2019s an accepted part of the dating scene. Recent studies show that up to 50 million Americans have tried online dating at some point. Now that\u2019s a big market. You can engage with this niche market in a number of ways. You could write a Kindle book on dating for people over 40 (or find another niche with low hanging fruit), self-publish it on the Amazon platform, and make over $100 per day. Or maybe you could put together a digital product on the best way to break up with somebody. Everyone else is trying to get their ex back, so why not take a different approach? Being in a relationship is one of the biggest commitments people make during their lifetime. That makes them more than willing to pay for solutions to their relationship issues. This is an area where there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to publish books, and it\u2019s never been easier than it is now to publish income generating books on Amazon Kindle. These books can generate more than $100 per day. 5. Personal Finance The financial meltdown of 2008 taught a lot of us some very harsh lessons about how quickly you can go from boom to broke. What it made most people wake up to is the fact that diversifying your incoming and planning for your future is smart. You can\u2019t rely on the government to take care of you. Especially not when most countries in the developed world are effectively bankrupt. This niche has tons of opportunities for different products or services, but all with the goal of either increasing a person\u2019s income, or helping them get back in control of their outgoings. Some people like Jeff Proctor are making over $100,000 per month in this niche through SEO traffic and smart keyword targeting. Niche businesses that could work really well in this market include informational sites about budgeting. Another sub-niche is how to live without cable TV. Or you could come up with ideas for family meals that cost less than $10 each. A financial advice coaching service is another option. Selling high-end digital products in this market might prove to be a challenge though. Remember, people are usually more interested in learning how to save money. If, however, your niche business is about generating more income, then selling digital products shouldn\u2019t be a problem. If you get into the personal finance niche, you\u2019ll have to do some serious keyword research. A few years ago I made a tool that makes it easy to do keyword research. It\u2019s called Long Tail Pro (read our Long Tail Pro review here). 6. Home Security Nobody likes the idea of having to turn their family home into a \u201cFortress of Solitude\u201d, but crime isn\u2019t going away any time soon. Even the most liberal families are being forced to look at just how secure their home is. In short, home security is a growing market and has lots of sub-niches within it. You could start a niche site focused purely on home defense weapons of the non-lethal variety. Home monitoring software and hardware is also growing in popularity, including video doorbells, Wi-Fi security camera systems and PIR lighting systems. A sub-niche could be offering solutions to deter \u201cporch pirates\u201d from stealing packages from outside homes. You could also create a series of digital information products for this market, or a YouTube channel reviewing home security gadgets and appliances. Another approach could be to start an affiliate marketing site on making your home burglar proof. Market value: US$51 billion per year 7. Babies There were 900 million people alive in 1800. By 1900 that figure increased to 1.65 billion. By 1980 that had increased to 4.4 billion people. And in the last 40 years the population of our planet has almost doubled to 7.6 billion people. That\u2019s a whole lot of babies born every single day. 386,000 of them. Unless we wind up in some kind of dystopian nightmare, like in the movie \u201cChildren of Men\u201d, the market for baby-related products is getting bigger every day. Not only that, but parents are \u201craving fan\u201d spenders. New parents spend an average of $4,000 per year to care for, clothe and feed their baby. Sub-niches within this market include Amazon affiliate marketing sites, how to organize baby showers, and sites dedicated to baby names. You could create a blog dedicated to first-time parents who are in their late 30s. Or a blog about the adoption process in different countries. Even Spencer has dipped into this niche when he bought a mom blog. So yeah, the opportunities within this niche are pretty much unlimited. People in this market are willing to pay almost anything to ensure their families get the best possible start in life. Market value: US$18 billion per year 8. Weight Loss America is in the middle of an obesity epidemic. It\u2019s not the only country in the world with that problem though \u2013 the UK and Germany are following close behind. There is a massive market for helping people lose all those extra pounds, and then keeping them off. Sub-niches you could take part in include ideas like a personal trainer YouTube channel aimed at young adults. Or you could run a niche site, or offline business, offering customized meal plans. Or maybe a digital product on weight loss for busy people. As we discussed earlier in this article, you need only take a look at the shopping channels to see just how much money is spent in the weight loss market. Yes, it is very competitive. Yes, you can compete with Time, Innovation and Effort. While there may be some ethical boundaries with certain types of content promotion, you can still make some good revenue from programs like the Amazon Affiliate program, or even with display ads. For those going the display add route, you can make a killing. Spencer has had the best luck with Mediavine, but it has a high visitor requirement (25k per month) before you can join. We recommend Adsense and Ezoic for beginners. Ezoic in particular is great for any site that runs ads. They use AI to text the optimum placement of ads on your site and maximize your earnings. Spencer uses Ezoic on Niche Site project 4 and they are doing well. We have a review coming out soon. Until then, you can sign up for free. Sign up for Ezoic and boost your earnings Market value: US$66 billion per year 9. Learning a Musical Instrument Now, this niche isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s because musicians are a different breed. They can spot a non-musician marketer a million miles away, so you\u2019ve been warned. With that warning aside, learning to play a musical instrument is something most people aspire to. And it\u2019s not just for beginners. There\u2019s just as big a market for improving musicians who want to take their skills to the next level. One of the most popular approaches in this market is to create a membership site ( we\u2019ve reviewed Membermouse here, but we also like Clickfunnels) featuring lessons on a specific instrument. You could also start a YouTube channel teaching people how to play covers of popular or classic rock songs, monetizing your channel as your income source. Or, you could sell digital products on the ideal effects pedal setup for the new guitarist or bass player. If you like the idea of a membership site, Clickfunnels help you do the whole thing. You can make the landing page, use their shopping cart software to save you from big fees, offer upsells, and host the membership area. 10. Electronic Entertainment It\u2019s worth taking a few seconds to look at how many electronic \u201cgadgets\u201d you own. You have a smart phone, a tablet and maybe an eReader like the Kindle or Kobo. You probably also have a Netflix, Hulu and Spotify account. Basically, electronic gadgets and entertainment devices are part of your life. They\u2019re part of everyone\u2019s life, including people in the developing world. In fact, the developing world is going to be one of the biggest markets for electronic gadgets and entertainment services over the next decade. Making money in this market means looking closely at focused sub-niches. One example would be a YouTube channel about video streaming services and media players they connect to. Or a digital product on how to make money with game streaming platforms like Twitch. You could also build a niche website dedicated to setting up your own media streaming servers at home, and reviews of all the required equipment such as Network Attached Storage devices. ",
