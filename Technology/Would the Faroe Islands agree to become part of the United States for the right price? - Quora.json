            "answer_text": "Would the Faroe Islands agree to become part of the United States for the right price? Sure. The right price might not be worth it for the US, but almost everything has a price. The US would need to satisfy 2 parties. Denmark and the people living on the Faroe Islands. The Faroe Islands have a GDP of about 3 billion dollars. If the US wanted to purchase them from Denmark they could probably get them away from Denmark for 100 times that, ~$300 billion dollars(the entire yearly GDP of Denmark) and conditions that the Faroe Islands people be in agreements. There are 50,000 people on the Faroe Islands. Offer them each $100k and you probably have 50% of the vote to join the US as a incorporated, self governing territory. Offer them $1 million and you certainly have it. So maybe $305\u2013350 billion dollars. Through in 50 billion to pay for advertising and the US could probably purchase the territory for $400 billion. What would be the point of that though? It certainly isn\u2019t in the US Citizen\u2019s interest to pay $400 billion to acquire a small cold island in the North Atlantic. ",

            "answer_text": "I mean, maybe? I guess it depends on that price. First, the Faroans would have to establish their independence from Denmark. I haven\u2019t read the Danish constitution, but I am reasonably certain that the idea of Denmark selling the Islands would be legally challenging. Independence, on the other hand, wouldn\u2019t be that challenging. Denmark has even suggested that the Islands may need to consider do so soon. So most likely, you would need another referendum of the citizens to declare independence and their parliament to listen this time. Last I saw, independence was popular with around 50% of the people there, so if the US wanted to spend a lot of money, they could probably convince the majority to declare independence. Then they\u2019d have to spend even more money to get them to agree to becoming a protectorate of the United States. I have no scientific reason to pick this number, but I\u2019d guess that between independence and protectorate actions, the US would have to spend $50,000 to $100,000 per citizen. That would be roughly $2.5 Billion to $5 billion. I find it difficult to believe that the US could not obtain a majority with that kind of money. But they could spend $10 Billion or more, if they were so inclined. Aside from its military value in the event of an all out conventional war with Russia, it\u2019s hard to imagine why the US would spend that kind of money. And in that event, it would be less expensive to agree to a leasing deal. ",
