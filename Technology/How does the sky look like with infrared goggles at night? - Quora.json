            "answer_text": "It depends. If it\u2019s clear and cloudless, it looks grey. I don\u2019t think I have a photo of that. My camera does not have the resolution to resolve stars, and besides, the atmosphere is not transparent to thermal infra-red - what I think I see is a uniform brightness level from the upper atmosphere. I have a relatively cheap camera that does not have manual control of the gain (what in a normal camera would be the iris); it has auto-gain. What I can do is to freeze the current gain setting - point the camera at my foot on auto, freeze that, then look at the sky. I can\u2019t just point it at the sky then adjust a knob to get a good picture. Which is a long-winded way of explaining why I don\u2019t have a lot of these pictures to choose from, and if I did have a picture of a uniform brightness sky, it\u2019s hard to tell apart from one with the lens shutter closed. The camera actually records a 320x240 pixel monochrome image of 10um infrared intensity with an image depth of about 12 bits. That is normally mapped onto a \u201chot iron\u201d false-colour JPEG with a depth of 8 bits - it\u2019s what people expect, and it looks cool, and it makes it easier to see heat losses. Cold things are black or blue, warm things are dull red through red, very hot things are yellow or white. The colours from heating iron in a forge, with the blue added in at the cold end. My camera has several false-colour palettes to choose from, including greyscale, but hot iron is the most common. Mapping is done in the camera, before it saves the JPEG. With more expensive cameras, you can save a raw image and post-process it. So the images you see like the one below are not \u201creal\u201d - they have been processed into something we can interpret. If it\u2019s cloudy, you can see clouds - they are at a different temperature from the open sky. Where with the naked eye everything looks black, with the camera it looks more interesting.
