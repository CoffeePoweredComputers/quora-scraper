            "answer_text": "Even though most cities in Europe are renowned for their ancient architecture, there are a few cities in Europe which do have a futuristic appearance, where modern sksycrapers rise upwards towards the skies amidst centuries-old structures. The Cuatro Torres Business Area in the city of Madrid, Spain houses some of the tallest skyscrapers in the entire country, the tallest of which is the Torre de Cristal.  London is home to a few notable skyscrapers, particularly in the City of London district, like the Gherkin, or the Shard, which used to be the tallest skyscraper in Europe until the construction of the Federation Tower in Moscow. New skyscrapers are currently being built which will change the skyline of London.  Renowned for being one of the world\u2019s fashion capitals and for being one of the most beautiful cities in Italy, Milan boasts a skyline which is home to many skyscrapers, including these two buildings, which are a pair of residential towers known as the Bosco Verticale.  France\u2019s La D\u00e9fense is the largest business district in Europe. Several of France\u2019s tallest skyscrapers are located here, as well as the Grande Arche, or La Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense, a monument that was constructed to celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.  The Park of Nations in Lisbon, Portugal represents a side of the city not too many people are aware of. It houses some of the highest skyscrapers in Portugal, one of the best indoor aquariums in the world, and one of the longest bridges in Europe, with a span of 17,2 kilometers (7.6 miles)  Some of the Russian Federation\u2019s tallest skyscrapers are located in the Moscow International Business Center, including the aforementioned Federation Tower, which used to be the tallest skyscraper in all of Europe until the construction of the Lakhta Center in Saint Petersburg.  Devastated after the Second World War, the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands was eventually rebuilt, and it is now one of the most modern cities in Europe, home to the largest port in Europe, the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world, the Netherland\u2019s tallest skyscrapers, and a set of bizarre, cubic houses.  Even though Oslo, Norway may have a reputation for being a rather boring city, the city\u2019s architecture is quite astonishing.  The city of Vienna in Austria is mostly known for its imposing Baroque architecture but it is also home to a few modern buildings, including a number of quirky structures designed by Austrian architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser.  However, I will admit, I still prefer the ancient architecture present in Europe\u2019s cities. ",

            "answer_text": "By futuristic appearance, I\u2019m assuming CBD areas in European cities which are filled with tall glass skyscrapers. Most European cities don\u2019t have densely pact skyscrapers like in Seoul, Dehli, Tokyo, New York, or Shanghai. But still, the European cities with those impressive skyscrapers are truly amazing and beautiful. For example: City of London, England Truly spectacular. The City of London is a historic financial district, home to both the Stock Exchange and the Bank of England.  La D\u00e9fense business district in Paris, France La D\u00e9fense is Europe's largest business district with 560 hectares of area.  Moscow, Russia One of the largest city in Europe and also possesses one of Europe\u2019s tallest skyscrapers known as the \u201cFederation Tower.\u201d  Warsaw, Poland Both historical and current capital of Poland as well as Poland\u2019s largest city. Its widely varied architecture reflects the city's long, turbulent history, from Gothic churches and neoclassical palaces to Soviet-era blocks and modern skyscrapers.  Frankfurt, Germany A very old German city dating back hundreds of years ago to the Holy Roman Empire. It possesses both historical architectures as well as modern and magnificent buildings.  Milan, Italy A metropolis in Italy's northern Lombardy region. Milan is the global capital for fashion and design and its financial hub is known for its high-end restaurants and shops.  These are some of the things we don\u2019t hear much about Europe on the news. Europe is truly vast and spectacular! ",
