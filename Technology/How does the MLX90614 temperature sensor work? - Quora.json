            "answer_text": "MLX90614 is an infrared temp sensor that measures the infrared radiation \u2013 a type of electromagnetic radiation below the visible spectrum of light - emitted by an object. The most basic design of infrared thermo-sensor consists of a lens to focus the infrared thermal radiation onto a detector, which converts the radiant energy into an electric signal. This configuration facilitates temperature measurement from a distance, without the need for contact with the object to be measured. MLX90614 is used where thermocouples or other probe type sensors cannot be used. ",

            "answer_text": "Infrared thermometers employ a lens to focus infrared light from an object onto a detector known as a thermopile. ... The thermopile gets hotter as it absorbs more and more infrared energy. The excess heat is converted into electricity, which is transmitted to a detector which determines the temperature of the object. ",
