            "answer_text": "best guess is that there will be more virtual viewings. less contact with agents and actual house visits. More people will desire to be out of condos and apartments, and densely populated habitats. Parks, schools and the like will be less popular and eateries as well. Not my business so this is only a guess. Home builders will see an increase in activity. Less on the multi family front and office space as more people work from home. commercial property will suffer as restaurants, malls, shops etc suffer. How long this lasts and how deep this goes will depend upon vaccines and cures. I could end up as a hermit for the final years of my life. ",
