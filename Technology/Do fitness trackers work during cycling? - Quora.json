            "answer_text": "Yes , they absolutely work. And my favorite is Endomondo. They track your workout through GPS Technology . Most phones have that. You don't require an internet connection or even a sim for that matter. While you\u2019re exercising, Endomondo will give you updates on how well you\u2019re doing. Every kilometre (or mile) you will get an audio update to let you know you\u2019ve hit that milestone. If you set a distance goal, you will be notified of how close you are to reaching your goal as you progress. You\u2019ll also get audio pep talks from your friends shortly after they send the text message to you. So, if you notice someone you know heading out on a run it\u2019s good fun to cheer them along. If you have a supported heart rate monitor or ANT+ bike speed monitor, you can automatically keep track of your heart rate or speed for each workout also. See store.endomondo.com to find out which monitors are supported. At any time you can look over your previous workouts and analyse your speed for each kilometre (or mile). You can also see your friend\u2019s times and race against them on the same route later. fitness should be fun and that social interaction is the key to achieving this. Whether it is a real-time pep talk from your significant other, an inspiring comment from your best friend or colleague, or likes from other friends in your social circle, the positive reinforcement will help you go that extra mile. That\u2019s why the app is designed to make it easy for you to connect with your friends, and I recommend that you invite at least a couple of your close friends to try it out. Go on, free your endorphins! ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer, as many have already stated, is yes. If you have a relatively capable wearable device, then it should be able to track calories, heart rate and\u2014if GPS enabled\u2014distance travelled. If I can go on a brief tangent, I\u2019ve actually found tracking health data over different activities to be a fascinating capability for wearables. Understanding how our bodies are physically reacting to different activities, and seeing how we react different over time, is an extremely effective way to fine tune your exercises. One of my favorite advancements in wearable technology as of recent is activity classifications. For example, wearables that use two devices, like a wristband and shoe-clip, are able to measure twice as much data and, through machine learning, can understand and recognize a user\u2019s different activities. Obviously, the more data wearables are able to collect, the more accurate and functional they\u2019ll become. Adding a second and third and fourth will not only measure more data, but can understand how the different motion tracking data are correlated with different activities. This is far more than you asked for in your question, so I apologize\u2014but it\u2019s so interesting! Reach out if you have any other questions! ",

Wrist-mounted HRMs don't always work well for tracking calories, but depending on the implementation, it could do a decent job. It certainly won't tell you how far you went on the bike whatsoever! Note that lower end Garmin units like the Garmin vivosmart can track distance covered without a GPS, but only with a speed sensor attached to the bike that's properly calibrated (i.e., you input the circumference of the wheel). But the Xiaomi Mi Band won't accept that either, though some smart phones will. ",
