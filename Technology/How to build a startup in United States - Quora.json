            "answer_text": "I have read quite extensively about it and talked to a lot of people regarding the matter. If your country if origin has any kind of program to do that, I would definitively go that way. In Mexico there is an organization called TechBA to do just that, where you will have many resources to help you get started. I know Chile has something like that and Colombia as well. The second tip would be, find an Incubator and use their resources, you will find plenty of people willing to help, with a lot of experience and usually going trough the same issues you are going. The last tip would be, don't be cheap and find some REALLY good advisors in incorporating and taxes it will be well worth it. Finally, make sure you really need to incorporate in the USA, sometimes you can start just fine in your country and then move on or start a subsidiary. Best of luck!! ",
