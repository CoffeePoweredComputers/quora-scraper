            "answer_text": "it is important to understand how a computer works. People unfamiliar with computers sometimes find it helpful to think of them as fairly goodsized, complicated things. Computers range in size from as small as a hotel ice bucket to as large as an entertainment complex like New Jersey's Meadowlands, including the parking lot. Inside, a computer will have a short red wire hooked to a terminal at one end and to another terminal at the other end. Then there will be a blue wire also hooked to terminals at either end, and then a green wire, and then a yellow wire, and then an orange wire, then a pink wire, and so on. -The Killion, The New Yorker September 6, 1982 But seriously, a very good way to learn this sort of thing is to read some of the papers about early machines. I recommend IAS machine - Wikipedia and in particular http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/vonneumann-firstdraftedvac.pdf which is the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC by John von Neumann himself.
