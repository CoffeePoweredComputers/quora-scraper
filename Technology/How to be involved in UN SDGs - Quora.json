            "answer_text": "As a member of our global human family, you are already involved in the SDGs. Many of the choices you make every day have a positive or negative SDG impact. For example, when you choose to use a metal or glass cup, rather than a disposable plastic one, you are being responsible in consumption (SDG 12), and less plastic goes into our water sources leading to clean water (SDG 6) thereby supporting life below water (SDG 14), and advancing the availability of food towards the push towards zero hunger (SDG 2) and so on. All the SDGs are connected in one way or another, and achieving the goals start with you making conscious decisions. For some ideas on what you can do every day to advance the SDGs, take a look at this resource: Lazy Person's Guide to Saving the World - Take Action to Achieve the SDGs! Remember, we are all partners (SDG 17) in this planet earth, our common home. ",
