            "answer_text": "Just my opinion, mind you\u2026. Let\u2019s start with the \u201cInternet of things\u201d (IoT). The internet and network connections will be ever more pervasive. Today we see high end vacuums and kitchen appliances with internet access These are pretty much \u201ctoys\u201d. Imagine things far more significant: health monitors embedded in your body that report problems AND dispense medications as needed, self-driving self-maintaining automobiles IF automobiles are even needed when most of population works from home; the entire knowledge of the human race available anywhere. I have little doubt that the trend to monitor human activity will continue to the point that everyone\u2019s movements will be tracked 24x7. This is too useful for solving - and therefore preventing - crime for it not to be extended. It will provide safety and security benefits that people are willing to give up their privacy to get. We already monitor everyone\u2019s communications. Everyone on the planet will be an entry in a database and tracked from birth to death. No energy crisis. For several reasons, mankind\u2019s need for energy will actually decrease. Devices will be more efficient and use less. But also, high-consumption items like automobiles will be used less as people work from home, shop from home, learn from home, and entertain themselves at home. Meanwhile, new energy sources will provide all the power needed and then some. IT jobs will decline as major [cloud service] providers host apps that service the world from a few giant data centers. Fewer programmers, operators, administrators will be needed because 1 can do the job now done by 1000. IT will become a creative medium. The big money will go to people who are successful at implementing new concepts in IT applications. IT technology will provide on-the-spot education for everyone to do everything. \u201cLearning\u201d will no longer involve acquiring knowledge, but will focus on how to use it. Skills and talents will be important, but not memory, because all data will be at your fingertips. \u201cSiri\u201d will be super-sized. ",

While the jury is still out on whether advancements in technology are accelerating, there is little doubt that new and exciting innovations will soon become commonplace where they were once the stuff of science and speculative fiction.
