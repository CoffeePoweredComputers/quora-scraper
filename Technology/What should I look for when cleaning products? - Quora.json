            "answer_text": "The people who stock and sell janitorial equipment and cleaners usually have salesmen experts that can guide you into the appropriate chemicals and how to use them properly if you intend to do this as a business or to order for your facility. They can also probably do the training or show you the training videos on proper facility cleaning. For just your home cleaning, you need some type of abrasive powder or paste cleaner for hard unpolished surfaces, a disinfectant for bathroom, and a detergent for counters. You need a furniture polish suitable for your furniture or a furniture oil and one for stainless steel, if you have those type of appliances. For carpets you need a vacuum with carpet brush if it is a wall-to-wall carpet. It should be deep cleaned every so often with a carpet cleaner in non rainy seasons so that it may dry properly. Even then, adding disinfectant to the rinse water after cleaning the rug will keep it from developing bad smells from the growth of mold as it dries. If you have a throw rug, consult the tag for cleaning instructions so as not to ruin it. Try to stay away from acidic cleaners for glass surfaces and toilet bowls because it will ruin the glossy finish and cause you to clean more often. There are cleaners to remove rust stains from porcelain surfaces, like toilet bowls. You need a toilet brush, a hand brush, a rough and a mild scouring pad made of synthetic plastic and a sponge. You need a fresh water pail of at least 2 gallons or 4 l. You need a good broom of a mixture of coarse and fine bristles, or a synthetic one. You need a cotton mop sewn with a band of cloth across the fibers about a third of the way from the end so the whole thing doesn\u2019t become loose strands tangled in the mop water. You need a mop bucket with ringer so you can control the amount of water applied to the surface. ",
