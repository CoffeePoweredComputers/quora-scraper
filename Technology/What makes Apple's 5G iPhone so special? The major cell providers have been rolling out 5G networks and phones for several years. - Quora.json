            "answer_text": "Ok, some Android phones have 5G for a year, not several. I\u2019ll give that to you as an honest mistake because 2020 definitely feels like it has been going on for years now. In theory Apple\u2019s 5G chip is much nicer, we will see. As a practical matter though the Android 5G phones so far have been fairly low volume. The iPhone is a very high volume device. By the end of the first day of sales I bet 10x as many 5G iPhones will be out there as Android phones (Android outsells iPhone by a fair margin, but the iPhone outsells any particular Android phone by a huge margin). So as a practical matter this is 5G\u2019s first wide scale consumer deployment. Apple is also doing some interesting things with 5G auto switching, but that is more of a battery preserving truck then anything else (and if Apple\u2019s 5G actually isn\u2019t better then the 2019 and other 2020 5G chips it is also a thermal issue, as in preventing your expensive phone from melting/catching on fire). I don\u2019t really think it is that special though, I think other phones coming out late this year/next year will have better 5G chips then the ones that came out last year. It is just how technology goes. The earliest versions tend to just barely work, later the ones you might actually want show up. First to market is frequently vastly overrated. You want the first good solution to market, which is frequently the sweet spot Apple hits, but obviously not always (and others can play that game). ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What makes Apple's 5G iPhone so special? The major cell providers have been rolling out 5G networks and phones for several years. A: That is not correct. There have only been two Android phones that had 5G capability last year, so its not been several years, the modem chips have not existed that longThe first generation 5G modem chips in those two Android phones were extremely limited, so they were actually prototype level chipsThe 5G modem chips in those Android phones could only provide high speed 5G for 15 seconds at which time they overheated in the reviewer\u2019s hand, they got so hot that they were dropped a few times, and the reviewer had to put the Android phone down, in addition the Android phones would drop their high speed 5G mode and switch to a much slower mode because the modem chip was starting to overheat; so in fact those Androids could only sustain 5G for 15 seconds (verified by Samsung engineers who publicly stated that the first generation 5G chips in production in 2019/2020 were most certainly limited to 15 seconds or so of high speed connectivity before they automatically slowed down to a very slow speed or that they would trigger an overheat condition which would cause the Android phone to turn itself offObviously those first Android phones with 5G modem chips only offer 5G as a marketing trick to fool consumers into buying technology that is is only of prototype level, and not really consumer qualityThe first Android phones were limited to only a few bands, so they cannot provide full service to everyone worldwideThe 2020 iPhone 12 5G modem offers coverage of far more bands (worldwide) than any Android phone, making it far more useful, and they will not overheat, so the phone is not at threat of being shut down unexpectedly like the Androids doUltimately Apple gives you a far better product, which is the hallmark of all Apple products",
