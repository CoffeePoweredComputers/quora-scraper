            "answer_text": "Waze is the better option to use IF there are a high amount of other Waze users in the city.  One thing that Waze benefits from that Google Maps doesn't is the network effort.  Waze users can report accidents or construction on certain routes real-time allowing a faster route to be taken. Waze even allows its users to report where cops are to not get caught by speed traps.  I believe that when Uber users use the service, they are looking to get to Point A to Point B in the fastest manner. It doesn't matter as much if the driver added a little distance to the ride if it was to the benefit of the customer. ",
