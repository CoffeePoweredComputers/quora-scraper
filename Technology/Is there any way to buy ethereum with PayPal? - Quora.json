            "answer_text": "PayPal can be an attractive way of buying Ethereum if you\u2019re unable to make bank transfers in your country of residence or you don\u2019t want to pay the hefty bank fees that are applied when converting currencies.  Visit here to exchange ETH to Paypal Unfortunately, it is incredibly difficult to find cryptocurrency exchanges that accept PayPal when buying any form of digital currency. VirWoX, the crypto exchange platform, was a firm favourite among those wishing to buy crypto with PayPal, but it was recently revealed it is no longer accepting PayPal for deposits or withdrawals. And although Coinbase lets users sell Bitcoin and have their US dollars deposited to a PayPal wallet, it doesn\u2019t let you buy digital currency using your PayPal account. Creative options It has been suggested that PayPal is wary of cryptocurrencies following a series of chargeback cases created by scammers, who bought Bitcoin using PayPal and then claimed they didn\u2019t receive anything. Since Bitcoins are untraceable, there is no way of checking whether such claims are true or not. Despite this, it is still possible to buy Ethereum with PayPal. You just need to be willing to explore some of the more \u201ccreative\u201d options out there. The two most viable methods to buy Ethereum with PayPal are via a contracts for difference (CFD) broker or a peer-to-peer exchange. Buying Ethereum using a CFD broker A convenient, secure, and fast way to buy Ethereum with PayPal is to use a CFD broker such as eToro. Marketed as a \u201csocial trading network\u201d, eToro\u2019s core purpose is to let people mimic the transactions of more experienced traders. It started supporting cryptocurrencies in 2017. eToro users can either buy one of the 14 crypto-assets listed on the platform or trade against their prices using CFDs. A CFD is a form of derivative trading which lets you take a position on a financial instrument without actually owning it. Buying Ethereum with PayPal on eToro is pretty straightforward. You create an account, submit how much money you wish to deposit, and select PayPal as your deposit method. Once the transaction is complete, you can then buy Ethereum. A major advantage of eToro is it is regulated in three jurisdictions, including the UK, thus offering peace of mind for investors. Similar CFD platforms to consider are Plus500 and Investous. Buying Ethereum using a peer-to-peer exchange A peer-to-peer exchange such as localethereum lets individuals anonymously connect with one another to buy and sell Ethereum. It\u2019s a bit like eBay for Ethereum. Registering is free and you can trade in any country in the world. Once you\u2019ve registered at localethereum, you need to select PayPal as your payment method. Your next step is to find an appropriate seller by browsing their location, the price they\u2019re selling Ethereum for, how much they\u2019re willing to sell, and how many trades they\u2019ve previously completed. After choosing a seller, you can set how much Ethereum you want to buy. You\u2019ll receive details of the PayPal address to send your funds to. An alternative peer-to-peer exchange, which has been around a lot longer, is LocalBitcoins. If you find someone willing to sell their Bitcoins in return for a PayPal payment, you could then convert your Bitcoins to Ethereum on an exchange platform like Changelly. An advantage of using peer-to-peer exchanges is you don\u2019t have to go through lots of identity verification procedures before you can use the exchange. However, unlike traditional exchanges, you\u2019re at the mercy of the seller responding to your request. Sellers on localethereum who have a lightning bolt icon are more likely to respond quickly. The most important thing is to ensure you find a reputable seller, as the risk of fraud on peer-to-peer exchanges is very high. Have a look at the seller\u2019s trading history and user feedback before you agree to a deal. Conclusion PayPal\u2019s strict view towards cryptocurrencies has made it more difficult to buy Ethereum with PayPal, but it is still possible if you\u2019re willing to use alternative exchanges. Just make sure you\u2019ve done your due diligence \u2013 whether that\u2019s of the platform itself and/or the individual seller \u2013 before handing over your fund ",

            "answer_text": "I've researched this for a while and as far as i've seen there is no way to buy ethereum with paypal. The only place where i managed to use paypal to buy crypto was virwox. But you lose a lot to fees and conversion rates. First you deposit the fiat, then you convert it into sll (second life linden) and then you convert it into btc. Not sure if this helps you. Also you can buy Ether with a credit, debit card or cash here: CoinMama is a nice option because you can buy less than $125 worth of Ethereum without the need to verify your identity. You can instantly sign up and buy Ethereum. You can have Ether in your wallet within about 20 minutes.  The downside to CoinMama is the fees are pretty high and come out to around 7%. CoinMama supports credit and debit cards from basically any country. Note that CoinMama only sells Ether and not Ethereum Classic. To buy Ethereum Classic you need to buy bitcoins or Ethereum on CoinMama and transfer the bitcoins to Binance to exchange them for Ethereum Classic. ",
