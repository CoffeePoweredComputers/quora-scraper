            "answer_text": "I know for sure it must be done with electro-magnetic fields. If you've ever used an electronic toothbrush you already have used the same tech. A small coil at the bottom of the toothbrush will receive. Another coil in the base of the charger will transfer it's energy via an electromagnetic field towards the toothbrush. I once disassembled one to see how it worked, wasn't surprised to find the coils.  Wireless phonechargers, or something like cota, must use the same technology since there is no other way to transport energy without any form of conductor other than via electromagnetic fields. ",
