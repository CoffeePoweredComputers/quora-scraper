            "answer_text": "I know that the concept of \u2018continents\u2019 is really a convention rather than a scientific style definition, but I\u2019ll ignore that, and base this on land masses. People have looked at the current continental drift, and made various predictions as to how the various plates will move in the future. There are two things that come to mind: There has been rifting in East Africa. Some people predict that eventually, this will split Africa into two separate land masses. Other people say that the rifting has been going on for a long time, and hasn\u2019t really got going, so this might never happen.The fastest moving land mass at present is Australia, which is heading norfthwards. This might eventually hit Asia, and become a new subcontinent, a bit like India.",

            "answer_text": "There is one that was just recognized\u2020: Zealandia. [Zealandia - Wikipedia] This is mostly submerged, but it is sufficiently large to be considered a continent, it is a complete piece of Gondwanaland that has remained separate since splitting, and much of it is within New Zealand\u2019s EEZ. It\u2019s a bit more than half the size of Australia, so big enough to be more than a micro-continent. It\u2019s just that a lot more of it is underwater than is the case with more land-oriented continents. But continents include their continental shelves, so Zealandia gets to count its. \u2020 There is no official \u2018register\u2019 of continents, nor any official body that decides whether something is or isn't a continent, rather like no-one really decides where the limits of the oceans are. It\u2019s a matter of loose agreement, with room for dissent. The Southern Ocean is in a similar situation today, and even washes onto or over parts of Zealandia.
