            "answer_text": "I attended St. John\u2019s Elementary School in Independence, Iowa, from 1st grade through 6th grade. Prior to that I attended kindergarten at Washington Elementary in Miss Walsh\u2019s class.

Plus, I was already reading, having taught myself using my 4-years-older sister\u2019s books. After sixth grade, I transferred to Jefferson High School, the local public school. Our band was just named one of the best marching bands in the nation and, even then, we had an outstanding band under director Glen Miller (no; not THAT Glen Miller.)
