            "answer_text": "Trying to learn machine learning fast is a recipe for disaster. There is so much you need to know to do any kind of meaningful work.The myth of the tool-assisted engineer.Recently, PaaS providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix and Google Cloud have marketed their machine learning platforms as magic tools that will make any software engineer into a data scientist just like that. Well, that\u2019s just marketing nonsense. Tools are no good without a proper understanding of the fundamentals.An unskilled data scientist will do more damage than good.The danger of trying to jump straight into professional machine learning is that you might create something that appears to make sense.With other areas of software engineering, like web development, it\u2019s usually very easy to expose something that stinks, because what you see is what you get. In machine learning, you get a bunch of numbers for the most part. It\u2019s often next to impossible for the end user to know whether they make sense or not.Incorrect assumptions are evil.An inexperienced data scientist may train a model and ship it to production once the accuracy reaches some high percentage, oblivious to the incorrect assumptions that were made while doing so.Knowing when your model is overfitting and when you have spurious correlations is something that comes with a solid theoretical understanding and experience.Learn machine learning the hard, but right, way.This is the best advice I can give someone who\u2019s starting out.Immerse yourself in all the learning material you can find. Attend MOOCs on Coursera and Udacity. Look up concepts on Wikipedia and Quora. Watch lectures and talks on YouTube. Read papers and books.Start practicing early, but start small. Implement simple algorithms like linear regression, gradient descent, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbors and na\u00efve Bayes before you progress to more advanced stuff.Implement algorithms from scratch. Try to do this once with every algorithm before you start using libraries. Only this way can you fully understand how they really work.Start with toy datasets. If you can\u2019t get an algorithm to work on a small, clean dataset, there is no way it will work on a big, messy real-world dataset.Only when you have gone through these steps will you be ready to take the training wheels off and attack real business problems. It will take time, but there is no quick fix solution to mastering machine learning. ",

            "answer_text": "After assuming that you have a good grasp on some OOP language like Python, Java, C++, etc. I recommend you to go with Machine Learning first. And the reason I suggest that, is because although all of them seem to be similar to each other in some aspect, there is a difference though. Here, Machine Learning is built upon some fundamental engineering maths topics, eg: Linear Regression.Whereas Artificial Intelligence involves more rigorous maths topics like Statistics, which can be quite overwhelming for a beginner.Now, Deep Learning is a different animal altogether, although much related to Machine Learning. The reason being that, it requires you to be good at imagination, and have the ability to comprehend deeper levels of abstractions. If ML is one layer of calculation, then DL involves multiple levels of it predictively building upon the previous results, similar to the human brain.And the company most popular for using Deep Learning is actually Google. They use it almost everywhere, beginning from Search, Translation, Home to the Google Assistant on your phone. The easiest way to think of their relationship is to visualize them as concentric circles with AI \u2014 the idea that came first \u2014 the largest, then machine learning \u2014 which blossomed later, and finally deep learning \u2014 which is driving today\u2019s AI explosion \u2014 fitting inside both. I hope this helped you in some way. Thanks ~ Atri PS: I am not a subject expert on this, so bear with me if you discover any flaws. ",
