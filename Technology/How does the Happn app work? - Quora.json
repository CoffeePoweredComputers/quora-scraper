            "answer_text": "How Does Happn Work?The first step requires you to create a profile to include up to nine pictures and basic information about you, with the option of syncing your Facebook. You can then submit your dating preferences and interests, just like any dating app. Instead of a search button, however, you are automatically connected with people you have walked by during the day, narrowing the search to profiles in close proximity. You can then filter through these suggested profiles and \u201clike\u201d it if you are interested. It is only when you have mutually liked each other, receiving a \u201ccrush\u201d, that the app lets you get into contact with them. This means that messages can only be exchanged between two people who are both interested in each other. Some may find this restrictive, especially when someone\u2019s profile is quite short. Luckily, Happn has a number of special features to improve its user experience. If you want to learn more about the pros and cons of Happn, you could check the Happn Review here ",
