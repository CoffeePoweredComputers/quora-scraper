            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi is a local area wireless technology that enables an electronic device to exchange data or connect to the Internet using to connect to a Wi-Fi LAN, a computer has to be armed with a wireless network interface controller. The combination of a computer and an interface controller is called a station. All stations share a single radio frequency communication channel. Transmission on this channel are received by all stations within range. A carrier wave is used to transmit the data in packets, referred to as Each station is constantly tuned in on the radio frequency communication channel to pick up available transmissions. the various type of wireless technology is that:- Bluetooth:- Blue tooth is the name of the wireless technology that is used principally to allow individual devices to communicate with each other over short distances. For example, handheld computers can transmit a phone number from an address book to a mobile phone, which then dials the number. While it is possible to use a blue tooth to network computers together, this is not generally done. ",

            "answer_text": "The term wireless communication was introduced in the 19th century and wireless communication technology has developed over the subsequent years. It is one of the most important mediums of transmission of information from one device to other devices. In this technology, the information can be transmitted through the air without requiring any cable or wires or other electronic conductors, by using electromagnetic waves like IR, RF, satellite, etc. Satellite Communication\u2014Satellite communication is one type of self contained wireless communication technology, it is widely spread all over the world to allow users to stay connected almost anywhere on the earth.Infrared Communication\u2014Infrared wireless communication communicates information in a device or systems through IR radiation . IR is electromagnetic energy at a wavelength that is longer than that of red light. It is used for security control, TV remote control and short range communications.Broadcast Radio\u2014The first wireless communication technology is the open radio communication to seek out widespread use, and it still serves a purpose nowadays. Handy multichannel radios permit a user to speak over short distances, whereas citizen\u2019s band and maritime radios offer communication services for sailors.Microwave Communication\u2014Microwave wireless communication is an effective type of communication, mainly this transmission uses radio waves, and the wavelengths of radio waves are measured in centimeters. In this communication, the data or information can be transfers using two methods. One is satellite method and another one is terrestrial method.Wi-Fi\u2014Wi-Fi is a low power wireless communication, that is used by various electronic devices like smart phones, laptops, ZETC Bollywood this setup, a router works as a communication hub wirelessly. These networks allow users to connect only within close proximity to a router. WiFi is very common in networking applications which affords portability wirelessly.Mobile Communication Systems\u2014The advancement of mobile networks is enumerated by generations. Many users communicate across a single frequency band through mobile phones. Cellular and cordless phones are two examples of devices which make use of wireless signals. Typically, cell phones have a larger range of networks to provide a coverage.But, Cordless phones have a limited range. Similar to GPS devices, some phones make use of signals from satellites to communicate.Bluetooth Technology\u2014The main function of the Bluetooth technology is that permits you to connect a various electronic devices wirelessly to a system for the transferring of data.Cell phones are connected to hands free earphones, mouse, wireless keyboard. By using Bluetooth device the information from one device to another device.",
