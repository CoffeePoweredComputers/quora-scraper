            "answer_text": "A number of my friends up north thought I was crazy for moving to Florida after 50 years of living in Minnesota and North Dakota, because of the hurricanes, which can make this a very dangerous place. That\u2019s in their eyes \u2014 to me, who has gone through two hurricanes (Matthew in 2016 and Irma a couple of months ago,) I don\u2019t really see them as being all that problematic. If a bad one looks likely to hit (and Daytona is in a somewhat unique position to avoid that,) we can just leave, otherwise, put up the shutters, clear off the patio and pool deck and wait it out. Pretty much every place has some element of danger, whether by nature or by man, so it comes down to weighing the potential for danger against the benefits of that location. Today, it\u2019s about 72\u00b0F and I\u2019m sitting on my lanai, enjoying the weather. Meanwhile, in North Dakota, it\u2019s 20\u00b0 and in my hometown in Minnesota, currently 23\u00b0. For me, that\u2019s a benefit that far outweighs the possibility of danger from a hurricane. Ironically, this came up on Facebook as a \u201cMemory\u201d from one year ago, today:  That\u2019s a 90\u00b0 difference between Daytona and my former hometown of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The largest difference that I\u2019ve seen was about a hundred degrees. ",
