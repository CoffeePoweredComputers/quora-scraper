            "answer_text": "Speaking from the perspective of an internet startup co-founder, I can say that without many of the current technologies, doing what my company is currently doing with the staff and funding level we are doing it with would be nearly impossible.  The basic idea is that the tech tools there are out there today help manage the mundane and common tasks that are shared amongst most companies, thus allowing businesses to focus more resources on their core value-creating activities. I'll quickly explain what I mean with a few technologies we use. 1. CloudOur team does everything in the cloud. Not having to maintain servers, worry about backups or pay an IT employee is a huge benefit. Not having to invest in expensive hardware to have solid website performance allows us to serve a big customer base and scale very quickly. We also take advantage of the collaboration the cloud offers, using Google Drive / Google Docs for the majority of our internal documents, allowing simultaneous viewing and editing for the whole team at once. This cuts down on wasted time like emailing files back and forth, and allows us to capture ideas directly in our system instead of a whiteboard that has to be dealt with later.  2. Freelance platformsSites like oDesk allow us to expand our human resources when we need to, without having to take on salaried employees. This is extremely important as a startup, since bringing in specialists on a full time basis wouldn't make any sense. For the majority of situations, we can find highly specialized skill sets, use them to complete small to medium sized jobs and then return to our normal staffing level, maximizing results while minimizing cost. The tools associated with these sites that monitor work being done and ensure you aren't getting ripped off give us peace of mind that we are working with the right people when we need to. This also gives us access to people all over the world, with skill sets and talents we might otherwise not have access to locally.  3. Organization ToolsExpanding on the collaboration aspect of the cloud, we use a number of tools to help keep us organized. Tools like GitHub and Trello allow us to work as a team no matter where in the world we are (currently split between Canada, USA and Belarus). This has helped enormously as a small team that is constantly moving around. Using Slack for daily communication and Google Hangouts for free voice calls keeps out team up to date and on the same page at all times. The same idea can be applied to any tool we use, from automated accounting and payroll services to advertising creation tools.  4. APIsAPIs are the new key to success for many internet companies. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow the integration of one service within another, and play a major role in most startups these days. Through the use of APIs, we were able to combine numerous stand alone technologies, package them together as one and expand our offering to include highly specialized manufacturing and shipping services, Intellectual property management tools and 3D rendering, all developed by partner companies and integrated into our platform through the use of APIs. This has allowed us to essentially act as a highly technical, international manufacturing service all without the need for much more than an internet connection and time. So, with the current state of tech, there has never been an easier time to get a small business up and running. The hard part, though, is finding an idea that people are willing to pay for, and executing properly. That still remains. Nick ",
