            "answer_text": "Sherlock Holmes the great fictional detective commented in a story that the slums of London were probably safer then the farm country passing by the train he was in. Most people in the old days knew their neighbors and even living in a bad neighborhood was usually safer then living in isolation. There are hazards and city life but most people don\u2019t get eaten by a grizzly bears in a large city in a large city hospital could be 15 to 20 minutes away by car a 911 call could be responded to depending on the emergency within 15 to 20 minutes. Imagine living on a farm with a response times of up to an hour for emergency vehicles. Most cities Street lights fire departments an animal control. Many of the old neighborhoods are gone but if you\u2019ve lived in Montreal your life there a good chance do you have some friends and family here. In some ethnic communities in certain neighborhoods there are many similarities to a small town. Usually people don\u2019t bother with each other here so there\u2019s less chance of making an intense relationship which could turn nasty especially if the other party feels betrayed. I guess it\u2019s just a matter of perception if you\u2019ve lived in the city your whole life you kind of feel safer in it I am basing my answer on my experience in Montreal. Hello if had grown up in Harlem Bedford Stuyvesant or the Bronx I might not feel the same way many cities have different neighborhoods. Montreal is not entirely safe but for a big city it\u2019s pretty safe the old neighborhoods may have gone but many people still feel the closeness to the city and their neighbors. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. It depends. And not sure what dangerous means in this question\u2019s context. I\u2019ve lived in quite a few - Gurgaon, Bangalore, NCR, Pune, and some from outside this country. Did I feel threatened? Nah. They are just normal cities in the end, full of people like you and me. Yes they are restless. So much that it\u2019s hard to find one inherently calm and happy soul who is just happy for itself and not for the fancy city it is in. I wasn\u2019t one either to be honest. But to look at it practically where else would you be? I am in the IT industry myself. It\u2019s only rare that I won\u2019t end up in one of those cities again. I\u2019ve left the last one for good as of now. And I\u2019m happier. Not liking my city either, it\u2019s a small town. Problem isn\u2019t that it\u2019s small, problem is that it\u2019s restless too. Unnecessary hustle, traffic, turning into a cemented forest. Two years down the line I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to turn out much like NCR. And it wasn\u2019t dangerous for the while I lived in any of those cities. Could easily take walks at 2am in the morning. But wait. Sadly that\u2019s okay for me as a male. None of my female friends had that luxury. It\u2019s a disgusting state of males we have in our country right now. It\u2019s always unsafe for a female to walk out carefree at anytime of the day practically in any city, forget the restless ones. I guess it\u2019s the attitude and the rotten mentality of us males that needs to change rather than the cities. For what it\u2019s worth I found Pune and Bangalore to be the best ones out there. People are educated, weather is nice and there are places you can drive to, to find that peace of mind. Cheers! ",
