            "answer_text": "[1] Varying the amount of black powder in each of these sections can alter how far your explosion shoots into the sky, how far it explodes outwards, as well as how hot the pellets get. The pellets that generate color are tiny balls of chemical salt. These salts are different metal and nonmetal compounds bonded together by a superstrong hold between the positively-charged metal and the negatively-charged nonmetal components. The nonmetals are usually chemicals like nitrogen or chlorine with oxygen attached to them, and can work as another source of oxygen for the burning explosion, or can enhance its color. The metal is responsible for each of these colors. \u201cDifferent chemical elements heated to a high temperature get rid of this energy by producing very specific wavelengths of light,\u201d John Conkling, a retired chemist formerly at Washington College in Maryland, explains for the American Chemical Society. The metals used in these salt pellets are made up of atoms with electrons floating around them. Usually, these electrons hang out as close as they can to the nucleus. But when you add energy to these atoms, as you do when you heat up powder, these electrons become \u201cexcited\u201d and get pushed farther and farther away. The amount of heat energy needed to push these electrons away varies for each metal. Electrons don\u2019t like being far away from the nucleus, so they bounce back down as soon as they can. When they do, they release the same amount of energy applied to them, but in the form of a unique wavelength of light instead, as Scientific American explains.
