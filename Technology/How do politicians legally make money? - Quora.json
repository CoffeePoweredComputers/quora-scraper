            "answer_text": "While in office politicians receive a (IMHO) modest salary and per diem. Given the expenses associated with maintaining household in their district while also living and working in the capitol, politicians are not getting rich through their salary. Pols spend a tremendous amount of time and effort raising money for reelection campaigns.  There are many restrictions on how this money can be spent -- the rules are intended to prevent the candidate from simply pocketing the money.  We occasionally hear tales of junkets and cronyism funded through campaign funds. Political Action Committees (PACs), especially Leadership PACs offer the candidate more flexibility.  Money donated to these organizations can be spent to support other candidates, and directed to charities the candidate supports.  There have been a few egregious examples of Leadership PACs supporting charities that employee the politician's spouse.   I'd assert that the \"payday\" for politicians begins when they leave office. Many land lucrative positions at law firms, consulting houses and lobbying firms.  These organizations are willing to pay dearly for the expertise, advice, and some would argue, influence, of a former elected official.  A shrewd politician can leverage money spent on fellow representatives campaigns via PACs to develop loyalty and perceived influence that continues (for a time anyway) after they leave office. In summary, I'd assert that most elected officials have a fair level of financial security before running for office, and few get rich while they serve... but if they play their cards right they can see a significant increase in wealth after leaving office.

            "answer_text": "I think that the question is really asking \u201chow is it that politicians manage to become quite wealthy when their salaries for their service in government don\u2019t appear to be responsible for their accumulation of wealth?\u201d That\u2019s actually a very good question, with the emphasis being on the word \u201clegally\u201d. Of course, there are many ways that politicians acquire wealth as a result of their office. But they are in a very unique situation in the sense that they are the ones who pass legislation. So whatever they do to \u201cearn\u201d their money, whether or not we might think it is ethical, can be legislated to be \u201clegal\u201d, by their own actions. It would be sort of like electing a bank robber to improve the laws concerning the robbery of banks. Naturally, in such a position, the politician will favor any legislation that improves his own ability to amass wealth. ",
