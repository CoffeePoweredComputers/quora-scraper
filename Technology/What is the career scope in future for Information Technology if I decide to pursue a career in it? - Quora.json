            "answer_text": "Ok here is the truth, its not for all. Pros: The starting salaries are great. Work environment will be the best in most cases. You are a mind worker which should keep you out of boredom completely and zip through time, work weeks feel shorter, unless you are benched or in support. No physical labor unless you are in networking even then you have support staff. Cons: Technology landscape changes day to day and so does your worth to the company unless you update constantly \u2014 life long learning. If you are slow or your company focuses narrowly on just a few clients and their technology you will have no career in a few years as you get outdated. You will find it harder landing jobs and keeping them once you reach higher salaries as if they dont get projects they lay off highest salaries first. The new trend is to train freshers on new technologies and pay them 10x lesser than a seasoned professional with technology expertise. You may end up a piece worker, you cannot deliver a whole product on your own, analysis, design, testing, implementation and focus geat narrower as there is broad spectrum of competing frameworks in each part and some settle for one expertise which can be automared or completely changed any day and you are back in the market competing with freshers. Even the best companies pay you less than a burger flipper minimim wages in the clients location in most cases. 20$ an hour = $160/day. 25days x 160 x 65 inr = Rs.2,60,000/\u2014 No matter who you think you are the above figures tell an aweful truth. Freshers are likely happy with 24k a month, but thats why India is such a piece of cake. On the flip side if you continue working directly with clients, freelancing on the net and not have to put up with all the nonsense managers and the office politics just to have a \u201crespectable position\" you could become a millionaire. In India we are all about position and company, we are here to satisfy our parents egos and close family than just live well. Chances are you wont even find a good proposal without it, so we repeat the same mistakes. So finally the question is: Do you enjoy continuous learning? Can you speak decent English ? Can you freelance and manage clients ? Are you hardworking and can manage high levels of stress ? Can you accept that by the end of your career everything you know will be useless and what you then know may also be useless but you should hopefully have found a stable ground or have otherwise ended up as some manager spilling out outdated gyan to bored teams , that is if you are employed at all :)\u2026 Finally in any industry you believe you put your life into the company and they should be greatful to you, your accomplishments and your efforts. The company will most definately see you as their burden that they paid and managed for so long. Its only a matter of perspective. I have seen certificates lying around my office worthless as pieces of paper as employees are given meritorious certificates for 10-20 years of service and if you are lucky a party and maybe the very lucky ones a double pay or pay raise. You should see their moment of realization of their worth and \u201cloyalty\u201d. If you are truly great, you get to double your salary at each job change and must only remain on that job till you are highly valued, but nothing beats freelancing. ",
