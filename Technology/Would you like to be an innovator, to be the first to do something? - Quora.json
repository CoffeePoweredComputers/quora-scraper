I am a unintentional innovator who discovered something about disease, infection and the human body that arose from the necessity of my own health. I attended a medical conference 5 years ago with my findings and left with more questions than answers. I was told nobody looks at disease, infection and addiction the way I have. Yet here I sit with 1st hand knowledge of what I overcame along with what others have also over the last 9 years using my discovery. The more I explore it further the more I find how much it applies across all Life and used properly produces life improving benefits. Being the first when it came from disease that got physically in your brain changed how you see things then you come up with answers to complex medical problems that seem to simple to be true only because you simplified them to understand it easier and you know they are true because not only did it work for me I watched it work for others. Every form of bowel disease even with fistulas improve Antibiotic resistant bacteria lose to this. It can help negate the negative effects of chemo and even improve the chances of recovery. It has dumb founded me the changes I have gone through fighting through disease looking for answers on my own and then figuring out all I have only to discover being the 1st is the bigger battle than finding the answers I have.

            "answer_text": "Unless I am widely known and respected on the marketplace, enjoying unconditional confidence of my customers, NO, I would not. When you are first, you have to get your product to be known and accepted, usually you have to teach people how to use it and prove its qualities and usefulness. Not to mention you also will have to overcome people\u2019s natural conservatism and reluctance to change. Just look at the case of the Personal Computers: Before 1981 there were dozens of different brands, standards and models of microcomputers. Selling them to the corporate world was an uphill battle (almost impossible) for all the above reasons. - in spite of the great prices. Then came IBM - and those three letters legitimized the microcomputer - and the rest is history, as you can verify it. ",
