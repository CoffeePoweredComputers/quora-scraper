            "answer_text": "Active Study vs. Passive StudyBe actively involved in managing the learning process, the mathematics and your study time: Take responsibility for studying, recognizing what you do and don't know, and knowing how to get your Instructor to help you with what you don't know.Attend class every day and take complete notes. Instructors formulate test questions based on material and examples covered in class as well as on those in the text.Be an active participant in the classroom. Get ahead in the book; try to work some of the problems before they are covered in class. Anticipate what the Instructor's next step will be.Ask questions in class! There are usually other students wanting to know the answers to the same questions you have.Go to office hours and ask questions. The Instructor will be pleased to see that you are interested, and you will be actively helping yourself.Good study habits throughout the semester make it easier to study for tests. http://...Studying Math is Different from Studying Other Subjects Math is learned by doing problems. Do the homework. The problems help you learn the formulas and techniques you do need to know, as well as improve your problem-solving prowess.A word of warning: Each class builds on the previous ones, all semester long. You must keep up with the Instructor: attend class, read the text and do homework every day. Falling a day behind puts you at a disadvantage. Falling a week behind puts you in deep trouble.A word of encouragement: Each class builds on the previous ones, all semester long. You're always reviewing previous material as you do new material. Many of the ideas hang together. Identifying and learning the key concepts means you don't have to memorize as much. http://...College Math is Different from High School MathA College math class meets less often and covers material at about twice the pace that a High School course does. You are expected to absorb new material much more quickly. Tests are probably spaced farther apart and so cover more material than before. The Instructor may not even check your homework. Take responsibility for keeping up with the homework. Make sure you find out how to do it.You probably need to spend more time studying per week - you do more of the learning outside of class than in High School.Tests may seem harder just because they cover more material. http://...Study TimeYou may know a rule of thumb about math (and other) classes: at least 2 hours of study time per class hour. But this may not be enough! Take as much time as you need to do all the homework and to get complete understanding of the material.Form a study group. Meet once or twice a week (also use the phone). Go over problems you've had trouble with. Either someone else in the group will help you, or you will discover you're all stuck on the same problems. Then it's time to get help from your Instructor.The more challenging the material, the more time you should spend on it.http://...Problem Solvinghttp://...Problem Solving (Homework and Tests) The higher the math class, the more types of problems: in earlier classes, problems often required just one step to find a solution. Increasingly, you will tackle problems which require several steps to solve them. Break these problems down into smaller pieces and solve each piece - divide and conquer!Problem types:Problems testing memorization (\"drill\"),Problems testing skills (\"drill\"),Problems requiring application of skills to familiar situations (\"template\" problems),Problems requiring application of skills to unfamiliar situations (you develop a strategy for a new problem type),Problems requiring that you extend the skills or theory you know before applying them to an unfamiliar situation.In early courses, you solved problems of types 1, 2 and 3. By College Algebra you expect to do mostly problems of types 2 and 3 and sometimes of type 4. Later courses expect you to tackle more and more problems of types 3 and 4, and (eventually) of type 5. Each problem of types 4 or 5 usually requires you to use a multi-step approach, and may involve several different math skills and techniques.When you work problems on homework, write out complete solutions, as if you were taking a test. Don't just scratch out a few lines and check the answer in the back of the book. If your answer is not right, rework the problem; don't just do some mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you could get the correct answer. If you can't get the answer, get help.The practice you get doing homework and reviewing will make test problems easier to tackle. http://...Tips on Problem Solving Apply P\u00f3lya's four-step process:The first and most important step in solving a problem is to understand the problem, that is, identify exactly which quantity the problem is asking you to find or solve for (make sure you read the whole problem).Next you need to devise a plan, that is, identify which skills and techniques you have learned can be applied to solve the problem at hand.Carry out the plan.Look back: Does the answer you found seem reasonable? Also review the problem and method of solution so that you will be able to more easily recognize and solve a similar problem.Some problem-solving strategies: use one or more variables, complete a table, consider a special case, look for a pattern, guess and test, draw a picture or diagram, make a list, solve a simpler related problem, use reasoning, work backward, solve an equation, look for a formula, use coordinates. http://...\"Word\" Problems are Really \"Applied\" ProblemsThe term \"word problem\" has only negative connotations. It's better to think of them as \"applied problems\". These problems should be the most interesting ones to solve. Sometimes the \"applied\" problems don't appear very realistic, but that's usually because the corresponding real applied problems are too hard or complicated to solve at your current level. But at least you get an idea of how the math you are learning can help solve actual real-world problems. http://...Solving an Applied Problem First convert the problem into mathematics. This step is (usually) the most challenging part of an applied problem. If possible, start by drawing a picture. Label it with all the quantities mentioned in the problem. If a quantity in the problem is not a fixed number, name it by a variable. Identify the goal of the problem. Then complete the conversion of the problem into math, i.e., find equations which describe relationships among the variables, and describe the goal of the problem mathematically.Solve the math problem you have generated, using whatever skills and techniques you need (refer to the four-step process above).As a final step, you should convert the answer of your math problem back into words, so that you have now solved the original applied problem.For Further Reading:George P\u00f3lya, How to Solve It,Princeton University Press, Princeton (1945)http://...Studying for a Math Testhttp://...Everyday Study is a Big Part of Test PreparationGood study habits throughout the semester make it easier to study for tests. Do the homework when it is assigned. You cannot hope to cram 3 or 4 weeks worth of learning into a couple of days of study.On tests you have to solve problems; homework problems are the only way to get practice. As you do homework, make lists of formulas and techniques to use later when you study for tests.Ask your Instructor questions as they arise; don't wait until the day or two before a test. The questions you ask right before a test should be to clear up minor details. http://...Studying for a TestStart by going over each section, reviewing your notes and checking that you can still do the homework problems (actually work the problems again). Use the worked examples in the text and notes - cover up the solutions and work the problems yourself. Check your work against the solutions given. You're not ready yet! In the book each problem appears at the end of the section in which you learned how do to that problem; on a test the problems from different sections are all together. Step back and ask yourself what kind of problems you have learned how to solve, what techniques of solution you have learned, and how to tell which techniques go with which problems.Try to explain out loud, in your own words, how each solution strategy is used (e.g. how to solve a quadratic equation). If you get confused during a test, you can mentally return to your verbal \"capsule instructions\". Check your verbal explanations with a friend during a study session (it's more fun than talking to yourself!).Put yourself in a test-like situation: work problems from review sections at the end of chapters, and work old tests if you can find some. It's important to keep working problems the whole time you're studying.Also: Start studying early. Several days to a week before the test (longer for the final), begin to allot time in your schedule to reviewing for the test.Get lots of sleep the night before the test. Math tests are easier when you are mentally sharp.http://...Taking a Math Testhttp://...Test-Taking Strategy MattersJust as it is important to think about how you spend your study time (in addition to actually doing the studying), it is important to think about what strategies you will use when you take a test (in addition to actually doing the problems on the test). Good test-taking strategy can make a big difference to your grade! http://...Taking a Test First look over the entire test. You'll get a sense of its length. Try to identify those problems you definitely know how to do right away, and those you expect to have to think about.Do the problems in the order that suits you! Start with the problems that you know for sure you can do. This builds confidence and means you don't miss any sure points just because you run out of time. Then try the problems you think you can figure out; then finally try the ones you are least sure about.Time is of the essence - work as quickly and continuously as you can while still writing legibly and showing all your work. If you get stuck on a problem, move on to another one - you can come back later.Work by the clock. On a 50 minute, 100 point test, you have about 5 minutes for a 10 point question. Starting with the easy questions will probably put you ahead of the clock. When you work on a harder problem, spend the allotted time (e.g., 5 minutes) on that question, and if you have not almost finished it, go on to another problem. Do not spend 20 minutes on a problem which will yield few or no points when there are other problems still to try.Show all your work: make it as easy as possible for the Instructor to see how much you do know. Try to write a well-reasoned solution. If your answer is incorrect, the Instructor will assign partial credit based on the work you show.Never waste time erasing! Just draw a line through the work you want ignored and move on. Not only does erasing waste precious time, but you may discover later that you erased something useful (and/or maybe worth partial credit if you cannot complete the problem). You are (usually) not required to fit your answer in the space provided - you can put your answer on another sheet to avoid needing to erase.In a multiple-step problem outline the steps before actually working the problem.Don't give up on a several-part problem just because you can't do the first part. Attempt the other part(s) - if the actual solution depends on the first part, at least explain how you would do it.Make sure you read the questions carefully, and do all parts of each problem.Verify your answers - does each answer make sense given the context of the problem?If you finish early, check every problem (that means rework everything from scratch).http://...Getting Assistancehttp://...WhenGet help as soon as you need it. Don't wait until a test is near. The new material builds on the previous sections, so anything you don't understand now will make future material difficult to understand. http://...Use the Resources You Have Available Ask questions in class. You get help and stay actively involved in the class.Visit the Instructor's Office Hours. Instructors like to see students who want to help themselves.Ask friends, members of your study group, or anyone else who can help. The classmate who explains something to you learns just as much as you do, for he/she must think carefully about how to explain the particular concept or solution in a clear way. So don't be reluctant to ask a classmate.Go to the Math Help Sessions or other tutoring sessions on campus.Find a private tutor if you can't get enough help from other sources.All students need help at some point, so be sure to get the help you need. http://...Asking QuestionsDon't be afraid to ask questions. Any question is better than no question at all (at least your Instructor/tutor will know you are confused). But a good question will allow your helper to quickly identify exactly what you don't understand. Not too helpful comment: \"I don't understand this section.\" The best you can expect in reply to such a remark is a brief review of the section, and this will likely overlook the particular thing(s) which you don't understand.Good comment: \"I don't understand why f(x + h) doesn't equal f(x) + f(h).\" This is a very specific remark that will get a very specific response and hopefully clear up your difficulty.Good question: \"How can you tell the difference between the equation of a circle and the equation of a line?\"Okay question: \"How do you do #17?\"Better question: \"Can you show me how to set up #17?\" (the Instructor can let you try to finish the problem on your own), or \"This is how I tried to do #17. What went wrong?\" The focus of attention is onyour thought process.Right after you get help with a problem, work another similar problem by yourself. http://...You Control the Help You GetHelpers should be coaches, not crutches. They should encourage you, give you hints as you need them, and sometimes show you how to do problems. But they should not, nor be expected to, actually do the work you need to do. They are there to help you figure out how to learn math for yourself. When you go to office hours, your study group or a tutor, have a specific list of questions prepared in advance. You should run the session as much as possible.Do not allow yourself to become dependent on a tutor. The tutor cannot take the exams for you. You must take care to be the one in control of tutoring sessions.You must recognize that sometimes you do need some coaching to help you through, and it is up to you to seek out that coaching.",

            "answer_text": "1) If you don't understand something, focus on mastering that topic before moving on to the next topic~It sounds simple, but it is absolutely essential. Lets say a student is learning Algebra, for example. Further, lets say he or she is having a hard time understanding how to add and subtract negative and positive numbers. All of us struggle with this in the beginning as it is a sticky point for most students. Some students in this situation, out of frustration that they \"can't\" learn this topic, will move on to the next lesson in the hope that they will be able to understand that one.This is a recipe for disaster.Math is very much like learning to read. If you don't know your letter sounds then you have no hope of being able to sound out words of course there is no way possible that you could read a book. All math courses are taught in a specific sequence because the every topic builds on the previous topic. If you are having a problem with a topic, continue working with that one until you understand it and can work problems successfully. Watch the DVD section over again, attend tutoring, read the book and examples a second time, or even get a totally different book to have it explained a different way...but whatever you do not turn the page and tackle the next topic. If you do, you will get even more frustrated and you in all likelihood will begin to give up hope.2)Work example problems and check your answers to gain practice with every lesson~The entire premise of the DVD series is to \"learn by example\" and it is quite simply the easiest way to learn Math. After watching the section on the DVD and reading the section in your textbook, begin working examples from the end of the chapter. Make sure to work the problems that have answers in the back of the book, and check every one. Always begin with the easiest problem in your book, even if you think it will be too \"easy\" to solve. It is very very important to build your confidence. This is why the DVD lessons begin with easier problems that no one will have any issue understanding. Gradually work harder and harder problems from your book and check your answer for each one. After working a dozen or more problems from the section (two dozen is best), you are ready to move on to the next section. Many students want to plow though a lesson just to make it to the next one. You cannot just read a section in a Math book and become an expert on that section. You must work problems. If you can't work problems then you are not ready to move on. The good news is that working problems will build your confidence, and confidence is 100% the name of the game in Math.3)When beginning to work a Math problem, do not \"map out a path from problem-to-answer\" in your head before writing anything down~I see this almost every day. It is very common when someone looks at a Math problem that they try to \"figure it out\" in their head before writing anything down. Take Algebra for example. When a beginning student looks at an equation, he or she will be tempted to solve the equation in their head and not write anything down. Students are tempted to do this most often with Word Problems. Since a word problem is written in sentence form, it is common to think that you can \"think your way to the answer\". I will tell you that I never, ever, solve any sort of math problem without writing it down. Ever.What you need to do is begin by first writing down the problem. Then you begin to solve it one step at a time. Write down even the simple things. What you need to ensure is that every single step that you write down is perfectly legal. In other words, if you are solving an equation for example and you subtract \"10\" from both sides....write that down. Then in the NEXT step actually do that subtraction. Then if you need to divide both sides by \"2\" write THAT down...then in the NEXT step actually do the division. This gives you a paper trail to check your work and also it allows you to break the problem down in to bite sized chunks. If you can be sure that every single little step is legal, then you will be in good shape. If you try to do too many things at one time, which is common, you will probably try to do something illegal and get into trouble.4)When you study and do homework, try to find a quiet place to do it~I was the worst offender of this while in school. I used to listen to music all of the time while trying to do homework. I'd also listen to the TV as 'background noise\" while studying. Over time I realized that if I had a quiet place without the background noise, I could focus much better. What I found is that when reading, for example...I would have to read something perhaps 3 or 4 times if I was listening to something else but only once if I had some quiet. People love to listen to music while studying, but I am convinced that it is much more effective if you don't. Try to find a quiet spot in your home or in the Library to get your schoolwork done and you will get your work done much more quickly because you'll be able to focus and absorb more.5)If someone asks you for help, try to explain the topic to them as best you can~This one is going to seem a little odd for this list...but there is one universal truth. Those who can teach others have a true grasp of the material. Many times when studying in groups there will be one member of the group who is behind and doesn't \"get it\". Try to help that person, even if your own work will take longer. Not only will you feel like you are helping someone else succeed, but the process of rephrasing information back to someone else and breaking things down into bite sized chunks will increase your own understanding. It will help you understand at a fundamental level what the stumbling blocks are for the topic, which will help you as you move on in your math studies.6)Never, ever work math problems in pen~This one is pretty simple. You will make a mistake; it is only a matter of time. When you do, you will want to completely erase your mistake and write over it. You will never, ever want to scratch something out and write next to the scratch-out. This will lead to a paper that is hard to read, and the scratch-outs will actually increase your anxiety about solving these problems. You want clean-neat paper with a clean well thought-out solution.7)Try to use a mechanical pencil with separate eraser, if you can~This one is pretty simple. You will make a mistake; it is only a matter of time. When you do, you will want to completely erase your mistake and write over it. You will never, ever want to scratch something out and write next to the scratch-out. This will lead to a paper that is hard to read, and the scratch-outs will actually increase your anxiety about solving these problems. You want clean-neat paper with a clean well thought-out solution. Thanks A2A. ",
