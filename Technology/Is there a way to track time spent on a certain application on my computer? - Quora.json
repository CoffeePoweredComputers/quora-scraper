            "answer_text": "There are several time tracking platforms out there that offer robust time tracking solutions. Hubstaff allows you to track time spent for project, budget and billing purposes but perhaps its best feature is that the time tracking feature provides info on time spent on each application, which application and can take up to 1x, 2x, 3x screenshots every 10 minutes(which can also be disabled). There is also a productivity tracker which tracks how active you are by keystroke. It\u2019s sort of a gamified way to motivate you to work. It will report productivity percentages and where the numbers are at compared to last week. Hubstaff app is device agnostic meaning you can use it on desktop, mobile or tablet across different operating systems and has many integrations making it fun and easy to track time. Another top time tracking app is ATracker. ATracker is great because it can work as a time tracker but also creates reports so you can see where time is spent the most. It\u2019s an easy and elegant set-up that is user friendly. You can check out more of the best time tracking apps of 2018 here. Good luck and I hope this helps! ",
