            "answer_text": "I am a transportation designer, and have been building electric vehicles since 1985. So I think I can illuminate this in few words. Electric drivetrains can be very simple. Two basic concepts: Hub motorInternally installed motor with gearingIn the first scenario, your motor is actually part of the wheel. A so-called \u201cplanetary gear\u201d transfers the motor\u2019s power onto the wheel. It\u2019s basically a little transmission popped at the end of the motor, and then the whole caboodle sits inside the wheel itself. What\u2019s great about this is that you have no engine stuff anywhere else in the car, so you save a lot of space. But it makes the wheels heavy, which is not a desired effect in a car, as it causes the car to handle less well. So we would see this more likely in construction machinery. In the second scenario, the motor can be anywhere in the car, and a drive shaft turns the wheel, connecting it to the motor. That means a drivetrain of that type is laid out very much like what we see in a \u201cnormal\u201d car with petrol engine. The motor may well be at the front, and there could be a drive shaft going back to the rear axle. Just like any good old 1950s Chevy. And that means you could theoretically convert an old car to electric quite easily, by taking out the old petrol engine and connecting the new, electric engine to the transmission, if it is a manual one. It\u2019s trickier when you have automatic transmissions, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend that. In both scenarios, all you need is a controller between battery and motor to control how much power flows from the battery to the motor. This is controlled directly by the driver. So, you essentially only have these three parts, controller, battery, and motor. And that\u2019s all. Electric drivetrains are much more simple than others. ",

            "answer_text": "Energy is provided by a large battery. Typically about 360 VDC, although some next generation electric cars have batteries of about 800 volts. On all the current production cars I am aware of, the high voltage DC is sent to an electronic device called an inverter. The inverter converts the high voltage DC from the battery into 3 phase variable frequency and variable voltage AC. The accelerator pedal controls the frequency and voltage of the power the inverter sends to the motor. The 3 phase AC power is sent to an electric motor. Most commonly 1 motor driving both front wheels or both rear wheels. The motor is connected to a reduction gear to lower the RPM (electric car motors work from 0 to 15,000 RMP approximately) and the output of the reduction gear goes to a differential that is the same as the differential in a gas powered car. Some electric cars have both front and rear motors, and there are a few limited production exotic cars that use 1 motor per wheel. As other answers noted, no mass produced electric car uses hub mounted motors, because that puts too much unsprung mass on the wheel. There is no clutch or torque converter. There is no reverse gear. The motor is always engaged, and stops when the car stops. Reverse is done by spinning the motor backwards (by controlling the phase relationships from the inverter). The output of the differential goes through axles to the wheels. The electric motor is most commonly a 3 phase induction motor, but Tesla uses a variant of a switched reluctance motor for the rear motor in a Model 3, and there may be some electric cars that use some version of a permanent magnet motor. No mass produced electric car uses a motor that has brushes or slip rings. They all apply multiphase AC to the stator windings of the motor, and the rotor is unpowered (except by induction) ",
