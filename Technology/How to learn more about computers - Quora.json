            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s how it started for me. TLDR: Fix it till it breaks and then fix it again. A few generations after the rice of the \u201cPC\u201d I stopped being a die-hard Amiga user and bought my first PC. I believe it was a Packard Bell. (I didn\u2019t know any better.) That computer came with a lot of demo CDROMs and a diskette that said \u201cstep one\u201d or \u201cstart here\u201d or something like that. It also came with a Windows 95 upgrade coupon that I sent in right away. I had a good understanding of my Amiga, but I was absolutely ignorant about Windows computers. The Windows 95 CDROM arrived in the mail, and I did the upgrade\u2014Somewhat annoyed at having to learn the new layout, but I managed. One night I started checking out the stack (had to be about a dozen or so) of CDROMS that came with the computer. I came upon one that was a solid color. I don\u2019t remember how it was labeled, but it certainly didn\u2019t say \u201crecovery\u201d or anything like that. Might have said \u201csystem.\u201d I got a message on the screen that told me to start with the single diskette that had come with the computer. So I popped it in, the drives started whirring\u2026 I don\u2019t remember any of the messages that you typically see when restoring a system or installing an OS. It may have asked me whether I wanted to do a full or partial restore. (Sorry, I\u2019m going back decades to describe something I really didn\u2019t understand at the time.) Eventually, I was told to remove the disks and reboot. What I had done, was restore the computers original W3.1 (I think) image to a Windows 95 system. But it wasn\u2019t a full wipe and re-image. I think it just replaced system files to bring what was supposed to be a corrupt drive back into a bootable state. Anyway, instead of booting, I got some error message complaining about a missing file. I DID have something of an understanding of startup files. (The Amiga had one too.) So I just deleted (Uncommenting never occurred to me.)the references to those files, or deleted the programs calling for them. Eventually, the computer booted into some sort of mutant Windows 3/95 configuration which consisted of a Windows 95 screen covered with Windows 3 icons and utility programs. The colors were weird too as I recall. I knew it could not possibly be stable, but it was late and I went to bed. I told my co-workers about the things I did to get my computer back to life and got responses like \u201cYou DELETED that?\u201d But I had learned something. I found out how to restore my system and I figured out that with the Windows 95 CDROM, I didn\u2019t need that start-up diskette anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "Go all the way back to why number systems were needed and how they came to be. Roman numerals, Arabic numbers, the creation of zero. Learn binary math, octal, hexadecimal (fun stuff for a math head). These will give you a base for understanding the building blocks of computer systems later on. Learn about what some consider the first computer and computer programmer: Babbage\u2019s Difference and Analytical Engines and Lady Ada of Lovelace. You might read books like The Soul of a New Machine.  Delving into all the amazing history is part of everything and you will become an archive expert. And the history, all the contributors, all the machinery invented, etc., etc., will help you not only KNOW everything but UNDERSTAND everything. Experiments with Digital Logic and electronics in general will move you forward in knowing all about how the various computer components work. Research the advent and increase in transistor use and the culmination of silicon chips of increasing power. Invest in all the electronic kits you can and work with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi\u2019s \u2014 learning all that goes into a basic computer. Put together kits that calculate, communicate and can be arranged or programmed to do a great variety of actions. Learn all the different operating systems and major and minor chips that run and ran them. How did we get the current versions of Linux, Apple and Windows OS\u2019s? There are others too. How did we go from solely key and paper interfaces to screens with command lines to today\u2019s GUI\u2019s? At this point, build your own computer which will take you to and beyond and break, crush and expand your personal limitations; you will learn tons and make the greatest strides in learning ALL. From there, you\u2019ll learn about communications history and practical protocols used today \u2014 as well as those being developed today but which you won\u2019t know anything about while they are behind closed, private doors. You\u2019ll acquire the finest points of all communications methods and the hardware that\u2019s been, is, and will be used to facilitate messaging and transfer. You will find new ideas popping to mind that haven\u2019t been thought by anyone and designs for breakthrough software and machinery, longing to burst forth into designs and physical manifestations that will be useful to one or to billions. You have quite an exciting journey ahead. Enjoy! ",
