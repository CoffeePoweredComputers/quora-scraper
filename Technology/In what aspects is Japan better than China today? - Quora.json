            "answer_text": "Oh boy...I've lived in Chengdu, Shanghai, and Tokyo...also spent a lot of time in Nagano Prefecture. 1) Japanese are wealthier on average...they have more disposable income so they travel more. 2) They have a better social welfare system, especially in regard to their National Healthcare system. 3) Japanese people are better educated on average. 4) Japanese people are probably more worldly in their outlook because they do travel more and get more uncensored news from outside the country.  I met many people, even in Shanghai who knew very little about the world outside of Mainland China but for what they saw on TV and movies, and they tended to think that was reality. I did not find this as much with Japanese.  It exists, but it is an issue of degree. 5) Japan is clean.  Japanese are almost obsessed with cleanliness, the streets are clean, as much as Singapore, but unlike Singapore they don't have to produce that with strong fines.  The Japanese naturally do this. 6) Food is safe, that kind of fits into #5, Japanese pride themselves not only on their cooked food, but the freshness and cleanliness of their food.  If you have a diet that includes raw fish, partially cooked chicken and horse it better be \"fresh\" or you have a good risk of dying from food poisoning. 7) Japanese are very detail oriented and generally have a healthy obsession with perfecting things.  In China many people, if not most still have the \u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u5148\u751f (good enough) attitude.  Most people in China do not take pride in their work or the precision it is about what is good enough to \"get by\" or to \"sale\"..or \"get away with\", the idea is \"fast/big/sell\"...in Japan it is \"quality\" first and foremost, the general idea is the customer will buy more if the quality is high.  Japanese did not invent the idea of \"continuous improvement\" but they perfected it (\u6539\u5584). 8) Japan is not as conservative in a lot of ways (this is very dependent on situation) but I found Japanese were more liberal in their personal lives and open to foreigners than most Chinese, who are still quite socially conservative, even in larger cities (on average). 9) Japan is a democracy.  The government does not arbitrarily ban media/internet/speech.   People vote for their leaders and hold them accountable.  There is no such thing as a \"political prisoner\" in Japan.  No one is put in prison for criticizing the government. 10) Japanese people are far more polite and respectful of others in public places than any Chinese people I have ever met, as a group.  They really do care about the feelings of others and are very cautious not to offend others, that they do not even know.  In China, Chinese are generally only like this with people THEY KNOW, so they tend to not care much about how they behave in a public space as far as being loud, taking up space, litter, etc.  Japan is a densely crowded nation, more than China, but people seem to care about the environment and others.  Leads me to the next one: 11) Japanese are generally quite environmentally conscious and love nature.  They take care of their natural places, despite how densely crowded their islands are. 12) In my experience living in both, I would say Japanese are far less racist, at least in comparison to Chinese people (not really in comparison to most Westerns): Collin Anthony Spears' answer to What is it like being black in Japan? Collin Anthony Spears' answer to What is it like to be black in China? 13) Maybe because Japan has been wealthier longer, and the country has been relatively stable for a long time, they are FAR LESS materialistic. Collin Anthony Spears' answer to Are people in East Asian nations more materialistic than others? 14) Japan produces more science and technology.  I'm not talking about \"OEM industries\" producing foreign companies' designs, I'm talking about indigenous knowledge creation. Japan is still ahead of China, far ahead.   15) Because of #14 and #7, #9, and #3 Japan has far more international brands that are recognized as top or near the very top of their industry.Collin Anthony Spears' answer to Why do some people say East Asians are not creative?

            "answer_text": "Despite being located in the same continent, and fairly close to each other, Japan and China are two very different countries. While Japan is an open, parliamentary constitutional monarchy, China is one of the largest Communist countries in the world. Japan is considered as one of the most advanced countries in the world, and China has a fascinating history and a well-developed economy. Both the Japanese and Chinese can be offended when you mix the cultures up, even if it is a silly little mistake, try to understand the big differences. Its a common misperception among people in the West that these two countries are very similar, but you would be surprised at \u201chow many differences are there\u201d. Japan is seen as one of the most advanced countries of the world, while China has one of the most developing economies in the world. But if you compare the two countries side by side, Japan is in fact richer, and the population enjoy a higher standard of living then they do in China. After decades, China has opened up and entered a new era of market-oriented policies and development. It is called the \u2018Chinese style capitalism\u2019, but not all citizens benefit from it. Some areas remain severely underdeveloped, while urban areas are growing richer and richer. China is a developing country, meaning it\u2019s a cheaper than Japan, which has a very high cost of living. If you aren\u2019t careful, just a few days in Tokyo could empty your wallet, while life in Beijing or Shanghai is slightly more affordable. To give you an idea; in Tokyo or Osaka you will pay around $30 for meals in one day, while being in Shanghai or Beijing you can expect to only pay around $20. The two nations have as much in common as they have differences. One of the main differences is that Chinese people tend to be freer and more opener, while the Japanese are more modest and a little more closed. Also Chinese are more open about public affection than the Japanese are; Japanese will try to have as little contact as possible with other people, while the Chinese are more open. Japan is more a standardized and harmonized country, while China has significantly more variety than Japan in terms of food, clothing and customs etc. One explanation of this is that China is a far bigger country than Japan.
