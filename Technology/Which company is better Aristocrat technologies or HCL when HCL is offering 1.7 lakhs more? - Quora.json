But if you want a serious answer, check out who you will be working for and what this person ambition and role is in the organisation. If you get to spend 1/2 a day in the work environment or even meet them for dinner, you will get to know your boss better. Then you can ask what kind of work you will be doing and what new things you will be learning. Once you have answers to all these questions, you will know which is the right one to choose.
