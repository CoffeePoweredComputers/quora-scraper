            "answer_text": "Some people want to help the streaming community there so they upload .. it's just a \"fight the system\" spirit so they put the time in.Same as the people who take the risk and publish copyrighted content through torrents. When sites are large enough you will naturally have some people uploading. As for the content constantly being removed and re-added back - that I doubt actual users do.My educated guess is site owners create bots to add content back while appearing as regular users when it is removed due to copyright violations.
