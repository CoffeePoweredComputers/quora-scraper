            "answer_text": "Peter Parker is a genius with biology, chemistry and technology. With very little in the way of financial resources he developed his web fluid, his mechanical web shooters and spider-tracers which are \u201cbugs\u201d his spider-sense is capable of detecting and tracking. Over the years he has been able to increase his technical repertoire. As a scientist for Horizon Labs he was able to develop alternative, specialized suits, one capable of invisibility which is still worn by one of the Scarlet Spiders aka Kaine. In a recent arc, Peter had been replaced in his mind and body by Doctor Octopus aka Dr Otto Octavius who managed to acquire the funding to start his own business and completed Peter\u2019s educational pursuit of a PhD. When Peter recovered control of his body he found himself a CEO of a global tech business to rival Tony Stark. It\u2019s hard to say how much tech he developed personally and how much employees developed but he was definitely a big contributor. ",

He believes in the good of humanity, but is an excellent fighter, for when people fail to live up to their true potential and decide to go against the law. Of course, those fighting capabilities are mostly due to his superhuman abilities, but he\u2019s very focused on honing those skills so he can carry the responsibility that he feels he needs to with his superpowers.
