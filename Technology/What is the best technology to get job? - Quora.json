            "answer_text": "First of all, this isn't a stupid question. One of the most effective ways to keep track of the technology skills that employers are demanding is to browse job sites on a regular basis.  Here are just a few job sites to get you started:http://Monster.com (the classic)http://craigslist.org (yes, legitimate employers post there)http://oDesk.com (for remote jobs) Since I have hired people on oDesk myself, I will use that website for this example, but you can basically do this on any job site. After creating a free oDesk account, do a search for \"Computer Science\" (in quotes), or just click here: https://www.odesk.com/jobs/?from=find-work#filter/?q=%22Computer+Science%22&spellcheck=1&highlight=1 Then, open up Notepad and start reading postings. When you find a job that sounds enjoyable to you, write down all of the technology skills required for that job.  Keep going until you have a nice, long list. Now delete everything that doesn't appear on there twice.  Boom! Those are the technical skills you need to learn to get the type of job you want. Do this on a regular basis and you will know much more about what employers want than most of your graduating class, and that's coming from a CEO. ",
