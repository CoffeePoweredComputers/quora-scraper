            "answer_text": "One person showed the power of multitrack recording and is widely credited with pioneering the techniques of multitrack recording, Les Paul. Les Paul was one of the first to demonstrate what multi-track recording could offer creatively. Les Paul It's hard to understate the importance of multitrack recording in the production of music in the 70 years since Les Paul pioneered the techniques. The technology was created originally to make these techniques easier. Recording studios used to require millions of dollars in gear and staff to maintain that gear. As the inventiom of solid state circuitry came about, the price of gear steadily declined until today, where you can have all the gear necessary to record a full band for a few thousand dollars. The technology has become democratized, and the gate keepers to the studio, the large record labels that funded records being made, have become less important. This has allowed a proliferation of artists making music. Somewhat ironically, the old outboard gear is highly revered in the studio world, with copies being made of classic gear in both hardware and software. Technology has also removed the track limits that used to exist, allowing virtually an infinite number of tracks. Multitrack recording and the technology that enables it have been interrwined in their development over the years. ",

            "answer_text": "There is much to answer on this, but the two biggest things is no tape, so basically if you make a mistake in the tune it's easy to go back and get right, which means much less stress in recording a record and no waste of expensive tape, also means the mucianship goes down, now there's less pressure to get it right the first time, this can be heard in the simplistic song writing on much of today's pop music. The other is editing. With tape you literally had to cut away with an exacto style knife the parts you didn't want, now in a digital sequence it's as easy as editing a word document using cut copy and paste tools. ",
