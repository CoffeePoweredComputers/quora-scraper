            "answer_text": "First, see what Internet Service Providers (ISPs) actually are able to install service at your home. Just because they are in the area doesn\u2019t mean that they can actually reach your home. (A perfect example is my parents\u2019 home. It is just 50 feet too far for them to be able to get AT&T U-Verse service due to the distance they are from the neighborhood DSLAM. As such, their only option (other than pathetic satellite) is the local cable company.) Next, once you have determined which services actually reach your home, see what each offers in regard to speeds and prices (and, depending on where you live, the amount of data transfer that they offer each month with each level of speed). If you are considering getting TV service from the same company, you might add that to your comparison as well. Not all TV packages are created equal. Third, check the reviews of each company written by those in your area who have used each service. Try to discover how well each company responds to repair requests and whether the problems are resolved in a timely fashion. (I recently switched back to U-Verse after six years with the cable company because the cable company knew that they had problems with the main service cable in the area but wouldn\u2019t do anything about it for at least three or four months despite it all but disabling the Internet access of a large portion of this neighborhood\u2026and yet they still expected us to pay for our 150Mbps connections at the full rate even though we were receiving only 30Mbps!) Also, check whether there is a pattern to those complaints such as a rise in reported problems during/after periods of rain. Fourth, look for any gotchas in their pricing. Is the price you are given today only for the first month or the first three months (with a huge price increase thereafter) or is the price locked in for the first year or\u2026? Once all this is weighed, look at your home and see what outside connections you have near where you want your service modem to be installed. Do you have both cable and phone connections nearby? If so, then your options are quite wide open. If you have only one or the other, then be aware that if you choose the opposite, chances are greater that a new jack will be installed and the company can charge a small fee for that (around here, that is $50). It might be worth it, though, especially in the case of cable since they will most likely install a modern, high-quality RG-6 line as opposed to the old, thin, barely functional RG-59 of decades ago. I hope all this helps. If you have any other questions or if you happen to be in the northeast Kansas area (Lawrence, Topeka, Eudora, Ottawa, Atchison, KC metro, etc.) and would like some on-site assistance, please feel free to contact me through my business website.

            "answer_text": "First, know what you want to do with the broadband connection. If it is only occasionally looking something up on the web, checking email, and such, then you don\u2019t need the highest speed. If you have multiple users, even doing the same, again you don\u2019t have a need for the highest speed. Add video streaming (Netflix, Hulu, or any of the other streaming services), with multiple simultaneous users, then you will need a higher speed Internet. With active gaming across the Internet, then the highest speed will be desired. Then, after contemplating your need, find the high speed Internet providers, read reviews on reliability, check costs (and price raising history) and make your selection. ",
