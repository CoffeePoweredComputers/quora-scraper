            "answer_text": "A \u201cSmart TV\u201d also called as \u201cConnected TV\u201d is a TV set which is connected to internet to use online services and access internet directly in TV. Android TV is the Operating system among few other OSes available in TV platform; like Web OS for LG TVs, Tizen OS for Samsung TV. However, most of TV operating systems are based on Linux based kernels, so that apps they develop has better integration with hardware used in those TVs. Many OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) like Samsung, LG are releasing models have either their own OS or Android to give few choices for their users depending on their preferences. They still adopt Android OS for their TVs, because it has better UX, vast developer support, major apps availability (from Google Play store), better google services integration for seamless sync between your Google apps. Users can side-load Android package files (APK) with many file managers where TV optimized app is not released in TV play store and many apps can be used with TV remote (but not all). So, Choosing a Smart TV os is purely depends on user preference (when compared with UX, apps availability in their OS and extra features integrated into TV by manufacturers). While buying a Smart TV, go to a retail store and compare each Smart TV OS and check above points. Trust me, it\u2019s not difficult to select right OS for your TV viewing needs. Let me give you an advice if you want to purchase Android based TV. Many mid/low-tier brands are providing android TVs for less price. Be sure to operate those TVs before buying as they may loaded with mobile OS rather than TV OS. Because TV OS and their pre-loaded apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video needs licensing and mobile OS don\u2019t need one. They just make a custom app launcher optimized for TV remote navigation, but apps and app store in that OS is not optimized for TV remote. Further they use cheap hardware (memory modules, storage units, processors) in their TVs and they feel like sluggish and slow when you operate. So, when you purchase Android based TVs, check for it\u2019s configuration for decent amount of Storage/RAM/ good processor and check it\u2019s OS type. ",
