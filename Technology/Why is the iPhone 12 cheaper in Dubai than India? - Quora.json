Soon after the prices were announced, it was clear that purchasing an iPhone 12 Pro from Dubai would not only be cheaper but also help them save some money because of the added 30% tax imposed in India on those phones.

(GST and import duty) You don\u2019t have any kind of import duty for electronics in UAE and sales tax or whatever their equivalent of GST is, is around 5%. (Read some time ago, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed) So obviously it\u2019s going to be cheaper. ",
