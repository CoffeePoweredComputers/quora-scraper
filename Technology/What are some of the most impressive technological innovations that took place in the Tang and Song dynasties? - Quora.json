The soldiers that advanced held this long blade, like a wall.\" - Create large cast iron structureFrom Joseph Needham: \u201cPerhaps the grandest cast iron structure of all was not actually a building. The Empress Wu Zetian had an octagonal cast iron column built, called the \"Celestial Axis Commemorating the Virtue of the Great Zhou Dynasty with Its Myriad Regions\". It was built in 695 AD upon a base of cast iron 51 metres in circumference and 6 metres high. The column itself was 3.6 metres in diameter and rose 32 metres in the air; on top was a\"cloud canopy\" 3 metres high and 9 metres in circumference. On top of this in turn stood four bronze dragons each 3.6 metres high supporting a gilded pearl. We have a record of the amount of metal used in this construction about 1,325 tons.\u201d - Used molten iron on ship to ship combatLouchuan - Wikipedia Description by Joseph Needham: \u201cTower ships (lou chuan); these ships have three decks equipped with bulwarks for the fighting lines, and flags and pennants flying from the masts. There are ports and openings for crossbows and lances [and at the sides there is provided felt leather to protect against fire], while (on the topmost deck) there are trebuchets for hurling stones, set up (in appropriate places). And there are also (arrangements for making) molten iron (for throwing in containers from these catapults). (The whole broadside) gives the appearance of a city wall. In the Jin period the Prancing-Dragon Admiral, Wang Jun, invading Wu, built a great ship 200 paces (1000 ft.) in length, and on it set flying rafters and hanging galleries on which chariots and horses could go. But if [all of a sudden] a violent wind is encountered, (such ships are likely to) get out of human control, so they were judged inconvenient in practice [for warlike action]. But the fleet cannot fail to be furnished with such ships, in order that its overawing might may be perfected.\u201d - Or sophisticated enough to create things that baffle later Song Dynasty scientist and even 19th century European scientist.Chinese magic mirror - Wikipedia These are pretty much opaque bronze mirrors that could let light through as if they are glass.

Gunpowder - Wikipedia The first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred in the 9th century AD during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue (\u592a\u4e0a\u8056\u7956\u91d1\u4e39\u79d8\u8a23) in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Taoist text known as the Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce (\u771f\u5143\u5999\u9053\u8981\u7565). By 1083 the Song court was producing hundreds of thousands of fire arrows for their garrisons. Bombs and the first proto-guns, known as \"fire lances\", became prominent during the 12th century and were used by the Song during the Jin-Song Wars. ",
