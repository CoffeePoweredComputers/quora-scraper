            "answer_text": "Let me tell the features of Lollipop first. Android 5.0 \u201cLollipop\u201d Feature Recap \u2013 The Best New Features    Android 5.0 \u201cLollipop\u201d is without a doubt one of the biggest (if not the) Android releases to date. There are 5,000 new APIs for developers to take advantage of, a brand new design language that will re-shape the way we look at and use apps going forward, and a couple of dozen new forward-facing features that you and I can take advantage of from day one. 1. Do Not Disturb (called \u201cInterruptions\u201d) arrives, plus notification controlsNotification controls and Do Not Disturb mode are huge parts of Android 5.0 \u201cLollipop.\u201d You can now fully control specific apps and when or how they show you information. Couple notification control with a newly introduced Do Not Disturb mode and you have pretty advanced controls over the information that shows up on your device.    2. Tap & Go and specific device restores In Android 5.0 \u201cLollipop,\u201d Google is introducing two new options for restoring your devices \u2013 Tap & Go, and specific device restores. The first, actually works just like it sounds; you tap your old device to your new device and go! With specific device restores, this is Google\u2019s way of letting you decide which specific device you want to restore from, a method that is incredibly handy should you deal with or have owned multiple Android devices. Both are equally great, so we wanted to make sure you understood each.    3. Android Beam becomes way more powerful Back when the Android L preview was first released, we told you how excited we were that Android Beam was now included in the share menu. With Android 5.0 \u201cLollipop\u201d official and up and running on our Nexus 5, we wanted to show you exactly why it is that we are so excited. In short, it makes sharing almost anything (more than just photos and links) in between devices so much easier.    4. Screen Pinning is a thing Our series of Android 5.0 \u201cLollipop\u201d feature highlights (view them all) continues this morning with a look at Screen Pinning, which is a way for you to share a specific screen or app with someone while not giving them full access to your phone. The idea is that you may have something to share on your phone and are considering handing it over to a person with you, but you likely do not want a home or back button press to allow the person you are sharing with to see what else you might be working on.    5. The right to remove bloatware Lollipop comes with a bit of good news on the down low for those of you who could easily do without NFL Mobile and the many other examples of carrier bloatware that find their way onto Android phones.    6. Better battery use Back at Google I/O in June, Google introduced something called Project Volta, which is basically a collection of tweaks and best practices for developers designed to make Android and apps run more efficiently, draining less juice out of a device's battery along the way.Evidence of this effort is visualized for Lollipop users in the form of a new, detailed power usage chart and a battery saver mode that Google says will squeeze an extra ninety minutes or so out of each charge, but there's more going on in the back end with Project Volta, too.   7. Apps get full SD card access You might have noticed starting with Android KitKat that there were some changes to how apps could access different areas of a device's storage, particularly an inserted microSD card. Developers complained about these restrictions, and Google responded in Lollipop by more or less completely opening access to inserted memory cards. This makes it much easier for media-heavy apps to seamlessly store and access photos, video or audio files on a memory card with less hassle.But perhaps most notably, the change also makes it possible for apps to install themselves entirely on the SD card, which should be a nice way of offsetting the fact that ART-friendly apps now take up more space.    So of course A sweet new take on Android  Android 5.0 \u2013 Lollipop is the best. ",
