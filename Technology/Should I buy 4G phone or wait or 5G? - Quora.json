            "answer_text": "The question is that what will you use 5G for.. to be honest alot of the unlimited plans now are successful because people stream alot of data. However, a majority of people use data savers or their provider throttles their speeds to ~3 mbps depending on factors\u2026 and they are STILL fine\u2026 MOST internet apps will work with that speed\u2026 AND what most people don\u2019t think about is that is actually in the range of 3G speeds\u2026. I can see no conceivable reason why 5G is a must , right now OR in the near immediate future\u2026.. now maybe four years from when i\u2019m writing this you \u201cmay\u201d need 5G for some weird reason\u2026 as everyone is streaming VR broadcasts and interactive simulations in 4k or 8k\u2026 but you\u2019ll probably be onto your second or even third phone by then. Hope this helps\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "It all comes down to your requirement and how long you\u2019ll be using the phone. If you\u2019re planning to use the phone for short term then 4G is a better option. If you\u2019re planning to use the phone for long then go checkout the 5G phones you\u2019re interested in. Also check if 5G is available in your area, if not then when is it expected, for example the latest India will get 5G is by 2022 and no sooner. 5G doesn\u2019t have good penetration capabilities, so before using it, it\u2019ll be hard to comment on it. But you\u2019ll be able to use 5G with better speeds compared to 4G but if you\u2019re looking for a significant speed difference then they\u2019ll be hard to get cause of the penetration capabilities. However if the phone you\u2019re interested is only available in 5G then go for it. ",
