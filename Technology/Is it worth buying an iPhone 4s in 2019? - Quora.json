            "answer_text": "No. It makes no sense. Apple isn\u2019t offering any software updates on that. Also please take note - it\u2019s a phone from 2011. You\u2019d have to carry a charger/cable which won\u2019t be available easily. The processor and ram, although was great for its time, and even for the time Apple promised it would be good for - ( 4 odd years) , would in 2019 would not allow you to run too many apps and you\u2019d see a bit of a lag. So let me once again clear it - if you\u2019re already using a 4s. Keep using it till it lasts, because there\u2019s not much you\u2019d get after selling it, and as a phone it may just continue to work. But don\u2019t expect the performance that the latest phone may have to offer. But don\u2019t buy a used/new 4s now. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It is not worth to buy an iPhone 4S in 2019.Apple isn\u2019t offering any software updates on that. iPhone 4S is the phone from 2011. You\u2019d have to carry a charger/cable which won\u2019t be available easily. If we talk about the specifications, the processor and ram, although was enough if we talk about 2011. But, now the heavy apps would make it slow to the utmost level. And of course, taking it around the corner in 2019 would look really strange. So that must be really clear till now that there\u2019s no fun of buying a 4S in 2019. And yes, if you already have that device, use it till it\u2019s last breath. But don\u2019t buy a used/new 4s now. ",
