            "answer_text": "A real world Star Trek in 6 main stages: Here what would happen when the different Star Trek incarnations would be used as the basis of this technology scenario, here sorted by the in universe historical and not the production order of all six canonical star trek series and the first ten movies: A Star Trek ENT world with actual humans: The humanity guided by the Vulcans having lost much of the early 21st technology.We would lose the Internet and would be reduced to separate on ship intranets, all the social media, modern computer games, online streaming TV, most ground vehicles.We would gain shuttle-crafts, relatively casual interstellar space flight, energy shielding and instantaneous teleportation on shorter ranges.All online streaming services like Netflix or so would go bankrupt or revert to the previously held business like delivering VHS tapes or some memory disks for movies.Due to some miss-interpretations between the Vulcans and the Earthers a Vulcan-Earth conflict would emerge and the humans happily would ally themselves with the Andorians.Interstellar space tourism still is in its infancy.Computers are starting to become interconnected again and forming some primitive computer networks again.The early development of artificial intelligences emerges.Genetic augmentation still is frowned upon but some shady corporations are illegally doing that anyway.The Klingons, learning from that and fearing superior humans starts to experiment to thus making them appear more human.The Terra Prime movement will briefly become the new government of Earth during the Earth-Xindi war and managing to enact a retailatory war of atrocities and attrition towards the Xindi thus fully destroying their homeworld in a self fulfilling prophecy thing as envisioned by the sphere builders.At the end of these four years the United Earth Nations Organization starts to build up its interstellar empire after fully establishing the UEN-Navy.A Star Trek DIS world with actual humans: Interstellar tourism to the neighboring solar systems would flourish. \u201cSee the blue sunset on Mars\u201d, \u201cCome and experience the swirls at the Jovian south pole\u201d, \u201cSee the Heart of Pluto\u201d, \u201cVisit the red day of Proxima Centauri\u201d, \u201cDelve into the endless ocean of Kepler 22b\u201d, \u201cSee the rich fauna and flora of Kepler186f.\u201d, Risa would have some heavy competition.Artificial intelligences are a great thing, tactile volumetric displays are the norm on more experimental ships as well as the vessels of the Earth National Security Agency ENSA.Still unsatisfied with the results of their genetical engineering about 90 years ago, the Klingons repeat their experimentation albeit with a more reptilian race and due to repeated old mistakes they alter their appearance again.After the suicidal attacks by some Klingon houses during the Earth-Klingon War, the Earths Islamic fundamentalists and Christian ones would enact similar suicide missions. One could destroy the government center of the Klingons.Mirror Philippa Georgiou would have become the leader of a right wing Earth nationalist movement, the successor of the older Terra-Prime movement and involved in the activities of the ENSA after the United Earth Nations agreed on her plan to destroy the original Klingon homeworld.According with the laws against traitors, Spock would have been sentenced to death after the alleged attack on UENN personnel.The remaining Xindi would have no other choice as to accept a mandate regime by the UEN-Department of Foreign Relationships.A Star Trek TOS world with real humans: Most medical conditions would be healed.Religious zealots like Islamic and Christian fundamentalists would try to convert as much aliens as possibly to their religions.A prime directive wouldn\u2019t exist.Large companies would exploit alien planets after the UEN fully recovered from the losses in the Earth-Klingon War.The humanity would become a middle thing between the main timelines Federation and the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire.And Klingons, Romulans, Tellarites, Andorians, Vulcans and Gorns would learn that humans can be the most villainous species out there.The more reptilian looking Klingons are slowly dying out and the more human looking ones survives by remaining fertile.At the same time they would encounter caring humans with large scale welfare organizations and a lot of internal power struggles between the human tribalistic elements.Al these extremely contradictory elements in the human nature would be the horror for the logic seeking Vulcans who would flee the human interstellar nation in droves and retreat to Vulcan. The Logic Extremists which emerged ten years earlier would gain the power over Vulcan and enact an isolationist epoch. Half humans like Spock would be exiled from Vulcan.After the first contact with this space-Roman world, the Earths and Rome-World media happily would join their forces to create a galaxy wide transmitted gladiatorial and race games shows and some of these space-Romans officers would be invited to teach the Earth forces how to create an even more stable military.A slightly older Mirror Philippa Georgiou learns from the arrival of Mirror Kirk, intercept the Enterprise and convince mirror Kirk that she once was the Terran Emperor. Mirror Kirk becomes her most loyal right hand. Original Kirk remains stranded in the Mirror Universe. Mirror Philippa Georgiou forces the indigenous to sell the UEN the needed raw materials.After the Earth Klingon war ten years ago, the weakened Klingons are still struggling in rebuilding their once proud civilization.The first movies: By using some large and highly covered \u201ctrojan horses\u201d, ships filled up to the brim with the newest generation of photon torpedos, the UEN-Navy manages to destroy the V\u2019ger space probe. In the aftermath, the psurfaces of Earth, Mars and the colonized moons needed to be at least partially rebuilt.Mirror Kirk, commanding the refurbished UENN Discovery, manages to defeat the Klingon attackers on his son.Spock, who gained some respect by mirror Philippa Georgiou especially in the final operations around the Red Angel and the avoided time paradox had been appointed captain of the UENN Enterprise. Mirror Philippa Georgiou now has become the UEN-Secretary of Defense.During the Genesis crisis the Klingons unsuccessfully protests against the planet generation apparatus.During an attack of an extraterrestrial space probe who looked out for whales the UEN-Navy resorts to a large scale of suicide attacks by a larger number of (in)voluntary UEN-Navy soldiers.After some shady operations by Earths secret intelligence the Klingons were thrown into a civil war weakening them again. The newly founded New Klingon Empire makes an alliance with Romulus.A Star Trek TNG world with real humans: We would gain the Holodecks.We would regain a bit of the old internet and a few limited elements of social media and smartphones in the beginning of this epoch.The big corporations successfully lobbied against the civilian use of replicators thus limiting them to military vessels.The UEN fully ignores the treaty with the Romulans to not to develop cloaking devices for UEN-Navy ships.Data would be mass produced and made an android race of slave laborers. The original one would land dismantled in a forgotten archive.Deana Troy would be the ships chaplain of a interfaith variant of Christianity accompanied by a Muslim Imam, a Hindu priest, A Jewish Rabbi, a Buddhist priest instead of the counselor since religion despite all the technological and scientific advances never would have disappeared.Klingons, Trill, Betazoids, Vulcans, Cardassians, Bajorans, Packleds, Andorians, Tellarites and the remaining Xindi would have to bring their own religious leaders with them since the UEN-Navy isn\u2019t here to accommodate their needs. The human first approach in this military organization is one of the driving forces of this world.Humanity would have erected an unstable interstellar empire with some wars at its borders and a lot of civil unrests, tribalism among the mankind and some briefly sparking civil wars. Humanity only unites against larger enemies like the Romulans, Klingons, Borg.Initially, Q had a bit of interest in the mankind but safe for the morally principled Jean-Luc Picard and his Enterprise D crew the general mankind is not of interest to him since he already witnessed too many similar civilizations in thousands of galaxies.A small sect was founded by some humans worshipping Q and the Q-continuum as real living gods. Q, initially a bit flattered about that decides to play with them a bit and leaving this sect.Perhaps the Ferengi would become a good trading partner for the most shady human corporations after a rough start.Social Justice Warriors would try to claim Klingon and Romulan cultural elements to make some rebellious statements towards the ruling elite of mankind. Statements like \u201cKnow your human privilege\u201d will pop up.Actual Klingons would be mad at these SJWs for portraying them as a victimized culture and this would spark another Human-Klingon conflict with the fully restored Klingon Empire under New Qo\u2019noS.Here, the Klingons finally managed to get their old original appearance prior to their first genetic augmentation experiments back and reemerges as a force to be reckoned with.Peace demonstrations everywhere.Former paradises like Kepler 186f would be fully exploited and many animals already extinct due to human industries.A new age group would have claimed Kepler22b and would have built large peaceful sub-maritime floating cities.Genetic augmentation would be a thing again.The encounter with the Borg would spark a counter transhumanist movement and the accelerated re-development of the internet and all its abilities as it was in the early 21st century.The descendants of Mirror Philippa Georgiou and Mirror Kirk who married founded a smaller other human state, the Imperium-Terranum-Nova in a more remote area of the galaxy.At the end of this epoch, internet and social media have fully returned. Many humans now are creating new meme sites like the restored 9gag.com.The human porn industry would have its field century by exploring every more or less pervert sexual relationships, real life hentai, furry porn the Betazoids due to their laizer faire approach could be used as porn actors and actresses.Since the humans rediscovered their experimental mid set regarding music and arts much more diverse genres than just Jazz and European classic is being played. Picard, regarding this music as just noise is seen a relict of the narrow minded past.Another Movie: Soran, an El-Aurian terrorist tries to make use of the Nexus to gain an immortal life. This gets thwarted by Picard who mets the original timeline Kirk who himself managed to get into the Nexus as a means of transport to return to the original timeline.The UEN tries to gain the defensive power against the Q as shown by some members of Guinans species, the El-Aurians after the paranormal powers of this species became more known after Sorans failed attempt to get into the Nexus.A Star Trek DS9 world with actual humans: Thanks to a cooperation between the United Earths Nations Interstellar Republic and its UEN-Navy and the Cardassians, the resistance of the Bajoran rebels would have been crushed and the UEN-Cardassian-Ferengi Alliance would explore the Beta Quadrant.Technology wise no changing albeit the genetical augmentation would become even more hyped. For instance Dr. Julian Bashir would be a hero for the large pro-Augmentation front.The UEN-Navy will make use of genetically enhanced super soldiers.In the war with the Dominion the Earth-Cardassian-Ferengi-Alliance enhanced by some Romulan groups and the Breen would achieve a narrow victory over the Dominion.The UEN-Navy starts to experiment with the old experimental Spor-Drive once developed for the UEN-Discovery again to be independent from the Bajoran wormhole.The old UENN-Discovery was rediscovered on a forgotten space junkyard in the VW-Canis Majoris sector.During the Dominion war, Earths religions would partially fall back to fundamentalist stances and Islamic Jihadist as well as Christian Terrorists would carry out some suicide missions against the Vorta and Jem Hadar bases thus earning the respect of some Klingon houses which starts to advocate for the Klingons to join the Earth-Cardassian-Ferengi-Breen alliance.The Imperium-Terranum-Nova provides some of the newly developed battle robots, skeletal metallic looking beings with a skull with teeth deliberately made looking nightmarish to frighten the enemies.Large earth and earth colonies based interstellar corporations would start to explore the non Dominion controlled space of the Beta Quadrant and gain a lot of new land to colonize for corporate lead new human states.In aftermath of the Dominion war, the weakened UEN had to accept the independence of the new corporate lead human states in the Beta Quadrant. At the same time, the UEN starts to militarize the human civilization even more.The Imperium-Terranum-Nova destroys the whole species of changelings who founded the Dominion in an preemptive strike.Seeing the humans as too dangerous, the wormhole beings once and for all closes this connection between both quadrants after some more years.After the perfectioning of the Spor-drive the UEN-Navy becomes independent from the wormhole and discovers that the Imperium-Terranum-Nova did it already some years earlier.A Star Trek VOY world with actual humans: The crew of the UENN-Voyager lead by UN-captain Janeway and her first officer from the new Disney-Shell-Samsung consortium military forces would create a scripted reality action show back home on the interactive TV-screens and start to explore how to exploit the Delta Quadrant.Contrary to the canon Star Trek philosophy Janeway won\u2019t object against the usage of quantum space beings as fuel for the warp core.The humans would be more ruthless but perhaps they would accept Neelix as a comical relief and the token minority clown aboard of the UENN-Voyager. His relationship with Kes would be the family friendly part of this show.Later, Kes, disgruntled with her role would leave the UENN-Voyager leaving a lone Neelix behind who will be drugged a bit to keep him happy.After some years in the Delta Quadrant, the UENN-Voyager gets brought back home by a Spor-Drive operated larger UENN-Terra, a dreadnaught Galaxy class warship. The Voyager has finished its mission as planned.The UEN starts to establish some human outposts and thanks to the perfectioned spor-drive the whole galaxy had been opened up for mankind.To prevent the Borg from traveling large distances in a short time the UEN-Navy destroys large parts of the Borg-Transwarp Network. Due to their collectivist nature, the Borg are unable to operate the Spor-Drive.The remaining movies: Thanks to the elite status of Picards crew and the otherwise great commanding capabilties of this UEN-Navy captain the humans managed to defeat the Borg and correct the fiddling with the timeline by the Borg.In the conflict between the Ba\u2019ku and Son\u2019a the UEN-Navy sticks to the alliance with the Son\u2019a and tries to max out the Earths profit in gaining a kind of immortality.In the Earth-Romulan conflict around Pretor Shinzon vs. Picard the UEN-Navy and the Earth National Security Agency adopts the Thalaron-weapon.Conclusion: Such a world would be much more cynical than the idealistic representation of humanity in the whole Star Trek universe in its already six canonical series and movies. A free market economy among the humans never would cease, the humans would be more militaristic and war like, religious fundamentalism and nationalistic and extremist leftists ideologies won\u2019t die out and produce new stuff for new conflicts in a world with Star Trek technology according to which of these series you want to have as the basis for this scenario. Update: Reordered the series according to the in universe history and not the production history. Added some details. Added the movies. ",
