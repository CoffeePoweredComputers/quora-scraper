            "answer_text": "How is the Poco M2 Pro smartphone and what is it worth? Poco, the sub-brand of Redmi has launched a new mid-range smartphone which is known as Poco M2 Pro and something that you would not like to know is that Poco M2 Pro is an exact copy of Redmi Note 9 Pro and starts at 14k in India. It has similar major features with the similar Snapdragon 720G processor and Poco ensured that they save all the effort this time by rebranding the Redmi Note 9 Pro smartphone. Do you think this is justified in the market? Well, I think this is yet another addition to the list of trash smartphones. Had Poco made some effort by putting in a processor like MediaTek Helio G90T or at least MediaTek Helio G85 which are far better, it would have been considered a good option. However, Poco just removed the stickers and back cover of Redmi Note 9 Pro smartphone and placed its own, thinking that they would be able to fool people. However, people are smart enough to know what is good and what goes rebranded. So this one by Poco would again be a great disappointment like the Poco X2 smartphone.  ",

Getting into details..,, I bought 6gb RAM and 64 gb storage variant of black color variant. The Fingerprint sensor placed towards the right side of the screen seems stylish and easily accessible with your thumb for unlocking. The sensor feedback is also prompt without any noticeable delay.With the processor named Snapdragon 720G, it's performance is great especially if you are a gamer \ud83c\udfae.The display comes with IPS LCD with 60 Hz refresh rate giving you a wonderful on screen experience.The 5000 mAH battery \ud83d\udd0bis another expected feature that poco has incorporated with in this model. It comes with a 33W fast charger taking time of 1 hr to charge from 10 to 100%.The Camera \ud83d\udcf7 is worth it. I have attached a photo I have taken with this phone below. (It is me\ud83d\ude0a) Overall, if you are looking for a smartphone with the above mentioned features and are ok with a Chinese branded smartphone, then do not wait for it, just go for it. ",
