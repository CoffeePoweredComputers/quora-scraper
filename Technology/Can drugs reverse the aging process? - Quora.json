            "answer_text": "Thanks for the great question. Many drugs slow the aging process, but you ask about reversing it. Telomeres effect the number of replications a cell can go through. it is possible that things that lengthen telomeres could create more cell replications, and restoring telomere length to that of a teenager could reverse, if not aging, the amount of time left until cellular death. There are many things that lengthen telomeres. Among them vitamin D, \u201cIn a more generalized study, vitamin D supplementation in a group of overweight Americans, at a dose of 2000 IU/day, increased subjects\u2019 telomerase activity by more than 19%. This finding suggests that vitamin D plays an important role in supporting telomere lengthening and as a result has antiaging potential.\u201d Prevent Telomere Shortening Aside from various vitamins (C and E are also mentioned as lengthening telomeres) there are drugs under active research that lengthen telomeres like RNA TERT, \u201cIn their study, the researchers explain that introducing as few as three applications of the modified RNA (called modified TERT mRNA) to human cells over a few days increased telomere length by up to 10%. Young humans possess telomeres that are around 8,000-10,000 nucleotides long, the team notes, but the modified TERT-encoding RNA increased telomere length by around 1,000 nucleotides.\u201d Scientists find way to increase length of human telomeres Also, you can find other things by thinking of something you hear there is less of in senescent organism and then looking up things that promote their production like elastin and collagen. Stem cells that differentiate and turn into mature new cells when injected into tissue could approximate age reversal as they swap out old tissue for younger new tissue. As far as something you did not ask, how can aging be slowed, or longevity increased, you can look up the drugs metformin as well as deprenyl which cause mice to live longer. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a wonderful new way of thinking about aging. Can we see aging as a decease indeed!? We connect aging with getting all different aches and pains, reduced hearing, worsened eyesight, slowed reactions, lack of energy but is aging an illness itself? If you look at it that way, it opens new possible developments in science. A drug called Metformin, usually used by Diabetic patients, had been already tested on few thousands patients to see how it reflects on their aging. Some studies have been published already: Of course more research is needed. \u201d Metformin in Longevity Study,\u201d or MILES, was completed and Published in 2017. Barzilai, an Israeli doctor scientist, is confident the drug has a beneficial effect on the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Researchers have been working on a series of smaller, faster studies designed to show how the drug interacts with pathways known to be associated with aging. Apparently there are some more drugs which might be promoting healthy aging! Isn\u2019t that great?! When I first read about the concept I exclaimed! \u2018Finally someone thinks like me\u2019 Being 80 doesn\u2019t mean you have to die\u2019 You should expect to live a better and longer life while still healthy!
