            "answer_text": "Very good fundamental question. PSU s are supposed to be commercial establishments mandated to achieve \u201ccommanding heights\" by Jawaharlal Nehru and controlled by the ever expanding beaurocracy and exploited by the netas as their personal fiefdom. Though the intent was very laudable - serving the people of India with all types of best goods and services at the most economic prices without any profiteering involved. The reality is they are used as vote bank generating instruments and control levers of beaurocracy forgetting the fact they need to generate sufficient profits to sustain themselves as viable entities. As early as the sixties, Nani Palkhivala and Sharu Rangnekar two eminent management experts of the time coined expression of \u201ctyranny of the beaurocracy\u201d which depicted the power/control/discretionary mindset of the IAS. No wonder they forgot that they were running business enterprises but thought were running the department's of the government wherein everything was ordered to be through circulars and file notings . Result : inefficient, spendthrifts of tax money . No accountability as they were apparently fulfilling public needs . These were excellent recipes for failure . That lead to their protecting themselves from punishment for failure . Result: profligacy, loss of business objectives . Final result is loss making money guzzling PSUs. ",
