            "answer_text": "Any job that is Not-predictable and non repetitive in nature, be it Manual or Cognitive, can never be overtaken by technology. There are field where technology cannot replace human jobs, well\u2026 at least in the near future. Few such jobs are : Creativity : Creative writing, drawing, Artwork, Music etc etc. There can be technology that can aid in the creation of finest Artwork or Music. But it cannot replace the required human effort or the feeling and emotion to create it.Professions that require human intelligence and knowledge. Technology may help you in creating the safest healthcare equipment that can provide you accurate data / information related to your illness/body/disease. But the decision needs to be taken by a human, how to treat the disease and the patient. Technology can never acquire feelings like love and compassion. There can never be a standard treatment of same disease/ illness for different patients.A computer cannot take decision if there is a bomb threat or hostage situation in an aeroplane you are flying. THere has to be human intervention to bring you out of that situation. 3. You can not depend on a Robot for nursing and treating a mentally ill patient. 4. There can be technology aided learning, but it cannot replace the teacher. There can be e-teaching and e-learning materials but for that to exist, some one needs to create it first. For subjects like Arts, Humanities and others which are not as objective as Science or Maths would need a human teacher to explain things and make you understand it. 5. Jobs that require Complex decision \u2026. like the President or Prime Minister of a country. Or the Mayor or the CEO of an organisation. 6. Social Workers : People who can feel he pain others are going through and lend a helping help. A robot or a computer will never be able to feel it and render its service in such social causes. It may assist, but someone needs to take the decision what to do and put them into work. ",
