            "answer_text": "Just like any other social media TikTok collects user\u2019s data. A clue to what information a website gathers can always be found in their Privacy Policy. So here is what TikTok collects: Information from the user's account on the platform like name, profile information and imageInformation the user shares with TikTok from third-party social network providers, technical and behavioral information about the use of the platformInformation contained in the messages sent through the platformInformation from the phone book on your mobile device and your social network contactsThere is also some additional information that users provide when they register, upload content to the Platform, or contact customer service. For example: Registration information like age, username and password, language and email/phone numberComments, photographs, videos, and virtual item videos uploaded on the PlatformPayment informationIn addition, the platform collects information like IP address, geolocation-related data, unique device identifiers, browsing and search history and cookies. To sum up, it may seem scary that so much information is gathered by a social media app, but frankly, that refers to any social network that we commonly use. ",
