            "answer_text": "No. Honestly, there is less of a chance the Mark I will be built in any form. Considering it only uses steel plating as defense yet somehow blocks .50 cal bullets, as well as the fact it can embed itself into a stone wall hard enough it can\u2019t yank it out yet was built out of scrap parts.  Look, I am a bigger Iron Man fan than anyone I know, but the reality is that no armor will ever exist that is like it. At least not in our lifetime. The biggest issue, as I always say in these answers, is the arc reactor. A near-limitless power source contained in the palm of your hand? Not likely until you achieve antimatter power, and even then, I highly doubt you can miniaturize that sort of power in that small a package. And it still requires fuel of some kind. Strength enhancement is another big hurdle. Modern exoskeletons can barely hold their own weight. Most people who have them still have canes to walk with.  These of course are only the commercial grade ones. They are more meant to support the body and act as a solid force to press against rather than an independently moving entity.  Then you have the in-progress military versions  While they do move as an extra part of the body, it requires a human driver to stand up on its own. It also doesn\u2019t increase human strength as much as it should relative to its weight. It weighs nearly 100lbs, yet doesn\u2019t even double a person\u2019s strength. There\u2019s also the weight to take into account. Everywhere these examples are shown are a) near a power source to recharge or be tethered to, and b) are standing on concrete. Imagine taking a 300 lbs. person out into rocky or marshy terrain.  That wouldn\u2019t be good. These suits have to be made lighter yet tougher in order to be put into a combat oriented environment. Otherwise, they will remain useless due to the ground they are working on simply can\u2019t hold them up. So yeah, at least as-is in the movie Iron Man, the Mark I will not exist in the real world. We might get something similar, but nothing will ever perfectly match the armored Avenger.  Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Taken from popular contemporary film, the mark one was effectively a huge steel body suit with a flame thrower and motor assisted movement. Is that possible? Sure. Definitely. It would be expensive as hell, wouldn't move very much faster than a normal person, if it malfunctions the pilot will die, one way or another, well-placed bullets would still eventually destroy it, a single tank shell would do the trick, or just running it over with a tank. It could be done, but it would be useless and cost WAY WAY WAY too much. ",
