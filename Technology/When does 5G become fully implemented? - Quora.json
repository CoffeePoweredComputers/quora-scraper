            "answer_text": " Image: Credit For the past few years, people have heard rumors about the development of a fifth-generation network. The network which is commercialized and data-oriented was adopted in 2018 and is awaiting some few guidelines to be marketed. Now the system is ready and is waiting to be implemented in all regions to start experiencing its connectivity. However, in some countries, through the help of companies collaborating, they have been able to achieve and deploy it. The generation is said to be implemented d in five different option as articulated by patent leader\u2019s taskforce. The patent leaders who it was through their relentless contribution and hard work made the technology a success are said to implement it before mid-2020 in many states in the globe.However, its implementation is being delayed due to several challenges facing its ability to produce harmful electromagnetic radiation, which poses a high health risk.  Hope this explanation help! OKportal Technology ",

This is for several reasons: Some feature sets are mutually exclusive.The feature set will continue to expand, with new 3GPP releases.Some mobile network operators will choose to not implement some features.The rollout schedule of new telecom systems varies radically around the world.",
