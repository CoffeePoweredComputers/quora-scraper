            "answer_text": "Well, I won't say it has any positive impact but we can atleast try to see brighter things in this darkness of Pandemic. I will share something. *Beautiful message from Bill Gates* Subject: *What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us?* I\u2019m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad. As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us: 1) It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should too. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Tom Hanks. 2) It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another. It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport. It is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression. 3) It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals. If we don\u2019t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick. 4) It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick. Our purpose is not to buy toilet rolls. 5) It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it\u2019s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to. 6) It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this. It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit. 7) It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. 8) It is reminding us to keep our egos in check. It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are, a virus can bring our world to a standstill. 9) It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands. We can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after only our self. Indeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colors. 10) It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic. We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good. 11) It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning. This can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to. 12) It is reminding us that this Earth is sick. It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick. 13) It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease. Life is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass. 14) Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a *great corrector* It is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.

            "answer_text": "We have a bunch of answers talking about nature restoration and pollution levels. But let me tell you, this makes me only more anxious, and doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. You know why? Because the day this Covid-19 problem is solved, we will go back to the same circus again. Except this time we know what an impact we are creating on our surroundings on a daily basis. Yes, pollution is low now, but it won\u2019t be when things sttart again. The view of this short, temporary relief only worries me more about what we are doing to our environment on a regular basis. To put it in a different way \u2014 things have improved so much within a month of this lockdown. Can you imagine the amount of shit we have been throwing at nature for the past few decades!? Anyway, coming to the positive impacts. Now, I am not sure that this is a positive impact yet, but there is certainly potential - People have begun to value family, and time. People have begun to value the basic necessities in life more than material. For over a month, people haven\u2019t been able to go out to eat, or shop, or travel, or attach themselves too much to material things. All they have to chase is family, and time. Humans, for the first time in years, have come down to live with the basics \u2014 food and water, learning to cook, learning to do things yourself because you can\u2019t be dependent on others. Finally, in this fast paced world, we have time and we\u2019re able to connect with old friends, family, spend quality time with them and really live life outside of the bubble that we have created. Finally, we can see clearly that the economy is volatile, work is a way to spend time, but there is so much more to life. We can learn new things, and most importantly, we can think. About our past, about our future, about our mistakes and everything else. We have the one thing we never had in a while \u2014 time to think! And now we can. We can reorganise our lives, reassess our priorities, and learn to connect to the world and the people around us instead of chasing that amazon wishlist or that pair of boots. Now is the time we\u2019re finally using technology for what it was meant for! To connect with people when we can\u2019t physically be with them. We finally realise that some things in life are more important than \u201cwork\u201d or \u201ccareer\u201d or \u201cmoney\u201d. Having enough supplies to last the month, and having enough skills to be able to manage your own life are all what we need. Everything else is extra. Let\u2019s not get carried away by extra. ",
