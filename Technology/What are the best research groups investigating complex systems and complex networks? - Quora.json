            "answer_text": "Besides Santa Fe, there are excellent complexity programs at U. Michigan and Cornell, and something called the New England Complexity Research Institute. http://necsi.edu But really, it is less of a discrete community today than a set of techniques and research approaches that have spread all over STEM academia. You can learn and do \"complexity flavored\" work just about anywhere today. The field was a temporary fork that has now re-merged into the mainstream. The descendant influence is most evident today in fields like machine learning, mathematical sociology, social data analysis, systems biology, distributed AI, distributed control, UAV research, driverless cars, formation flight, behavioral finance etc. The field itself is really a historical field now. I'd say it peaked as an independent field with the complex networks work on 1997-2003 (Barabasi, Watts etc.) and has produced no comparable body of big ideas since.  I'd say the decline was mainly driven by availability of huge data sets. It became more interesting to look at the data and model what it actually revealed than explore theories based on the characteristic \"simple models can yield complex behavior\" aesthetic of classic complexity research.  In other words, our attention shifted from \"toy\" complexity in simulations to the real thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I was fascinated to read comments here and elsewhere about investigating complex system and complexity is an historical field and that is attributed to have large data sets. Having large data sets and tools to analyze them has not made the understanding of why things occur they way they do and more importantly the unintended consequences that are usually pain points for someone or society. The vast problems that data analytics will not solve is getting to root causes, variances and latitude of decision and subsequent consequences. There are a stunning number of mathematical, physical and computer science problems that unless solved will prohibit advances in AI, machine learning, block chain technology, bio-pharma innovations, etc. To dismiss the study of complexity would be a mistake and truly be a set back of not finding methods, tools and even a language for greater precision. Sometimes self-driving cars, AI and machine-learning are taken as a granted. We may find that it be either so ridiculously expensive to maintain or even riddled with an unsurmountable problems that it may never be fully realised. ",
