            "answer_text": "Nowadays, brands desperately want WhatsApp Bulk Message feature to promote exciting offers, an announcement to their customers. If WhatsApp allows, it can be a game-changing feature. But as WhatsApp is with the motive of personalized conversation app and doesn't want your inbox spammed with promotional messages, it's currently restricted. You can read on WhatsApp FAQs as well.  Let me explain why it is not helpful for brands to promote via Bulk WhatsApp for now. Third-party WhatsApp Bulk Sender service providers are sending messages via virtual numbers or any random numbers. At end-user, it looks like someone unknown sent message and generally people block that number.Once multiple contacts block that number, it will be blocked immediately. End-user can not contact back, so it is like one-way communication.You have never seen a well-known brand which sent such promotional messages on WhatsApp as marketers/people will count under cheap marketing tactics.You will not get the detailed statistics, and those platforms will show you just the numbers. [Ex. 10k Sent] A good marketer will never suggest doing Bulk WhatsApp Marketing until he wants to make some good money from your campaign. :DWhatsApp is not for pushing bulk messages, for that you should try email marketing. Now if you still want to do marketing on WhatsApp, then you should think on below things. Do One to One marketing Contact your friends, family, or business people on WhatsApp by sending them a message individually or via a broadcast list.Send a personalized message When you receive the message with your name on WhatsApp even from an unknown number, it will make us alert, and we carefully read that message.Assign tags/labelsWhatsApp Business app provides a feature to assign tags to contact. And you can filter those contacts with the tag.With these features, you can manage your business on WhatsApp. Still, if you are looking for some advanced features like CRM, then you should check this WhatsHash which is first ever WhatsApp CRM.  WhatsHash have features like - Quick Replies, - Tags to User/Media/Messages - Save WhatsApp Chats - Save Media Files [Image, Video, Audio] - Export Contacts of WhatsApp, Groups and Broadcast Lists to Excel - User/Customer Profile with Overview, Conversations, and Media, - Send a message to Number without saving in mobile - Sales Funnel - Auto Sync Chat - Personalized Quick Replies - Groups & Broadcast Lists support - Powerful Cloud-based Admin Panel And many more Hit Upvote, if this answer helped.

            "answer_text": "When it comes to social media, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter will come to our mind first. But as far as users are concerned, the messenger apps have actually caught up with social networks. More and more messenger applications are being used for marketing. WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion active users a month worldwide, is already ahead of most messenger apps. This is really one of the best marketing options for the messenger app. WhatsApp loves its users, and it doesn't allow spam to interfere with them, so this puts a limit on sending a large number of messages. But that's not enough to stop us from moving on to WhatsApp marketing. Because we have the help of bulk messages sender software-WAppSenderPro. It can help us break through the limit of the number of messages and contacts. WhatsApp has a limit on the number of users' contacts. With this software, you can send text messages to people who are not saved in your contact list. One of my favorite features is that I can get all WhatsApp numbers similar to my niche market from anywhere on the Internet. You can also schedule messages, and with this software, you can send messages to the right people at the right time. Following are the simple steps to send bulk SMS using WAppssenderPro: First of all, you need to add the accounts which you are going to use to send bulk mmessages. And add the contacts too, the order of adding accounts and contacts is irrelevant.  Secondly, set the send task. Multi-media messages like emoji, text, image, audio, video, link, pdf, word document, ppt, file document ... all types of files are available. You can also use the spin function to make your message unique.  Finally, start the task. After confirmation (scan QR code), the message will be sent to all your contacts automatically.  ",
