            "answer_text": "N 1971 a small company called Intel released the 4004, its first ever microprocessor. The chip, measuring 12 square millimetres, contained 2,300 transistors\u2014tiny electrical switches representing the 1s and 0s that are the basic language of computers. The gap between each transistor was 10,000 nanometres (billionths of a metre) in size, about as big as a red blood cell. The result was a miracle of miniaturisation, but still on something close to a human scale. The transistors on the Skylake chips Intel makes today would flummox any such inspection. The chips themselves are ten times the size of the 4004, but at a spacing of just 14 nanometres (nm) their transistors are invisible, for they are far smaller than the wavelengths of light human eyes and microscopes use. If the 4004\u2019s transistors were blown up to the height of a person, the Skylake devices would be the size of an ant. t is also a difference capable of easy mathematical quantification. In 1965 Gordon Moore, who would later become one of the founders of Intel, a chipmaker, wrote a paper noting that the number of electronic components which could be crammed into an integrated circuit was doubling every year. This exponential increase came to be known as Moore\u2019s law. In the 1970s the rate of doubling was reduced to once every two years. Even so, you would have had to be very brave to look at one of Intel\u2019s 4004s in 1971 and believe that such a law would continue to hold for 44 years. After all, double something 22 times and you have 4m times more of it, or perhaps something 4m times better. But that is indeed what has happened. Intel does not publish transistor counts for its Skylake chips, but whereas the 4004 had 2,300 of them, the company\u2019s Xeon Haswell E-5, launched in 2014, sports over 5 billion, just 22 nm apart.   Increasing resistivity of copper with scaling and rising demands on current density requirements are driving the need to identify new wiring solutions for deep nanometer scale VLSI technologies. Metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising candidates that can potentially address the challenges faced by copper and thereby extend the lifetime of electrical interconnects.  The quantum computers of the future will be able to perform computations that cannot be done on today's computers. These may likely include the ability to crack the encryption that is currently used for secure electronic transactions, as well as the means to efficiently solve unwieldy problems in which the number of possible solutions increases exponentially. Research in the quantum optics lab of Prof. Barak Dayan in the Weizmann Institute of Science may be bringing the development of such computers one step closer by providing the \"quantum gates\" that are required for communication within and between such quantum computers. In contrast with today's electronic bits that can only exist in one of two states\u2014zero or one\u2014quantum bits known as qubits can also be in states that correspond to both zero and one at the same time. This is called quantum superposition, and it gives qubits an edge as a computer made of them could perform numerous computations in parallel. There is just one catch: The state of quantum superposition state can exist only as long as it is not observed or measured in any way by the outside world; otherwise all the possible states collapse into a single one. This leads to contradicting requirements: For the qubits to exist in several states at once they need to be well isolated, yet at the same time they need to interact and communicate with many other qubits. That is why, although several labs and companies around the world have already demonstrated small-scale quantum computers with a few dozen qubits, the challenge of scaling up these to the desired scale of millions of qubits remains a major scientific and technological hurdle. One promising solution is using isolated modules with small, manageable numbers of qubits, which can communicate between them when needed with optical links. The information stored in a material qubit (e.g. a single atom or ion) would then be transferred to a \"flying qubit\u2014a single particle of light called a photon. This photon can be sent through optical fibers to a distant material qubit and transfer its information without letting the environment sense the nature of that information. The challenge in creating such a system is that single photons carry extremely small amounts of energy, and the minuscule systems comprising material qubits generally do not interact strongly with such weak light. Dayan's quantum optics lab in the Weizmann Institute of Science is one of the few groups worldwide that are focused entirely on attacking this scientific challenge. Their experimental setup has single atoms coupled to unique micron-scale silica resonators on chips; and photons are sent directly to these through special optical fibers. In previous experiments Dayan and his group had demonstrated the ability of their system to function as a single-photon activated switch, and also a way to \"pluck\" a single photon from a flash of light. In the present study, reported in Nature Physics, Dayan and his team succeeded\u2014for the first time\u2014to create a logic gate in which a photon and an atom automatically exchange the information they carry. \"The photon carries one qubit, and the atom is a second qubit,\" says Dayan. \"Each time the photon and the atom meet they exchange the qubits between them automatically and simultaneously, and the photon then continues on its way with the new bit of information. In quantum mechanics, in which information cannot be copied or erased, this swapping of information is in fact the basic unit of reading and writing\u2014the \"native\" gate of quantum communication.\" This type of logic gate\u2014a SWAP gate\u2014can be used to exchange qubits both within and between quantum computers. As this gate needs no external control fields or management system, it can enable the construction of the quantum equivalent of very large-scale integration (VLSI) networks. \"The SWAP gate we demonstrated is applicable to photonic communication between all types of matter-based qubits\u2014not only atoms,\" says Dayan. \"We therefore believe that it will become an essential building-block in the next generation of quantum computing systems.\" More information: Orel Bechler et al, A passive photon\u2013atom qubit swap operation, Nature Physics (2018).

            "answer_text": "Hi, Small, smaller, smallest. Where will it stop, 3nm is already coming in 2021, that's right next year. And we know that AMD is pursuing 5nm already, And also some of Projects in Big Giant like QC and Samsung Has been providing good yield with 5nm/7nm/14nm/16nm . Now as we know A technology node is denoted by channel Length of FET and The process node used by a foundry relates to the number of transistors that fit inside a specified space, such as a square mm. For example, the transistor density of the chips currently produced using the 7nm process (such as Apple's A13 Bionic, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform, and Huawei's Kirin 990 5G chipset) is approximately 100 million transistors per square mm. That allows Apple to stuff 8.5 billion transistors into each A13 Bionic SoC. The new 5nm chips rolling off the assembly line this year will have 171.3 million transistors per square mm which will allow the 5nm A14 Bionic to contain 15 billion transistors inside. Performance of the new chips will increase 10-15% while energy consumption will decline by 25%-30%. The transistor density of chips keeps going up as the process node goes down , Right now, TSMC and Samsung are racing to complete facilities to produce 3nm chips. TSMC's 3nm chips will deliver a 5% performance boost while consuming 15% less energy. And the transistor density will rise by 1.7 to just shy of 300 million transistors per square mm. Amazing. TSMC is expected to begin risk production of 3nm chips in 2021. Upcoming Year will be a Racing Competition for all Vlsi companies and that may turn out to be a war of Lower Tech node (5nm/3nm War Begins). Since I am a follower of non violence , I dont like war in General \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09but above one is a silent war as most companies dont Reveal their Road maps and that makes this war interesting, Let's be part and enjoy this. Happy Learnings \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Regards Ziya ",

            "answer_text": "It is a possibility to go below 5 nanometers by the use of the derivatives of carbon, i.e. graphene, graphen oxide(GO) or reduced grapheme oxide (rGO). Probably, graphene is the future of VLSI industry which could replace the semiconductor in coming years. In last decades, carbon based materials have been enormously studied as a potential candidate to overcome technical and scientific limitations of conventional semiconductor. It has been known that most of the carbon based work focused on field effect transistors. So it would be great if non-volatile memories can be fabricated on carbon based material. Pure graphene is somewhat difficult to extract from carbon whereas GO and rGO can be formed easily. They are ultrathin (~1 nm) due to its physical and chemical properties. These oxygenated groups enhance the resistivity making it insulator and suitable for RRAM devices and rGO could be one of the possible candidates. Altogether, we can say, the electronic properties and band structure can be modulated on a single carbon substrate by altering the quantity of chemical functionalities on the thin film surfaces and possibly use to fabricate electronic devices.

            "answer_text": "Too many work is being done towards enhancement in this domain day by day. Most notably of them can be said as 1.Technology Scaling- These days the IC design mechanism is sclaed day by day. We have heard 180nm tech in 2010 or so. And now the latest being 7nm. The size is decreasing day by day obviously satisfying Moore\u2019s law. 2. Increase in Leakage Current and its Use- The concept of leakage current is quite intruiging. Leakage current increases as size decreases. So for low power designs, concepts are being used to use that current to drive the IC. 3.Race in Industry and Boom effect in overall specifications in Resultant fields- All the recent development has led to a race in industry to develop cutting edge technology as you can see. Qualcomm Snapdragon Processor vs Mediatek Helio( most notably upcoming Decacore version). That has led to huge changes in mobile development world. You can see the competition between Apple, Samsung, HTC, Lenovo, and somewhat Google also. ",

            "answer_text": "Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining billions of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI lets IC designers add all of these into one chip. Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using wiring by abutment. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells. In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting. Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s, but lost its popularity later because of the advent of placement and routing tools wasting a lot of area by routing, which is tolerated because of the progress of Moore's Law. When introducing the hardware description language KARL in the mid' 1970s, Reiner Hartenstein coined the term \"structured VLSI design\" (originally as \"structured LSI design\"), echoing Edsger Dijkstra's structured programming approach by procedure nesting to avoid chaotic.
