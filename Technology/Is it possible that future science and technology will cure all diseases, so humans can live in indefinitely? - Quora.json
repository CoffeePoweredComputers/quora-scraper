            "answer_text": "No. Because there\u2019s new diseases coming up all the time; MERS, Ebola, Influenza, Zika; probably more if you search for them. Influenza isn\u2019t a new disease, but because of evolution, these organisms have come up with new ways to evade the ways by which our traditional medicine kills them. There\u2019s also the fact that there\u2019s so much war going on in the world, and conflict always brings with it a plethora of diseases due to lack of sanitation and health facilities. There\u2019s also so much poverty in the world and the situation there really doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to become any better anytime soon. Maybe a few generations down the line? Also, lastly, do you know that there\u2019s your normal antibiotics that the doctors prescribe, and that there\u2019s alternatives too, but that there\u2019s also a last-resort set of antibiotics for the really bad infections that show no sign of improvement even after treatment? These are called carbapenems and they\u2019re like nukes. Doctors never use them, because they cause a lot of damage by way of side effects but they, normally, do get rid of the infections. The bad news I\u2019ve got about these is that.. there are now strains of bacteria showing resistance to even these last resort medicines. Imagine getting a staph infection, (which is pretty routine as far as infections go) and now imagine that that staph infection will kill you, and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it. So it\u2019s certainly possible, as you mention in the question, but to me it just doesn\u2019t seem plausible. Because of.. EvolutionThe billions (trillions?) of organisms we haven\u2019t discoveredPovertyWarIncreasing resistance to drugsI just don\u2019t see it happening. There\u2019s probably other factors in this, but I\u2019m writing this off the top of my head. ",

            "answer_text": "Even if all diseases were cured, humans would not live indefinitely. That is because people die from old age which is not a disease. Also many illnesses that people die from are caused by malfunctions of their bodies, not by outside organisms. For example, heart attacks are often caused by a lack of exercise, too much cholesterol produced by the liver, genetic problems with the heart, and injuries to the heart. Some cancers are not caused by environmental issues such as smoking, but by a type of birth defects. We are so far from curing so many problems, I often wonder if humans will exist long enough. Oh by the way, war is not a disease and we lose a lot of people to wars, not to mention texting when driving, drugs and alcohol, and a bunch of other stuff that aren\u2019t truly diseases, such as stupidity.
