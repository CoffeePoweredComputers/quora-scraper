Use your recovery email if you have oneUse a smartphone that is logged in with your gmailAnswer basic questions about your account. Sometimes google will ask you stuff like \u201cWhen did you last have access to this account\u201d and \u201cwhen was this account created\u201d.If you don\u2019t have a recovery email(which you should), and don\u2019t have a smartphone that is logged in with your gmail(which is okay if you don\u2019t) and can\u2019t remember when you created your account or when you last used your account your out of luck. You should always have your password stored somewhere(even just on your computer), have a recovery email, login through your smartphone if you have one, and have a recovery phone so if you lose access to 2 or 3 of those you still have access to your account. You should also backup important files that are on your google drive other places to so you don\u2019t lose them. ",
