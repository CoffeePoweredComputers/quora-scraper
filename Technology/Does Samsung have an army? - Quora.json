            "answer_text": "Armies serve two main purposes. To shoot people and to protect things. Who would Samsung want to kill? Apple users? Apple buys stuff from Samsung. Samsung does not have a monopoly so any over the top behaviour will strengthen its competitors. As for protection, Samsung does not build it's factories in warzones. It gets by with the laws of whatever country it works with. Lastly, there are security companies that offer discreet services if needed. There is no need to arm your employees. ",
