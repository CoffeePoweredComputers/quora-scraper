            "answer_text": "This is not about a particular year of our life where we face ups and downs, I know due to COVID pandemic the situation becomes more stressful for many of us but let\u2019s talk about the positive sides of it. :) Just like every year, this year was also started with full of joy, enthusiasm and positivity but as we know problems can chase us everywhere :P haha, kidding. We generally encounter a few unwanted issues in our life which comes like a hurricane and destroys the peace (here I mean for our inner peace or mental peace). We all face issues related to our work, health etc. for example a research person always set up an experiment but not getting the results that means a constant failure. Another example, a person constantly struggling with their health and trying very hard to get better but due to the restless and hectic lifestyle, this task becomes tough. Similarly, we all have such problems every year which doesn't fade away easily but what is so special about 2020? Life was going the same I discussed above and at one time it became very stressful that things were not getting sorted. Many of you can relate to this, now here comes COVID-19. All schools, colleges and public places were shutting off and people started panicking. Have you ever thought of the positive side of this situation? Let\u2019s discuss it. We all have got a break from our schedule due to which we were not able to do our favorite things. Now, we all have chance get stress free and enjoy each and every day without worrying. There are many people who are suffering a lot in this time, let's pray for them and also help them as much as we can. So, those who are safe at their places and feeling negative in this time please: Do your favorite work like cooking, reading, music or watching your favorite movie, which we all keep on complaining about, during our busy time. I found this time really helpful for me, I can think peacefully about myself. I can work on improving myself, my health and spend a stress free time with family. Trust me you need some healing time in your life and remember that you are not a machine you are a beautiful human. The best example is nature \ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf43\u2026. .. You all can see how nature is healing itself. If you will not work on yourself or heal youself, you will be messed up totally after working for sometime. So, take this time positively and don't blame 2020..because it's a beautiful year like other years, we just need to change our vision. So, after a lot ups and downs this year is being superb for me till now and it will be nice in future also. . This year gave me a good break to heal myself and strengthen myself so that I can get back with full enery\u2026\ud83d\ude0a .. Stay attached to nature it will help you growing up as a good human\u2026I'll share some amazing images\u2026.    Stay home and stay safe\u2026\ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "My top 3. And 2020 sure has lots of lessons. First, catastrophes open opportunities. As the lockdown cascaded we went into the fastest and severest economic contraction since the Great Depression. Investors panicked and liquidated their investments tanking the markets and their wealth. I looked at the carnage and realized there were opportunities. So, I continued to invest in world class companies, that offer products and services in demand around the world. And I could invest while the stock market was having a huge \u201cWhite Sale.\u201d I did the same thing with our real estate investments taking advantage of once in a generation opportunities. Both will bring outsized returns for decades. Second, catastrophes offer recalibration. My business is classified as an \u201cessential business\u201d so we continued to operate with certain restrictions. It impacted my revenue yet because of the so far \u201cV shaped\u201d recovery it\u2019s been limited. Because of the restrictions, it caused me to recalibrate how I did business. I found I could work remote more allowing us to spend more time at our second home. Also, I could accomplish most of what I needed on the phone or email rather than face to face. This saved me hours and made me responsive and productive. So my business became more efficient while taking better care of my clients. A win, win. Third, catastrophes give perspective. With Covid-19 raging people were fearful as the news blasted us 24/7. I chose rather than fear to reevaluate. I take good care of myself with diet and exercise but I still fine tuned it. And I\u2019m healthier now than ever. I slowed down and took more time to be with my family. If this might be the end then I wanted to spend that time with the ones I love. With a slower pace and renewed perspective I purposely chose to focus more on each moment and all I\u2019m thankful for. And that filled me with light in the midst of all the darkness. So the biggest lesson of 2020? Watch out for that bus you don\u2019t see coming your way. Also, you may not be able to fully control your circumstances but you can control your response. And that makes all the difference. ",
