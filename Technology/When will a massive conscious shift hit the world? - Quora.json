            "answer_text": "Can I answer this question? - Yes! However there is no way to know if my hypothesis is correct. Several people have already given answers and they are all different. So now for the answer. First, I don\u2019t believe in the magical thinking that it will be imposed in the same instant on everybody or anything like that. Each person goes through their process of evolution and becoming self responsible. Some people will fight the process all their life. Others will go with it as soon as they understand The process of the shift is going strong. It has been changing for about 10 years; 07/06/96. There is no way to prove it. There are other dates other people might pick that had interesting metaphysical events. This change is a process, not a sudden flip of a switch. As more people change within themselves they will participate in the consciousness shift. It happens on an individual basis. How long will it take? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps the rest of everybody\u2019s lives will be as long as it takes. Metaphysical time isn\u2019t the same as world space-time. No matter how long it takes in space-time, it is all over in a single cosmic instant. And if nobody likes my answer, write a better one. ",

            "answer_text": "You think people will start to fly then never, the mind would not allow it. People talk about rising but not literally off the ground. Rise in conscious levels. Your attitude defines your life, if you hurt that says more about you than anything else. I am not against wars, wars must happen to take down wrong people. Dictators and unjust leaders who hurt more than nurture their people. The biggest wake up call in history has been wars. Lets pretent its 2021 and A big consciousness shifts hit the earth. Everyone in this world know their rights. We encourages and not criticizes each other. People start believing that kindness is the answer a win win, it pays the best interest. Wars ended because both sides agreed it is not the answer any more. Money and awareness is well distributed across the world, not one person is left hungry or abused. Whatever is causing harm be put to a stop. Don't let any religion, system, and negative people in control of your life, you have control. The cancer driven and drama driven operating systems must go. When there are no more poverty and corruption our consciousness will rise. ",
