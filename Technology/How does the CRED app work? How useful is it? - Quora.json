            "answer_text": "Sincerely I feel that there is no other app or platform that rewards you when you make credit card payments. Obviously your credit card company rewards you with points when you make a purchase, but what happens when you pay that huge ransom of money to credit card company? CRED helps you in earning some points and you can use them from a wide variety of options. Some people might come here and share their experience of when they lost money, meaning that money was deducted from their account successfully and CRED is completely denying it. This can happen to anyone and using any online platform whatsoever. There is a great system behind how the transactions work and you should immediately get in touch with your bank to confirm if the payment you made was successful at beneficiary\u2019s end as well. Also I am the one who lost \u20b915,000 by making multiple payments and CRED never claimed that they got the money. One fine day I put my foot down, sent like 10 emails to all the people I could find associated with CRED, got in touch with my bank and confirmed every transaction made to CRED and if it was successfully sent to the beneficiary. My emails weren\u2019t answered, I took it to TWITTER and guess what, my \u20b915,000 was settled in less than 30minutes. TWITTER is the place where CRED is most responsive. Take your issues there and the team will resolve it. Also note that TWITTER is the last resort, after this, there is no place other than their office in Bengaluru to go to. Sharing my experience, thats all! ",
