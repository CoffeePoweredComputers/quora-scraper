            "answer_text": "When I was CEO of a company, I had to fire a VP Sales whom I felt I could not fire until I had sufficient, tangible, rock solid evidence. He was traveling to a state where there were no customers, but there was a competitor. He did not know it, but I had already entered into negotiations to buy this company from the multi-billion parent. One day the CFO of the company called me to tell me that another manager in my company was visiting the company in question and was trying to buy it. At my next senior management meeting I announced that I was in negotiations to buy this and there was to be no more contact from our team with anyone in the target company. I asked each VP in turn if they had any contacts with the company. Everyone looked puzzled and said no. After the meeting I asked the Sales VP to hang around. Privately, I told him that someone in the parent company had told me it was my sales manager who made the contact. I asked if it was him. He said \u201cabsolutely not and I\u2019m offended that you accuse me of this.\u201c Then I knew he was lying and set out to get the proof. I learned this technique from a Government Attorney who had investigated the first huge company. She walked into my office one day and said, \u201cNow we are going to search these together.\u201d I was shocked and asked what she had in the files. \u201cThe last five years of your expense reports.\u201d Without wasting your time she taught me by example that people lie all the time but they NEVER lie on their expense reports. So the government uses expense reports to find and convict those who have had an illegal meeting. I stayed at the office one night after everyone left. I took my master key and went into the accounting office and borrowed the expense report files for Jay and the sales Exec he stated he was working with about this time. I checked the reports and found on the expense reports that Jay and the Sales Exec met with someone from the target company. I made copies of the reports. The account manager was a young guy who I had hired as pure potential. I knew that I could have a conversation with him that he would keep confidential. I phoned him if he had ever visited an office of the other company. He said absolutely not, but asked if I could tell him why. I said that we are in discussions with the parent and we\u2019ve signed an agreement stating that no one but me could contact the company. I added that I had told his boss it would be grounds for termination. I begged him to be honest with me and promised there would be no repercussions if he just told me the truth. Sadly, he told me that was the truth and I hung up the phone knowing that I was going to have to let him go, too, since he lied to me. I was speaking with the CFO of the Billion dollar company to finalize the deal. He told me the one thing that could screw it up was the continued visits of my sales people to his regional office. I told him that the problem would be solved in 24 hours. I asked my CFO to go through the expense reports of the two individuals that were involved. He found three occasions of the unwarranted meetings. First, I called in my best VP and told him that he was promoted to Exec VP Sales effective in 24 hours and then told him that he could not discuss or even start smiling until the next day. Next, I called in the Sales VP. I had laid out the expense reports on my desk facing him. He looked at them and said, \u201cSo, what is the problem? These are expenses I spent on behalf of the company.\u201d I asked him specifically if he had met with mr. x on all three occasions. He said he had. When I asked why he said \u201cWe were talking about new business opportunities.\u201d By the way, I was taping the session and I had my CFO in my office as a witness. \u201cJay,\u201d I said, \u201cDo you remember me stating in the management meeting that no one could contact company X and then I asked you about it and you denied it?\u201d He responded that the expense report must be wrong. I told him that he had signed all three reports and that he had been paid for them. \u201cSo, can I go now?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, sit down. You\u2019re fired. The CFO will take you to your office and you will only be allowed to take items you paid for with your own money with you.\u201d He asked me if there was anything else I needed for him to do and I responded, \u201cGet out and don\u2019t ever come back or call anyone in our company and company X. \u201c Next was a heartbreaker. I had to call the super potential guy I hired and fire him over the phone. I asked my Admin Asst to announce a company meeting in an hour and also dictated a one paragraph statement to send to the Board of Directors. You know, I thought I would really pleased, perhaps ecstatic to fire the guy but I wasn\u2019t. It made me sick to remember that I had hired him and an outsider had warned after the hire that he was bad news. I started to think about all of the damage he had probably caused during his year on board. It turns out that he had his thumbs in a little bit of everything. It took months to repair the damage. There is no joy in seeing the look on someone\u2019s face when they are fired. You care more than they do and they could not care less. ",

            "answer_text": "I worked at 14 companies through my careers. I have seen some employees unfairly treated who had poor supervisors. I cannot recount a time that I ever saw a co-worker fired who did not deserve it. Several examples immediately come to mind: The company put out several memos that visiting sites considered pornographic from the office was unacceptable conduct. A follow-up memo stated that 11 of the 15 sites still most visited were pornographic. A week later, they let six people go. One was a couple levels down in my team. He was spending 6+ hours a day at porn sites, streaming a lot of video.A person who charged over $15,000 to the company for meals for his team. He would take them to expensive restaurants at 6 PM, they would return to work for ten minutes, and then go home. In one week, he also managed to antagonize our three largest customers.A male who was accused of sexual harassment by a subordinate. When questioned by HR, he told several obvious lies. He was discharged for lying.Someone caught stealing computers after hours from the office. He likely would have gotten away with it, but stole a computer furnished to us by the federal government. The FBI investigated, got a confession, and we terminated him.Two different cases where highly-paid PhD\u2019s could not complete simple analyses. In one case, it was work that I had already done (making less than half the salary) that the person never even attempted to do.A technical writer that produced one poorly edited chapter in 13 months. Our contract employees produced a chapter per week per writer. Our technical writer\u2019s excuse was that she was supposed to be a manager, not an individual contributor. I always thought that managers had expertise in the areas they managed. Five minutes before the writer was to be put on a performance improvement plan, she went on maternity leave. She was not due for eight months, and later lied that HR had approved it. She eventually went on leave without pay, got paid while on leave without pay due to a clerical error, but did lose the guarantee of returning to her job. When she went to come back, we had not held her position open. We ended up paying her severance pay AND let her keep the overpayment rather than get bad press.I\u2019ll stop now. Suffice it to say, I have found the firing process to be fair at every company where I worked. ",
