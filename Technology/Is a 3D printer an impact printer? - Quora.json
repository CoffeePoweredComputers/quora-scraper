            "answer_text": "impact printer produces characters and graphics on a piece of paper by striking it is called impact printer whereas A type of printer that produces characters and graphics on a piece of paper without striking is called a non impact printer. So 3D printer can\u2019t be said so infact 3d printing is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century but what you might not realize is that there are tons of different 3d printing techniques out there. the four most common varieties FDM SLA laser centering and Poly Jet there are some other more specialized methods but these four are definitely the most widely used. let\u2019s start with fpm which stands for fusion deposition modeling. 1. if you\u2019ve seen a 3d printer in person then chances are it was an FTM printer so how does it work well functionally speaking an FTM printer works a lot like a hot glue gun that\u2019s being operated by a robot solid material known as the filament goes in one end gets pushed through a hot nozzle that melts and is deposited in thin layers. this happens over and over until a three-dimensional object emerges so in other words FDM 3d printing is basically 2d printing over and over again just each time a layer is completed the nozzle moves up just a little bit and the next layer is printed on top of it then there\u2019s stereo lithography or SLA. 2. SLA basically uses light to grow objects out of a puddle. SLA machines work by shining ultraviolet lights into a pool photo reactive resin any resin struck by the light solidifies and forms a layer of the object you\u2019re printing generally speaking these printers can create objects with far finer details than FDM. 3. the third variety of 3d printing is laser Center LS prints by flashing a high-powered laser over a bed of super fine powder fusing the particles together to form a thin solidified layer. the Machine then sweeps more powder over the top of that layer and repeats the process until the 3d object is complete. this process isn\u2019t common in consumer level 3d printers but on the industrial side it\u2019s often used to create large durable objects out of metal in fact Space X uses this method to 3d print it\u2019s super Draco rocket engine that\u2019s definitely a tough act to fault but we\u2019ve got one more on our list. 4. last but not least is a 3d printing technique known as Poly Jet think of this one has a mix of FDM and SLA Poly Jet machines squirt out tiny droplets of photo reactive resin onto a build surface and then immediately harden the resin with ultraviolet light this process is then repeated hundreds of times create objects from the bottom up. the benefit of this method is that it\u2019s crazy fast and super precise unfortunately most poly jet printers cost tens of thousands of dollars so they\u2019re out of reach for people like you and me now that school is over let\u2019s talk about the real world because 3d printing is used in almost every industry.
