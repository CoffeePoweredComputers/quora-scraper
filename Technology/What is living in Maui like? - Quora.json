            "answer_text": "First of all, you\u2019re \u201cON Maui\u201d, not \u201cin\u201d it. I am grateful to live on this beautiful rock in the middle of the Pacific Ocean for 13 years. For those who want to experience the abundance of Maui life, I offer this advice: Let Maui change you, don't try to change Maui. Accept Maui for what Maui is. Respect the locals and the culture. And always pay it forward, when someone does something nice for you no matter how big or small. The Reality of Living on Maui: There\u2019s a housing crisis. Mainlanders own a good portion of the homes for rent and they like to rent them as vacation rentals (why get $1300 a month when you can get $1300 a week?) This creates a housing scarcity, and drives up rents. Nowadays you can rent a bedroom in a shared house for $800+ a month.Most Jobs fall in one of 3 categories: Construction, Service Industry, Retail. Not many white-collar, college degree, salaried - type jobs. Oahu is vastly different in this aspect. Check Maui\u2019s Craigslist jobs ads and you'll see what I mean.The island either accepts you, or not. It doesn't take long to figure out if you belong here or if you don't.Owning a vehicle (and maintaining it) is almost like paying a second rent. My yearly truck registration is almost $380. Annually. Gas is $3.67/gal. The island is limited in choices for vehicle service and repairs. No junkyard or salvage yard -no (legal) zoning has been designated.You will experience Aloha. Just remember, No Hawaiians, no Aloha. If there were no Hawaiians left on Maui, there most definitely would not be any more Aloha.There are so many beautiful places to see, experience and behold. Like nowhere else on earth will you find the Silversword (\u02bb\u0101hinahina), for example.Learn about Maui\u2019s history, especially the plight of the Hawaiians. Learn as much as possible, it will help you appreciate your surroundings even more. \u201cKalai \u02bb\u0100ina\u201d by Antonio V. Ramil is a good book with solid history.Traffic- there is only one major road around the entire island. One accident on the Pali could halt all traffic to a standstill for hours, for example.Support local businesses as much as possible. There's already too many WalGreens and Safeways.Every year the beaches are more and more built up with McMansions from rich people who use them only a few times a year. Then we gotta deal with the opulent eyesore year-round, and their \u201csecurity\u201d guards, gates, obtrusive nighttime lights, etc. White Rock (Palauea) beach is a good example of this.Be prepared to do everything at a beach: Socializing, celebrating, recreating, cruising, playing sports, etc.Please add to my list, comment, or correct me if u no like my mana\u02bbo.

            "answer_text": "As far as living goes, everyone creates their own experience. Most people that end up living here seem to have story on how they arrived on Maui. There is a saying here: \u2018the island either likes you or spits you out.\u2019 Personally, for me, I love it here and the island, she is good to me. It is unlike any place I have lived or traveled too. No matter how many times I have left, I always seem to come back. I am compelled here. I found love here (or, love found me), and I call Maui my home. I do travel off island a fair bit though. It is a rock, after all, so I do leave, as we can all get a little island fever at times. But, what a beautiful rock to come back too! I am answering this question, as I lay in my hammock on my lanai (porch) looking out to clear blue skies and a few puffy white clouds and lush green flora with the ocean and neighboring islands of Molakai and Lanai in the distance. Maui, like all the Hawaiian islands, has an abundance of good mana (energy) in it\u2019s nature. If you like the outdoor life there is plenty to do here. There is an unspoken permission to relax and just be or go to the beach and spend time with your Ohana (family). Community is varied depending on who you know, your interests and your location. The flip side of the relaxation habit is there can be a lax attitude and motivation can be an issue. There is such a thing as \u2018island time.\u2019 If you are a type A personality, it may not be a good fit or actually it may be just what you need to learn to \u2018chill.\u2019 I often say for \u201cmainlanders\u201d moving on island, if you have worked hard to get to paradise, and have arrived and can survive here, what else is there to strive for? Yet, if you want to learn how to be a human \u2018being\u2019 instead of a human \u2018doing\u2019, you might find that life balance comes easier here. There is a large tourist population that comes and goes and many with second homes. Locals do ok with the tourists with not too much of a bias. There is a strong Polynesian influence rising again here and reclaiming Hawaiian law and independence. So, sometimes you might run into an attitude but it is mostly because the scars run deep of where the white man gave attitude that polluted a lot of the Polynesian culture and not just Hawaii. That being said, those with the spirit of Aloha, lead with their heart, and will show you a smile and a friendly attitude if you show respect and share eye contact and a smile. Because Maui is an island, goods are shipped here and normal items like bread and milk can be expensive for purchase. But, you find ways around that like shopping at Safeway on $5 Fridays or bulk buying at Costco or the local farmers market or fruit stands, can make costs manageable. Maui is an expensive place to live. Most forget we are dependent on shipping to bring supplies. To live in paradise with box stores and all amenities and conveniences does not come cheap. Again, if the island likes you, and you are patient, and willing to pay your dues, contribute your time, energy and talents, you will find your way to not just survive here, but thrive. Because Maui has many micro-climates you can travel anywhere on island to escape the heat of the west side or the rain of the north side. It is cooler up country and mostly sunny on the south and west sides. Yet, travel a few miles up the coast on the west side and you can get a drop in temperatures up to 12 degrees. In winter the whales come with their majestic bodies and melodious bellows. Surf also comes and many travel from around the world to ride the waves of famous sites like Jaws or Honolua or Hookipa. Overall, Maui can be an amazing place to live. But, the island may not keep you forever. On the other hand, she may never let you go. Hope that helps! ",
