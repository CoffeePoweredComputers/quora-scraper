            "answer_text": "Peter Parker synthesizes them using various organic chemicals taken together. In some comics or movies it's oscorp biocable whereas in general it's a organic fluid. Due to its super high viscosity and adhesive vanderwal forces, it is densely packed into very small capsule type structure isolated from external environmental conditions. Based on pressure viscosity differential function, he determines the maxima that at a certain pressure at what other conditions viscosity will be maximum. After solving these equations he determines appropriate conditions of storage and creates a micro nozzle which supplies appropriate pressure for the fluid to homogenize and expell unidirectionally to the target without spreading out. Further based on the villains he fights, he keep modifying his fluid to take maximum advantage. For example when he fights to hydroman, he mixes a coagulant which can stick to water which otherwise goes invain hitting with general ones. ",
