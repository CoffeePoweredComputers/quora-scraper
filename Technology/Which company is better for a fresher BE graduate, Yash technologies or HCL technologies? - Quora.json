            "answer_text": "hi, HCl Technologies is a very good company if you are joining as a software Engineer. you will get lot of flexibility while working here like they won\u2019t put pressure to come on time or go on time.. you just need to complete your work anyhow and prove your worth\u2026you can switch project if you don\u2019t like a project..you can switch to you favourite Technology if you don\u2019t like you current Technology..Good number of projects in Database and Java.Friendly Environment , Hr are friendly if you are good at work and have good image in project. Senior\u2019s will help you a lot.one thing is you may need to compromise in package in HCL, they are having huge variable pay gap.Again for fresher\u2019s the package depends on where you are SAP developer or developer or you are tester. it\u2019s less for a tester\u2026 unfortunately :p",
