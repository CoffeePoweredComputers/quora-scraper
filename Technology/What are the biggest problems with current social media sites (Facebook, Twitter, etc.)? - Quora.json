            "answer_text": "Each social platform has it's strengths and weaknesses, but it's varies a lot. This answer is completely subjective though, so please take my answer as such. The largest issue that all platforms have in common is money. Money has taken an incredible idea of connecting people to a level that people resist being attached to them. Of course, each platform deals with that issue differently. Let me dive in. Facebook Facebook is the monster so I will start here. I want to break this into a few sections. Facebook's big properties right now are Pages, Groups, Profiles. I won't touch Messenger because people either use it or they don't. So let's go! Facebook PagesPages are a thing of the past. People who are starting pages should stop. They are of no value unless you plan on paying to get reach. The typical page post reach is somewhere between .01%-12%. It primarily depends on if it's just text, just an image, or a mix of image & a link to a website, and you can put your own mix together. The result is basically, not much.  For some pages they have greater success because they are consistent and they are putting out amazing content. For the majority of us, that's not the case.  Pages aren't getting the attention of businesses or the media as they once did. I can remember seeing the facebook icon everywhere with the tag \"Follow Us on Facebook\" and now hardly anyone does it. The product has gone to the wayside. Facebook GroupsGroups is where facebook shines. This is probably now the heart and soul of the platform. It's more engaging and meaningful. You don't get the lame posts that people post to the own feeds. They are niche targeted and usually informative. It is much easier to get the conversation started in groups and actually connect with like-minded strangers. I also think groups is where businesses and influencers can score big wins by starting a related group and build it to leverage conversation and attain real leads. Now this paragraph is basically about marketing and not personal. I think people get a lot out of groups, but I think marketers, businesses, high-profile people can benefit greatly from building a large and active group. Facebook ProfilesOnce upon a time games like Mafia Wars drove huge droves of friending. Fast-forward what seems to be a lifetime ago and now the personal profile is highly regarded. Sending a friend request is now reseved for those you truly want to connect with. I don't send game requests anymore. I remove people I don't have a connection with, and I continue to review who is connected to me. I feel as though many friends have resorted to very low quality posts and that has pushed many people to check on facebook less for updates. It doesn't feel awesome anymore as the platform has matured. I don't see facebook going away anytime soon, but I see them maturing into more of a way to stay connected to friends and family. I rarely add a status because I don't feel the need. I refuse to share anything for the most part because often there isn't anything great to share. Facebook's feeds are in terrible shape as far as I am concerned. I am aware of the unfollow feature and grouping contacts into segments. They are nice features but I don't feel like programming my facebook experience. Overall Facebook ExperienceFrom my point of view, facebook is less of a tool in my marketing belt. Personally, I am at the point that my feed sucks so I don't really check it. I think the conversations are cumbersome and don't reflect my interests much. Twitter Twitter is a tougher platform to understand and put skin in the game. You follow people within your interests and sometimes they follow back. Twitter has a lot of witty goodness, but it also has the most SPAM I have ever seen as well. Many posts I see is either follow for follow, read this, rewteet this, and other \"asks\" that turn me off and causes me to unfollow those accounts. I constantly see links upon links to go see this or that. I don't want to leave my Twitter experience to see your splash page on eBooks. Yet, with my complaints about SPAM, I have met some of the most awesome people and built relationships from the service. I have only been using Twitter seriously for about a month now. I disregarded it in the past, but decided to give it a fair shake. I personally am starting to like it. Direct messages are useless as well, and I hate Twit validator. Twitter has some serious cleaning up to do, but that's not their focus. They need to produce money. From a marketing point of view, my 4 marketing accounts are driving more traffic daily to my websites than any other platform. I am converting at a decent rate also. As my following grows so does my Google Analytics reported sessions/users. Twitter has a lot to offer, but it is a pyramid game. It's to follow influencers and celebrities. It's not for nobodies. If you are on twitter and don't have much to offer then just follow people who you have an interest in. Twitter is all about interests and short conversations. Pinterest Pinterest is still evolving but it has huge potential for gains. The visual social world is where it's at. I am still struggling to find my zen on this platform, but for my small amount of work I did on a couple profiles last year are continuing to pay off. People are just visual creatures and I think this is what raises Pinterest's value. I love going through posts, hearting them, and leaving a comment. I think this is a fun network that is not just for women anymore. I built an iron pipe computer desk this week after getting some ideas from Pinterest and YouTube. This is the place where people can win more by investing. YouTube If you aren't here, even with the awful state of comments, then you are losing big time. This includes myself. Because I am not currently putting video out, I am losing considerably and I am well aware of it. The only things I can truly add to YouTube is that Google made a significant error by adding G+ into YouTube. It hasn't added value, and the comments haven't gotten better. Great channels like CPG Grey don't even read the comments and instead opts for Reddit to engage with his fanbase. YouTube is the king of video with it being the #2 search engine in the world. Honestly, it's just an awesome platform with useless commentary 90% of the time. I personally watch about 2-3 hours a day. I watch it from the desktop, Chromecast, mobile, and of course while walking by other computers at work. My apartment has 2 Chromecasts and 21 other network connected devices. YouTube is the #1 platform used in my residence. Marketing wise, YouTube is almost everything at this point. My wife wanted to show off some bags for our upcoming trip to the Philippines on eBags. We surfed some, but mostly we watched the videos about the bags. We are dependent on video. If you are using this then you are not marketing correctly. By that thought process, I am currently not marketing correctly either. Soundcloud Soundcloud is the untapped resource, even though it's been out for a while. Some people like myself can't grasp how to use the platform. There isn't an easy way to grow your following unless you are consistently posting in groups or marketing your sounds off the platform. I don't really see the point of their groups. It's just people adding all their stuff and it has never felt social to me. The commenting systems on the entire platform doesn't encourage conversation. To me, Soundcloud is just a cloud storage system that happens to have some social features..  I podcast and upload here, but podcasting is tough on Soundcloud. They give you an RSS feed and I can create playlists, but beyond those stellar features, it is a very uphill battle to become popular. I have to build my presence elsewhere for it to matter on Soundcloud.  Overall Score Across Platforms Personal#1 Youtube: We all love video. I consume tons with my Chromecast.#2 Pinterest: Visual and I love the interaction.#3 Soundcloud: I podcast like crazy and it's cheap to go pro.#4 Twitter: I have met incredible people there.#5 Google Plus (even if I didn't address it) I still think it's awesome.#6 Facebook Marketing, Branding, Business#1 Youtube: #2 Search Engine in the world.#2 Soundcloud: Audio is second to video.#3 Pinterest: Visual wins here and traffic converts.#4 Twitter: You can build your following fast and see results.#5 Google Plus (even if I didn't address it) Still good for SEO and traffic.#6 Facebook: Sucks unless you focus on dark posts for adverts.  I was tempted to just post this on my website because it's so detailed, but it should live here instead.  There are more platforms, but I think this at least discusses some of the main ones that I currently dabble in. If you want me to go deeper in one of the points just let me know. I would be happy to do so. Thanks for the great question!Adam ",

            "answer_text": "So called 'modles'\u2026  What do they do wrong? They sell sex. Yup, that's it it. They sell porn. Why do you think these girls have such a huge fan following? People like her captions? I doubt if her followers even read her captions. Also they post vulgar photos having deep captions. Irony. Lol.  A generic stolen caption!  Another thing wrong with them is that they sell perfect body types. These so called perfect bodies have a long, long history of plastic surgeries, laser treatments and what not\u2026 These make girls feel insecure about themselves and make guys have a so called perfect girl in their mind and then wonder why they can't get such girls in real life.  What is even more shocking is Social media is just some socially accepted porn site. I mean of course one won't open incognito mode just anywhere. However this is not the case for Facebook and Instagram. Moreover people get embarrassed when these semi naked modles come in their feed in front of everybody. Dude, you are freaking following them Irony!  Moreover one just needs to cover their nipples (in case of girls) and genitals and it's fine. No matter you are showing 90% of your skin. It's acceptable\u2026 And then we wonder why most relationships don't work out.  Inspired from: Shwetabh Gangwar (YouTube) L ",
