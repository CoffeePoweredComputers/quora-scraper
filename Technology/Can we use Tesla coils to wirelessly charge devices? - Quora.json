            "answer_text": "It is possible to extract usable energy from a nearby operating Tesla Coil. All Tesla Coils generate radio frequency electrical and magnetic fields (E-field and H-fields) that can be quite strong near an operating coil. These are called the \"near fields\" or induction fields, and these fields are present around any operating Tesla Coil or RF transmitting antenna. By placing a nearby metal plate (to capture the E-field) or a coil (to capture the H-field) and then rectifying the RF output, you can extract usable amounts of electrical power from the near fields. For example, Greg Leyh's Tesla Coil was able to power a manned electric wheelchair at the 2008 Maker Fair in San Mateo, CA using only the E-fields from Greg's Tesla Coil. In the following paper, Greg was also able to transfer over 500W from a transmitting coil to an identical receiving coil using primarily E-field coupling between the top terminals of the coils. See the following paper: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Efficient-Wireless-Transmission-of-Power-Using-Res-Leyh/3b827b6526e614e3708bbf7a93adfcb0f7d6de5f ",
