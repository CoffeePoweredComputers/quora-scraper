            "answer_text": "It\u2019s battery operated and installed out by the door. When a visitor pushes the button, the ring Wi-Fi connection notifies the homeowners\u2019 cell phone app (or) their computer in their house (or) even sounds a doorbell ( if they have one plugged in) or their Alexa will actually ring and announce \u201c Someone is at the door!\u201d Audibly. It\u2019s incredibly cool. The ring can notify several cell phones simultaneously so the first person to answer it wins and can interact with the visitor, no matter where they are in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Doorbells in North America typically operate from a transformer that reduces the 120VAC household voltage to either 16 or 24 volts AC. A doorbell using one of those voltages is typically installed in a location where it can be heard by the building\u2019s occupants. A push-button is connected between the doorbell and the transformer. When pressed, the push-button causes the transformer\u2019s voltage to be connected to the doorbell, which actuates its mechanism or electronics. ",
