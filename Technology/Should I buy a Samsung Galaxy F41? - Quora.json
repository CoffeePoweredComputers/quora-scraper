            "answer_text": "Hi there! Everything depends on price. Seeing the leaked specifications, if it launches under 15k INR, then it should be a good buy. If it goes above 17k, then it is worthless to buy. You can buy better phones like Realme 7 and POCO X3 in that price range. If the leaks are correct, then it is similar to Samsung Galaxy M31. Thanks!
