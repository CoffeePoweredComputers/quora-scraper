            "answer_text": "the biggest rival to Taobao (C2C) was not Amazon (B2C), but was eBay (through Yiqu). when Taobao was established in 2003, eBay just purchased Yiqu, who dominated China's c2c market. Yiqu copied eBay's business model, ie charging listing fees and get commission for successful deals (I think was 2%). But Taobao made everything free for everyone since day one. This was hugely popular and Taobao accumulated some 300,000 sellers in the first year, many of them migrated from Yiqu. when users came, the next thing Taobao did was to introduce Ali-pay, an escrow service. back then counter-party risk was quite high in c2c business, as eBay/Yiqu acted as trading platform but could not guarantee transections (paypal could not enter China due to restrictions, and didn't offer Rmb settlement anyway). Ali-pay offered peace of mind for both buyers and sellers, and pretty much eliminated counter-party risk once and for all. This allowed much larger transections to take place. meanwhile, eBay/Yiqu tried to teach their users how to operate within their scope of product and services, to follow their rules. It was bit like 'my way or the high way'. eBay already made great success from their business model among overseas markets, they had great confidence in it and wanted to duplicate everything to China market, and to integrate China into their global network. But Taobao took a 'user first' approach, and made extra effort to listen to their users and improve their services based on these feedbacks. it was like 'tell me what you need and I will make it happen'. this made a huge difference, and led to further user churn from eBay. another key thing is their different corporate culture. eBay/Yiqu acted like a big international company, with their fancy office in Shanghai, everybody suited up and looked at small business users with arrogance and even contempt. while Taobao took a grass-root approach, hired a whole lot of 'lower educated' workforce who didn't mind getting their hands dirty, and went face to face with even the smallest sellers. by the time eBay realised their errors and started to adapt, Taobao already reached a critical mass and went snowballing from there.

            "answer_text": "Localization matters. The Chinese understand the Chinese fully well. Yahoo, Groupon, Google (even before banned, it could not beat Baidu), eBay, MSN, the list is quite long, Amazon is no exception. The reasons? 1. Localization. What were true for American netizens, were not necessarily true for Chinese ones. 2. Focused on sales and operations, instead of improving technologies adapting to the Chinese user base. 3. The headquarters in USA did not place high priority on the China market. 4. Chinese government censorship and policies. Dance in Fetters. 5. Recruited too much elite, no good news for the grass-root user experiences, which is a huge user base in such a populous nation. ",
