            "answer_text": "Super AMOLED basically combines the touchscreen layer onto the display itself.. so it makes the screen a bit lighter and more clear without that extra layer. OLED and AMOLED do not have the touchscreen layer attached and it's separate. Super AMOLED is actually a Samsung trademark as they apparently invented it. Super AMOLED is always the best\u2026 but still, OLED and AMOLED still looks very beautiful. OLED = LG AMOLED and Super AMOLED = Samsung (AMOLED and Super AMOLED is OLED, but with Samsung's technology) Other Phones with LG OLED: Google Pixel 3 and 4\u2026 iPhone XS, and half of the iPhone 11 Pro, Apple Watches Other phones with Samsung Super AMOLED: iPhone X, the first gen Apple Watch, and the other half of the iPhone 11 Pro (Apple bought OLED panels from both Samsung and LG for their iPhone 11 Pro). So which is better? THE ANSWER: IT'S SUBJECTIVE & IT DEPENDS. Honestly it really DEPENDS more on the RESOLUTION and PIXELS PER INCH (the PPI, how many tiny pixel dots are on the display).. whichever screen has a higher number of these two, then that screen is going to be a better screen. For example, Samsung makes BUDGET Android phones with AMOLED screens (Galaxy A and J series).. but those screens are of LOWER QUALITY OLED screens with lower resolution and lower PPI which makes the screen look more fuzzy and less sharp\u2026 so that screen will not look better than a OLED screen on a FLAGSHIP LG phone with a higher PPI and higher screen resolution. LG and Samsung are really the only two that makes OLED screens.. Super AMOLED is basically what Samsung calls their OLED screen technology and it helps people know that it's a Samsung screen when it's a Super AMOLED screen\u2026 Samsung's Super AMOLED panels help make the screen thinner because the digitizer is already built into the screen.. but most people won't even know the difference. I think for curved screens, the Super AMOLED is probably more ideal. I said it's SUBJECTIVE because it can depend on which you prefer. Of course a Samsung fan will say \"Samsung is better\" and a LG fan will say \"LG is better\". Samsung's AMOLED screens however on their newest Galaxy S or Note flagship phones are DEFINITELY one of the BEST SCREENS you can get.. Samsung tends to reserve the best panels for their own phones which has a much higher PPI than the other ones they sell to Apple or Huawei for example.. this makes Samsung's phones always have the best screen. So the answer is sort of Samsung's Super AMOLED screen is better.. but I myself prefer LG OLED. Samsung's AMOLED screens are absolutely gorgeous.. especially on their newest Galaxy flagship phones.. you will not find a sharper screen than on a Samsung. But sometimes, I feel like their screen looks too saturated and cartoonish.. and the display often does NOT look entirely black when the screen is turned off, it looks sorta blue and off black.. so it doesn't blend perfectly with the black bezels on the phone sometimes. LG's OLED panel looks entirely black which camoflauges the black border bezels very nicely when the screen is off. Another thing is the Super AMOLED screen on Samsung sometimes it shows a weird rainbow effect and a blue shift when you tilt the screen.. with LG, I don't see any of that. The issue with AMOLED or OLED screens usually is that the WHITE COLORS never look 100% true white and sometimes look off-white.. this is more of the case with Samsung's AMOLED screens (however, they have gotten better over the years).. but one of the main reasons why I prefer LG OLED screens is that the colors look very natural.. and white colors look surprisingly accurate and looks more white. So to me, I prefer LG screens over Samsung for these reasons.. I just think it looks more natural and not too over the top. But Samsung's Super AMOLED screens on their flagships Galaxy phones are certainly one of the sharpest and best looking screens.. it's just not really my preference. But really the answer depends on WHICH DISPLAY HAS A HIGHER PPI density and SCREEN RESOLUTION.. the PPI is probably one of the most important factor in terms of screen sharpness and quality.. the higher the PPI, the better the screen. So pay attention to the PPI number. If you want to know the PPI of a screen, go to the GSMarena website and look up your phone model and look under the display specs. ",
