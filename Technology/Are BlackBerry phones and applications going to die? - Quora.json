BlackBerry as a company will probably continue a bit, they\u2019ve got some security software offerings and probably a lot of patents which might be valuable, but as a maker of distinct smartphones (vs. an Android OEM), then no, it\u2019s over. A real shame because I much preferred them to iPhone or Android, but not enough people agreed with me. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Are BlackBerry phones and applications going to die? A: Blackberry died years ago. It turns out that Blackberry lied when they said that their phones were secure, the fact is that they never were secure at allAll Blackberry connections were routed through a Blackberry server (BES) which we all knew about, what Blackberry did not tell us is that the encryption was removed, all messages were copied in plain text, the the plain message was encrypted and sent to the destinationThat means that all your messages that you though were secure were actually completely accessible by Blackberry employees, government employees and criminals, so your Blackberry communications were never secure at all",
