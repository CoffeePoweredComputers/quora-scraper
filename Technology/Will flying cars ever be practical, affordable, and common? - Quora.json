            "answer_text": "Maybe, but probably not in a Jetsons kind of way.  I can\u2019t imagine anyone being able to fly a car in traffic and keep to traffic lanes and not run over everyone. The logistics of keeping track of individual takeoffs, landings and routing would be a nightmare. Everyone would get in everyone\u2019s way. People have enough trouble driving within the lines in a two dimensional world of freeway and street traffic. Think about adding a third dimension to that, where there are no landmarks or control signs. Cars would drop on people\u2019s houses and heads, weather would be a significantly bigger factor and now we have to fly around buildings a well. Crashes are inevitable and now you have crap falling on whatever is below. Safety goes in the toilet and deaths rise, at least with current technology. Now if someone makes an antigrav unit\u2026 maybe that changes things. Flying cars could hover then. Noise also becomes a factor. Flying cars with today\u2019s tech aren\u2019t going to be quiet and they would take a lot of room to take off and land. Without vtol, you would still have to land somewhere and transfer to your destination. Not convenient.. So, no, I don\u2019t Think flying cars are in our future. Not for a long time and not without some really new and novel technology. ",

            "answer_text": "No, no and no. Flying cars have actually been around for quite a while now, but there are several issues with the whole concept that likely will never go away. The most obvious issue is that a \u201cflying car\u201d may be able to double as a car and airplane, but it's not very good at either one of those things. You want a car that handles well, has a roomy, well appointed interior, is efficient while still having a good amount of performance? If you want that, don't try to make it capable of flying, and vice versa. Oh, and then there are also small matters like having to obtain an expensive pilots license to operate one, and then also having either your own runway in the backyard, or easy access to an airport for takeoffs and landings. Flying cars will never be anything more than oddities and playthings for the wealthy.. ",

But it is likely to be a poor spoon, a substandard fork, and a hopeless knife. So there is your \u201cflying car\u201d, makes just as much sense as a \u201ccar boat\u201d. After WW2, airplanes had made such a shocking difference in the war effort, U.S. magazines were filled with wondrous articles about how we will have an airplane in every garage. Well, I know of someone who has an airplane in his garage, John Travolta. But I am not john Travolta, nor are you. ",

            "answer_text": "Practical ? Sure. Affordable ? Not so sure, but expect it to be more expensive than land cars. Common ? No way. Flying cars are too unsafe compared to land cars. When we talk about flying, the accidents can be more deadly than on lands because of gravity. Even worse, if flying cars become mainstream, then the number of deaths per accident will increase significantly. Flying cars also don\u2019t have the same braking ability as land cars. I don\u2019t there will be such thing as traffic jam on air. ",

Can science suddenly discover some kind of anti-gravity particle, and the tech world work madly to commercialize the technology, make it affordable, and foolproof? It could POSSIBLY happen. Will the world come to accept and give up control of their vehicle to a massive computer network, so every vehicle knows what every other vehicle around it does and intend to do? It could happen with time. I would say I am safe in predicting that the possibility of those things happening in yours or my lifetime is zero. ",

Or any object that can take-off, land in compact space and is very personal (like your car?). If the latter is fine we are heading that way. There are a lot of drone companies that are working on a personal drone , self-piloted etc\u2026 and then there are jet-pack guys who are like the motorcycle riders who can absorb that additional risk for the trill factor (people like me :D)\u2026 Time will bring them all forward.
