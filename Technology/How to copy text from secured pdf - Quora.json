            "answer_text": "I ran into a similar problem last week when I had to copy some text from a PDF document and paste it into a presentation. Did a quick Google search and found that it is protected with the owner password. In case you\u2019re not familiar with the PDF password protection, then let me tell you that there are basically two types of PDF passwords \u2013 owner password and user password. If a pdf is protected with user password then you can\u2019t open that pdf without entering the right password. Owner password restricts some basic functions like printing, editing, copying text and images, and so on. If your PDF document is protected with the owner or permission password then you\u2019ll see the word \u201cSecured\u201d in the title bar when you open the file in the Adobe Reader. Now after understanding about PDF password types let\u2019s talk about the method to break or crack them. If you\u2019re dealing with a user/open password then let me tell you that it is next to impossible to crack the user/open password. There are some tools that claim to remove the user/open password but most of them are rip-offs and they don\u2019t work. On the other hand, there are some workarounds to remove the owner password and enable copy, print and other features. Method 1: Take the screenshot and run through it OCR program This is not the most convenient method but it works. What you need to do is to take the screenshot of the text that you\u2019d like to copy and then use any free OCR program to extract the text from your PDF. You\u2019ll find plenty of free OCR tools on the internet. FYI \u2013 Microsoft One-Note also has built-in OCR functionality. Method 2: Use some PDF password remover to unlock your PDF file You can also use some PDF unlocking utility to remove pdf owner password and copy the text freely from your PDF. I also ended up using the tool recommend in this tutorial to remove password from my protected pdf. It is convenient and saves a lot of time. For your quick reference, here are the steps you need to follow: Install the app on your Windows PC or MacLaunch the app and import the protected PDF file by clicking add file buttonSelect the destination folder where you\u2019d like to save your unprotected pdf fileClick the \u2018Start\u2019 button to unlock your PDF file.There are some online websites that also claim to remove the password from a PDF document but most of em\u2019 don\u2019t work with the PDF files protected with latest version of Acrobat. And, if you PDF document contains some confidential information then it is better to AVOID these website. ",

            "answer_text": "When you open a PDF file but cannot copy its content, it literally means that the file is protected and secured. You will need to enter the password entered to lock the file. People secure their pdf file with password to protect from any unauthorized copying, but forgetting the password can be a big issue later. In that case you can download a PDF converter and editing software that can solve the issue.
