            "answer_text": "I think the answer to your question is yes, and yes. It is all of those reasons as well as competitive bidding guided by supply and demand. There are limited resources in any area, and if you are trying to hire people in an area where there are 4000 other companies who want to hire similar resources or need more of that similar resource, you get higher price points for employees. The cost of living is also a function of resources in the area. There aren\u2019t a lot of great places to live in The Bay Area so the prices go up for the most desirable. This raises the prices in fringes of the less desirable areas and ultimately the undesirable areas as well, as those that can\u2019t afford the most desirable areas buy in the less desirable. It remains an economic question if the salaries are raising the cost of living, i.e. rents, foods, housing, cars, etc. Or if it is the lack of supply i.e. employees, and housing that pushes the prices higher. Perhaps they both play on each other, a chicken and egg problem. ",

            "answer_text": "They pay a 15% higher salary than in other tech hot spots because competitors do, originally because candidates needed slightly more for California prices. Local governments make home prices high. Local governments permit office space for _many_ more workers than homes to house them, with geography and transportation options precluding viable market alternatives. The resulting high demand for housing naturally meets the restricted supply at inflated prices. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses Sunnyvale permitted projects like the Moffett Towers campus with room for 9500 employees but only 2040 new homes. Santa Clara just gave developers a 99 year lease on their soccer fields to build office space for 29,000 but only 1360 apartments. San Francisco permitted the 1070 foot Salesforce tower but limits residential areas to 40 feet. ",
