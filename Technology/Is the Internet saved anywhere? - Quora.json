            "answer_text": "First at at all, what is Internet?... Internet is the world wide web... is a net of computers... is hardware, gadgets... the Internet is not a set of files or webpages. Then, the Internet is then \"saved\" or rather, stored, anywere. When you say that you access to Internet, you are saying you are sending and receiving information, that information is saved in files with many formats (html, htm, swf, doc, txt, ppt, etc.). You can access to the information saved in those files, and you can save those files (and its information) in your device PC, smartphone, tablet, etc.), but you are not saving Internet, you are saving information, previously or simultaneously saved on Internet. Nevertheless, it's a common error to confuse the World Wide Web with the web pages stored in the devaices that contain them.  Sometime ago, you can use Google, to watch a backup of all webpages (information on Internet, not Internet), that back up was called cach\u00e9. Right now that cach\u00e9 is not accessible using Google. Then, you can, instead download webpages, order to create cache using pages like:  http://www.cachedpages.com But, you might prefer use tools that ler you access to a copy of all a Internet without you need order anything. Then, on Internet you have a site  (archive.org) that automatically creates a cache of all webpages stored in Internet, or rather, stored in the computers that compound Internet. Another cache, is in your browser, but is not a cache of all Internet, is a cache of all pages a user visit using that browser. This cache is used to show you fastly pages you have visited before. The webpages on this cache are downloaded automatically, without your order. If you don't erase that cache frequently, your computer could become a slow computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Not that I am aware of. It is distributed so it would be a daunting task to do this.  Nevertheless Google (company) probably has the largest fraction of it stashed, as they crawl as much as they can indexing it for their searches and can often provide current and previous versions. Portions of the internet that are forbidden to robots, or that are password protected, are never going to be crawled by bots that obey the rules which we believe Google's do. So for those parts you may want to ask the NSA... they don't seem to feel constrained by rules like that. (Don't ask me how I feel about that) ",
