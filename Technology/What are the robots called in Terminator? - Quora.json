            "answer_text": "The robots in the first Terminator (1984) film is T-800, or what it called itself Cyberdyne Systems Model 101, it has an advance infiltration-based assassination android with the outer layer of living tissue over a robotic endoskeleton. The T-800 have remain one of the most iconic terminator in the series, there is at least 1 T-800 Terminator in every Terminator film. In Terminator 2 Judgement Day, a more advanced terminator, the T-1000 emerged as the antagonist while T-800 serve as the protector. As desxcribed by the T-800, the T-1000 is composed of a mimetic polyalloy / liquid metal, it can manipulate its limbs into sharp, stabbing melee weapons AND camouflage itself by assuming the appearance of a nondescript object or shapeshift to mimic appearance of other humans it touches. The T-1000 is virtually invincible toward physical damage (gunshot wound, explosion) as it can instantly reform itself. The T-1000\u2019s only weakness are temperature extreme, as shown when it was frozen solid from liquid nitrogen, it can be terminated using extreme heat with molten steel. In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, an upgraded version of T-1000 appear as the antagonist. This terminator is called T-X, or an anti-terminator terminator, Like its predecessor, the T-X can assume the appearance of other character because it has an outer shell of liquid metal, allow it to shapeshift. The T-X has the endoskeleton of a T-800 and the outer shell of the T-1000, the endoskeleton allow it to store a variety of advanced weapons from the future (plasma cannon, flamethrower). This terminator variant is much more advance than the original T-800 terminator, as it can also hack into electronic to remotely control any vehicles or rogue terminator. In Terminator Genisys, two significantly more advanced version of terminator appeared as the antagonist. The T-5000 is the host consciousness / avatar of Skynet, it can transmit nanobots into the body of humans, to transform them into T-3000. The T-3000 terminator was created by Skynet by converting human cells using machine-phase matter, these phase matter rewrite the victim\u2019s genetic coding and transform the human body on a molecular level to billions of nanomachine. Only 1 T-3000 was deployed because all other human subject went insane during the transformation stage and died. The T-3000 is extremely power, it combine the regenerative and shapeshift capabilities of the T-1000, it has superior combat abilities than the T-800, immune to rifle bullets and explosion, it is temporarily stunned by high-caliber bullet but can immediately heal itself. The T-3000 has extreme speed and reflexes, capable of phasing through objects (including other terminator). The only weakness to a T-3000 is magnetic fields, because the chassis of the T-3000 is hold together by magnetic field, only an ultra-powered external magnetic source can disrupt the T-3000\u2019s internal magnetic field. In Terminator Dark Fate, the new terminator is a major step-back when compared to T-3000. The Rev-9 is essentially two terminator merged into one, it has an outer layer shell of liquid metal similar to the T-1000, and an internal endoskeleton similar to the T-800, it has the unique ability to separate into two independent-functioning terminator.

In its own words, it is \u201cA robotic endo-skeleton surrounded by synthetic living tissue\u201d. So the answer to your question is that the robots are \u201c\u2026robotic endo-skeletons\" ",
