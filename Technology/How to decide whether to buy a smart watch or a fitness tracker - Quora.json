It would be like buying an expensive food processor that can do all sorts of things, when all you need is something to chop vegetables. It also explains why chefs use a knife in their kitchen. ",

When looking for a nice folding knife to go camping with and you see a single blade folding knife and you see a Swiss army knif with 32 different functions what do you decide to get? If all I want is a knife to do a simple thing and do it well I get the first one. Of I want to do many different things I get the Swiss. The same thing with the fitness tracker and the smart watch.
