            "answer_text": "Original Question: When will self driving cars be everywhere? It\u2019ll be a very long time yet! Getting 80% of the way to self-driving cars is the easy bit, which is where companies like Tesla and Waymo are right now, but as with so many things, it\u2019s the final 20% which is the tough part. Some years ago there were a lot of over-hyped claims about driverless cars and how we\u2019d be seeing them on the roads in \u2018a few years\u2019, but a lot of that early optimism has now fallen by the wayside as companies are realising the difficulties of programming computers to think as smartly and as fast as humans can in random real-life situations. What we may well see is an increasing number of roads or kerbed-off lanes on existing roads which are exclusively for the use of driverless or self-drive vehicles, keeping them well clear of the often chaotic traffic and pedestrian situations we have, especially in many town and city centres. Beijing\u2019s \u2018E-town\u2019 seems to be leading the way with driverless-only roads, however, a number of other cities around the world, particularly in the US, the UK, the UAE, and Germany, are experimenting with automatic delivery and guidance systems using robotic vehicles. I suspect that one of the first large-scale commercial uses of driverless vehicles will be for long-distance transport by road, where driverless lorries will be able to use exclusive lanes on intercity motorways. OK, they\u2019ll probably still have a driver in them, but only sitting behind the wheel on ordinary roads at the start and end of the journey. But it\u2019s not just the technology which is the problem, it\u2019s convincing the public that totally autonomous vehicles will be safer to travel in than those with a driver. That might just be the biggest stumbling block yet! Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Hopefully NEVER. Frankly, I don\u2019t trust a robot that cannot be programmed to think outside the box. In driving, 99 percent of situations are predictable, with responses programmable, but you\u2019ll always get the 1 percent that are totally out of left field. I\u2019m happy to let a robot do most of the work, but I would not like to see cars with NO human in charge. Someone needs to be there to take over in an emergency. ",
