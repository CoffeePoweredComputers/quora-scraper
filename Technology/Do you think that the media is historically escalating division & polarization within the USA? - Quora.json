            "answer_text": "It is the lying, bigoted POTUS who is escalating the division and polarization within the USA. If Twitter would ban his account and the MSM would stop reporting his every prevarication, there would be much less conflict in the USA. How else does he escalate division and polarization? He violates the US Constitution often, expecting his base cult to defend him, and they almost always do. (The Bible photo op was a misstep for him.)He threatens his opponents with baseless investigations, while blocking investigations into his own illegal activities.He obviously governs in a way that benefits his businesses, especially his open-secret relationship with Vladimir Putin.He makes no effort to stop the slander that constantly pours out of his mouth, unless he is praising some foreign dictator or reading a prepared speech from a teleprompter. (For awhile, people weren\u2019t sure he could read.)He often says absurd things, perhaps in jest, but coming from his bully pulpit, these things sound like either horrible advice or horrendous plans.His lies distort reality for his followers, causing them to believe absurd things. This produces a great deal of confusion and conflict.He alienates our allies abroad (except Israel,) and comforts our enemies (except Iran). He undermines the alliances and military chain of command that have defended America since WWII.I could go on much longer, but if he is re-elected in November, the USA will no longer be a republic. Original question: Do you think that the media is historically escalating division & polarization within the USA? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes but not for any grand conspiracy. Media (specifically news media) like any form of entertainment makes its money from people consuming that media. In the case of news these days they are hyper dependent on your continued patronage to survive financially. Think of the media like \u201cThe Matrix\u201d. They want to keep people complacent and feeding them (in this case its your eyeballs and attention that leads them to getting advertisers). Subscription revenue is a hard game so its all about keeping your attention. Their primary enemy is apathy. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are left wing emotional or right wing emotional as long as you keep coming back to feed off of what they have to say they will survive. If you lose interest spend time walking your dog instead of patronizing their content they got problems. For the last couple of weeks my house has been in the danger zone for the fires. During that time I subscribed to all sorts of media to make sure that the fires were not going to require me to leave my house, to seek guidance for what I should do in these fearful times etc\u2026 The second that fire became a non issue for my area as far as potential risk of loss of life/property I stopped looking at all that related media. If the general population does this to a particular media outlet they go under. And unfortunately for all of us (them included) is that if the population doesn\u2019t feel like they are fearful for their future they have a tendency to place their attention elsewhere. It\u2019s not that CNN wants to filter their content, create click bait headlines and slant largely left and feed constant alarming messages. They have no choice. In business the responsible thing is to serve your consumers and receive money so you can scale and serve even more people. The second CNN and other outlets can\u2019t effectively keep you emotionally engaged they are sunk. And also unfortunately for us they have gotten really good at learning how to survive and cut through the noise by being exactly what they are. Bad stuff happening is not bad enough. They have to convince you that the other half of the nation that has the differing politically party preference as you is impossibly corrupt and wants to destroy your way of life. The fault is not with the news network, the fault is with us. Its kind of like the reference in The Matrix where the Matrix informs Neo that they tried to create a bliss but people just wouldn\u2019t believe it. In our case unless we are anxious, angry or have some other very visceral emotion we won\u2019t consume as much of their content which costs them money and threatens their survival. Yes the media pits everyone against each other because of they just said everything is fine then we would be spending even more time watching Netflix as they disappeared from relevance. Seriously just think about it for one second. If you didn\u2019t have any news channels what-so-ever or if there was never any political news, how different would your life really be? What would you do with all that extra free time? ",

Subliminal brainwashing of people of color into thinking that they are under-privileged, under-resourced, always the hardest hit target of any calamity (weather, virus, economy). It\u2019s mind numbing. I won\u2019t be surprised if CNN comes out with a report saying Black people are affected by sunburns more than any other race. ",
