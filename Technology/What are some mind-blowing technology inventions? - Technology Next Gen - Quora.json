You can control them from anywhere with a simple touch on your mobile phone. The latest smart devices can be controlled with motion and voice control. It is just like in the sci-fi movies. Imagine coming home and the porch lights light up thanks to their motion sensor. Or asking a smart speaker to turn off the lights when you are too tired to get up and switch them off! This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to IoT devices. Security has seen a massive update in the past years and continues to grow smarter. Hope this helped. Happy reading! :) ",
