            "answer_text": "1. To Collaborate in Real Time Remember when Google Docs broke onto the scene? It was magic. Students writing and sharing in real-time, able to see what the other students are doing and saying, while still working on your own part of the project or activity. Flash forward 7-8 years and now \u201creal-time collaboration\u201d is a must for most online software. This type of technology allow project-based learning to be monitored, documented, and done outside of the school hours. At my school we have been using Microsoft OneNote (as well as the Google products) to collaborate in real-time. Whether it is staff planning together, students working together, or a combination of both\u2026this technology has so many learning purposes. 2. To Reflect and Share I used to have my students journal in their marble notebooks. And during certain activities I still do (like Writer\u2019s Bootcamp). However, what\u2019s nice about having students journal online and share \u201cin the cloud\u201d is the ability for their classmates to see what they have to say. This is why I suggest blogging throughout the year, and not just as a project. Make blogging a part of your student\u2019s life and you\u2019ll be able to see which topics, ideas, projects, and activities really impacted them. Sometimes it may not be what you thought\u2026and sometimes their simple act of sharing will bring the class together in ways you never could have imagined. 3. Better Research After I finished writing my Master\u2019s thesis on \u2018peace education in the 21st century\u2019 I talked with my mom about her writing process in graduate school. It sounded awful\u2026 She would have to go to the library, find a resource, read almost the entire resource, make copies of the pages she wanted to use, and literally \u201ccut it out\u201d and \u201cpaste it on\u201d her typewritten document. Technology has made research simple and more time efficient. I\u2019m not talking about typing a question into google, I\u2019m specifically focused on searching journal databases like ERIC through places like Ebscohost. A nice search phrase will turn up hundreds of peer-reviewed results which can be sorted many different ways (such as by date or full-text article). Those articles that you choose can then be automatically scanned for your keywords, read the specific parts you want, and use what is applicable with a simple copy and paste and proper citation already set up and ready to go. How often do we really teach students how to research in today\u2019s world? Or do we expect them to learn on their own like we did? 4. Write and Re-Write Using tools such as Google Docs, the new Microsoft Word, or Draft students are able to write and edit on the fly. They can get feedback from peers and teachers\u2026and then choose whether or not to accept that feedback on their writing. Technology has changed the writing process in much the same way it has changed the research process. The most important part of writing is the revising and editing. Yet, we often take it for granted. Instead let\u2019s use the technology to track what types of changes students have made, and if they are making the same mistakes in their writing over and over again. That way, the \u201cre-writing\u201d process can have a direct impact on how much they improve and change some of their writing habits over time. 5. Make Something (that matters) This may be my favorite way to use technology with a purpose. Students now have the ability to make movies, songs, pieces of art, websites, apps, games etc\u2013with technology. However, too often we ask students to make something that does not matter. We ask them to make a movie or poster or presentation that has no direct impact on the world around them. Instead, let\u2019s challenge ourselves to start making technology matter. Make iMovies that can be uploaded to Youtube and have a purpose. Make games with a meaning. Make apps that matter. Yes, there is a time for fun and games. But if that is all we use technology for in school\u2026then we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when that is all students use technology for once they get out of school. 6. Keep a Digital Record Digital portfolios are a must. Not because colleges will want and need them in the future (which is happening sooner than you think). Not because it is a cool way to show off what you\u2019ve done in class. Digital portfolios are a must because they show learning growth. The best way to show how much a student has learned is through a digital portfolio. You can look back over time and what they\u2019ve created, written, and done in school. And how that work has improved (and in what ways) throughout their schooling. When students know their work will be on display and recorded, they also take pride in what they do because it will last. Ask yourself, are you making \u201cdigital fridge art\u201d or something worth keeping? 7. Mastery Assessments Think about the last time you gave an assessment. I\u2019m sure you prepared students for it during class, gave them materials to study, and supported them during the assessment. However, there were definitely a few students who struggled on this assessment. What happens next? You can either give them a re-take, give them another similar assessment, or say that is there only chance. ",

            "answer_text": "By attempting to make the most out of it, i.e., maximising the benefits and minimising the costs (financial, operational, ethical, etc.). The most important, I believe, is to not lose track of the Kantian imperative and to view people as the only ends in themselves. That is, a wise use of technology is one where the human being is always the ultimate goal. Let me give you an example from my field, that of voice cloning technology. Respeecher is meant to help content creators use voices in new and exciting ways, and to offer them more creative control over their projects. To this end, we combine classical digital signal processing algorithms with proprietary deep generative modeling techniques to learn your target voice inside and out. Now, a not-so-wise use of voice synthesis is deception - deepfakes can be used in order to manipulate people into believing that someone said something they didn\u2019t. This is unwise in the sense of being unethical. However, we do allow non-deceptive use of the voices of historical figures and politicians, such as Richard Nixon and Barack Obama. We conducted with a team of researchers, journalists, and artists at MIT a project which presents an alternate history of the first trip to the Moon, which ends with the unfortunate stranding on the Moon of the two astronauts. You can actually listen to a deepfake discourse of president Nixon, informing people about the tragic outcome. But it\u2019s non-deceptive because everything is labeled \u201can alternate history\u201d. So basically we at Respeecher equate wisdom with non-deception, i.e., with granting people the benefit of accurate knowledge as to who said what when. ",
