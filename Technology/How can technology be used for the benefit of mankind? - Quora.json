Finally, we searched the Problem ;)  Problem: In Colleges, We have seen many student were not using the dustbin properly. They were too lazy to open the Lid of the Dustbin for throwing the waste, thereby they littered around the Dustbin.  [Source: Dawn] This problem was noticed at public places too.  Solution: We have came up with a solution. The solution was our SMARTBIN. This SmartBin will automatically open for 5 seconds when you come near the SmartBin. When the Bin will be full, it will send the message to the authorized person that \u201cThe BIN IS FULL\u201d. The authorized person will come and empty the bin. It has Two LED's: Green and Red. Green: Everything is Normal. Red: The Bin is Full.  A Glimpse of our SmartBin.  [Source: My Camera :)]  Demonstration Video:   Now, you will be eager to know that Who are We? We are Manish Sharma Pritesh Pawar Akash Prajapati Sandesh Sawant  Thanks For Reading :) ",
