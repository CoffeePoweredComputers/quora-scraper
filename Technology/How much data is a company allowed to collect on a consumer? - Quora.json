            "answer_text": "As much as they want. There are really no limits what a company can collect. As much as you give them, and they can buy from firms who are scouring the internet gathering up bits and pieces of your information. Now, some firms are regulated in what they can DISCLOSE about you. This is particularly true in law enforcement/legal arena, where privacy laws were established in the 1960s to protect sensitive information. And in the medical field, we all deal with HIPAA when we go to the doctor and sign all those forms. That controls what they can disclose about you. A lot of firms have privacy policies that they voluntarily implement to limit the data they can share. Not regulated as such, but if a firm violates their stated privacy policy that can open them up to civil litigation, so they are serious about it. And remember, privacy laws generally control what SOME GROUP can do in RELEASING your information. So, for example, your doctor can\u2019t tell anyone what condition you suffer from. But if you tell ME, I can tell the world because HIPAA only applies to health care professionals. And while the police will NOT release some data about your legal troubles, tell your friend and they can tell the world. So privacy is not absolute. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, as much as they want. The one caveat to this would be consent. If you are located in certain areas (e.g. EU), you need to obtain the consent of a consumer prior to collecting their information. However, if you do obtain this consent properly, you can collect pretty much anything you\u2019d like. ",
