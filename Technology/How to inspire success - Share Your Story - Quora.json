            "answer_text": "One thing I have understood about success. YOU can be inspired by success, but that will not make you successful. I am not successful, will I be one day?

When you want monetary success in life you have to be willing to give up certain things. I inspire to be successful just like you inspire to be successful, but what do I give up that you don\u2019t? Motivation only lasts so long, it slowly dissipates, to \u201cinspire\u201d success you need DETERMINATION. Determination is what will outlast motivation or any other word you can come up with to \u201cinspire success\u201d. \u201cI AM determined to be successful in ______\u201d is something that I tell myself upon waking up each morning and I ask myself each night before I got to sleep. Try it for yourself. It takes 30-days (actually 21 to re-wire our brains, but I like to day 30). After 30-days, let me know if your thinking is different. Take care!! ",
