            "answer_text": "Impossible to answer - OR, alas - you can answer almost any way you like, and your answer will be inadequate, but lots of people will accept it without criticism - but the question is MUCH TOO LARGE - because - (i) you do not specify what you mean by \u201cthe recent past\u201d - months ? years ? decades ? generations ? centuries ? millennia ? -and (ii) there have been vast quantities of changes in technologies, and (iii) the changes can affect the environment in many different ways, some very non obvious, subtle or with long delays, and hence (iv) it takes a long time for people to become aware of these changes, such that our knowledge of such impacts is always partial, and (v) there are a lot of people out there who are trying to fool us - and some of them are succeeding - for various devious political reasons - e.g. the Anthropogenic Global Warming scare was initiated in order to frighten the rich world into giving lots of money to the poor world - as though pushing large sums of money around is an economically clever way of achieving anything - and/and/and/ \u2026.

            "answer_text": "I must declare both nuclear detonations on Japan in World War II a severe environmental change caused by technological change beyond high-yield chemical explosives. Yes, it wasn't global, but the localized effects of detonation and fallout were devastating. Beyond imagination. This is why countries like Iran are banned as the world cannot trust them to be responsible stewards of this fearsome weapon. The human toll and environmental Carnage from even one modern (15\u201320) Kiloton nuclear bomb is horrifying.  ",
