            "answer_text": "Clarify your \u201cfuture\u201d first ! Near future, like 5\u201310 years? Or very long future? Assuming that mankind will not be terminated by bad luck, such as \u201ccomic death ray\u201d, \u201cplanet size meteor\u201d, \u201cnuclear war\u201d\u2026. and that we keep growing technically and economically like the 80s and 90s, then here is my speculation : The nature of Politics will never change, but its expression did change and will. I mean there will always be \u201cleaders\u201d vs \u201cfollowers\u201d, \u201cwinners\u201d vs \u201cloosers\u201d\u2026 , but it will be less and less aggressive, desperate, cruel.. In the past tribes / nations / classes clashed barbarically. Rulers were so brutal. Sheerly using brute force, no need for \u201chuman right\u201d etc..Then there was democracy, republic, federalism, socialism. \u2026 etc, people was rules more humanly.In the ( quite far ) future, where technology are so advanced, where productivity are so high ( car are as cheap as toilet paper today) , where population are so under control, where religions are almost zero important, where cultures converge \u2026 \u2026 By that time, there will be not much need for war, president, military but maybe polices to protect people from sickos.. Because, there is not much to fight for. Well, there might still be some sort of board-of-president to help people. There might be still some kind of military to protect mankind from external threat \u2026 Basically, it is like paradise, where even politic is a \u201ctrivial\u201d matterP/S: Hell, my english is so weak to describe this :( ",

            "answer_text": "Our politics is moving with only one motive that is how to get power once and how to hold it for long terms by unfair means. Indian political system is over crowded with criminals.Common people are afraid of politicians as they afraid of gangsters.  Women from various social organizations stage a silent and non-violent sit-in protest against the criminalization of politics near Parliament House in New Delhi Crime and politics in India are so intertwined that a \u201cclean politician\u201d sounds like an oxymoron, a breed that no longer exists. This fact hits home even harder as the world\u2019s largest democracy, and, with 1.3 billion people, the second most populous nation after China, gears up for a high-octane election in 2019 to determine the fate of the ruling Narendra Modi government. Democracy is thriving in India, with 554 million voters queuing up at over 900,000 stations to cast their ballots in 2014 to determine the fortunes of 8,250 candidates representing 464 political parties. But all is not well with the country\u2019s polity. Corruption is striking at the very root of the democratic ethos, with nationwide surveys highlighting the extent of the rot. According to a report released this April by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a nonprofit that works on electoral and political reform, a total of 1,580 Members of Parliament (MPs) and Member of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs), or approximately 33 percent of the legislators in India\u2019s Parliament and state assemblies, have criminal cases pending against them.
