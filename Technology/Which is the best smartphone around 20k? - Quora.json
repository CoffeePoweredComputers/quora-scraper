            "answer_text": "If I have to narrow it down to one smartphone, I would strongly recommend the Moto G5 plus. It is an amazing phone. I've been using it for about 4\u20135 months now and it hasn't lagged once. It comes with Android 7 out of the box and is awaiting the Android 8 udgrade. It has 32 gb memory and the phone comes with a 5.20-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels at a PPI of 424 pixels per inch. The Motorola Moto G5 Plus is powered by 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor and it comes with 4GB of RAM. I've heard some reviews which say that it has an overheating issue but I have not experienced anything of that sort. It comes packed with Moto assistant which gives you the liberty to add gestures like shake for camera and one touch nav. In all, it is a good experience packed in a full metal body. ",
