            "answer_text": "There are two ways to look at the problem: (A) Technology will make great leaps forward, and broad AI approaching fully human capabilities will become commonplace, or (B) average human thinking skills will atrophy to the point that we can be readily out-reasoned by a toaster or electric blender. I think that perhaps there is the thinnest glimmer of a possibility that (A) will come to pass by 2050, but like most pronouncements you see in the media I suspect that it too will be over-hyped and fail to deliver when examined closely. Sadly, (B) is the more likely scenario \u2014 witness how often I have to address the same question, over-and-over again. It all boils down to just how simplistic your definition of \u201chuman-like\u201d is; a human face on a box of Wheaties might meet all of your requirements. ",

            "answer_text": "No, this is a common misunderstanding of what AI is and is not. AI (which is called machine learning by those who work with it) will never \u201cthink.\u201d Machine learning does data analysis of large amounts of data and then writes some programming code to take advantage of the findings in the data. It still is a computer driven program that is written by humans to enhance data analysis. So it possesses no human thinking qualities and most likley never will. The hype created around the term Artificial Intelligence is the best example of Artificial Thinking. It is just not true. ",
