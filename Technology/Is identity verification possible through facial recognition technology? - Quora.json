            "answer_text": "There is difference between face recognition and face identification. In case of recognition the intelligent algorithm simply recognize the objects, person. It\u2019s pre-trained on the given set to recognize the items or any thing. But in case of face identification the intelligent algorithm is able to identify the person or place etc. i.e. person A, person B according to self intuition when training done or not done (for model). But the advancement and enhancement in intelligent algorithms, deep learning technologies and feature extraction helps to perform person identity verification through facial recognition. It\u2019s not completely true for identification purpose because bias will be possible in many cases. But further improvisation and enhancement in features extraction, mathematical modelling of algorithms and advancements in deep learning technology helps to achieve the identity verification through facial recognition by mapping the individual details like (SSN number or any unique id to (no-sql) database) and API call execute the result in form of identity.
