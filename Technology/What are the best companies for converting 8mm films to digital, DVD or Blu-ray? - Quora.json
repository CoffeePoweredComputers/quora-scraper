One of my specialties is the conversion of 8mm, super 8mm, and 16mm film to digital. I see most of the responses are advertisements. A Google search will find me in Murray, Utah. I don\u2019t want to toot my own horn. There are good and honest services out there. My suggestions to anyone wanting his movies transferred to be aware of the large assembly-line companies supported by major warehouses and drugstores. You don\u2019t get what you pay for. I\u2019ve redone some of their poor work. You need to find someone who has state-of-the-art equipment, know-how on its use, and personal attention to your project. There\u2019s more to a good transfer than just frame-for-frame capturing the some 80 frames per foot of film. There\u2019s the timing, color correcting, and even the reduction of grain. Don\u2019t try to project your film on an old projector as you may damage it and add additional scratches. If you want to try out a company\u2019s service consider sending them a single roll of film for a test. Talk to a knowledgable person in the company who can explain the process and what you can expect. Consider what you want to do with the transfer - edit it, pull still frames, put it on the internet, etc. and make sure you have the proper files to achieve this. If you have film material that is worth preserving, don\u2019t think that once it is transferred it is permanent. Common DVDs, blu-rays fade with time - hard drives and thumb drives are not permanent storage. I suggests to my customers that they consider storing their finished media on a DVD or Blu-ray M-Disc that has a thousand year expected life. I also suggest that silent home movies become much more meaningful when a soundtrack is added - not just music but commentary by knowledgable family members. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, why do you want Blu-Ray?  The fact of the matter is that whether the final outcome is Blu-Ray, Standard DVD or External Hard Drive, the quality of the transfer is the most important thing. The biggest company is YesVideo.  They have deals with Costco, Sam's and Walgreens. However the knock on them is that prices are high it takes a long time, and their customer service leaves something to be desired. http://www.scandigital.com/ Is a company that has been growing a lot over the past few years, and they have a deal with Groupon.  This means that if you find a current deal you can get $100 worth of 8mm transfer for $40.  They do have a backlog as a result of this deal, but the quality is good. http://www.homemoviedepot is also a great option.  They have a product called the Easy Box that you can fill with all your media (within limits), they offer standard DVD's, Blu-Ray or transfer to an external hard drive.  The HDD (external drive) is the best bet, because they give you the uncompressed files to use for editing, or just as backup. ",
