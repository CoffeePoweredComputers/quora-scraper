            "answer_text": "Shower heads that don\u2019t work like a watering can A nearly 200-year-old design still powers almost every shower head today. But three small companies are now actively working to disrupt it. Since the early 1800s, shower heads have worked like a garden watering can: they\u2019ve made their spray by dropping water through small holes. For nearly two centuries, nearly every shower head ever made has followed this antique design. For example, here is a display of shower heads from the 1907 catalog of J.L. Mott Iron Works, which look conceptually similar, at least, to those you might find at a hardware store today:  While some of today\u2019s shower heads now deliver pulsing, aerated, or droplet-laden sprays, their basic design concept has still remained the same. As CEO Philip Winter of shower head startup Nebia noted in 2015: \"Showers have been the same for [over] 100 years. ... there\u2019s no meaningful innovation here. It\u2019s dominated by a handful of players ... mostly private multi-generational companies.\" Three companies have now disrupted this conventional design However, beginning in 2004, three companies - Methven, High Sierra Showerheads (with whom I work), and Nebia - all came up with radical alternatives to this design, by introducing new nozzles that either collide or atomize water. One key factor behind this sudden burst of shower head innovation, some 200 years later, is sustainability. In a world concerned about climate change and fresh water scarcity, all of these new designs use notably less water - and thus also less energy to heat that water - than most conventionally designed shower heads ... as much as 50% less! Yet, while saving water and energy, these innovations also attempt to deliver an equivalent or better showering experience. Most shower heads in the USA today use either 2.5 gallons per minute (\u201cgpm\u201d) or 2.0 gpm, the EPA WaterSense standard for high-efficiency low-flow shower heads. In contrast, nearly all of these reinvented designs use no more than 1.8 gpm, with many using even far less \u2013 as little as 1.25 gpm. More about these new designs Here are the stories of these three companies and their reimagined shower head designs, along with the shipping dates of their first products: 1. Methven (acquired in 2019 by the GWA Group), since 2004 Methven\u2019s shower heads use two different 'external collision' techniques to generate droplet sprays. One of these techniques collides adjacent sprays, while the second collides its sprays against surfaces on the shower head body. Video of Methven\u2019s Aurajet-based Rua design:  This company, whose global head office is located in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city, was founded in 1886 as an iron and brass foundry. Methven made munitions for the WWII war effort and home bathroom fixtures in the building boom that followed, and now owns patents on two shower spray technologies. In 2004, they began shipping products based on their Satinjet technology, which collides water from two adjoining nozzles to create a droplet spray. Satinjet shower heads are in 80,000 hotel rooms worldwide. Methven launched a second shower spray technology in 2015 called Aurajet, in which invisible nozzles generate individual jets of water that collide against angled surfaces hidden within the contours of the halo-shaped showerhead. The company asserts this design delivers 20% more spray force and twice the amount of water contact on the skin than a conventional showerhead. Depending on the model, these shower heads, which sell at higher price points than those based on the Satinjet design, are rated to use as little as 5.0 litres per minute (lpm) (approximately 1.3 gpm), while others use up to 9.0 lpm (approximately 2.3 gpm). The Aurajet\u2019s design has twice been updated and improved since its launch with the Aurajet Aio and the Aurajet-based Rua, the latter introduced in part via an October 2017 Kickstarter campaign. Led by former Brita executive David Banfield, Methven has expanded into Australia, China, and recently the UK, and in its 2017-18 fiscal year had annual revenues of 105 million New Zealand Dollars (approximately $71 million USD), from sales of shower heads and other \u201ctapware\u201d products. In April 2019, Methven was acquired via a friendly takeover by the GWA Group, an Australian bathroom and kitchen products company. 2. High Sierra Showerheads, since 2009 The shower head models made by High Sierra Showerheads, based in Coarsegold, near California\u2019s Yosemite National Park, all use an internal collision technique to generate a droplet spray, by splitting water into two streams and then colliding them back together. Video of two of High Sierra\u2019s models, fixed and handheld:  High Sierra\u2019s design was first used on the golf course, as a handheld spray nozzle for watering greens. It was then adapted for use in household and commercial shower heads. Inventor and company founder David Malcolm's design splits water into two streams via a pin, then collides them via the shower head\u2019s large, concave nozzle opening. This invention makes it the world\u2019s only shower head featuring just a single nozzle; all others require multiple nozzles to make their spray. Shower heads based on this design, patented in 2007, have been sold by the company since 2009. All of High Sierra\u2019s models share the same nozzle, which creates a conical spray of large, heavy, high-kinetic energy droplets at fixed flow rates of either 1.25, 1.5, 1.8, or 2.0 gpm. They have particular appeal to institutional customers, as despite their significant water savings, their spray is also consistently strong. And their simple, straight-through design has proven to be nearly clog-free, even with hard water minerals. Yale University, The Ohio State University, and the US Air Force Academy are among High Sierra\u2019s notable recent purchasers, as are a growing number of Planet Fitness locations (200+ to date). Creating new designs for water spray nozzles runs through the last two generations of the Malcolm family. During his career of over 30 years, David\u2019s father, Richard, also designed irrigation nozzles for companies like Rain Bird, Buckner, and his own firm, Weather Tec. High Sierra is family-owned and privately held, with between $1 and $2 million in annual revenue in 2018. Alongside its institutional sales, it sells its products to retail customers via the Internet. Their most affordable model \u2013 which has long been on Amazon\u2019s \u201cBest Rated in Fixed Showerheads\u201d list \u2013 starts at a price point comparable to that of Methven\u2019s Satinjet-based models, and considerably lower than that of both Methven\u2019s Aurajet-based models and all of Nebia\u2019s (below). 3. Nebia, since 2017 The high-end (and relatively high-cost) \u201cshower system\u201d created by the most recent entrant into this market, Nebia, seeks to provide an immersive, spa-like experience via atomizing nozzles that generate mists of tiny, high-velocity droplets. Video of Nebia\u2019s initial product launch:  Nebia is notably backed by Apple CEO Tim Cook and the family foundation of Eric Schmidt, former Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google's parent). Headquartered in San Francisco, it\u2019s steeped in the Silicon Valley, with engineers drawn from Stanford University and other Valley stalwarts, a wave of publicity in the tech press at its August 2015 launch, and $3.1 million in Kickstarter pre-orders. The company's initial product, which was announced in August 2015 and began shipping to pre-order customers in January 2017, was the most radically re-imagined of all of these designs: it uses multiple atomizing nozzles on a halo-shaped overhead unit, together with a removable shower wand, to envelop the showerer in a warm, misty cloud of tiny, high-velocity droplets. At its most frugal setting, it uses a mere 0.7 gpm, 72% less water than a conventional 2.5 gpm shower head. (At its max setting, it uses 1.3 gpm.) The version 2.0 product, highly similar in design concept but featuring \"brand new proprietary nozzles\" to increase spray warmth, coverage, and forcefulness, while using as little as 0.9 gpm, was announced in February 2019, in conjunction with a partnership with bathroom products giant Moen (a Fortune Brands subsidiary). It drew $1.9 million in additional Kickstarter pre-orders, and started shipping in June 2019. Nebia\u2019s third generation product, branded as \u201cNebia by Moen,\u201d was introduced via yet another Kickstarter campaign in January 2020. Its prices were significantly reduced, and customers were also given the option of buying a configuration with just the overhead unit, without the removable shower wand. The company called this iteration \u201cthe product we envisioned\u201d when they initially launched, nearly five years earlier. Based on the company\u2019s claims about savings relative to a 2.5 gpm benchmark, this newest product uses 1.375 gpm when only the overhead unit is in operation, and 1.75 gpm when used in combo mode with the shower wand. Nebia\u2019s unique design draws its inspiration from atomizing nozzles used in the aerospace, agricultural, and automotive industries. (Interestingly, it may also have some spiritual roots in Buckminster Fuller's 1927 design for a \u201cfog gun.\u201d) The genesis of Nebia\u2019s own design came from two years of work begun in Mexico in 2010, by fitness club executive Carlos Gomez Andonaegui and his father Emilio, an IBM country representative, to develop a water-saving shower head. Their connection with Nebia CEO Philip Winter, when he was formerly working with an NGO, Endeavor, and their subsequent meeting in the San Francisco Bay Area with Apple engineer Gabriel Parisi-Amon, led to the company\u2019s founding.
