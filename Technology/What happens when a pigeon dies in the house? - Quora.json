If you leave it, then as with any dead animal or human, it will start to decompose, it will smell and become maggot infested. ",

Roll the pigeon in the flour. Place the bird in an oven . Cook until done. Eat bird. If eating a pigeon is not on your list of things to do, dispose of dead bird as soon as possible. ",
