            "answer_text": "Thanks Eastwood for the question \"What is the cheapest phone I can get that is still decent?\" What's decent, depend on your need and they may even change when you read my sincere advice... And you need also to think extra smart, to find the best value phone... I live in Sweden, but I guess most phone shops and phone service companies work in the same way... They get normally the best profit, on very expensive phone models and people find also these models extra attractive, so they almost only offer too expensive phones... And if you get a deal with a \"free\" phone, must you in time pay most of what that phone actually cost, except some of the price reduction the phone company get... That may sound as a good idea, but the result is dramatically worse, than if you buy the service and phone separate... The best value alternatives are also very hard to find in shops, who naturally get a bigger profit, on very expensive models... But you can find excellent phones at 30% of the normal price, if you use a price comparison site... I have for example a lovely phone of a very fine brand with a 6inch fullHD screen, place for an optional microSD card and the extremely valuable USB mass storage, that I bought new for 190 euro and I pay only 14 euro a month for free calls, free sms and 8gb data traffic. But which phone that is best for you depend on your taste, except the vital functionality below... And a really fine smartphone cost normally 600 to 999 euro in shops, but you can easy find very fine to truly excellent alternatives for only 120 to 300 euro in web stores, with help of following smart ways... Use simply an advanced price comparing site, to find the truly great alternatives at the best price and then can you look for an even better price, with another price comparing site... This happen because shops make a lot more money when they sell more expensive models, so most shops never show the really great low cost alternative models, even if you often can order them* in the same shops web store! *And you may naturally wonder why the phone makers and online shops offer these great low price alternatives? It's only because they know you really are looking around and they naturally want you to buy something from them and not from another maker or site... Select then a smartphone with Android 6 or higher (mainly because iPhone's are actually about 4 times more expensive, without offering any real advantages) and a 5 inch 294ppi 720x1280 screen to 7 inch 315ppi FullHD screen (because 300ppi is the max you can see with perfect eyesight and more, force only the graphic processor to work harder and draw normally more battery) from a known brand (as Huawei, Xiaomi, Sony, Nokia, Asus, Lenovo / Moto / Motorola, Oppo, Oneplus, ZTE, TCL or Alcatel) and finally should you naturally check any model you may buy, with help of the really deep reviews at - www.GSMarena.com - and - www.phonearena.com - plus customer reviews... Practically all those phones can take very fine photos (even if you have to zoom with your feet) and they are normally very good in all other aspects too... But if you want to keep the phone more than 3 years and maybe give it away later, is it best if the battery is removable... Because it cost extra if they first have to remove the screen, to be able to change the battery and it may also damage the screen, when they do that! And if you want to use the phone for smart mobile data storage... So you always can bring all your important document, photos and more... And then access them completely on a PC just like an external drive... Then must the phone also have a microSD slot, a fine card (the best is Samsung Pro Endurance cards, that last 25 times longer) and be possible to connect to a PC in the rare \"USB mass storage\" mode... Because the default dumb slow \"Media Transfer Protocol\" mode, does not allow you to edit any file in your phone from your PC and MTP don't even let you view picture files in your phone, as thumbs in your PC so you can only copy or move files! But it is very hard to find info about this, except that OTG make this possible in some phones, so you must simply test if a phone have this valuable possibility... By connecting it with a normal two way USB cable (not one that only charge) to any PC and see if you can select USB mass storage... Some say that you can also put almost any phone with a microSD slot (??) in the half secret USB debugging mode (go Settings > About Phone > Software info > tap \"Build Number\" 7 times > go back to Settings > open the new \"Developer Option\" and tap check USB debugging > connect finally to your PC with a complete two ways otg / file transfer USB cable and select also \"Always allow from this computer\" if it shows) and then may you get USB mass storage... Please message me if that work on a max 300 euro phone with a 5.5 to 6.5 inch screen, or if you know anything more about that... I know anyhow that some phones from Huawei and Lenovo / Moto / Motorola (same company now) offer this great rare USB mass storage... And Sony can also do that to one computer, with help of the extra Sony program PC companion. A note to Quora... This is a direct answer on the question (a different answer would simply be wrong or missing vital info) originally written by me to help everyone find a great smartphone, based on my deep experience and NOTHING is copied from anyone else! And I'm from Sweden, so I may write slightly strange... But I hope my answer will be a great help, anyhow! ",
