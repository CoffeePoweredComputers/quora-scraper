            "answer_text": "Ahhh the nebulous \u201cwe\u201d question. Since it literally means what ever demographic you want it to the answer is yes. Mostly because, even though 5G coverage is currently small, said phones will still be getting coverage wherever LTE and older coverage is available. That means your office buddy that goes rock climbing on the weekend or those construction workers you drove by, and saw only one out of ten actually working while the rest leaned on shovels, would still benefit from having a more rugged phone than the rest of us.

That implies your office amigo that goes rock jumping toward the end of the week or those development laborers you drove by, and saw just one out of ten really working while the lay inclined toward scoops, would in any case profit by having a more tough telephone than most of us.

A case is better because you can easily replace the case.. but with a rugged phone, the phone will become very ugly over a period of time and you can't remove the shell of the phone and swap it that easily.
