            "answer_text": "Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are: Common human coronaviruses 229E (alpha coronavirus)NL63 (alpha coronavirus)OC43 (beta coronavirus)HKU1 (beta coronavirus)Other human coronaviruses MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS)2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)People around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. ",

CoV-2 is a \u2018selective\u2019 mutator which utilizes the brains of its victims to help \u2018naturally\u2019 select out the weaker. less successful sub-strains of itself for transmission to other humans.

            "answer_text": "Remember SARS, back in 2002, that was a coronavirus that hopped over from bats to civets, which is a cat-like mammal, and then over humans. And in 2012 there was MERS, which was a coronavirus that hopped from bats to camels a few decades ago and then circulated among camels for quite some time before infecting humans. So what's the likely source of the Wuhan coronavirus? Well, it looks like it also ultimately cam from bats. Now, the way this happens is that a sick animal, let's say a sick bat, sheds the virus in their urine and poop and that can get aerosolized and inhaled readmore ",
