            "answer_text": "Wireless Ethernet is a standard for wireless networking within an organization or a home. It is also known as a WiFi network. It is a popular counterpart to wired Ethernet. It uses high-frequency radio waves to communicate and transmit data. Installation flexibility, increased productivity, scalability, reduced cost of ownership, quick and simple network set up- are the reasons to use a wireless LAN instead of a wired network connection. A wireless Ethernet network consists of Ethernet ports, wireless NICs, hubs, and switches. ",

            "answer_text": "Wireless Ethernet is most likely WI FI. Wire and Wi Fi use same data structure but have different rules on how traffic passes. Wired uses Collision Detection (listens for silence and jumps in but if two devices think the cable line is silent and both hear that another is on the same line broadcasting the same time, both stop, set a random timer and tries again. Wifi uses Collision Avoidance (asking router if it is safe to transmit. If permitted, it transmits otherwise waits till it is told it is safe. So though they are similar in many ways, there are subtle differences between the two. ",
