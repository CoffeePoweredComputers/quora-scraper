            "answer_text": "Not totally serious {tongue in cheek, sarcastic} reply: If the internet were to shut down today - long term - the first thing that would happen is that everyone would be in a state of shock because they wouldn't be able to get their facebook and twitter updates. Some folks would start weeping when they realize that no longer would they be updated that their favorite celebrity posted a picture of themselves standing on a corner waiting to cross the street - but looking good in Jimmy choos and expensive jeans. A tweet would be the sound a bird makes and many would remember the times when the only popular tweet was \"tweety bird\" from loony tunes. Folks would dread the fact that they sold or donated the encyclopedias that used to be the way to find information because google and wikipedia would be unavailable. Libraries would see an uptick in subscribers and one of the most popular trending terms would be \"The dewey decimal system\".....through word of mouth. Google and Wikipedia would merge and become larger than the \"Library of Congress\" as a resource of information with annexes across the globe where patrons pay a monthly fee to access the stored information, becoming a hangout spot similar to starbucks where information is gained. Letters start to be written again but with unbelievable spelling errors. Since google's spelling assistance and automated spelcheck arent as accessable, people once again have to memorize the proper way to spell words. The memorization of phone numbers also upswing's as smart phones don't sell as well without internet access. English teachers and especially skilled voice coaches and acting teachers would have a phenomenal increase in the need of their talents because all of the celebrities whose claim to fame was \"facebook\" exposure, would now have to develop a skill to keep their incomes high. At home Teila Tequila gets on her knees thanking her higher power that this happened after she became famous. Amazon would buy the US postal system because people would still want stuff but since web commerce is no more, people would be forced to use snailmail to get the things that they want. Amazon improves efficiency sooo much that the shares that the US post office kept in the deal to Amazon, grows to an amount that satisfies half of the 10 trillion debt that the United States has on its books. Since online buying of stuff is no longer possible they would also buy up 500 cable channels turning them into the ultimate QVC and HSN's (home shopping Network) channels. Ebay does the same by buying up another 500 cable channels. The new \"Amazon shopping channel's\" and \"Ebay shopping channel's\" are born. For the first time in TV history something is always on, even if its only a channel selling something. When the channels go live, credit card issuers wipe their proverbial brow's as impulse spending slowly go back to former amounts. Netflix goes back to sending out Dvd's and Blurays because streaming video is no longer possible, but they have to sue Amazon first because Amazon has a monopoly on postal service and Amazon has to be forced to deliver a competitors items. They do, as the Federal Trade Commission steps in. The folks in the darknet that made their careers by doing all types of backroom stuff, would find out that all of the McDonalds, Burger King and other entry level jobs are already taken, forcing them to put on Suits and tie's to get the remaining tech jobs that may hire someone with their experience. Wall street is interested. Cd sales experience an serious rise in sales as downloading them goes to zero and the investment of the day are cd pressing plants as more needs to be built. All of the record companies contact AOL not because of their past position as the #1 internet service provider but because they also held the title as the most prolific user/purchaser of cd's - remember those AOL cd's that you got in the mail. How they did it is really important today. We gotta start making cd's. Conversely more albums are created with really bad \"Side B\" tracks since albums are again sold by the cd and not singular tracks - good bye itunes and 0.99 cents single track buying. Blockbuster again becomes relevant as people, still wanting an instant gratification experience by getting their videos \"now\" move blockbuster to reopen locations around the world. Lines are formed around the corner as former \"darknet'ers\" succumb to being in such close proximity to the movies that they formerly traded online and try to get employment. Conversely global warming gasses increase because of all of the cars that now fill blockbuster parking lots - families weekend blockbuster rental days start again. Its possible the increase's are countered by the electricity no longer needed by all of the servers and equipment that used to make the internet work. Mom and pop video rental stores also experience a upswing. They mainly specialize in pornography because the free access to porn online is no more and Blockbuster, Netflix and Amazon don't do porn. Mom and pops stores are renting porn, causing an outcry by AARP because they feel that the occupation is beneath their values. Mom and pops fight back as they can now afford many of the things that they once could not. People faces start glowing, not by the glow of their smartphones while looking down.....walking down the street....not looking where they are going, but by the joke told to them by someone standing in front of them - LOL is an actual thing and not just something at the end of a text. Landlines start being sold again. The need to be umbilically tied to their phones so they can be updated constantly to facebook and twitter is no more, but since there aren't any more voip services, prices increase. The NSA realizes that all of the free information given by folks who were constantly posting all types of questionable and unbelievable information on the web would make all of the computers that they had dedicated to sifting through all of this web created info...useless. Instead of mothballing them they decide to reorganize all of the extra computers and create \"NSATSI\" - The National Security Agency Technologies and Science research institute. With all of the computers now dedicated to science instead of spying, a cure for most cancer's is discovered in a month and plans for a real starship is finally realized. Unfortunately: Someone at \"NSATSI\" realizes that the technology used to connect all of the computers together could be used to connect different and even distant computers and a new NSATSIconnect net is born. Justin Beibers first born has 30 million hits in the first week as society catches up on lost time. LOL. ",

            "answer_text": "Originally answered:What'll happen if all the internet goes down? You can never shut down the internet. As long as there exist computers, there will always exist some form of a network. Computers means PC desktops, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, smart watches, and even PDAs. When you pair your phones together? That's a network. When you connect your phone to your computer to transfer media? That's a network. When you connect your computer to play Counter Strike over LAN? That's a network. Heck. Even pairing Gameboys to battle with your friends creates a network. As long as there is a two-way exchange of information between two or more computers, the link between them qualifies as a network. The internet is nothing but a network of networks. Computers connected to one another. They are known as nodes in the network. Every single web page that you access is not floating somewhere in the *internet*. No. The layout of web pages are stored on someone else's computer. When you open a web page, your computer communicates with the computer of the person who owns or hosts that web page. Even Quora is hosted on it's company servers. The internet is commonly misinterpreted as thing. In fact, the internet is a link and a way for computers to communicate By the internet going \"down\", it means that computers will not be able to connect to the major servers across the globe which allow you to access your favourite website. Yes, this would be devastating on a personal scale - teenagers would go insane and be actually forced to using text messaging again (*gasp*), your annoying friends wouldn't be able to poke you or invite you to play games on Facebook, and people like me would be slightly inconvenienced by not being able to access Quora on a daily basis. But there would be no real loss of information. Every byte of information would still be stored on the host computers. Wikipedia articles, Quora user profiles, everything. Government agencies and large corporates also use their own network to communicate. They would use what is know as an intranet. Communication would be localised and private, requiring passwords and security information every step of the way. Usage and activity of employees could also be tracked. The only immediate effects would be that transactions taking place at the time of the internet doing down would not be completed. People could lose money. The long lasting effects? The newspaper would become popular again and become one of the only means of conveying national and global news to the public apart from television and radio broadcasts.You could expect the cost of texts to come down because it will be in demand by the public.Copying information off internet articles and looking for help online would not be possible. People would have to resort to going to libraries again or actually talking to the people around them to get help. It would be a coder's worst nightmare.People would socialise more out of sheer boredom than having an actual interest in other people's lives.Many multi-billion dollar companies across the globe would suffer huge losses. Internet advertising is usually the main source of income for many websites. The only other source of income would payment from the users. Why would people continue to pay for an advertisement people can't see or a service they can't access? Facebook, Google, Twitter, you name it. All of these companies would be forced to shut down. Mobile phones and computer sales would also take a big hit. Most of the features available on today's smart phones rely on the internet. Feature phones like the old Nokia ones would become popular once again, but maybe with a better typing interface.Games would not rely on being connected to the internet. Have you heard of the new Need for Speed game? You need an an internet connection to even play single player. Ridiculous. This would make a lot of gamers happy. But Steam would take a big hit.The IT sector could experience a new boom as more time would be spent and more research done on alternative ways of connecting computers. Hooray for Computer science and Telecommunication students!Of course there would be people protesting (what don't people protest against these days?) and looking for someone to blame for them not being able to upload a picture of their breakfast on Instagram.Companies might start allowing the general public to use their networks for communications for a fee. You could even expect the creation of a government networks which are available for public use.We wouldn't really be thrown into the stone age, though. And right now, I can argue with myself - if people are able to use private networks, why can't they create public ones? Which is.. Correct. I'm sorry, but you can't get rid of the internet unless you found a way to destroy every computer on Earth, ban cables and wires, or found a way to block all communication based on electromagnetic waves.

            "answer_text": "I am in a unique spot generational wise, growing up without the tech, being introduced to it, embracing it and being able to operate quite well in either a pre and post internet scenario. I still use old school means such as prefer to pick up the phone for placing orders and dealing with clients, but I use the internet to augment things in support therein. I happen to be one of those in my generation that grasped the technology on a deeper level then most when it first came out upon computing for the masses. 1983 was my starting point with the Commodore vic 20 to give you an idea upon where I personally started at. Keeping up with the hardware and software evolution from assembly, repair, programming and of course end using, it would not take long before I had assembled a series of servers, both from new hardware to putting the older systems back into use for that application. From there, build the network on a local basis and teach others to do the same, eventually linking together to form a new internet that expands exponentially. People would have to learn some new log in protocals to gain access, \u2018new to them, old to those of us that were there from the beginning\u2019, and they would need to remember IP addresses instead of URL\u2019s, until a new ICANN was established after the network was large enough. While it was growing, mobile servers would make specific rounds and schedules to update the unlinked servers in the areas in order to do file exchanges while individuals would be swapping portable drives and media. Our current data centers would be employing a fleet of drivers and pilots to deliver content from their servers to the outside networks as well, none of the information would be lost, but it would not update quite as quickly without having a dedicated pipe to transfer the data in and out of in real time. Cash and paper checks would make a big come back for transactions, but the digital means still would remain solid, be it operate in packets with delays rather then in real time. People would start to use computers for their more full capacity towards what they can do, others would have them sit in the corner collecting dust much of the time, used similar to getting that Sunday newspaper. Local network based TV and other media productions would spring up since the mainstream ones now have limits and can\u2019t broadcast in real time. People would get into embracing more satellite and Ham radio types of means towards intercontinental communications as well. Those techies like myself would be treated like royalty and we would have to up our capacities and credentials significantly in order to keep up with the new demands. There would be a lot of crap based internet operations out of business very quickly. Nobody would want to save and distribute click bait or garbage media, or garbage news any more, that aspect would be a wonderful change and it would improve traffic and interest that is being hampered by these garbage outlets. A nice example of this, how many of you see a link or ad show up and notice that \u2018sponsored\u2019 tag to it, and avoid it at all cost knowing you are typically going off into being bombarded with ads just to attempt to check out what is advertised knowing it\u2019s likely going to be all fake and just a ploy to get you to click over. There would be a significant increase in security for developed countries upon their networks because the bulk of infiltrators are from non developed countries who have nothing but time on their hands. Most hackers would be out of business since they rely upon the open network of the internet to operate the slave computers they have infected. Viruses would be minimal since they at best can only spread to a small local network, which of course would red flag them for removal and contained rather then spreading like wildfire as they do now. It would be an interesting time, it would force the younger generation to understand what it means to not be so dependent upon technology and to experience what life is like without it. We would have stronger local communities, but we would also not be so much in the dark where the world ends just because we don\u2019t have access to the data in quite so quick of a real time scenario. Dial up internet days were very slow, but they also functioned just fine, be it people were more discerning upon where they went and how they used the internet, not wasting bandwidth and computer resources on nonsense, it would be similar to that at first of sorts. There were and are software that you can use for downloading larger files more efficiently too, so instead of clicking over to view a large video file to see it in real time, you just add it into the quo to view later and have it download when you are not actively using the computer. Your habits online would change a bit, but it would hardly be the end of the world. ",

Assuming that the entire Internet could be shut down, the impact would be cataclysmic, with a return to the communications infrastructure that existed in the early 19th Century. Even most land line telephones would be unusable, as virtually all of them connect to the Internet less than a mile from where a phone call originates. The only thing that might still be working are a handful of radio broadcasting systems; television went completely digital in the United States and most other places about a decade ago. Planes would be crashing into each other and falling out of the sky, as there would be no air traffic control systems working. It would be really bad. Fortunately, absent a science fiction scenario like The Terminator or Revolution, any Internet outage is likely to be relatively localized and very temporary, more of a nuisance than a threat to health and safety. On this note, Internet outages are fairly common, and are part of most disaster recovery/business continuity contingency plans. The causes range from intentional mischief to incompetence and/or unforeseen \"black swan\" events, and the recovery times usually range from minutes to hours rather than from days to weeks.

Smaller and undeveloped countries may only have limited physical connection to the internet. In that case, \u2018localized\u2019 could mean the whole country. This doesn\u2019t nessisarily include satellite internet and other wireless infrastructure. Even if an entire country loses access to the internet via wired connection, one lone individual who has access to satellite internet could use that connection to provide bandwidth for others. The idea of the internet shutting down is nonsense. It\u2019s like asking \u201cWhat if all the radio stations shut down.\u201d People with the hardware would simply broadcast new localized radio stations. You could shut down radio relays, make it so nationally syndicated programs/stations wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to continue broadcasting long-range , ect. But to \u2018shut-down\u2019 every single radio communication/broadcast on earth at the same time? The same kind of concepts can be applied to the internet. There are several major \u2018internet backbones\u2019 which aid in networking together and keeping bandwidth available ect ect, but the internet is still fundamentally a connection of unaffiliated local networks connected together so that anyone who connects to the internet can also connect to all the other networks.

Come to think of it... it'd be easier to turn off religion than to turn off the internet. It can't just be turned off... but it can/could be stopped, of course.   I had to ask myself - what would that take?  To be truly shut down, the 'net would have to be decimated - destroyed - by something immense and catastrophic, wiping out each and every ISP, basically. So... now, to answer your question - what would happen? Life would do it's thing on the planet, as it always does, after whatever global catastrophe which caused the internet to actually get fully \"shut down\" occurred.  Possibly, dinosaurs would again evolve.  Possibly, yet another almost-extinction event would occur, and possibly humans might eventually re-result. ",

In order for the internet to switch off, someone would have to disable EVERY intersection, EVERYWHERE. And after that's done, that someone would have to go back and do it all over again, because an army of okay-ish paid (their strength is in their numbers, not their individual value) techs (so to speak) would be re-enabling said disabled intersections. It would be a very long and arduous process, so it's very unlikely that the whole internet would be switched off. It's more likely that you asked this question because you're bored.
