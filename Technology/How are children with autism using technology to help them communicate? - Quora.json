            "answer_text": "I am constantly amazed by how deeply technology has integrated itself into our lives, and completely changed the way we view the world. One of its major feats according to me, is its ability to connect people. Be it through Facebook or google translate, it has made connecting to, and understanding people transverse physical and cultural barriers. During my recent web browsings, I was pleased to discover that we are now overcoming social, and developmental barriers too. Technology is helping not only non-verbal people with autism communicate, it is also allowing them to interpret social cues successfully, and even respond in an appropriate way. SmartStones is probably the one I\u2019m the most biased towards. Even though it is yet to hit the markets, its potential amazes me. Essentially a small round stone with sensors all over it, you can connect it to your devices and make certain gestures translate into actions. For instance, if your nonverbal child needs to tell you they\u2019re hungry, they simply draw a line on the stone and a message shines on your screen. Or if they want tell you they love you, they draw a circle, and your stone lights up a warm pink. By eliminating language as the means of communication, it eliminates the distance between you and your child. There are also a number of free apps available on the internet, that convert text to sound, like Proloquo4Text. Cheap and affordable, they provide a very good start for nonverbal people. iPrompts and Social Express are probably the leaders in that arena, providing free visual tools to help children with autism learn and communicate. You can also invest in special keyboards similar to Stephen Hawking\u2019s, especially if your child is permanently in a wheelchair. BRAIN POWER uses Google Glass to act as your child\u2019s very own life coach. It has an AI installed in it, which will show the mood and emotion of the person the wearer is talking to. Since an inability to understand social cues often hampers communication for children with autism, knowing exactly what the other person means through their sarcasm, irony, or other social cues, will help respond accordingly. I feel this will benefit young children the most, who have a tough time trying to understand the world and adapt to it, regardless of their autism. Besides these, there are many other technologies, each more inventive than the last, that make great advances for the advancement of the autism community, to empower them every day. ",

            "answer_text": "It completely depends on the child and the issues they are having with communication. My experience is with high-functioning kids with sensory processing issues and social and communication delays. Using technology to bridge gaps like this is NOT new - my source book on all this dates back to 1984, The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit by the amazing Sherry Turkle. She discovered that letting kids who had poor handwriting use keyboards completely changed their lives, and went from there to expand the use of digital communications in assistive education (and to point out the pitfalls of living in world where we only connect \"via the keyboard\" in her later works). That still works great for kids with dysgraphia. And using self-paced digital instruction seems to work great for kids who have attention issues - in particular those for whom paying attention in a classroom environment is an issue.  Use of automatic noise reduction headphones seems to be a big assist as well. I've found that games are a big help too - starting with mobile devices, moving to \"regular\" PC-based games and console games. It creates a need to communicate - I need help with X, or what would happen if Y - that might be hard to cultivate otherwise. And it builds proficiency with the technology which is rewarded by \"leveling up\".  Strategic selection of the particular content can also leverage relating to how fictional characters might feel, which is also often a stumbling block in communication.  Hopefully, some of this is helpful. ",
