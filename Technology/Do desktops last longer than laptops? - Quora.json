            "answer_text": "Yes, I would say desktops do last longer than laptops in a couple of ways. Obsolescence: Desktop components are (in many cases) more powerful than their mobile counterparts. This is sometimes due to size, but more likely heat output and power consumption. This means that a desktop will usually be faster than a laptop, so will take longer to not be able to do something that you want it to do. Most components are also upgradable (laptops only sometimes have upgradable RAM and storage) so you could argue that the computer will last longer. You could equally argue that if you swap parts out, it isn't the same computer, but that's an argument for another time. Durability: Laptops are usually used as mobile computers, so they are often on the move with their owners. This leads to them getting knocked about more - mine certainly has a couple of dings and scratches. Desktops on the other hand live on or under a desk, so whilst they may get dusty, they aren't likely to be damaged in the same way. Moreover, desktops are larger and easier to cool, so there is less likelihood of thermal damage to components. That's all I can think of at the moment, but I'm sure there are other reasons why desktops last longer than laptops.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, yes, for sure!But not necessarily because they are intrinsically ore reliable, simply because it is VERY SIMPLE TO REPLACE BROKEN PARTS!Even the whole motherboard, if an overvoltage has fried it \u2026This is an extreme example, but yes, indeed, if one component or other fails, it is easy to replace it!- cooling fans, I often replace or clean- the same for the PSU. The fan of the cheap power supplies does get clogged with dirt, and start making screeching noise. I simply remmove the PSU from the PC and \u2026 wash it thoroughly! You must then assure that the remaining drops are removed by blowing air, and that it dries completely, before being reassembled.- the power supply may fail completely, but it is easy to repplace- the microprocesor seldom FAILS, but it may get completely oudated. You can easily replace the old i3 with an i5, i7 or a newer and better processor from the same familiy. Much, much more difficult to do this in a laptop!- the cooling fan for the processor may die, or it needs to be repasted. Again, it is much easier to do this tahn for a laptop!- the RAM DIMMs can easily be replaced or upgraded, like taking off the 2x4GB sticks and put instead two or four DIMMs of 8GB each- the DVD-RW unit can be easily replaced- the HDD can be easily replaced, in case of failure or when it gets too small (you had filled it up completely) or too small. For instance, since 2017 I have replaced all my system disks with SSDs!- if one USB or Ethernte port fails, there is no need to replace the whole motherboard, you can plug add-in boards into the PCI or PCIe slots - likewise, I always bought my desktop computer only with onboard video, and afterwards purchased, if need and if I could afford it, a high performance plug-in card! But on a laptop what can you do, if you have only VGA output, but now only external monitors with HDMI inputs are available??? And this tenedency is getting WORSE: until two years ago, in a laptop I could easily replace or ugrade:- the one or two HDDs- the SODIMMS for memory- the Wi-FI module. No more! The 15\u2033 Dell I purchased last year has no openings on the back, the battery is the only item that can be easily replaced, for the rest, you must take apart the laptop, which I cannot do \u2026 Yes, desktop computers do last longer!",

            "answer_text": "Yes! & No! Desktops have two advantages over laptops: 1) Not being portable, desktops have a much lower incidence of being drop-kicked in an Airport Concourse; smashed in a travel bag; stolen in a school library; & etc. 2) Laptops also have a limited capability for being upgraded. The usual route, other than adding more memory, or upgrading to an SSD, is to simply replace the whole unit. 3) Repairing a Laptop that has been damaged is also a *much* more difficult task. 4) Finally, a desktop can pretty easily have any part replaced. I once had a desktop, where, after 5 years, the only original part left was the case (and some screws)! So, you can extend the life of a Desktop much longer than a Laptop. ... ",

My desktop, that I\u2019m using now, is to me the same desktop I\u2019ve been using for 20 years. It isn\u2019t, of course - every part of it is different. I\u2019ve probably been through five or six motherboards and cases in that time, and five operating systems. Memory expanded from 16 megabytes to 8 gigabytes, and the HDD from one gigabyte to two terabytes. I used to have one CRT monitor, now I have three LCDs. But there\u2019s a thread of continuity. It never changes all at once. The old motherboard gets pitched but the old hard disk moves on into the new body, until I get a bigger one and transfer all the files. I have files on here that are more than 20 years old. I bought the speakers in 1998. Laptops, on the other hand, come and go. I\u2019ve had eight in the past twenty years. They can\u2019t be upgraded, and they break down unexpectedly at inconvenient times. End of life is about the same time that the first battery won\u2019t hold a charge any more - two years or so. There\u2019s nothing in a laptop worth saving, so they stack up on the bookshelf until someone less sentimental than me tosses them in the recycling bin when I\u2019m not looking. ",

However, regardless, a desktop will always last longer than a laptop for several reasons. The components themselves are a lot more sturdier and made with a lot more durability than laptop components. The heat dispersion is one reason why a laptop can never compete with a desktop. When you have to compare an enclosed space that is used on a person\u2019s \u201clap\u201d that isn\u2019t a fair comparison to a desktop that sits on a desk or floor with multiple large fans cooling with the utilization of air flow.

Desktops on the other hand, they are in one spot, there are vibrations but not as much as laptops would get, also desktop parts can be replaced, except for Apple products, but generally if you replace a part of the desktop which is failing, this will increase the life of it, this can also be applied to some laptops, but generally laptops don't like to be modified depending on the brand.

            "answer_text": "i still have my desktop from 2004, with an amd 4400+ processor. two years ago i upgraded my video card to an evga 750 ti (the 1050s were not available then). it's running xp. the problems that i'm facing is that i can't find updated web browsers for xp, but the hardware is going strong. i upgraded the ram to 4 gb, but the motherboard only uses 2.6 of those. another limitation i have to deal with. my desktop can't do virtual machines, and heavy data transfer is a challenge, but here i am, using it for games, movies, internet, and productivity. 14 years of service. you can't do that with a laptop because laptops are not modular. when the weakest link breaks, your laptop becomes useless. however, laptops are portable. is portability a feature you desire ? you can port an itx form factor desktop, but i wouldn't.

Then, and only then, is it a fair comparison. In all other respects, the laptop will wear out sooner. On top of this, the desktop is probably upgradeable, prolonging it\u2019s usable life even more. Given this, why do people pay more for a computer that is underpowered and doesn\u2019t last? Mobility. We apparently value it that much. ",

I have a smartphone and a laptop and macbook, etc. I almost never use them. Why look at the tiny screen, and type on a cramped keyboard? At home I have an Intel i7 desktop loaded with RAM and SSD storage, full size wireless keyboard and mouse, a gigantic 4k monitor, lightning fast wired internet (Wifi is inherently problematic), etc. When you get accustomed to the speed and comfort of a nice desktop, using a laptop or phone is not worth the effort. I built it myself, so it was much less expensive than a typical laptop. ",
