            "answer_text": "Most radio receivers you are likely to encounter are of the down-conversion superheterodyne (superhet) type. These days, direct conversion is also very popular and is the way mobile phones generally implement their radios. I\u2019ll just discuss the superhet though, because it\u2019s the more common type when most people think about an \u201cRF receiver\u201d. A receiver has three main functions: to SELECT the signal of interest and REJECT all others (tuning).to AMPLIFY the received signal to a useful level.to DEMODULATE the intelligence that was carried by the radio signal.Tuning and amplification are carried out at the same time, but demodulation is usually carried out as a last step in the receiver. The signal is received on an antenna, and is coupled electrically to the input of the receiver. The signal consists of a mixture of the wanted frequency and a large number of other frequencies, for example all of the in-range stations in the FM broadcast band. The antenna itself will respond more strongly to a certain frequency than others, but typically will cover the full band of interest and usually quite a bit more on either side as well. The first stage of a receiver is a combined filter and amplifier. The filter generally accepts all frequencies in the band of interest, rejecting any others, but not all that strongly. Then there is often a single stage of amplification, boosting the antenna signal by 10dB or so. After that the signals pass to a MIXER stage. The purpose of this stage is to mix the signal with an internally generated sinewave. The sinewave\u2019s frequency is tuned by the tuning knob on the front panel of the receiver, and has a fixed offset from the wanted frequency of interest. So for example if this is an FM broadcast receiver, receiving 88\u2013108 MHz, the sinewave\u2019s frequency (generated by a circuit called the Local Oscillator - LO) will typically be 10.7 MHz higher, so 98.7 - 118.7 MHz. There\u2019s nothing magic about 10.7 MHz, but it\u2019s a very common choice for the so-called INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY (IF) of the receiver. The mixer is non-linear, so in fact it actually multiplies the incoming signal by the sinewave. The result are new frequencies at the sum and difference of the two inputs. One of these will be 10.7 MHz, where the input signal happens to produce 10.7 MHz difference. For example, if the LO is at 110 MHz, an input signal at 99.3 MHz will produce 10.7 MHz. The IF is strongly filtered using a series of tuned circuits, or sometimes ceramic or crystal filters. This ensures that ONLY the signal at 10.7 MHz gets through to the amplification stages, and any others are filtered out. This filtering is the main way that the receiver rejects unwanted signals, and because it\u2019s at a fixed frequency, careful alignment of the tuned circuits to that frequency is possible, since once set they never need to be changed. Only the frequency of the LO needs to change to tune the receiver to a different station. After filtering, there ar many stages of amplification. Radio signals can be very weak - down in the microvolts level at the antenna - so need a lot of amplification. The amplifiers might bring the wanted signal up to the level of a few volts from a few microvolts, so voltage gains of 1,000,000 (120dB) are not uncommon. A few volts is enough to demodulate whatever intelligence we are interested in, be it audio, speech or data. FM broadcast receivers demodulate stereo audio which is imposed on the carrer using Frequency Modulation (FM) - a technique that varies the instantaneous frequency of the carrier by the value of the analogue signal carried. There are many kinds of modulation and therefore many kinds of demodulation circuits. But after this step, what is output is the original signal we wanted to receive, the audio, the data or whatever. Audio might pass, via a volume control, to an audio amplifier and speakers for example. One of the other functions that is usually part of a receiver\u2019s design is a way to actually control the forward gain (the 120dB above) according to the received signal strength. The stronger the signal, the less gain is needed. This AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL (AGC) is vital for AM receivers, since the intelligence is carried in the amplitude of the carrier wave. It\u2019s usually also found in quality receivers of all types, though in some cheap FM receivers it is omitted. AGC is a feedback loop around the receiver, where the output signal level from the demodulator is held constant by varying the gain of the IF (and sometimes RF) amplifier stages. In some kinds of FM receiver (such as FM broadcast receivers) a similar feedback loop can be used to fine-tune the LO to ensure that the received signal is dead centre in the channel. This prevents the receiver drifting out of tune over time or with temperature. However, these sorts of feedback circuits arre much less common on modern receivers that use a phase-locked loop frequency synthesizer to generate the LO frequency. These tend to be very stable as they are derived from a crystal oscillator and so the centre-tuning feedback isn\u2019t needed. ",

            "answer_text": "First, it accepts a signal from an antenna or other source. It tunes it, may convert it to an intermediate frequency, (for better tuning and more amplification), detecting the modulation and finally amplifying and sending the signal to a speaker. I have included several steps in the description which most modern receivers employ, however a simple receiver such as a TRF may go direct from the accepting the signal to amplifying to detecting and audio amplification and loudspeaker.
