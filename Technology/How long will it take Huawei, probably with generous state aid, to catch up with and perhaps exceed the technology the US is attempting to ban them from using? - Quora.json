            "answer_text": "A lot of things are going on in China as a result of the unprecedented behavior of the US or the department of commerce. China's national science and technology research center had responded and embarged a ramp up and focus effort on all items or technology that had been banned by the US deem critical to Chinese high tech development. This is a national high power research center where all the country top research scientists are researching. Most of the listed items are not new to them just need to be upgraded or polished or refined. It will not take long, probably with new technological breakthroughs. Including EUV machine, equivalent EDA system, etc. SMIC had successfully test production of 7nm chip with DUV machine pending delivery of EUV machine by ASML which they ordered way back 2018 due for delivery 2019 but yet to be delivered. Mass production of 7nm chip or N+1 chip by end of this year. Huawei may be able to benefit from this 7nm mass production. SMIC fabrication is led by a very capable scientist who was behind Samsung breakthrough from 28nm to 14nm uplifted Samsung on par with TSMC. A Chinese group is finalizing the acquisition of some Japanese EUV machine manufacturers, with new funding from this Chinese group and the experience of the team of EUV machine Japanese scientists and engineers, it will not be long they can help meet the requirement of Chinese fab companies in China for latest EUV machines, the current bottleneck in China chip fabrication. ASML had relaxed their restriction of sale to a Chinese company, recent report confirmed they are delivering the latest version of DUV to their Chinese clients. Another potential solution to the bottleneck situations. Huawei too had been seen actively hiring EUV experienced engineers last few months, Huawei is not new to EUV technology, they had a team on this technology development and dappled with it more than 5 years ago. So it will not take long for them to come out with some solution. Probably jointly with some domestic fabricators that had been fabricating Huawei's lower-end chip. Huawei is also exploring Virtual machines as alternatives like cloud phones which Huawei reported had lunched, which has less dependence on build-in chips for smartphones but on cloud technology to power the phone. On the software side, Huawei HongMeng 2.0 had launched and will be the OS for all her new smartphones like Mate 40, P30, P20, etc. Look like Google\u2019s Android will lose substantial users in China and the world. Other Chinese brands may be using HongMeng too, The world will have a chance to used Huawei OS of the future HongMeng with new technology. Huawei also launched new strategies for US content free design, product, and production across the groups. Huawei smartphone, 5G base station, etc are already 100% US content free. There is no technology from the US suitable for Huawei cutting edge high tech products. Huawei technologies are at the forefront of her rivals, probably 3 to 5 years ahead. Similarly, the chip fabrication industry does not dependent on US technology, TSMC of Taiwan that help fabricate Huawei 5nm chips has equipment with US technology content of less than 10%. TSMC and Samsung specifically and the industry generally are reported to ramp up building production lines with US technology content free. Hopefully, that will be another solution. I do not see any problem for Huawei and China with these self-harm US adventures. Probably a slight short-term inconvenience, Huawei 3rd quater 2020 profit is increasing over the previous year. Look like the crushing of the US has minimum impact on Huawei's normal operation and profit. I foresaw the expedite demise of US chip industry supply chains with these self-harm US adventures. It will be interesting to see how the free US content wave will propagate around the world and across the high tech industry. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember years ago all these other countries had implemented high definition TV, but not the US. The policy makers of the US did not want to let foreign companies have an advantage. They wanted to create something that would allow American manufacturers to get the edge. So finally they agreed on new digital technology. The only problem was that with digital broadcast technology you generally got a perfect signal or worthless (there was a little wiggle room). Well, so what happened. All the Japanese and Korean manufactures managed to market TVs that handled the new US standard, and so after all that, the US policy failed in its objective. So this sounds like the same sort of thing. But now the US is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing. There are a few patents that have some impact, but it appears that there are work around and better technology that does not depend on American technology. So the end result is that Huawei cannot use American chips, That means either getting chips from somewhere else or creating the technology and building them themselves. And the best semiconductor technology is no longer in the US. LOL. Intel has the best, but AMD and Qualcomm are using far superior foreign technology to manufacture their chips. And China has better technology than the US by a large margin. So Intel looses a lot of business, and China companies have even better reason to invest in superior technology, and China has the largest number of STEM graduates of any country in the world, and I believe by a large margin. And they do not need state aid. They do it without state aid. China may be the most capitalistic country in the world, Just look at the success of Chinese emigrants in so many parts of the world. They are the Jews of the East. And remember that China has the largest economy in the world followed by the EU, and they can also go into third world countries that have a much more positive attitude towards China than the US which has treated these countries the same as the British and French treated their colonies. Because of China conditions in so many third world countries is so much better, and the US is renowned for their bigotry, bigotry that China also suffers from. In any case, the internal market for China is so large that Huawei should be able to survive fine on just that market. And it appears that Germany is not about to do to Huawei what the idiot UK has done. Germany has benefitted significantly from trade with China, and German tend to be smart and probably see that maintaining great relations with the US is of diminishing returns. The US is on the fall, as shown so clearly by the year 2020. ",
