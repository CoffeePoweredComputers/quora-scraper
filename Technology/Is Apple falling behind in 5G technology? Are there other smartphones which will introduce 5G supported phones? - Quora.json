            "answer_text": "Welcome to iPhone.  The original iPhone shipped with 2G-only in 2007, in an era in which \u201ceveryone else\u201d was already on 3G phones. My Palm Treo 700p, for example, one of the \u201cold skool\" smartphones that Apple and Android would kill off in the next few years, was a 3G phone. The next year's iPhone 3G supported 3G.  In 2011, Apple introduced the 2G/3G iPhone 4s, in a day in which most other phones also supported LTE (aka 4G). I bought my Galaxy Nexus, with 4G support, that same year. Apple put 4G support into the iPhone 5 for 2012. And even once on 4G/LTE, Apple lagged the rest of the industry on performance improvements. So you can probably expect Apple won't have 5G support until, well, whatever the 2020 iPhone is called. And you can already buy 5G phones from Samsing and others. Not that you need them, but you can. It's a Chip Thing Why are they behind? Well, part of it's by being ahead. Apple, as you probably know, designs their own ARM processor cores and their own System on Chip (SoC) processors. Recently, they debuted their own GPU design. Since Apple is their only chip customer, they actually spend just a bit more per processor than would likely fly in the semiconductor business. So they have faster chips. But pretty much every other smartphone company is using an SOC with integrated radio modems. Apple does not. And in fact, they were fighting patents for years against Qualcomm, while simultaneously using some of Qualcomm's cellular radio modems in their phone. And some from Intel's wireless division. Gradually, pretty much everyone used integrated modems. In fact, today Apple remains Intel's only cellular wireless customer. That's been an unprofitable business, and Intel announced earlier this year their intention to sell that division. And Apple jumped up to buy it for $1 billion dollars. They probably found that much cash down in their couch, being Apple and all. And Intel\u2019s 5G technology is not ready for 2019. The deal will not be finalized until year's end, after the next iPhone comes out. But this may be the last time Apple comes up a year behind on radio technology. Is 5G Important? You probably won't be using 5G much in 2020 anyway, even if your phone supports it. Ok, sure, some AT&T phones say \u201c5G\" right now, but they're probably exaggerating. AT&T is lighting up the 5G sign for LTE Advanced, a 4G technology. They did the same for 4G, lighting up as 4G for HSPA+ 3G connections. See what trouble calling it \u201c<n>G\" leads to, rather than using its proper name? Real 5G is being used in some cities. If you're outside a city center, don't expect it for awhile. Some of the first 5G setups are targeting last mile home internet setups, not mobile. And it's really short range, initially being at 6-30GHz (millimeter band)\u2026 stupid Friis equation! And it's probably going to suck in the rain -- this range covers the Ku and part of the Ka bands that made your satellite TV and internet fail in rain and snow. Or at least mine. Most carriers are turning 3G off, some starting end of the year, and plan to use those frequencies for slower, longer range 5G\u2026 eventually. 5G is actually a very big deal, and it'll take years to fully roll it out. Apple's not missing all that much, this time. But check the 5G rollout for your area and carrier, and weigh that against your single-mind devotion to All Things Apple, versus your need for your phone's internet to be faster than your home internet, and see which one you want for now. Thing is, Apple already seems to have told everyone that the fall-of-2019 iPhone will kind of suck anyway and what you really want is the 2020 model. So maybe just wait a year?

            "answer_text": "Yes. Apple is always behind in technology.. heck, when the iPhone X came out, they finally had an AMOLED display for the first time ever.. somehow Apple fans were amazed and there was a lot of hype over it, despite AMOLED being on Samsung. Apple doesn't care about innovation, they care about profit. They will STILL sell phones while other phones have newer and advanced technology.. it's because people love Apple so much, they don't really mind. Apple is slower when it comes to releasing new tech.. they don't see the benefit in it for them. The Apple Watch came way after Samsung's smart watches. Apple got a dual and triple camera years after other Smartphones had it. Apple is good at \u201cstalling time\u201d and stretching out their phones, re-releasing the same phone with minor upgrades and they still make money from it. So don't expect Apple to roll out with 5G phones just yet.. probably year or longer after the first round of 5G phones are released. Apple: \u201cif it don't make money, it don't make sense\u201d. Releasing a 5G phone will cost them money and they don't benefit much from that investment.. if they released a 4G phone, people will still buy it regardless, so what's the point? They will probably wait until 5G becomes the standard and then they will consider it. ",
