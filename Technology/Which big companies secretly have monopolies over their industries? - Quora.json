            "answer_text": "Secretly? That is a the conundrum. It is never really a secret. Every company, if it is successful enough, strives to become monopolistic. Traditionally, industries end up as oligopolies where you have, for example, the big three automakers. Or the big three accounting firms. More recently, because of networking value, one becomes dominant. For example, there is Facebook. What is #2? Governments often give companies monopoly power. Public utilities are government controlled monopolies. Usually there is good reason. For example, if one company lays gas pipes throughout a city, there is no real reason for a second company to try and duplicate. There may also be toll roads run by private companies regulated by the government. Coming back to your original questions, there are many monopolistic firms but none are really hidden. ",
