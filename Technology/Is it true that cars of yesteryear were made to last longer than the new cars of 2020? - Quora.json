            "answer_text": "Cars prior to the early-mid 1990\u2019s did not have a definitive life span. Automotive engineers didn\u2019t look at long-term ownership as an engineering parameter. They were built as consumer items, like anything else. The difference was that older vehicles, like older refrigerators, TV sets, radios, vacuum cleaners and other consumer items were designed to be serviced.  Just as a TV set 50 years ago could have its picture tube replaced, or the vacuum tubes tested at a Thrifty\u2019s or Western Auto store and replaced, automobiles could have worn parts replaced or refurbished over and over again, for decades if required.  At that time, there were repairmen, who operated businesses and would drive to your home in a service truck or van. They would fix a broken refrigerator, washing machine, blender, radio or TV. All of these items would be kept in service until they literally couldn\u2019t be repaired anymore, and it was more economical to replace them.  Cars at the time, were built with components, which could all be unbolted and replaced with new or rebuilt parts, which were available from dealers and auto parts stores. In this way, yes, older cars could last longer, because they could be rebuilt and repaired, over and over again. In this way, they could be kept on the road almost indefinitely.  Modern cars, like many modern consumer items are designed using a lot more plastics, composites and parts which are pressed, riveted or molded together into full assemblies. This makes manufacturing easier and cheaper and improves profits. But it also makes these things harder and more expensive to service. The idea is that by the time these hard parts wear out, the vehicle will be ready for recycling.  In some countries, like Japan, aggressive recycling programs make keeping a car more than 6 years uneconomical, and they are scrapped. In the U.S., we typically keep cars far longer, on average between 10\u201315 years. Rebuilding key parts, such as engines, transmissions, suspension components, steering components and more easily can exceed the value of the vehicle, especially with rising parts and labor costs, and the vehicle is simply scrapped.  So in a sense, modern cars are made to last a long time, until around the 250,000 mile mark, and then expensive things start to fail, and many of those aren\u2019t designed to be rebuilt affordably. The result is the car is scrapped. This is how today\u2019s \u201cthrow away\u201d culture works. We don\u2019t fix things. We just use them up and replace them with newer things.  With an older car, the engine and other components may require rebuilding at the 100,000\u2013150,000 mile mark. But you just spend to have those parts rebuilt or replaced and keep it going. You can repeat this process over and over again for many hundreds of thousands of miles. The cost for those simple parts is cheap and the labor costs are less as well. This is why classic cars from the fifties and sixties are still on the road 60+ years later. Just ask the residents of Cuba, who have been keeping their 1950\u2019s American cars going strong for decades\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on your definition of \u201cyesteryear.\u201d As far back as the early 1900s and up to the dawn of WWII, yes, cars were made to last. Even though after WWII cars remained simple enough for the shade tree mechanics to fix. Then after WWII when economies were recovering, in came the concept of Planned Obsolescence. There was no legit way to use up steel to keep the prices up. During the war steel vehicles, ships, and munitions were destroyed and required replacement, consuming tons of steel. EDIT: It was correctly pointed out that Chevrolet began the concept of new model every year in the 1920s. This came to a screeching halt with the stock market crash of 1929, the subsequent depression, and WWII. Chevys of that era were still mechanically reliable in comparison to the postwar Planned Obsolescence phase, where the outsides got fancier and the mechanicals suffered. After the war, when steel sales slumped, in came the concept of let\u2019s make a new model every year or so to keep consumers wanting the newest and glitziest. Notice the body styles in the 60s and 70s? Miles of tail fins and ornamentation that were strictly unnecessary. Because of the emphasis on body style and trading in every 2 years to keep up with the latest, as well as the relatively cheap prices of cars and gas, little attention was paid to mechanical longevity. This all came to a head in the 70s with the two oil crises when fuel economy became a buzzword and Japanese car popularity surged, when people discovered their reliability and long life. Computerization of engine components soon reared its ugly head as well, making it far more difficult for people to fix their own cars. All of these things combined to introduce the phase of disposability rather than fixability. So, yeah, the yesteryear of 1900\u20131955 or so cars were more long lasting and easier to repair. ",
