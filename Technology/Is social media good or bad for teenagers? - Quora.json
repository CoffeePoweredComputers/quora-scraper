            "answer_text": "If you can\u2019t imagine your life without social media, that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019ve fallen a victim to the evil power and impact of social networking. It also means that you\u2019ve experienced one (or more) of the negative effects of social media on society. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019ve never heard of these. While social media can have a positive impact too, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all hearts and flowers. Unfortunately. How Social Media Is Bad for You Let\u2019s explore the darker side of social media and exactly how (and why) it\u2019s bad for you. You\u2019ll be surprised to learn the negative effects of social media are both physical and mental. It can change your perception of the world and yourself, and not always for the better. Don\u2019t believe us? Then read on to find out some of the negative effects of social media. And if you recognize any of them as your own symptoms it may be time to consider stop using social media altogether. 1. Depression and Anxiety Do you spend more than two hours per day on social media? Spending too long on social networking sites could be adversely affecting your mood. In fact, you\u2019re more likely to report poor mental health, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. So how to use social media without causing yourself psychological distress? If you turn to the same research (and common sense), the recommended amount of time you should spend on social networks is half an hour per day. So, as with so many things in life, it\u2019s all about moderation. 2. Cyberbullying Before social media, bullying was something only done face-to-face. However, now, someone can be bullied online anonymously. Today everyone knows what cyberbullying is, and most of us have seen what it can do to a person. And since screens hide our faces, you can even be a jerk on sites like Reddit without realizing it. 3. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a phenomenon that was born at the same time as Facebook\u2014and it\u2019s one of the most common negative effects of social media. FOMO is basically a form of anxiety that you get when you\u2019re scared of missing out on a positive experience or emotions that someone else is getting. This fear is constantly fueled by your social media engagement. The more you use social networks, the more likely you are to see that someone is having more fun that you are right now. And that\u2019s exactly what causes FOMO. 4. Unrealistic Expectations This one probably comes as no surprise, but social media helps you to form unrealistic expectations of life and friendships. The networks that do it most are Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Those are the social media platforms that severely lack online authenticity. One simple way out of this is for everyone to quit lying on social media. But in the era of Instagram celebrities and YouTubers who earn millions, that isn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon. 5. Negative Body Image Speaking of Instagram celebrities, if you look at the most-followed accounts on Instagram, you\u2019ll find beautiful people wearing expensive clothes on their perfect bodies. Today, body image is an issue for many people of both sexes. Of course, seeing those perfect in accordance with the society standards people on a daily basis makes you conscious about how different you look from those pictures. And not everyone comes to the right conclusions in this situation. 6. Unhealthy Sleep Patterns On top of increased rates of anxiety and depression, spending too much time on social media can lead to poor sleep. Numerous studies have shown that increased use of social media has a negative effect on your sleep quality. If you feel like your sleep patterns have become irregular and that this is affecting your productivity, try and avoid spending a significant amount of time on social media. 7. General Addiction using smartphone Social media is often described as being more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol. With the worst social media apps being Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat when it comes to addiction. TikTok is the latest social network with addictive qualities. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019re addicted to your social networks? Think when was the last time you went a full day without checking your social media accounts? What if your favorite social networks completely disappeared tomorrow; would it make you feel empty and depressed? If you just realized you\u2019re addicted to social media, don\u2019t worry, as most of us are there with you in varying degrees. And it\u2019s not necessarily a reason to go and wipe yourself off all those social networking platforms. However, if you think quitting is the best solution for you, we won\u2019t stop you. In fact, one of our writers tried quitting social media once, and it was an interesting experience. Social Media: Is It Time to Quit or Detox? As with everything else, social media brings both good and bad things into our lives. At the end of the day, you\u2019re the one who decides whether there\u2019s more help or harm in it for you. Maybe all you need is find the right site for you. Perhaps switching from Facebook to Twitter, or from Instagram to YouTube. Or maybe you\u2019re done with all of them altogether and are ready to delete your entire social media presence for good. If that feels a little too extreme consider doing a social media detox every once in a while instead. Because the non-nuclear option should always be your first choice. And once you\u2019re back, consider filtering toxic comments from social media. Cred; Make use of so yeah, hoped you liked the answer. There\u2019s obviously bad things about social media but there is good things for sure. An upvote would be much appreciated \ud83d\udc4d Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s world, social media has become a huge part of people\u2019s lives, but for teenagers it is all consuming. Teenagers live on their phones. They are constantly texting, Facetiming, Snapchatting, Tweeting, Instagraming, Facebooking, etc. With that being said, one has to ask; what impact does all of this have on today\u2019s teenagers? Like an addict, teens tend to push that social media doesn\u2019t have any negative effects on them. However, it is evident to parents and outsiders that it indeed does. Social media\u2019s worst impact on teenagers is mental health issues. The most common impacts social media has on teenagers is depression, anxiety, and bad self-esteem. There are several ways in which teenagers can develop depression from social media. One way is through cyber bullying or online harassment. On social media, teenagers can post whatever they want, whenever they want; which enables them to post hurtful things about others. Another way teenagers develop depression from social media is through seeing unrealistic lifestyles, and from constantly seeing what other people are doing. One study even came up with its own way of classifying depression among the youth as \u201cFacebook depression.\u201d This depression is defined as depression that develops when preteens and teens spend a great deal of time on social media sites, such as Facebook, and then begin to exhibit classic symptoms of depression[1]. Because of the ability to freely post - regardless of the consequences, and because of the perpetual updates on how fabulous people\u2019s lives are, it is easy to see that social media can harm the mental health of growing teenagers. Anxiety is another negative impact that social media has on teenagers. Because we are free to post whatever we want, teenagers have become anxious about what they are posting. Many are scared they will be cyberbullied or judged. When teenagers post something on Instagram or Facebook they tend to develop anxiety over how many likes and comments they get, and what people think about their picture. This becomes a vicious cycle, because teenagers are constantly posting, and therefore constantly feeling anxious about any potential negative comments. Another form of anxiety that is evident from the over use of social media, is social anxiety. Because it is easy to meet people and talk online through social media platforms, it has allowed teenagers to develop social anxiety in real life. Their screens act as a security blanket, and without them they are anxious about how to behave. Social media allows teenagers to act a completely different way than in person, then when they are in person they have a tremendous amount of fear which makes them avoid social interactions[2]. Lastly, another negative impact social media has on teenagers is that it lowers self-esteem. Because teenagers are glued to their phones, they are constantly seeing what other people are doing - which always seems better. This in turn makes them feel as though they aren\u2019t good enough. Social media models and ads give teenagers a false sense of what they should look like, or how they should act. As a result, this makes them strive for an unrealistic perfection, and thus many have low self-esteem because their lives aren\u2019t like what they are seeing. As you can see, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem issues are all negative ways in which social media impacts teenagers. It is important to explore this because social media is only becoming more prominent in today\u2019s society. The mental health of our youth is too important to ignore. We must help kids learn to recognize what is happening to them, and how they can prevent these negative impacts.
