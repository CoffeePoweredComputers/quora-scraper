            "answer_text": "It varies between disciplines, but in general resolution refers to the smallest unit you can measure, and accuracy refers to how close the sample is to the target in terms of the measurement unit. If your target is say 100PPM and you can measure 1PPM, a sample which measured 101PPM is 10 times more accurate than a sample measuring 110PPM. If a microscope is measured in micron resolution, a consistent accuracy of 1mm is 100 times less accurate than an accuracy of 10microns. Marketing people tend to use a resolution which makes their samples appear more accurate. A real world example. A few years ago a US corporation ordered several thousand parts from a Japanese supplier. The contract stated that a 1% defect rate was acceptable. The Japanese firm packed 1% of the items separately from the 99% good ones. This demonstrated that the Japanese firm believed their resolution was so superior to the American one that their worst accuracy was more accurate than the resolution the American firm could measure to. Needless to say, the Japanese firm became a major supplier to the US one. No names are cited here, but the US firm is commonly known by 3 initials. ",
