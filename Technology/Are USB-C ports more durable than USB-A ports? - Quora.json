            "answer_text": "Actually this is two questions 1-usb type A is an old version and it\u2019s not in use anymore (only few might be) Type B (or as usual USB2) is eventually fading out although many of devices are still working with it In other words, usb type B is the most common type and includes usb2 and 3. When you are talking about usb 1.1 - 2.0 - 3.0 or 3.1 differences are about transfer speed ( send and receive) But type c is a form of usb 2 or mostly usb3 but with different form and its reversible so its quite much better and more easy to use also it usually uses for smartphones and laptops USB type c is a version of USB3 2- yes for reversible form of this port, it\u2019s more durable than type B ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, no. USB-A, in large part because of it\u2019s large, not to mention bulky nature, is generally more durable then USB-C. In my experience, you can be a lot rougher with a USB-A port then a USB-C port without breaking anything. That being said, USB-C has two big advantages fueling it\u2019s rising popularity. First, it\u2019s reversible, something that USB-A isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s far more compact, making it more applicable to a wider range of devices. ",
