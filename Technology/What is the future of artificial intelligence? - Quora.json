            "answer_text": "What is the probability or risk of it? The controversy was sparked by the debate between Jack Ma and Tesla's Elon Musk, two of the world's most tech-savvy entrepreneurs.  At the World AI Summit (WAIC) in Shanghai, China, the two discussed the AI \u200b\u200bissue for 5 minutes. There, the two disagreed on the risks and potential of artificial intelligence. Jack Ma says he was very optimistic about AI. Smart people like them have nothing to fear. In response, Mask said, \"Technology is changing rapidly and it is going beyond our ability to understand.\" Of course, the two agreed that the world's biggest problem is population decline. These two traders are known as one of the most influential technology leaders in the present world. US-based businessman Mask developed his wealth from digital payment company PayPal. He now owns electric car maker Tesla, rocket maker SpaceX, and the tunnel transportation business The Boring Company. He helped establish Open AI, a San Francisco-based AI research institute in the United States news. Jack Ma, co-founder of e-commerce company Alibaba. Alibaba is competing with Amazon to win the world's top e-commerce company. Alibaba has made one of the world's largest investments in AI technology. China has set the goal of leading the world in artificial intelligence at the top of the top 20 in the United States. During the debate, Jack Ma basically raised the issue of how machine learning (ML) calculates a good workforce. This technology will give new ideas of how people think and will be accepted in due course. When people understand themselves, even more, the world can be improved. AI will help create new types of employment so that creative work can be done in less time. Jack Ma said, \"I would leave if I had to work three or four days a week for the sake of artificial intelligence.\" At this time the life expectancy of people will be 120 years. There are a lot of things that nobody wants to do at this time. Adding artificial intelligence to a robot will help it take care of older people. Elon Musk, however, opposed the idea. According to him, AI will create huge unemployment. AI won't put anything into work. Perhaps the work of people will stand in AI writing. One time AI will write its own software. Human civilization will be at risk. Tesla's chief executive says, \"Artificial intelligence will take control of people.\" However, Jack Ma said, \"I've been hearing about this for the past two years. But we think it's impossible. \" ",

            "answer_text": "From Man and Superman: Human History Bifurcates | Sramana Mitra I recently wrote a series titled The Future and also gave a talk on The Future of Capitalism. In those, I said that I am optimistic about the next couple of decades. I believe, strongly, that entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial capitalism can be democratized, and wealth can be created in the middle of the pyramid using capitalistic principles. In the next 2-3 decades, the potential for distributed capitalism is very high and the outcome should be extremely positive around the world. That is the mission upon which my current work with One Million by One Million is based. However, there is tremendous inequality due to technology and automation on the horizon. In the 30-50 year timeframe and beyond, technology and automation will create tremendous disruption. 60-80% of ALL jobs will, likely, get automated. Now, that is a scary situation. I am sure you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve heard this before. Machines replacing jobs. New jobs always emerge.\u2019 Yes, in the Industrial Revolution, for instance, that was a major concern, but we\u2019ve seen tremendous job growth since then. This technology revolution is, however, different. Before, machines could not think. Now, they can. And because of the processing power available in tiny chips, they can think incredibly fast. Process unbelievable amounts of data in a nanosecond. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics are moving forward at breakneck pace right now. The march of automation looks pretty much unstoppable. Let me give you an example. China managed to do tremendous poverty reduction on the back of manufacturing over the last couple of decades. But no longer can industries employ huge masses of people and drag populations out of poverty. FoxConn, one of the largest manufacturing companies in China that makes iPhones for Apple, this May, eliminated 60,000 people out of their 150,000 work force. These people were replaced by robots. We can safely assume that India\u2019s poverty reduction strategy cannot be manufacturing, because new factories would inevitably use robotics, not people. Agriculture is seeing very similar levels of automation as well, by the way. I\u2019ll give you another example, this time software, not hardware. In the advertising industry, media buying and allocating budget to various types of advertisements, and various media outlets has been a crucial job. Today, advertising is shifting online rapidly. And media buying in the context of online advertising is a 100% automated job that is performed by software, not human beings. It\u2019s all done with mathematical precision, measured in real-time, and human beings just cannot play in this rapid-fire software application game. Same thing happens in finance by the way, with real-time high-frequency trading where human beings simply play no role. Machines think, machines look at data, machines make decisions in split seconds. And machines replace white-collar jobs, not just blue-collar factory workers. Let\u2019s talk about the field of medicine. If you think about what a doctor needs to do to diagnose an illness, she needs to consider all the symptoms, take into account all the test results, consider all the treatment options, factor in all the side-effects of various medications and their interplay with other medications the patient is already taking. This is, effectively, a multi-variate optimization problem that a doctor has to do in her head. And, she needs to keep up with all the new research and advances in medical science, and factor those in as well. The field of medicine is full of incorrect diagnosis and mistreatment of illnesses. Now, if you replace this whole process with software, which IBM is trying to do with their Watson supercomputer, medical diagnosis becomes a truly scientific, deterministic process. I can tell you, if I have the option of being diagnosed by software versus a human doctor, I would always prefer software. It will be far more accurate. In the medical field, there are also tremendous advances in robotic surgery. So, the medical field will get dramatically disrupted in the next 30 years. The legal profession will face similar disruption with lawyers getting replaced by software. There are, of course, both pros and cons in this disruption. If the medical profession can be automated to that extent, billions of people can have access to quality medical care. Today, this number is relatively low. That\u2019d be a huge positive outcome of automation in the medical field, for example. In another industry \u2013 transportation \u2013 there\u2019s already huge disruption underway. Some of you are already using services like Uber and Ola \u2013 these are replacements for taxis. Well, the taxi industry is a major employer, and this trend is going to destroy an enormous number of jobs, and this one isn\u2019t even a few decades away \u2013 it\u2019s here. Now. It\u2019s upon us. Then we have self-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles including trucks that drive themselves. This technology is almost ready. If governments allow autonomous vehicles, this will eliminate the requirement for drivers. If you have a combination of ride-sharing a la Uber and autonomous cars, PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that 99% of the vehicles on the roads can be removed altogether. The total size of the fleet will fall from 245 million vehicles to just 2.4 million vehicles. That eliminates entire professions like truck drivers, taxi drivers. Car ownership drops. That shrinks the car manufacturing industry dramatically. Car insurance industry gets decimated. Car service industry shrinks. Massive disruption. 10 million jobs will disappear.

            "answer_text": "Following Are the Future upcoming changes you can expect in this field! AI and Robotics Will close The field of cybernetics has already begun to meld with AI which trend is predicted to continue. By incorporating AI technology into robotics, we\u2019ll soon be ready to enhance our own bodies, giving us greater strength, longevity, and endurance. While cybernetics may help us enhance our healthy bodies, the appliance of this technology is basically aimed toward helping the disabled. Those individuals, who have amputated limbs or permanent paralysis, are often given away higher quality of life. Cybernetic limbs which will communicate with the brain can become almost as useful as natural limbs. within the future, artificial limbs may even become stronger, faster, and more efficient. AI Will Help Create Fully Functional Robots In addition to helping us enhance our bodies, AI technology is additionally expected to assist us create artificial lifeforms. fantasy has long suggested the concept of human-like robots that are capable of complex interactions. That future might not be very faraway at now . because the field of robotics advances and incorporates AI technology, robots will become useful during a sort of ways. they will combat dangerous jobs and work that poses health risks to people. Even today, drones and fewer sophisticated robots are performing welding and other hazardous tasks, though they\u2019re typically controlled by an operator via a foreign . How Will AI Technology Change Our Lives on a private Level? Artificial intelligence has already made its way into many homes, but it'll soon be indispensable in most households. As we move closer toward becoming a technologically driven society, AI applications will fulfill the promise that computers would make our lives easier. AI technology will help us live happier and healthier lives, while also helping us conserve time, energy, and money. You\u2019ll Have a Virtual Assistant Many people already make use of AI-driven personal assistants. Amazon\u2019s Echo and Alexa currently dominate the market, but the competition is starting to offer more virtual assistants to settle on from. What can they are doing for you? Currently, they will provide information, like a weather report, and order services, like place your weekly pizza delivery order. They\u2019re also wont to control smart home devices from the stereo to the thermostat. within the future, AI-driven virtual assistants will anticipate your needs and fulfill them without the necessity to offer them instructions. as an example , if you grill steaks every Friday, your virtual assistant can have fresh steaks delivered to the house every Thursday. Your Face Will Become Your ID We\u2019re already seeing biometric incorporated into our daily lives which technology is predicted to evolve. Eventually, many within the tech industry anticipate AI-driven applications allowing machines to acknowledge your face to finish transactions. Your credit cards and driver\u2019s license could also be linked to your face, allowing pattern recognition devices to understand you instantly. this will make everyday transactions much more efficient, saving us from having to attend in line at the shop, bank, or movies. Receive Better medical aid Research is already underway to develop new software applications that use AI to assist doctors to diagnose and treat patients. It won\u2019t be long before wearable devices can measure blood glucose levels for diabetics and transmit that data to the patient\u2019s doctor. Already, devices are in use that measure pulse, respiration, and other vital functions. AI can also help patients better understand their care options and communicate more effectively with their caregivers. AI Responses are going to be More Empathetic Internet users have already seen the effect AI has had once they visit an internet site with a chatbot. within the past, chatbots were pre-programmed to offer specific answers to specific inquiries. Today, AI software allows chatbots and virtual personal assistants to research any question and supply an accurate response. While that's impressive, there\u2019s still room for advancement. Ultimately, AI-driven devices will analyze our speech or actions to interpret our needs, in order that they offer more insightful information. this sort of programming might best be described as \u201cdigital empathy\u201d and it's going to provide the simplest human-device interactions possible. Caring for youngsters and therefore the Elderly are going to be Easier Both virtual assistants and robots may advance to A level nearing human efficiency, which suggests these devices are going to be ready to look after those needing supervision. Down the road , robots could also be ready to look after your child or elder parent. this will release some time and, in cases of the elderly, prevent them from wanting to enter an assisted living facility. Elders can occupy a home, where they feel easier, while the robot performs functions to stay the individual healthy and safe from harm. The rising concern over elder abuse and neglect may make this one among the foremost anticipated applications for AI. Hollywood May Become Obsolete Currently, streaming sites, like using a sort of AI to supply suggestions, supported your previous television and film viewing patterns. Similarly, sites like Spotify and Pandora use AI to assist you to create stations that exclusively play your favourite music. this is often just the start, as far as how AI will cater to our entertainment interests. within the future, AI applications may analyze our interests and draw upon them to make music and shows that use digital performers. Since everything is going to be supported personal preferences, we\u2019ll rarely need to sit through a \u201cflop\u201d or a nasty song. As AI continues to evolve, these innovations will likely be overshadowed by even greater advancements. While there are no thanks to knowing needless to say how far AI technology will advance, it does seem obvious that it'll become an integral a part of our lives. Already, we frequently use AI-driven technology without even realizing it A good way to start your basic knowledge will be to go with online courses as it is easy and convenient, one such good platform can be Eduonix.

            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence is a blooming technological advancement, from software\u2019s like Alexa, to basic human command system. Every aspect of these technologies has been put to its best use. It is now turning a basic part of human lives. People need this technology in enterprises and even households. Artificial intelligence has made its way through all sectors of society. Every person is using this technology in some or the other way. Moreover, it is modified for different age groups and industrial sectors. The future of artificial intelligence is more fascinating than ever. People seem to have indulged in this debate for years now. Some say robots are the future and they will replicate humans completely. Another opinion is a human dependency on this sector will increase manifold. However, one thing is for sure, artificial intelligence is progressing faster than ever, and no one knows what might come next. Amongst all the debate, there are some predictions that one can consider: Prediction #1: Universal Usage Artificial intelligence is already a part of various everyday activities. The future might make humans completely dependent on this technology. For example, self-driving cars are being developed with artificial intelligence. There is no limit to this technology if it wants to make the human experience easier. Prediction #2: AI and robotics will merge Many have predicted that by applying this technology in robots multiple new inventions can be created. There are many effects this can have on humans. Like, robotics will completely alter the medical stream, probably being able to be able to cure anything easily. Prediction #3: Simpler work environment Unlike any other predictions, this one says that artificial intelligence will only enhance your work environment. It will make tedious tasks simpler and humans will be able to focus on key tasks. This will help in utilizing human resource to its best potential. Therefore, the future can be infinite and the changes can be unpredictable. Although, one thing is for sure this technology will change the dynamics of our lives. ",

            "answer_text": " When the industrial revolution is mentioned, what immediately comes to mind is steam engines, ironworkers, and textile mills. This was a transformative time in the late 18th and early 19th centuries because it marked the transition from an agrarian society to factory-based work. Shortly before the First World War, another phase of industrialization took place brought about by the expansion of steel and oil production, as well as the discovery of electricity. Fast-forward to the 1980s, and you see the rise of digital electronics as well as their impact on society, which marked the genesis of the digital revolution. What we now know as the Fourth Industrial Revolution is yet another transformation of the society, this time, driven by technological advancements. To be specific, the technological advancements in question are centered on Artificial Intelligence (AI), autonomous machines, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Basically, in the formative industrial revolution, brawn was replaced by steam. In the subsequent one, steam was substituted by electricity. The third one saw the introduction of computers. While what society has been relying on is intelligent rule-based systems, what has not been in use systems is systems that can learn. This is the crux of Artificial Intelligence in the prevailing technological transformation. So, what is the future of AI? Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that the journey to where we are with AI now has been long and treacherous. The quest for the development of this technology has wavered, experiencing multiple \u2018winters' where it looked destined for dead ends and disappointment. Today, the situation is different as businesses, and even national governments are investing billions into AI Research and Development. Essentially, what was a plot device in science fiction movies is in the process of being actualized. Google is employing AI in the diagnosis of heart problems more rapidly and precisely, American Express is using bots to serve its clientele online, while hedge funds are deploying AI to beat the stock market. Today, researchers are not talking about a single AI invention. Instead, the tone has shifted towards hundreds of AI creations, each focused on resolving a complex challenge in society today. So, what is the future of AI? What we have now is referred to as \u2018narrow\u2019 AI because it is has been developed to perform small tasks such as helping with the navigation of your car's GPS systems, executing Amazon product recommendations, or facial recognition among others. However, the future of AI is the development of a self-teaching system that can outdo human input and intelligence in different disciplines whether it is playing chess or solving equations. Some scientists believe this objective will be realized in the next three decades, while others talk about centuries to come. What is certain is that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is already in motion. ",

It is even scarier how much it does impact the World as I am answering this question. Everything became so artificial that they decided to cover the intelligence as well. In my opinion, humanity created the artificial intelligence for quite different reasons that it is used for right now. Correct me if I am wrong but we did create it to make our lives easier, didn't we? We invented autonomous vehicles, and talkative fridges, automatic garages and what so not. But we forgot to protect ourselves along the lines. Did we think about our own security for a minute when we were entering our personal data in the systems? Did it even cross our minds that our trust in the devices can be used against us? I am pretty sure, we did not. The humanity created the artificial intelligence so it can help us. Yet we will be the ones trying to help ourselves get rid of it. Mark my words, it will be a tiring war. We will have to turn against everything we designed. It will be us against the monsters we gave life to. If we don\u2019t stop the artificial intelligence, it will stop us. It will start controlling our lives instead of the other way around. As of now, we still have the matters in our own hands. Let's not forget about that yet. We still have the power to control it all. And yes, we don't have to go all the way through it. Because if we do, the AI will become unstoppable. Not you, me or anyone will be able to control what's happening in the World. And that's just something no alive soul wants to be a part of. The most powerful creatures of this planet will become those who are less in power. It is a messed up, isn't it? It terrifies me and it should do the same thing to those in charge. Because in my opinion, it is time to start. Artificial intelligence is meant to help people, not to do a damage to the world. Let's not contribute to that purpose even more. ",

Humans control the planet and we won\u2019t allow machines to take control away from us. It will just make our lives better in the end. We will just fill our lives with more useful smart machines. For the same reasons we put seat belts and air bags in cars, and safety guards on tools, and creates laws against the building and use of nuclear weapons, we humans are smart enough to not yet dangerous things hurt us. We make mistakes, and learn, but in the end, we find ways to protect ourselves from things that are dangerous to us. Whatever the risk of AI, we will find ways to protect ourselves from it, and in the end, we will only use the \u201cgood\u201d forms of AI and prevent the bad forms from hurting us. AI will change society whoever. The big change is in the economy since we will use this new technology to automate the entire economy and this will convert wage income to capital income \u2014 the income always grows with the economic output, but it will all be rent collecting income, instead of labor income. So profits, and capital gains, land rents, and interest payments will make up all the income of an automated system. An economy based mostly on capital income can\u2019t support a democracy because capital income is a winner take all game where a few people always win big and everyone else loses big. It guarantees levels of inequality that can\u2019t support a society. The machine economy we have already created has driven the levels of inequality beyond what works to support a healthy society. Our society is sick, and getting worse, because of the rising inequality, which comes from our technology. As AI and technology advances, this scikness will only continue to grow. The sickness created by this has to be cured, and the cure is a Basic Income. We need to share the capital income as a public resource, and prevent it from being privately hoarded to cure this sickness. Because our society grew up on the back of labor income, our culture places high value on a work ethic which the rise of smart machines has destroyed. It\u2019s hard for people to cope with change that happens this fast but we must because the machines aren\u2019t going to stop getting smarter and the jobs aren\u2019t coming back. AI is forcing a transition from a private labor income and private capital income economy to a private labor and PUBLIC capital income income economy and this change is going to be hard for a lot of people to accept. So the transition will be rough. It\u2019s already rough \u2014 9/11 and the great recession, Brexit, and Trump are all potholes on the path created by the rise of automation). But, once we get the world converted to public sharing of capital wealth through a world wide Basic Income, then things will get a LOT better very fast and we will harness AI to do massive good for the world.

            "answer_text": "As of 2020, 8 years into the most powerful wave of AI ever, the future of AI is in coming up with a THEORY of what Deep Learning is all about and what all those artificial neurons do and what role they play in coming up with the results at the inference time. What this theory will show is that Deep Learning is all about LINEAR quantum-like operators and transformation, in a manner very much related to Quantum Computers. The mystique of this latest wave of Deep Learning and AI has been (rightfully) centered around generalization, meaning how deep learning networks are able to come up with reasonable answers on data they never saw before, after lots of training, of course. And the key is presumed to be in the non-linearities in the activation layers of artificial neurons. The initial activation function favorite of sigmoid has been whittled down to ReLU, which is almost as simple as it can be, and actually looks rather linear:  But this supposed linearity is a taboo as of now, as it is taken as a gospel that the magic of generalization can only come from something non-linear, as linear systems are supposedly (way) too simple to account for the magic of deep learning. This sentiment has persisted ever since the initial critique of perceptrons by Minsky and Papert, that supposedly showed great limitations of early neural networks such as perceptrons. That critique, of inability to do XOR function, has received a huge amount of (misinterpreted) attention through the years. It as in fact rather specific and localized to the connectivity of input neurons, as opposed to some grandiose statement of ultimate limits of computation. It is true that the linearity in Deep Learning is not obvious and hard to see, as it is obscured by reams of real numbers floating around in deep networks. The key is in a DOMAIN TRANSFORMATION where operators become linear. Such transformations are well-known in other fields, notably Laplace-transform in Electrical Engineering (and other fields) where systems of (linear) differential equations are transformed to polynomial fractions in the complex variable s of the Laplace transform. As for critiques of linear systems being too simple in nature, see this little field of Quantum Mechanics to figure how complex it can get. The future of AI and Deep Learning as of 2020 is in unveiling of this transformation, demonstrated to be quantum-like and linear. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps it is safe to say that with the role of technology in our lives today, our future depends so much on how far we we will go with its development and advancement and its crucial role in reshaping and redefining our society as a whole. Artificial intelligence has grown so much that its value has been highly appreciated not just in the computer industry. The continuing pursuit to advance in more areas has been overwhelming that we see our future side by side with it taking our role and the ones we never thought we could devolve. Here are 6 ways AI might affect us in the future. 1. Automated Transportation We\u2019re already seeing the beginnings of self-driving cars, though the vehicles are currently required to have a driver present at the wheel for safety. Despite these exciting developments, the technology isn\u2019t perfect yet, and it will take a while for public acceptance to bring automated cars into widespread use. Google began testing a self-driving car in 2012, and since then, the U.S. Department of Transportation has released definitions of different levels of automation, with Google\u2019s car classified as the first level down from full automation. Other transportation methods are closer to full automation, such as buses and trains. 2. Cyborg Technology One of the main limitations of being human is simply our own bodies\u2014and brains. Researcher Shimon Whiteson thinks that in the future, we will be able to augment ourselves with computers and enhance many of our own natural abilities. Though many of these possible cyborg enhancements would be added for convenience, others might serve a more practical purpose. Yoky Matsuka of Nest believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs, as the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb to give the patient more control. This kind of cyborg technology would significantly reduce the limitations that amputees deal with on a daily basis.  3. Taking over dangerous jobs Robots are already taking over some of the most hazardous jobs available, including bomb defusing. These robots aren\u2019t quite robots yet, according to the BBC. They are technically drones, being used as the physical counterpart for defusing bombs, but requiring a human to control them, rather than using AI. Whatever their classification, they have saved thousands of lives by taking over one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. As technology improves, we will likely see more AI integration to help these machines function. Other jobs are also being reconsidered for robot integration. Welding, well known for producing toxic substances, intense heat, and earsplitting noise, can now be outsourced to robots in most cases. Robot Worx explains that robotic welding cells are already in use, and have safety features in place to help prevent human workers from fumes and other bodily harm. 4. Solving climate change Solving climate change might seem like a tall order from a robot, but as Stuart Russell explains, machines have more access to data than one person ever could\u2014storing a mind-boggling number of statistics. Using big data, AI could one day identify trends and use that information to come up with solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems. 5. Robot as friends Who wouldn\u2019t want a friend like C-3PO? At this stage, most robots are still emotionless and it\u2019s hard to picture a robot you could relate to. However, a company in Japan has made the first big steps toward a robot companion\u2014one who can understand and feel emotions. Introduced in 2014, \u201cPepper\u201d the companion robot went on sale in 2015, with all 1,000 initial units selling out within a minute. The robot was programmed to read human emotions, develop its own emotions, and help its human friends stay happy. Pepper goes on sale in the U.S. in 2016, and more sophisticated friendly robots are sure to follow.  6. Improved elder care For many seniors, everyday life is a struggle, and many have to hire outside help to manage their care, or rely on family members. AI is at a stage where replacing this need isn\u2019t too far off, says Matthew Taylor, computer scientist at Washington State University. \u201cHome\u201d robots could help seniors with everyday tasks and allow them to stay independent and in their homes for as long as possible, which improves their overall well-being. Although we don\u2019t know the exact future, it is quite evident that interacting with AI will soon become an everyday activity. These interactions will clearly help our society evolve, particularly in regards to automated transportation, cyborgs, handling dangerous duties, solving climate change, friendships and improving the care of our elders. Beyond these six impacts, there are even more ways that AI technology can influence our future, and this very fact has professionals across multiple industries extremely excited for the ever-burgeoning future of artificial intelligence.

            "answer_text": " The past few years have been landmark years for advancements in artificial intelligence.  Recently, tech giants like Facebook and Google have created their own AI labs to produce robots capable of learning to play video games without any instructions. Google now has their own form of AI called Deep Learning, which in 2015 doubled in the amount of projects using it. A huge focus right now for startups and giants alike is to learn how to use AI to help better automate a machine\u2019s ability to solve problems on the fly. There\u2019s definite signs that machines with artificial intelligence will soon be taking over skilled manual work that now is typically handled by humans. Amazon recently showed interest in getting more robots working in its fulfillment centers by holding a contest called the Amazon Picking Challenge at a prominent robotics conference, which awarded $25,000 to the team that could design a robot to identify and grasp items from a storage shelf as quickly as possible. While this may seem like a trivial task for us, grasping items haphazardly arranged on a shelf requires intelligence, expert coordination, and an understanding of one\u2019s environment \u2014 skills that up until this point have been quite difficult for robotkind. Amazon already employs the use of robots in its fulfillment centers according to the reports of those that have been given behind the scenes peeks. The word is that these centers are already highly automated and sophisticated, with robot workers that transport products between humans as endpoints in a finely tuned system. Amazon is not the only organization backing up innovations in artificial intelligence. TheDARPA Robotics Challenge, funded by the U.S. military, gave participants the lofty goal of designing humanoid robots capable of responding to highly dangerous disaster scenarios. Robots needed to make their way through a series of grueling challenges; testing their skills in everything from opening doors to operating power tools. The $2M prize ended up going to a participant who won because his robot could both walk and roll along on its knees. Facebook has been doing some interesting things in its AI lab with a deep learning AI capable of parsing language and holding meaningful conversations. They also recently started a personal assisting service called \"M\" that is using human workers to train future AI.  No other point in history has seen this much engagement in the development of artificial intelligence, and it\u2019s showing. These past few years have been a shining moment in history for AI, with the epic unveiling of self learning robots. A new issue to ponder: How do we face our fears of a future AI mutiny? How do we keep new technologies in check? With the development of standards to prevent robots from ever turning on their makers, the next new advancements in artificial intelligence will be of interest to watch. ",

            "answer_text": "I think AI is going to be more influential in the SaaS industry, and that\u2019s something we should all look forward to. AI will help a lot in removing tedious tasks for humans, leaving us more time to do jobs that need critical thinking and creativity, such as designing products or services, thinking of new brand campaigns, or dealing with human relationships. The last one is the most important, because that determines the success of your company. Keeping meaningful and productive relationships with customers is essential to remaining a profitable company, while healthy relations between people in the office is the key to meeting business objectives. Some applications of AI are already sweeping many tech-based industries, like insurance and finance, health, and even customer service firms. AI is powering robots that do geological surveys, calculate risks, talk to humans, record information, and capture data from interactions. Those are just some of the possibilities with AI. The expansion of AI use may also result in the transformation of work culture, where people will be more challenged to do better than robots and be knowledgeable in robot use. In the tech world, it would certainly be more advantageous, and more lucrative, to have credentials in machine learning, especially as robots would most likely provide the best solutions to business problems. That\u2019s why this early, it\u2019s imperative for companies like us to invest in AI, think of ways to integrate into our system, and teach employees what AI is about and how it will change the future. We\u2019ve written an article on this at the Tenfold blog, aptly titled Process Audit: How to Prepare Your Team for AI. Hope you can check this out and our other free ebooks on integration solutions for businesses. ",

Enough data has been archived to discover many things, but we are not yet at the point of being able to make these discoveries. The technology certainly exists, but the latest advances are still difficult to implement broadly and lack the required financial investment, in some cases due to elusive monetary rewards. As we better understand how to efficiently implement AI and current implementations stabilize, our abilities will reach critical mass. The data to broadly identify criminal behavior, illegal actions, and compliance avoidance already exists. We also have the data to understand the impact of decisions and legislation that can improve the quality of life. The massive troves of medical data will soon be mined to discover cures and treatments. AI tools coupled with other advances will enable ever more sophisticated genetic engineering for an increasing range of biological systems. The reality is that human behavior will hinder this progress. Status quo is perceived to be the safe and sound approach. Bad actors will do their best to interfere, ironically adding to the evidence that will ultimately reveal them. Those in power over various doctrines will rally their followers to resist. The good news is that AI is increasingly within the reach of everyone. Tools and techniques are appearing at an accelerating rate. Anyone with a laptop, a few thousand dollars for compute power, and sufficient education has the tools to contribute to advancing AI. Certainly, many will not discover new techniques, but they can apply known models to additional corpora to gain new insights. AI is indeed the new electricity. More importantly, AI is at the equivalent stage of development as electricity was when AC and DC power were competing for dominance. The significant difference is that there are dozens of competing AI technology models. ",

We\u2019re already witnessing the beginnings of self-driving cars, though the vehicles are currently required to have a driver present at the wheel for security. Robots are already taking over some of the most dangerous jobs available, including bomb defusing. They are technically drones, being used as the physical counterpart for defusing explosives, but demanding a human to control them, rather than using AI. Whatever their classification, they have protected thousands of lives by taking over one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. If you want to know what Jeff Bezos speaks about the future of AI and how it is going to change our lives forever, do check out the following video:  Although we don\u2019t know the exact future, it is quite obvious that interacting with AI will soon become an everyday practice. These communications will help our community evolves, especially in respects to automated transportation, cyborgs, handling critical duties, resolving climate change, friendships and enhancing the care of our elders. Beyond these six impacts, there are even more ways that AI technology can impact our future, and this very fact has experts across multiple industries remarkably excited for the future of artificial intelligence.  Shortly general AI will begin taking jobs away from people, millions of jobs as drivers, radiologists, insurance adjusters. In one possible situation, this will lead governments to pay jobless citizens a universal basic income, freeing them to pursue their dreams unburdened by the need to earn a living. ",

            "answer_text": " What is Artificial Intelligence(AI)? Artificial Intelligence is empowering machines to behave like humans by adding Emotional Quotient(EQ) to them. These machines are controlled by computer systems. These systems are programmed in a way to learn, analyze and even self-correct to get a higher degree of accuracy. Big Data and Data Analytics are common terms today and used to simulate AI. Machines can now process information for themselves on a very high level. It allows them to perform complex functions like image recognition. Big data can be used to speed up AI development and soon AI will significantly impact our everyday lives. How has AI grown? From its inception, AI has grown by leaps and bounds. We have more power in our pockets than what our grandparents were used to in their homes and offices. But, did you know that the future of AI is even more exciting?How will be using Big Data Analytics and AI in the future?Applications of Data Analytics and AI in Healthcare: The human body is a machine, and who better to replace a machine than another machine? The use of artificial limbs and organs will be commonplace in the future. Even in the disciplines of cardiology and radiology, you will see all mundane tasks being taken over by robots and human supervision will only be needed in complex cases. Using Data Analytics and AI to do Dangerous jobs: Already we are using drones for bomb diffusion. Farming, welding, mining and any other jobs known for producing toxic substances, intense heat, and earsplitting noise, can now be outsourced to robots in most cases. These safety features help prevent human workers from fumes and other bodily harm. Using Data Analytics and AI to enhance Cyber Security. Artificial Intelligence can be used to outwit hackers. We can have a system that daily monitors millions of data points and flags anything suspicious.

            "answer_text": "Hi there, Here we have an interesting Blog about AI / AI in Software Testing which I think ban be useful for you. Have a good read. In 21th century AI is coming to change out vision for life. It is everywhere in our daily life: may it be while commuting, working or just relaxing. We are unconsciously in touch with AI and it will become more and more integrated in our daily life. Nowadays many of professions are trying to implement AI in their working process. And now we are going to see how AI is helping to do Software Testing. Wikipedia defines AI research as \u201c\u2026the study of \u201cintelligent agents\u201d: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\u201d In other words it\u2019s the ability of a computer program or machine to think and to learn. As the software economy grows, enterprises push towards digital transformation and consumers have become more demanding and impatient, software development and testing can\u2019t be in match using traditional methods and practices. Businesses now demand real-time risk assessment all over the different stages of the software delivery cycle.Speed \u2013 is all that matters in product delivery and one of the best and most efficient ways to achieve it is to implement machine learning and AI in software testing practices. So the use of AI in software testing could arise as a response to these changing times and environments. AI could be of a great help in developing failsafe applications and to enable greater automation in testing to meet these expanded expectations from testing. The application of AI in software testing tools is focused on making the software development lifecycle easier. For example, consider that most (if not all) test automation tools run tests for you and deliver results. Most don\u2019t know which tests to run, so they run all of them or some predetermined set. So what if an AI-enabled bot can review the current state of test status, recent code changes, code coverage, and other metrics, decide which tests to run, and then run them? So what comes next? We are in active R&D era, trying to continuously implement applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment our software testing tool kit. There are many means of research, but the end goal is clear: to support teams develop and test their code more efficiently and effectively, to create higher quality software at speed. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Automatic Transport We are currently seeing the launch of self-driving cars, but vehicles must now have a driver at the wheel for safety. Despite these exciting developments, the technology is not yet perfect and it will take some time for the public's willingness to make automated cars more widespread. Google began testing the self-driving car in 2012, and since then, the U.S. has made a significant contribution to the industry. The Department of Transportation has released definitions of different levels of automation, with Google car classifying the first level from full automation. Other modes of transportation are closer to full automation, such as buses and trains. 2. Cyborg Technology One of the main limitations of being a human being is our bodies and brains. Researcher Shimon Whitson hopes that in the future, we will be able to enhance ourselves with computers and build our own natural capabilities. While many of these cyborg enhancements are being added for convenience, others serve a more practical purpose. Nest's Yoki Matsuka believes that AI can be useful for people with broken organs because the brain can communicate with the robotic limb to give the patient more control. This type of cyborg technology significantly reduces the limits of dealing with amputees on a regular basis. 3. Taking up dangerous jobs Robots are already taking some of the riskiest jobs available, including bombing. The BBC said these robots were not yet robots. They are technically used as a physical counterpart to disarm drones and bombs, but require humans to control them without using AI. Whatever their classification, they saved thousands of lives by taking over one of the world's most dangerous jobs. As technology improves, we will see more AI integration to help these machines work. Other jobs for robot integration are also being reviewed. Welding, which is known to produce toxic materials, extreme heat and deafening noise, can now be outsourced to robots in most cases. RobotWorks explains that robotic welding cells are already in use and have safety features to prevent human workers from fumes and other bodily harm. 4. Resolving Climate Change Resolving climate change may seem like a long order from a robot, but as Stuart Russell explains, machines have access to more data than ever before \u2014 storing mind-boggling statistics. Using big data, AI can one day track trends and use that information to come up with solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems. 5. Robot as friends Who wouldn't want a friend like C-3PO? At this stage, most robots are still very emotional and it is difficult to portray a robot that you can relate to. However, a company in Japan has taken the first big steps toward a robot companion \u2014 a person who can understand and feel emotions. Introduced in 2014, the \u201cPepper\u201d Companion Robot went on sale in 2015, with a total of 1,000 startup units sold within minutes. The robot is programmed to read human emotions, develop its own emotions, and help its human friends be happy. The pepper was released in 2016 in the U.S. Selling in and ensuring more sophisticated friendly robots follow suit. 6. Improved Large Care For many seniors, everyday life is a struggle, and many need to seek outside help or depend on family members to manage their care. AI is not far off to replace this need, says Washington State University computer scientist Matthew Taylor. \"Home\" robots assist seniors with daily tasks and enable them to stay independent and in their homes as long as possible, which improves their overall well-being. While we do not know the exact future, it is clear that communicating with AI will soon become a daily activity. These interactions will clearly help our society grow, especially in the areas of automated transport, cyborgs, managing dangerous tasks, addressing climate change, improving friendships and taking care of our elders. Beyond these six influences, there are many more ways that AI technology can impact our future, and this fact makes professionals in multiple industries keen for the ever-evolving future of artificial intelligence.

            "answer_text": "The Short Read: Emotionally Intelligent Software is the New AI Advanced digital tools have revolutionized the modern workplace. But CIOs often make the same mistake when choosing new software. They focus too much on user outcomes, and not enough on usability. Think about it. Everything we hear and read about emerging tech boils down to the promise for greater outcomes. It\u2019s all about deeper insights, fewer errors, and higher productivity, all in less time. We see this now with the hype around artificial intelligence. AI-generated buzz is merited, but enhanced technological capabilities \u2014 no matter how intelligent \u2014 don\u2019t matter if the tool is too difficult to use. Organizations need emotionally intelligent software to raise both outcomes and usability. Tools that can anticipate where frustration will occur and prevent a negative emotional response in users will be of the greatest value to companies and produce the highest ROI for CIOs. What does emotional intelligence have to do with technology?  Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is defined as the ability to understand and manage one\u2019s own emotions, and to recognize, monitor, and influence the emotions of others. EQ is a critical \u201csoft skill\u201d for managers and employees alike. It\u2019s rarely applied to technology, mainly because software doesn\u2019t have emotions (yet\u2026) \u2014 but the human end-user does. Anyone who has ever struggled to use a complex software platform knows how excruciatingly frustrating it can be. You have a job to do and you need to use a certain tool to do it. But the tool isn\u2019t working for you. Time is passing, your stress is rising, and your productivity is declining. As excited as CIOs may be about implementing a promising new software solution, the road to adoption will be long and full of obstacles if the tool lacks emotional intelligence. Emotionally intelligent software is within reach If difficulty using software evokes a negative emotional response, employee productivity and performance will suffer. Digital adoption platforms add a layer of \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d to any software platform. With AI and machine learning capabilities, this breed of software uses data to anticipate where users will experience friction, a key indicator of employee frustration. It can proactively deploy onscreen assistance in the form of pop-ups to prevent user issues from arising. Digital adoption platforms ensure a positive emotional user experience by providing help and preventing the factors that contribute to user frustration. Think about how much more efficient, productive, and happy your employees will be if they don\u2019t feel like pulling out their hair every time it\u2019s time to use a software system. An EQ boost goes a long way  Digital tools have the power to skyrocket employee productivity and enhance virtually all business functions. It\u2019s the CIO\u2019s job to decide which tools will support the business strategy. It\u2019s also their responsibility to ensure employees can use the tools effectively, without frustration or difficulty. Emotionally intelligent software solutions like digital adoption platforms prevent negative emotions among users so they can work better, not harder.

            "answer_text": " It was mathematician and scientist Alan Turing who spent a lot of time after the Second World War on devising the Turing Test. Though it was basic, this test involved evaluating if it was possible for artificial intelligence to hold a realistic conversation with a person, thus convincing them that they were also human. Since Turing\u2019s Test, AI was restricted to fundamental computer models. It was in 1955 when John McCarthy \u2013 a professor at MIT, coined the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d. During his tenure at MIT, he built an AI laboratory. Full List Processing (LISP) was developed by him there. LISP was a computer programming language for robotics intended to provide expansion potential as technology improvements happened with time. Though promise was shown by some base model machines \u2013 be it Shakey the Robot (1966) or Waseda University\u2019s anthropomorphic androids WABOT-1 (1973) and WABOT-2 (1984), it wasn\u2019t until 1990 when Rodney Brooks revitalized the concept of computer intelligence. But it took many more years for artificial intelligence to evolve as it was only in 2014 that Eugene, which was a chatbot program designed by the Russians, was able to successfully convince 33% of human judges. According to Turing\u2019s original test, more than 30% was a pass, though plenty of room was left for stepping it up in the future. From its humble beginnings, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved as perhaps the most significant technological advancement in recent decades across all industries. Be it the robotics aspect of AI, or the implementation of machine learning (ML) technologies that are driving useful insights from big data, the future seems to hold a lot of promise. In fact, the enhanced information extracted from large chunks of data is helping companies today to mitigate supply chain risks, improve customer retention rates, and do a lot more. An example of how these technologies could change the way we live and work became evident when Amazon introduced its Alexa in the workplace. However, many believe that the AI-powered, voice-activated device signals just the beginning. Thanks to NLP (natural language processing), which is made possible via machine learning, modern computers, hi-tech systems, and solutions can now know the context and meaning of sentences in a much better way. As NLP becomes more improved and refined, humans will start communicating with machines seamlessly exclusively via voice without the need of writing code for a command. Thus, professionals who can design and test devices based on NLP and voice-driven interactions are likely to be in high demand in the future. With the growing interest and implementation of artificial intelligence in various fields and the promising future the global machine learning market (predicted to grow to $8.8B by 2022 from $1.4B in 2017, according to a report by Research and Markets), there\u2019s bound to be a wide variety in future jobs for data science professionals as well those specializing in AI and ML.

            "answer_text": "One can only make a calculated prediction regarding the advancement of artificial intelligence in subsequent years by assessing the progress that it has made in the past few decades. It has had a short yet eventful history, interspersed with sluggish blips and periods of massive and swift development. Artificial intelligence first shaped up as an academic and functional point of discussion in the 1940s and 50s. Growth was positive and extensive research-based breakthroughs were made in the field, especially in USA, bolstered by government funding. However, the graph turned stagnant in the next couple of decades, now known as the \u201cAI winter\u201d period.  Nevertheless, as new countries such as Japan and Germany joined the bandwagon, exponential growth was seen around the end of the previous millennium. In the last few years, monumental landmarks have been breached with the popularisation of driverless cars, the advent of autonomous weapons, conversational machines, order-to-task robots and the tapping of neural networks. Over the last five years AI research has grown by 12.9% annually worldwide. In 2020, AI has seeped into almost every sector which has a technological base and is facilitating a level of growth and productivity that has never been seen before. Several startups are incorporating AI-based tools as a part of their core functioning, with more expected to join the wagon in the next few years. Analysts have predicted the appearance of a new Industrial Revolution phase in the next 50 years, and the complete takeover of mechanical functioning by AI-based machines. The future holds several promises, as well as numerous uncertainties. While one can\u2019t exactly gauge what shall happen, one can certainly be sure that it shall mark a new chapter for the human race.

We are biased, prejudiced, racist, sexist. And in the data that we feed to the artificial intelligence, there are bits upon bits of these flaws hidden in the data which we not be conscious about. We feed the artificial intelligence this data. It doesn't know anything about propaganda, it doesn't know anything about prejudices, it doesn't know about sexism and racism, so what do you end up with? A super \u201cintelligence\u201d that is horribly biased. And that is WRONG! The \u201cbad guys\u201d can consciously feed the artificial intelligence a bunch of flawed data like that and use it for their own advances. Now do you realize the potential danger that is to society? Another thing to consider is, this highly sophisticated technology is quite likely to be controlled by people that are already rich and powerful and that IS DANGEROUS! FOR ALL OF US. I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN! Well, what can we do about that? Well this is where the good guys come in. They will be the ones scrutinizing the data that will be fed to the AI to ensure that there are none of such biases. BUT EVEN THAT, THEY ARE STILL HUMAN! AND MAY MISS THE MICRO BIASES HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN THE DATA! On the bright side, artificial intelligence is what could \u201cpotentially\u201d bring this world to a Utopia.

            "answer_text": "The Future is a state of mind. You choose. The mechanical theory of mind enthymeme of the Deep Learning paradigm has been clearly stated in the recent ICML2018 meeting, in a comprehensive and informed presentation entitled \"Building Machines that Learn & Think Like People\" - Prof. Josh Tenenbaum laid out this research roadmap.  Let this represent the enthymeme of the positive argument for Perception and Prediction. Let the following represent the positive argument for the more powerful and expressive generalization abiding in perspective and orthogonality. This capacity is only available with the alternative: the Readware metalanguage and learning system technology. Premise 1: The orthography of a language encapsulates orthogonality which is the generalization of the notion of perpendicularity to the linear surface. The rotating, scaling and abstract operations needed to symbolize a continuously rotating 3-D World using periodic and n-D spaces (places) necessitates learning such an anterior generalization. This explains why children are given alphabetic blocks to play with these scaling and rotating operations while learning to speak, read and write using the abstract symbols of their language. The alphabetic blocks, shapes, and places are perceived by fresh new minds uncluttered by dirt in all the corners and free of harness or rider. They need only this small set of unbiased instructions to begin a lifetime of learning and an odyssey through the world using their mind's eye merely from reading off the page of a book. Premise 2: An instruction set is said to be orthogonal if it lacks redundancy (i.e., there is only a single instruction that can be used to accomplish a given task) and is designed such that instructions can use any register in any addressing mode. Theory: The Arabic symbol set and English symbol set (among other languages). are registers for addressing modes. Even though the sounds of each language are different, and English speech sounds are ambiguous with respect to Arabic, --both Arabic and English sound symbols address the same set of instructions identified in Adi's Abstract Symbol Tables (below). Proof:   For a complete proof, see Adi, T. (2007). A theory of semantics based on old Arabic. In R. Gudwin, & J. Queiroz (Eds.), Semiotics and intelligent systems development (pp. 176-209). Hershey, PA & London: IGI Global. This terminology (in the headers of rows and columns) results from considering an instruction as a vector whose components are the instruction fields. One field identifies the registers to be operated upon (the linear, rows), and another specifies the addressing mode (the perpendicular). An orthogonal instruction set uniquely encodes all combinations of registers and addressing modes. Initially implemented in the Intel 8080 microprocessor assembly code in 1986-87, later in 1992 Readware was translated into an ANSI-C code-base. In 1996, we added an HTTP service and API using a C++ wrapper. This Readware architecture was put into practice within several information systems products (without significant failures). The \"cognoscitive signature\" produced by Readware analysis has been extensively tested, verified and validated in real-world content management systems. No games; no cartoons; no toys. In the last decade, we have busied ourselves with publications while learning from the findings of the previous decade and experience as we go. See also: Adi, T. A framework of cognition and conceptual structures based on deep semantics. International Journal of Conceptual Structures and Smart Applications, 3(1), 1-19.Hershey, PA & London: IGI Global. (Winner of the award \"Outstanding Computer Science and Information Technology article for 2015\") Discussion: So what? The Readware Learning System Technology presents a simple, proven, viable alternative to existing AI and Deep Learning Technologies based upon complex probabilistic distributions and tuning parameters. The combination of perspective and orthogonality (as I have linked these notions here above and below) now contain the answer to every one of these research questions in Professor Tenenbaum's Long-Term Research Roadmap. Benefits: Orthogonality is a system design property. This property guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. So, don't talk to me about side effects; they are not admitted. Whatever you are thinking \"meaning\" or even \"knowledge and intelligence\" means, -- are side-effects that must be redefined in this more authentic and capable context. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and I reckon it is essential for available and compact designs of complex systems. This is how Readware is designed from the ground up, e.g., concerns about intelligence and consciousness, or even the definitions of words and language games are kept separated from the encapsulation of orthogonality within the Readware system. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., the non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them. This fact should assuage fears of an AI takeover given widely spread confusion about intelligence and consciousness, language and the meaning of words. We have reduced the number of independent fundamental concepts to three with four modal operators, so that the Readware Meta-language is easy to describe, to learn, and to implement. On the other hand, these concepts have been applied \u201corthogonally\u201d (see tables above) to maximize the expressive power of the language while trying to avoid unhealthy superfluities. Conclusion: Orthography in language allows us to spell out the objects, places, and spaces,\u2014 uniting us and rescuing that vagrant perspective. I am not referring to your gaze or your choice of words. Perspective is the ancient art of drawing solid objects on a two- dimensional surface to give or obtain a true (real) impression of their height, width, depth, and position in relation to each other when viewed from a particular point. Can you do that? Did you do that as a child? Did you draw houses and people in places and spaces? How did you learn to do that? Why? Your capacity for the width and depth of your awareness is not within the bounds of your eyesight or your earshot. Now consider the notion \"perpendicular to the linear surface\" after projecting it to n-D spaces (e.g., Abstract symbol tables above) in reverse, then, seeking non-linear relationships in the 3-D data! Isn't that what we're doing when we're reading an image, graph, map or a text? Orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results. Applied spaces that scale are nimble while classic probabilities via known distributional synergy are not. I think probabilistic programmers know, deep in their bones, that inference about the \"natural paradigm,\" not little predictive success, is impossible without knowing the applied spaces that are proven to scale!

Well, who is looking for their career for them, I will suggest one of the best training company in Bangalore. myTectra is the best artificial intelligence training company in Bangalore. They are provided with both classroom training and online training throughout the world.  What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence refers to the reproduction of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applicable chine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and solving the problem. The major characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. The Future Of Artificial Intelligence: Autonomous Transportation: We have already heard, read and seen enough about self-driving cars. With tech mammoths like Tesla, Google, Uber and more getting hands-on with self-driving cars, we have already witnessed the first step towards automated transportation. While some false, some experiments succeeded, the takeaway here is that self-driving cars are real. In future, the technology will evolve and we will see in our roads replicas from Back to the Future, where transportations like public buses, cabs, and even private vehicles will go driverless and on autopilot. With more precision, smart vehicles will take over the roads and pave way for safer, faster and economical transport systems. Robots into Risky Jobs: Nowadays, some of the most dangerous jobs are done by humans. Right from cleaning sewage to fighting fire and diffusing bombs, it\u2019s we who get down, get our hands dirty and risk our lives. The number of human lives we lose is also very huge in these processes. In the near future, we can expect machines or robots to take care of them. As artificial intelligence evolves and smarter robots roll out, we can see them replacing humans at some of the riskiest jobs in the world. That is the only time we expect automation to take away jobs. Personal Assistants: Virtual assistants are already used and some of us would have used them. Still, as technology grows, we can expect them to act as personal assistants and emote like humans. With artificial intelligence(AI), deep learning, and neural networks, it is highly possible that we can make robots emote and make them assistants. They could be used in tons of different purposes such as in the hospitality industry, daycare centres, elder care, in clerical jobs and more.

Artificial Intelligence will help a lot in removing tedious tasks for humans, leaving us more time to do jobs that need critical thinking and creativity, such as designing products or services, thinking of new brand campaigns, or dealing with human relationships Some applications of Artificial Intelligence are already sweeping many tech-based industries, like insurance and finance, health, and even customer service firms. Artificial Intelligence is powering robots that do geological surveys, calculate risks, talk to humans, record information and capture data from interactions. Those are just some of the possibilities with Artificial Intelligence. The expansion of Artificial Intelligence use may also result in the transformation of work culture, where people will be more challenged to do better than robots and be knowledgeable in robot use. In the tech world, it would certainly be more advantageous, and more lucrative, to have credentials in machine learning, especially as robots would most likely provide the best solutions to business problems. Over the past half-century, there has been intense research into the construction of intelligent machinery \u2013 the problem of creating Artificial Intelligence. This research has resulted in chess-playing computers capable of beating the best players, and humanoid able to negotiate novel environments and interact with people. Computer systems are installed at airports to sniff luggage for explosives. Military hardware is becoming increasingly reliant on research into intelligent machinery: missiles now find their targets with the aid machine vision systems. Future Possibilities: In 10\u201315 years from this might actually be true! You have special kinds of locking systems been used on your phones that involve Artificial Intelligence. Homes are getting smarter than humans, Cars can drive themselves, so its safe to expect that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way after it was idea-ted. The present world is almost run by Artificial Learning. Alexa, Siri, Cortana and the numerous number of virtual assistants make our lives much faster. Ever since The world \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 was coined in the year 1956, it has made little breakthroughs which were never appreciated based on it has seen advancements that has changed humanity a lot.

            "answer_text": "AI (Artificial intelligence) is just now finding its niche in manufacturing, as the technology matures and costs drop\u2014and as manufacturers discover applications for which AI algorithms can make complex decisions. And as it becomes ubiquitous, the future of artificial intelligence in manufacturing is already becoming feasible in emerging markets; showcasing better sensory capabilities; and, off the factory floor, predicting what will be needed and when. Improving TransportationThe transportation sector can be dangerous, with car accidents alone being responsible for a shocking 1.25 million deaths per year. Naturally, any advancements in AI that could help curb the deadly incidents taking place by the thousands each day will quickly be hailed as a success. So it should come as no surprise that there are multiple ways that companies are investing to bring the structured order of artificial intelligence to the chaotic world of transportation. he Rises of AI in New MarketsIn manufacturing, capital investments are high and profit margins are often thin. Those conditions helped to drive a lot of manufacturing to low-wage countries, where the human-resource costs have been so low that the capital investment in AI and related automation was hard to justify. But rising living standards and wages in places like India have made AI an easier sell. In fact, China is already making significant investments in AI for manufacturing and e-commerce. The Photoshop SolutionAnother way that AI could be impacting our everyday lives soon is by automatically editing your photo at the moment it is taken. The technology would be able to enhance select portions of a picture (no more picture-wide effects or corrections necessary) in less than 20 milliseconds. The blistering speed means users may be able to view the corrected image before they even snap the picture. When this technology emerges in its fully developed form, it could revolutionize the photography industry and relegate applications like Photoshop to an industry professional-specific tool overnight. AI In the Supply Chain\u2014and BeyondAI certainly is making robots more capable and easier for humans to collaborate with. But it will have an impact in areas that have nothing to do with robotics. In the supply chain, for example, algorithms can perceive patterns of demand for products across time, geographic markets, and socioeconomic segments while accounting for macroeconomic cycles, political developments, and even weather patterns. The output can be a projection of market demand, which in turn could drive raw material sourcing, human staffing, financing decisions, inventory, maintenance of equipment, and energy consumption. ",

            "answer_text": "This is going to be a long answer . . Present day AI can detect cancer cells better than doctors do, build better AI algorithms than human developers, and beat the world champions at games like chess and Go. Instances like these may lead us to believe that perhaps, there\u2019s not a whole lot that artificial intelligence can not do better than us humans. The realization of AI\u2019s superior and ever-improving capabilities in different fields has evoked both hope and caution from the global tech community as well as the general public. While many believe the rise of artificial general intelligence can massively benefit humanity by raising our standard of living and status as a civilization, some believe the development may lead to global doom. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WRONG WAY ON AI. Such things doesn't happen.  However, before worrying about the future of AI it is necessary to first know what artificial general intelligence exactly is, what it would take to achieve it, and how far existing AI capabilities are from getting there. Actually what is Artificial General Intelligence? Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) can be defined as the ability of a machine to perform any task that a human can. Artificial intelligence systems, especially artificial general intelligence systems are designed with the human brain as their reference. Since we ourselves don\u2019t have the comprehensive knowledge of our brains and its functioning, it is hard to model it and replicate it working. However, the creation of algorithms that can replicate the complex computational abilities of the human brain is theoretically possible, as suggested by the Church-Turing thesis, which states \u2014 in simple words \u2014 that given infinite time and memory, any kind of problem can be solved algorithmically. This makes sense since deep learning and other subsets of artificial intelligence are basically a function of memory, and having infinite (or a large enough amount of) memory can mean that problems of the highest possible levels of complexity can be solved using algorithms. Although it might be theoretically possible to replicate the functioning of a human brain, it is not practicable as of now. Thus, capability-wise, we are leaps and bounds away from achieving artificial general intelligence. However, time-wise, the rapid rate at which AI is developing new capabilities means that we might be get close to the inflection point when the AI research community surprises us with the development of artificial general intelligence. And experts have predicted the development of artificial intelligence to be achieved as early as by 2030. A survey of AI experts recently predicted the expected emergence of AGI or the singularity by the year 2060. Thus, although in terms of capability, we are far from achieving artificial general intelligence, the exponential advancement of AI research may possibly culminate into the invention of artificial general intelligence within our lifetime or by the end of this century. Whether the development of AGI will be beneficial for humanity or not is still up for debate and speculation. So is the exact estimate on the time it will take for the emergence of the first real-world AGI application. But one thing is for sure \u2014 the development of AGI will trigger a series of events and irreversible changes (good or bad) that will reshape the world and life as we know it, forever. Cheers!!

Some of those are small but some of them change the way we look at the field forever. The most recent such change was the introduction of Artificial Intelligence. The concept of humans creating machines that can make decisions for themselves is absolutely astounding. Don\u2019t you think so? Well, look at it this way. This is the closest mankind has reached to recreate human conscience. How amazing is that? Artificial Intelligence enables us to do everything that an ordinary human can without the need for human intervention. Whether it is mental labour or physical labour, we have successfully been able to recreate human intelligence to complete those individual tasks. With more and more companies shifting towards automation, the popularity of A.I. does not seem to be slowing down at all. Different fields of A.I. like Machine Learning or Deep Learning are hot topics for the new and upcoming generations. A.I. is the cake and everyone wants a piece of it. Yes, Artificial Intelligence is great. But we cannot ignore the other side of the coin. With the increasing number of jobs being replaced by Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, the unemployment rates are through the roof. Companies have realized that a one-time investment in A.I. and its subsidiaries is much more cost-efficient than having to repeatedly pay for manual labour. Even industries in developing countries choose to use A.I. rather than employing unskilled labour. Unskilled labour is the backbone of the gross domestic product in developing countries. If they are ignored, then the economy of that nation would crash eventually. According to recent unemployment studies, around 65 million (6.5 crores) jobs have been lost because of the advent of A.I.

            "answer_text": "In simple Language : AI is an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence. it is the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include: Speech recognition. Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as: \u2022 Knowledge \u2022 Reasoning \u2022 Problem solving \u2022 Perception \u2022 Learning \u2022 Planning \u2022 Ability to manipulate and move objects Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering. Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious approach. Technically, AIML (meaning \"Artificial Intelligence Markup Language\") is an XML dialect for use with A.L.I.C.E.-type chatterbots. IPL was the first language developed for artificial intelligence. ... Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two very hot buzzwords right now, and often seem to be used interchangeably. They are not quite the same thing, but the perception that they are can sometimes lead to some confusion. To clear this confusion, I'll be writing another blog titled \"Machine Learning\". ",

            "answer_text": "Man has always been fascinated by science-fiction, attempting to recreate some of the wildest tech imaginations. Robots, intelligent machines, advanced software, artificial intelligence, and neural networks have been the result of the fascination and today, we\u2019re at a stage where all these are becoming a reality. From just a vision to actual advancements, we\u2019ve come a long way. Today, artificial intelligence is a fascinating wing of science and technology that is slowly shaping our future. If you didn\u2019t know, advanced machines and devices with autonomous decision-making abilities have already made their way into reality. Amazon has been a pioneer in introducing automated machines and their innovations have been quite surreal. The Amazon Go store that attempts to bridge the gap between eCommerce and brick-and-mortar stores, advanced supply-chain management systems, delivery drones are all examples of their baby steps towards advanced artificial intelligence. Besides, we also have smart homes, self-driving cars, facial recognition systems and more are gradually bringing inconvenience in our lives. Besides, the onset of Big Data and Machine Learning is also complementing the evolution of artificial intelligence, allowing machines to become smarter in terms of grasping things, understanding patterns, learning trends, and coming up with better and informed solutions. Your music apps, shopping carts on online shopping websites, virtual personal assistants are examples of simple Machine Learning applications. However, we believe that the future is going to be more epic when artificial intelligence will have taken its full shape. We anticipate the future of artificial intelligence will be nothing less than the best sci-fi movies. To paint a better picture in your mind, here\u2019s the future of artificial intelligence. Autonomous Transportation: We\u2019ve already heard, read and seen enough about self-driving cars. With tech mammoths like Tesla, Google, Uber and more getting hands-on with self-driving cars, we have already witnessed the first step towards automated transportation. While some failed, some experiments succeeded, the takeaway here is that self-driving cars are real. In the future, the technology will evolve and we will see in our roads replicas from Back to the Future, where transportations like public buses, cabs, and even private vehicles will go driverless and on autopilot. With more precision, smart vehicles will take over the roads and pave way for safer, faster and economical transport systems. Robots into Risky Jobs: Today, some of the most dangerous jobs are done by humans. Right from cleaning sewage to fighting fire and diffusing bombs, it\u2019s we who get down, get our hands dirty and risk our lives. The number of human lives we lose is also very high in these processes. Shortly, we can expect machines or robots to take care of them. As artificial intelligence evolves and smarter robots roll out, we can see them replacing humans at some of the riskiest jobs in the world. That\u2019s the only time we expect automation to take away jobs. Personal Assistants: Virtual assistants are already there and some of us would\u2019ve used them. However, as technology grows, we can expect them to act as personal assistants and emote like humans. With artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural networks, it\u2019s highly possible that we can make robots emote and make them assistants. They could be used in tons of different purposes such as in the hospitality industry, daycare centers, elder care, clerical jobs and more. Climate Change and other Crucial Concerns: Data is one of the most powerful things currently. As humans, one reason we\u2019re not able to do anything about climate change is due to the lack of awareness of the current condition and its consequences. We also have limited knowledge of the impact little changes and actions in our everyday life could have on climate change. With machines, it\u2019s not the case. As IoT evolves and cities become smart with automated utility equipment, houses and more, we can significantly curtail the damage we cause every day. All these might sound far-fledged and distant but you wouldn\u2019t believe if we said that intense works on artificial intelligence have already begun and the days aren\u2019t far where we could see the prototype of super-smart robots roll out. Machines, with their access to data and precision, can make the world a better place. As you can see, all of our lives are impacted by artificial intelligence daily. Whether we are using our smartphones, surfing the internet, buying products online, using navigation, wasting time on social media or listening to songs on our favorite music streaming service, AI is impacting our choices in one way or another. AI is present in such industries as pet care. A project like Pawtocol is using AI to analyze data and find trends that result in healthier pets. You get information about these trends through unbiased product recommendations based on actual data about your pet. Pawtocol brings the world's most powerful diagnostic databases and AI to pet owners and makes informed recommendations based on knowledge of their pets. Pawtocol is your personal pet AI working in the service of you and your pet. As it gets to know your pet, it's recommendations get smarter and smarter. ",

Being able to make anything you need, at home will make the current manufacturing market economy obsolete. A service economy may replace it for a short time until these are all automated as well. We are in the middle of that transition today. The nature of work and employment will also be affected in major ways. When automation can run most things, without human intervention, the result may mean no jobs as they exist today. Gene Roddenberry\u2019s future predictions were based on this concept.

This will be a gradual transition and will result in many nuances that cannot be accurately predicted today. The transitional period will be the more dangerous as there will a pronounced difference between the winners and losers. We see the beginnings of this transition today with many disenfranchised people who have had their jobs displaced by technology. The GOP has made this their battle cry and political platform on this, fleeting as it seems to be. AI will be, I believe, the most impact-full of any technology or era to date. Hang on because it will be a very bumpy ride for the next decades to come. There is one universal truth, the only thing that never changes is every always changes. The disposition of mankind will determine the outcome, be it benevolent or catastrophic. Likely it will be neither, but rest assured it will tumultuous. ",

            "answer_text": "In our nowadays world it is a common belief that AI will replace human and take over some percent of the current jobs. Artificial Intelligence is a great tool that can do many tasks at the same time. It has a great knowledge but those mostly come from human. However in the future AI will be able to do things that we are not able to succeed in or can hardly do. Artificial Intelligence will probably be able to proceed tasks very precisely and get things done perfectly -even these days robots are already doing jobs that are dangerous-. In this case, the risk of human-made mistakes will decrease and also people getting injured will be more evitable.We live in a technology-centred world and has an important role in our everyday life however it was a human work that made it so advanced, everything it knows, we are responsible for it. Due to this fact, we have to be the ones that takes over control it and not the opposite way around.I am convinced that in a few decades it will surpass the level of human intelligence, AI will be essential in automating certain industries. However, I believe it should not be something human have to be afraid of because it will generate new positions because it still must be controlled and checked at some point.AI will make it possible for corporations to devote more time on tasks that are vital and significant rather than working on time-consuming topics.There are many interesting facts about AI that are worth knowing and going through for those that have not yet realised the importance of AI or would like to know more than they do now.

The future of artificial intelligence, or the main goal focused on, is artificial general intelligence; a self-teaching system that outgrows humans in so many different ways. As much as AI is helping to make life easier for people, it\u2019s future will make it a little bit harder since bit by bit it will take the jobs away from people and thus will increase the unemployment rate. In addition to unemployment, AI will lead to increasing the need for specific skills and thus will open the space for wealth inequality. The problem is that imagining a world with robots taking over all human tasks is considered disastrous because even scientists believe that it will lead to unwanted results; even Bill Gates warned about AIs destroying the planet while they are pursuing their goals. Creativity is definitely needed when it comes to the skills that the future asks for; no matter how far robots can reach or how many tasks a machine could perform, human creativity could never be replaced.

All types of image fecognition and voice recognition is based on machine learning, which is AI. Digital assistants will soon evolve into factfinding conversationalists who can even do stuff for you, like ordering food or a taxi. Cars will drive autonomously soon, and I would imagine that a humanoid robot for those cars will soon be announced, so that you can tell your car to fetch you something back at your house, without having to go with it. Humanoid, human sized robots, are not that far in the future. Then there is deep learning, which is a way to go through large quantities of data to find new knowledge. Imagine if one person could read all papers ever written on a certain disease and still keep track of the results. That is the future of research. Did you know that airplanes has had an autonomous landing mode, in case something happens to the pilot, for years? I believe an artificial brain, indistinguishable from a humans, can be build within the next 20 tears; something I like to work on in my spare time. Spam filters, catching hackers, identifying thieves before they steal, all kinds of pattern recognition. The possibilities are infinite. ",

A lot has changed between when this question was first answered and now; what I see is a transition a little outside what was first laid out to us in the form of science fiction. Some people fear AI as a technology set to destroy jobs, but that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. What AI actually eliminates, or at least what we\u2019re witnessing today, is redundancy. It\u2019s what makes it augmentative. What this does is actually free people from mechanical tasks that require little to no brain power, allowing them to actually focus on growth and strategy. Analysts, AI developers, and more - we see a significant uptick in jobs as well. And haven\u2019t we always been this way when we look at things from a broad perspective? We\u2019re constantly evolving, becoming better - emails replaced letters, and messengers are now ready to replace emails, for example. People will always need to up-skill to stay relevant, and AI offers them that opportunity - both for the people and the organizations implementing solutions around the technology. It\u2019s all about how you use it. When you talk about the future, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to from a business perspective. From data to machine learning and AI, there\u2019s a lot of growth to look forward.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not wondering why everyone\u2019s talking about the benefits of AI, most of us are astonished by the different ways that AI helps us in our daily life. Be it as simple as asking Siri to schedule an upcoming meeting or as intense as carrying out an automated robotic surgery with minimal/zero risk. But did you know that the same machine that aids mankind for the good is being used in equal or even more ways for harmful & dangerous activities? I believe there\u2019re many answers here that support the benefits of AI, so do I. But It is also important to know its dangers so that we can prepare for the future outcomes and utilize AI for good. Here are some dangers of AI that we should be worried about right now. Deepfakes: Deepfakes is considered one of the famous dangers of AI where technology is used for altering digital content to defame a targeted person usually a celebrity. A Deepfake AI application uses two components, namely a \u201cGenerator\u201d and a \u201cDiscriminator\u201d. The generator creates the fake video clip while the discriminator identifies whether the clip is original or fake. As the discriminator identifies the clip as a fake one, the generator \u201clearns\u201d where to improve for the next time. This system is called a \u201cGenerative Adversarial Network\u201d or \u201cGAN\u201d. In this system, not only the generator learns, but the discriminator to improves its algorithm to identify fake videos better every iteration. The risk of people believing in Deepfakes will persist until there is regulation upon such content. An example of a heated controversy is a video showing Donald Trump taunting Belgium regarding the Paris climate agreement. This calls to the governments to take measures to prevent deepfakes from being dangerous. Human-like Dos attacks: A denial of service attack is a cyber-attack where a cybercriminal prevents users from using a particular website/service/ application. It sends requests in large volumes which slows down the system. These attacks are usually sent from a single source. On the other hand, a distributed denial-of-service attack is sent from multiple sources that are coordinated. Cybercriminals infect computers connected to the internet with malware first which helps them form a botnet subsequently using it to launch a DDoS attack on a targeted system. Human-like DoS attacks use AI systems to launch attacks in which supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms play a vital role. Deploying cybersecurity systems with ML unsupervised algorithms might build an effective wall against these human-like DoS attacks. Spear phishing attacks: These are the most popular types of attacks by cybercriminals which persuade people to share sensitive information. They are usually combined with other social engineering attacks like site cloning which makes them look trustworthy. Emails, phone calls, SMS, etc. are the modes through which phishing attacks are carried out. It all starts from when a recipient clicks on a link sent by the hacker as it spreads malware. A spear-phishing attack is when an attacker focuses on a single target and sends a custom email/message. AI is being used to power these spear-phishing attacks and send personalised emails to a large number of people. Implementing Artificial Neural Networks would detect these automated spear-phishing attacks and make cybercriminals abandon their attacks. Swarm attacks: Swarm attacks are emerging to be one of the recent trends of cybersecurity threats. Cybercriminals enable swarm-based bots to collaborate and operate autonomously to pose attacks on a target. For example, Fortinet describes that in the context of swarm attacks, \u201cHivenets\u201d replace botnets, and are compromised devices using AI that helps target vulnerable systems. To prevent swarm attacks, there needs to be consistent cybersecurity across the ecosystem with automated cybersecurity to match the swarm intelligence. AI-powered drones and vehicles by terrorists: With an increased number of terrorist groups and activity in the world, the equipment that these groups use to spread terror is also undergoing continuous sophistication. Easy access to artificial intelligence makes the situation more complicated. Many technologies like UAVs, facial recognition and machine-to-machine communication are available to everyone. The thought that armed UAVs replacing suicide bombers for terrorist groups tells us how far can the risks of AI go when in hands of terrorist groups. Controlling this is only possible through regulation and framing anti-terrorism laws. Read Other 7 Dangers of AI: All the Dangers of AI everyone should know about. ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of asking what is the future of artificial intelligence, you should be asking how will it change the future. It has the highest scope in the future as with any technology. Everyone has heard of Siri and Tesla. They were the game changers in their respective fields only because they were the first ones to employ artificial intelligence. The world is transforming at a great pace. We are in the mid of 2018 and artificial intelligence has become a common name. Soon it will take over the world (it has been taken over partially, already). It has got some amazing pros like we use artificial intelligence in most of the cases as this helps us in reducing the risk. Also, it increases the chance of reaching accuracy with the greater degree of precision. In addition to that, the future prospects of AI are more interesting: Soon all cars running on the road will be driver-less. That means they will be controlled by AI.All devices ranging from smartphones to laptops will be supported by AI. That means you don\u2019t have to do any work. Just say it and the AI will do it on its own. Doesn\u2019t it sound jaw dropping.However, speaking of that AI still comes with some cons which pose a problem that questions its reliability to stand in future prospects like it involves a huge cost. Its creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines. Also, repair and maintenance require huge costs. Also, it has some risks associated with it which needs to taken into account. As intelligence is believed to be a gift of nature. Also, an ethical argument will continue whether the human intelligence is to be replicated or not. Everything comes with a cost. It\u2019s the humans who have to judge whether the AI will be useful for them or not. But surely we have entered the 22nd century quite early. ",

It has gone leaps and bounds from the advancements that we now know, as it is essentially a concept wherein a non-human has a mind of its own. In the 1990\u2019s, it has been foreseen that by the year 2000, the world as we know it will dramatically change. The best depiction of it could be how it is laid out in the Jetsons cartoon show, where humans are seen clad in spacesuits floating through the air in flying vehicles and are assisted by talking robots. It is now 2017, and life has pretty much been the same, save for digital technology. But artificial intelligence continues to be a hot topic, and in fact, some companies have worked to further advance this futuristic concept. Dennis Mortensen has developed x[.]ai, a tool that assists in scheduling meetings and all the logistics that come with it. But the difference is that \u201cAmy Ingram\u201d has been more humanised, and now gets to be more interactive with a user. It is not simply a yes and no for the tool, but it also possesses some level of judgment that it uses to complete tasks. This is only the beginning of advancements for artificial intelligence, and it can be expected to move further in the near future. http://www.businesssystemsexplored.com/bse009/ ",

            "answer_text": "All normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and any differences in intelligence are related to \"quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions''. Speed, short term memory and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories. That's with humans. In AI the situation is the reverse.  Computer programs have plenty of speed and memory but their abilities correspond to the intellectual mechanisms that program designers understand well enough to put in programs. Some abilities that children normally don't develop until they are teenagers may be in and some abilities possessed by two year olds are still out. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are. Very likely the organisation of the intellectual mechanisms for AI can usefully be different from that in people. Whenever people do better than computers on some task or computers use a lot of computation to do as well as people, this demonstrates that the program designers lack understanding of the intellectual mechanisms required to do the task efficiently. To answer your question, 10 years from now we begin to understand and emulate the algorithms behind the intellectual mechanism from humans to machines.  20 years from now we, humans are still perfecting the \"emotional algorithms\" for AI 2050. 35 years from now, machines are us and we are machines.

Just as the advent electricity revolutionized our lives and industries similarly the emergence of AI is certain to bring forth the fourth industrial revolution that is going to change our lives drastically. On the contrary to common belief that lots of jobs will be lost to AI, a study by Forrester Research estimates that approximately 15 million new jobs will be created in the United States alone over the next 10 years as a direct result of AI and automation. Yes some jobs such as those that take less than five seconds of thinking will be lost to automation but hey there are a lot more new opportunities and we could always learn a new skill. Furthermore, there are a lot more jobs that is tough for even AI to replace.

Well, those may not be \u2018fiction\u2019 for long. Artificial Intelligence is the future and as crazy as it may sound, the future could no longer be in our hands \u2013 it might be in our machine\u2019s hands! Our brains are focussed on developing AI which is taking over faster than we can imagine. Future of Artificial Intelligence A lot of visionaries like Stephen Hawking, Steve Wozniak, Elon Musk and others have predicted that AI could be dangerous because if machines started thinking better than humans, then where would humans be? Scared? We have the power to diffuse what we have created. What we need to know is where to draw the line. It\u2019s overwhelming and exciting \u2013 but definitely not scary. In this article, we will discuss some compelling opportunities in the field of AI that were unthinkable in the past. Mr. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google once said that everything in Google is going to be AI centered which could mean that AI will create numerous job opportunities that will require creativity, critical thinking skills and much more. What is AI? AI includes machine learning as well as deep learning. There has been significant progress in both fields. On one hand, machine learning algorithms are helping businesses evolve, and on the other, speech recognition, image processing techniques and fingerprint patterns are taking the world by storm. We use gadgets that are intelligent and makes our everyday tasks easy. For example, Alexa can remind you about your daily appointments, keep a check on your grocery list, play your favorite music when you need, read news and even play some brain games! It is like a human companion \u2013 that is not human \u2013 but has human-like capabilities. There are restaurants where robots serve food to humans \u2013 how do they take orders? How do they walk and turn and serve food to the right customer? There are self-driving cars. How does the car know about red signals, traffic, when to move slow or fast and so on? More serious business scenarios include spam filtering, product suggestions and personalization of feeds, dynamic pricing (for example during online ticket booking), optimization (for example, getting the best route for a destination), emotion analysis and much more. To do all these needs a lot of processing behind the scenes \u2013 a lot of data is analyzed, reports are produced, new business scenarios are created and ideas just have to keep evolving. Learn more about AI from these tutorials. What\u2019s the fuss about data science and AI? For Artificial Intelligence to work, \u2018data\u2019 is the key. Every single piece of data generated from the user has to be carefully examined to recognize behavioral patterns, likes, dislikes, trends and so on. When we interact with another person X or Y, the memories of X or Y remain in our brain \u2013 we remember their appearance, their voice, their expressions, their likes and much more. How does a machine do that? Data And that\u2019s what Data Science is all about. Learn more about how AI and data science go hand in hand here. What the future beholds To understand what the future of Artificial Intelligence is, we need to know the current enhancements and state of AI as of today! The human brain is complex and different people think in different ways. There are \u2013 Learners \u2013 we are not born with the capability to make choices. We learn by experience \u2013 what to eat, what to wear, how to react in different situations. To be able to evolve and think that way, a machine should be able to learn, evolve and improve itself \u2013 just like humans.Reasoners \u2013 Reasoning and logic are what makes each human different and the human brain complex. Sometimes, the reasoning is simple and follows a traditional approach, but for some things, generalizations don\u2019t work. Reasoning can be based on experiences, facts, and rules. Machines need to know all of it to be able to reason well.Visionaries \u2013 combining the power of learning and reasoning, visionaries are able to give the power to a machine to be able to think and perceive, to make decisions and predict.Linguists \u2013 for a machine to interact with humans, it should be able to talk just like human beings do. Speech recognition software processes audios into text. Significant progress in speech recognition has been a big step towards the victory of AI.AI system that can be compared with human intelligence should have all the 4 aspects combined into one. As humans, we learn faster, process things faster even with less data, however machines need loads of data to infer anything useful. This could change in the future, though. Let us look at each of the subfields of Artificial Intelligence, their current state and what can be expected in the future from each. ",

What is good for the Chinese, may be less good for the USA or Russia etc. It is not clear also whether humans will still exist in say 1000 more years. Perhaps we have all given up our biological form, maybe even by force. Or perhaps only the richest people can afford to remain in that form (if we still have money by then). Anyway, the future of AI is AGI and next ASI. If some of us remain in biological form, we will also use genetic manipulation, to be less viable for diseases and to increase human intelligence. So the baseline for AGI will shift upwards. We can view ASI as a new (shared?) cortex, sitting \u201con top of\u201d this enhanced biological intelligence, although physical location is less important. Let\u2019s call it the techno-cortex.

Asian AI will be different from Western AI because East and West have different world views. All cultures have their roots in animism. In the ancient past, everything (and non-thing) was believed to be permeated by spirits. In European culture, we saw a split between spirit and matter, which partly explains why Europe developed natural science. China emerged from animism without separating spirit and matter. They instead identified Tao, the \"mysterious power\" that moves the universe. Literally everything and non-thing partakes in Tao. Taoism is a sophisticated form of animism. The reconciliation of spirit and matter became one of the guiding principles in Chinese culture (as it did in Japan). The Chinese, like the Japanese, have no fear of robots with embedded AI, because robots too parttake in Tao. One of the themes of the 21st century will be the reconciliation of spirit and matter - and all other opposites humans conceive in reality.
