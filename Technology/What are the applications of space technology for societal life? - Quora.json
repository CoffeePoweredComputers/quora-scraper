            "answer_text": "Just imagine, when we are not having any space technology, what could be the effect on Earth? Without space technology, we would be congested only to normal life. Here are some benefits of space exploration and its technology for the sake of Earth: Navigation system: Satellite plays a major role in navigating the geographical distribution and thus it is only because we are able to travel far away within an hour or more.Understanding of Space and celestial bodies: Being curious creature on Earth, humans always wonders about the formation of the universe and life. With gradual advancement in space technology, it has made possible for humans to increase their knowledge in the great domain including different solar planets, black holes and beyond.International relations: Today, it plays a crucial role to establish relationships among different countries as it is believed that space technology mandates wide knowledge and expenses. For instance, a joint mission of India with France called SARAL.Weather forecasting: It\u2019s because of the satellite, we are able to forecast weather and be prepared for upcoming disasters.Medical research: With this technology, we can conduct an experiment on the biology of life in outer space which helps to get deeper knowledge and understanding of its. How the osteology varied from Earth to space and gene transcription, are some fields of research which provide a better understanding of biology.Improvement in Air-breathing flight: It\u2019s because of Ramjet engine, we can see some supersonic planes today.Space-based economy: Economical status of the company is improved by launching payloads of different countries.There are more than benefits on Earth due to space technology. If it is misused, I can\u2019t say it will benefit us. But it is obvious that the proper use of sources can benefit more than we expect from current and upcoming space technology. ",

            "answer_text": "The application of science and engineering to the exploration and utilization of outer space is known as space technology. Space technology is technology that is related to entering, and retrieving objects or life forms from space. \"Every day\" technologies such as weather forecasting, remote sensing, GPS systems, satellite television, and some long distance communications systems critically rely on space infrastructure. Of sciences, astronomy and Earth sciences most notably benefit from space technology. Computers and telemetry were once leading edge technologies that might have been considered \"space technology\" because of their criticality to boosters and spacecraft. They existed prior to the Space Race of the Cold War but their development was vastly accelerated to meet the needs of the two major superpowers' space programs. While still used today in spacecraft and missiles, the more prosaic applications such as remote monitoring of patients, water plants, highway conditions, etc. and the widespread use of computers far surpasses their space applications in quantity and variety of application. Space is such an alien environment that attempting to work in it requires new techniques and knowledge. New technologies originating with or accelerated by space-related endeavors are often subsequently exploited in other economic activities. This has been widely pointed to as beneficial by space advocates and enthusiasts favoring the investment of public funds in space activities and programs. Political opponents counter that it would be far cheaper to develop specific technologies directly if they are beneficial and scoff at this justification for public expenditures on space-related research.
