            "answer_text": "No, unlike in many countries, everyone still has a PC at home or access to a PC at work plus with wifi at home, work and in many other places, so we essentially have 5G speed almost everywhere - having it on mobile is nice but not a game changer since the people not using a PC as a base are not really looking to download a lot of stuff other than immediate consumption (streaming music not even pirating tracks), watching youtube \u2026 so you might have some more torrent of movies but there won\u2019t be a massive uptick as I cant imagine a whole lot of non-torrenters suddenly jumping on that bandwagon. I suppose you could get a few more online games since it\u2019ll be less laggy but hardcore gamers probably are not going to trust it so overall, nice upgrade but in the US, not a game changer. ",

            "answer_text": "In the short term the 5G marketing is mostly hype. The real value\\performance increase of 5G will be years down the road. In order to deliver on the promise of 5G performance requires cell tower densities be increased by at least a factor of 4x and in some areas as high as 10x the number of cell phone towers currently deployed. How long that will take is anywhere from 5 to 10 years before that number of tower can be deployed on a national basis. Downtown \\ high density areas will be upgraded first over the next 2 to 4 years. ",
