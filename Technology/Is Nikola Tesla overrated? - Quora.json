            "answer_text": "I saw many questions on Quora about Tesla being over-rated or under-rated, and I wanted to give the topic a reference point and some context, to make it slightly less subjective. So I thought I would do a comparison of some famous geeks here on Quora, and see how many followers they have. The topic Nikola Tesla has over 48,000 followers on Quora. Let's see how that compares to other equally important technology visionaries... The topic George Westinghouse has 41 followers on Quora. Many internet stories describe the great science and technology feud known as the War of Currents as a battle battle between famous geeks Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. The internet hype and mythology over the alleged wonders of Tesla overshadow the true champion in the War of Currents was George Westinghouse. Here's what Nikola Tesla said, \"George Westinghouse was, in my opinion, the only man on this globe who could take my alternating-current system under the circumstances then existing and win the battle against prejudice and money power. He was one of the world's true noblemen, of whom America may well be proud and to whom humanity owes an immense debt of gratitude.\" When Tesla was a forgotten man living in New York hotels in the final years of his life, it was Westinghouse that was picking up the tab for his room and board. Tesla and Westinghouse made a good team. Tesla had the visions, he could see the problems and solve them in his head. Westinghouse was a systems thinker. He collected various patents, the ones he purchased from European Inventors Gaulard and Gibbs, and then the patents he purchased from Tesla, to build a system to distribute AC power. The success of Tesla and Westinghouse working together also illustrates the reason for many of Tesla's future failures. In the PBS documentary \"Tesla Master of Lightning\" Tesla's grand-nephew William Terbo explains the downfall of Nikola Tesla. \"He was totally disinterested in business. He did not make the relationship between the importance of business and the importance of his invention and discovery.\" More on Westinghouse: https://www.quora.com/Given-that-Westinghouse-won-the-war-of-currents-against-Edison-why-has-the-Westinghouse-company-disappeared-while-General-Electric-is-still-thriving-What-did-Westinghouse-company-do-wrong Where is the topic J.C.R. Licklider , Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, on Quora? I could not find a specific topic on Licklider. In 1960 Licklider published the paper \u201cMan-Computer Symbiosis,\u201d in which he describe the concept he called the \"Galactic Network.\" His work was the inspiration for decades of computer research to follow. He provided the visionary outline for what would be the ARPANET, the parent of the modern internet. The topic Douglas Engelbart has 143 followers on Quora. Speaking of the ARPANET, when it went live in 1969 there were two hosts, one of them was managed by Douglas Engelbart and his team at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). In 1968, before Xerox PARC, before Microsoft or Apple, Douglas Engelbart gave a 90-minute presentation introducing the world to the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking. I could easily add a dozen more names to this list, of great visionaries that no one knows. Asking whether Tesla was over-rated or under-rated is very subjective. Draw your own conclusions. But don't you think some of these numbers make a point? Some of the greatest geeks of technology are a lot less known than Tesla! The number of followers quoted here is based on the day I am writing this answer. God willing, if I am still here to edit this question in a few years, and Quora is still around as well, it will be interesting to come back and revisit these numbers.  Answered December 12, 2015 | Updated - August 31, 2017: I created the topic J.C.R. Licklider on Quora. Pretty sad, the man who was the visionary for the modern internet did not even have his own topic on Quora. Computer visionary Douglas Engelbart now has 150 Followers George Westinghouse, the man who made Tesla famous now has 52 Followers Nikola Tesla is up to 129.7k Followers and 1.4k Questions . (\u2026 and I can speak from personal experience many of those questions ask the same things over and over.) Since I first answered this question the number of Tesla followers has more than doubled, while equally great geeks hardly gather a following. So how can you not say that Tesla is overrated when so many people praise him here on Quora, while there are so many great geeks that never get mentioned? ",

            "answer_text": "1)Inventor Nikola Tesla contributed to the development of the alternating-current \"electrical system\"( Alternating current was developed in principle by Michael Faraday )that's widely used today and discovered the rotating magnetic field (the basis of most AC machinery).    2)Tesla\u2019s vision  is wireless transmission  of power .imagine a world  without current poles ,wireless charging ,no plugs ,no wires to you tv and laptop now ofcorse which he is didnt succeed but there is possibility with current tech (Page on wsj.com  3)Tesla Invented Radio, Not Marconi:http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/tesla-invented-radio-not-marconi   Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association.  In 1897 Tesla applied for two patents  US 649621 and US 645576. In 1904, however, The U.S. Patent Office reversed its decision, awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio, possibly influenced by Marconi\u2019s financial backers in the States, who included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie.    3)Edison didn\u2019t invent the lightbulb, he improved upon the ideas of 22 other men who pioneered the light bulb before him. Edison simply figured out how to sell the light bulb(Nikola Tesla Wasn't God And Thomas Edison Wasn't The Devil) 4) laser,x-ray 5)n 19s, when working on creating trans-Atlantic radio, Tesla proposed what now sounds like a modern-day cellphone to his funder, J.P. Morgan[\"jp morgan a banker is close to Edison who d* tesla later :(   ]. The idea was to create a plan for a \"World Telegraphy System\" that allows instant communication of news to individual handheld devices. 6)Tesla dream to turn  Niagara Falls, a large river flows over a cliff  into electricity  generator when he was a kid ch he succeeded later  so please open your eyes edison is a business man not a great inventor like tesla .he tortured animals with current (.Thomas Alva Edison Unmasked At Last!!)....(Thomas Alva Edison Unmasked At Last!!)       anything more ???
