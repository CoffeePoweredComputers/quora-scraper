            "answer_text": "Still developing. But pace is picking up faster in some places slower in others. To be a truly developed country like Australia, UK , America etc, Indonesian government needs to provide the same facilities for rural areas, as well as just big cities. Just because someone lives in a country place, they should still be given access to wifi, electricity, and fair prices for lifes essentials. That not the case for Provinces, and rural area in Indonesia. In a truly developed country like Australia, even if someone lives on a farm in the outback, the government will provide Internet access so that people there have same opportunity to get get information. Even in remote areas the government will provide satellite internet and charge the same price (subsidise). Theres many people living in remote Islands or distant place, that struggling even to have electricity, access to medical help, pay fair prices for food..and not allow monopolies to control everything. Indonesia is advancing towards being developed. But they will only become truly developed when ALL people are treated fairly and helped and given the same facilities and infrastructure, and not discriminated because of where they are born and raised. Obviously there some difficulty because Indonesia is an Island Nation, spread out over vast distance..It easy for Govt in Jakarta to forget about people living far away. The other problem is the complexity of government layers. Too many levels of Government, too much bureacracy, too many hands stealing money that has been allocated for infrastructure. They need to simplify the process of ensuring money allocated to infrastructure projects gets spent on those projects. Indonesia does a few things really well at federal level..eg education. Theres standardised schooling system across whole. Also National highways are generally maintained ok. Kepp going Indonesia..you can do it. My thoughts\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Well regarding HDI, Indonesia is developed, with a high HDI of 708,1 / 70,81. But it\u2019s still developing, GDP per capita PPP is medium at 13 120$. And there are disparities between provinces, some provinces enjoy good life standard with high gdp per capita above 30 000$ such as Riau, Jakarta, Riau island, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan\u2026 and some provinces, especially in eastern Indonesia, have a low gdp per capita at around 6 000$ Such as Nusa Tenggara barat , because they have been neglected by te government for many year. But recently the government has been serious on developing those regions and improvements are underway. New ports, tourism destinations, facilities, infrastructure are being constructed. They are also extending the existing fiber optic network in those regions so they can enjoy fast internet. Regarding poverty, Indonesia has made a lot of improvements, with a poverty rate of 9%. This is due to the numerous social welfare programs. ",
