            "answer_text": "No, not at all. 3G and 4G are the foundation for 5G connectivity, that is to say that 5G requires 3G and 4G for long distance connections. 5G at high speed only works at very short ranges, sometimes only as far as one block, so once you move further away or if you are in a moving vehicle the phone has to switch instantly to 4G or 3G to be able t maintain the connection. 5G will not be widespread for many years. In the US I would be surprised if 5G coverage will be completed before 2025. It will take phone manufacturers years before they upgrade all model of phones at all price points to 5G so don't worry, it will be many years before 5G becomes a must-have service. ",

In terms of internet speed, there is a considerable bump however to really use the power of 5G your Network provider should have the ability to provide it to you. And as you know when technology is new it is always costly. It is good to know that you have a future proof smartphone but it will take some time for the 5G tech to reach everywhere. I would suggest waiting until all the network providers have the tech to give you 5G speed and moreover smartphone companies also do not provide updates after 2\u20133 years. So the best option is to wait until everything is settled as the smartphones having 5G capability will be expensive. A good example here is Samsung Galaxy S10+ and S10+ 5G. ",

Since India does not have the infrastructure ready for the 5G network, it will be worthless to buy a 5G phone this year. Another reason to not buy 5G phones is that in the coming few years 5G phones are going to be cheaper as the technology matures further. So it's better to hold your horses for now and be content with a 4G LTE device. Follow this space for 5G phones and 5G network related information. Thanks,Shikhar ",

As technology is rapidly increasing then one should opt for the latest one to avoid regretting the decision in future, especially for smartphones since most of us buy smartphone for using it for 1 to 3 years. 5g phones also comes with better reception of network then a 4g phone so it will increase the call and network quality of currently present 4g network aswell. A 5g phone will also add some value when you decide to sell it to buy a new one. ",

And future 5G phones will be less expensive than current 5G phones.
