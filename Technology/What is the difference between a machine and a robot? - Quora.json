Robot- An intelligent machine. It can do more than what a machine can do as it can be programmed to perform many different tasks. A robot may have situational awareness to certain degree depending upon its type. Based on the nature of work and many other factors, companies decide to use machines and/ or robots to automate their tasks, increase their productivity and reduce the cost. Have you purchased items online, especially from Amazon and wondered how they are able to deliver it to different part of the world in a short time? Take a look at this video:   Example using a scenario To move an object from point A to point B in a factory, using a machine (fork lift), the operator has to control & operate the vehicle to life the object, drive around avoiding obstacles and deliver it to point B. On the hand, when using a autonomous indoor vehicle with robotic arm, we just have to tell the robot which item to pick, coordinates or locations of pickup and delivery points. The program in the robot will do all the computation, find the item, pick it up, plans the navigation route, avoids the obstacle in the course and delivers it at point B.

ROBOTS It is a machine that acts independently of external controls.It is a machine built to carry out some complex task or group of tasks, especially one which can be programmed.It can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.It may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.Ex: humanoids, UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) drones, etc.MACHINES It is a physical tool which is controlled by users or external automation.It is a mechanical or electrical device that performs or assists in the performance of human tasks, whether physical or computational, laborious or for entertainmentIt can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power,It has to be supervised or controlled by others.Ex: vehicles, appliances, etc.Source: Machine - Wikipedia Robot - Wikipedia Robots vs Machines: The Difference Explained https://wikidiff.com/machine/robot ",
