            "answer_text": "Technological advancement has nowadays become the norm for our daily lives and activities. Processes are now getting more efficient, precise and seamless with constant improvements in technology. If an individual or business does not constantly strive to innovate or adapt to technological advancement, it is bound to fail sooner or later. Technological advancement is occurring in all industries and sectors across the globe and there is no denying it. Although all technologies are constantly advancing, there are, however only a handful of them that have a very promising future. Among them is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence is a tool that empowers people to rethink how to integrate information, scrutinize data, and effectively use the resulting insights to improve decision making. It involves the concept of machine learning which is the study of algorithms and previous stats to execute specific tasks without manual instructions and directives. Artificial Intelligence or AI has a wide range of applications and some of them are listed below: HealthcareScientists and engineers are developing machine learning systems that would diagnose diseases faster than humans. The system stores patient data and other information sources to form a hypothesis, which is presented with a hypothesized conclusion. AI is used to integrate human intelligence into advanced computers that could assist both, the doctor and the patients. BusinessAI is applied in businesses where there are a significant amount of repetitive tasks involved, usually performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to reveal information on how to improve customer service. Chatbots have also been incorporated into websites and applications to provide immediate service to customers. FinTechAI in the FinTech industry is used to save time and resources by using various algorithms to generate reports, improve customer service, and predict the company\u2019s sales performance. Another important use of AI in the FinTech industry is the digital identity verification of customers and anti-money laundering screening, as part of global KYC and AML regulations. Artificial Intelligence is also used in Blockchain technology. Autonomous vehiclesSelf-driving cars, like humans, need to have sensors to interpret the environment around them and a brain to gather, process and choose specific actions based on the information assembled and a body to carry out those actions effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with high-tech tools and computers to fetch information, including long-range radar, cameras, and LIDAR. Autonomous cars have proven to show a reduction in the number of road accidents due to lesser chances of machine errors as compared to humans. Cyborg TechnologyOne of the main limitations of humans is their bodies and brain. At the current pace of technological advancement, we might be able to someday surpass this limitation as well. We could use advanced technology to augment ourselves with supercomputers and enhance our skills and natural abilities for convenience as well as practicality. ",

            "answer_text": "What technology is most likely to advance our society? Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). To be more precise CCS will enable our society to advance, because in the absence of its timely development and implementation there will be no society to advance. Sadly there is no political will to move ahead on this issue, so it\u2019s conceivable that the gloom and doom merchants may have it right this time. ",
