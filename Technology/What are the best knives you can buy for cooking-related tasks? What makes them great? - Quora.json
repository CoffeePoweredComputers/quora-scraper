            "answer_text": "Selecting a knife that\u2019s best for you depends on a variety of factors: ease of sharpening, ease of maintenance, value for money spent, toughness/resistance to abuse, comfort, edge retention, sharpness out of the box, edge geometry, blade profile, length, point of balance, overall weight, aesthetics, etc. Choosing a knife is a very personal process. When the knife is to be used strictly the way it is intended (ie. No prying open cans, chopping frozen food, or cutting lobster shells with a chef knife), it is almost universally agreed that Japanese knives are the best. Why? Jknives tend to be harder and lighter than western knives, meaning more edge retention and less user fatigue. Japanese smiths tend to be very involved and discerning in the crafting process so they heat treat the blades to perfection consistently and implement thoughtful knife design (ex. Relieved spines and choils, keen attention to point of balance, attention to appearance, attention to grind and cutting performance). They understand the intended use of the knife affects the way that even the edge should be ground, not just an overall length and knife shape. Many even choose steels and a hardness range based on the intended use of the knife. The devil is in the details, and Japanese smiths know that. A factory-made knife can be cheaper but doesn\u2019t compare, nor does a factory line deliver consistent quality. There is a lingering presumption that Japanese knives are all extremely expensive but, as we will see, this is not the case. A handmade Japanese knife will often outperform even a western custom knife twice as expensive. However, this is just a general rule and you must know the reasoning behind the rule. A point of balance leaning toward the blade end allows the knife blade\u2019s own weight to do some work for you. Hard steel is more brittle but tends to hold an edge better. A thin edge grind is not intended to be abused but can move through ingredients like nothing is there since it eliminates friction. A shape and grind and overall design should enable the user to easily sharpen their own knife. A convex edge shape allows ingredients to easily release from the blade instead of sticking. There are countless others, which you will discover as you learn about knives and use more kinds of knives. If you just want something cheap that cuts and stands up to abuse, a $40 Victorinox or a $25 Mercer might be the best choice. But it\u2019s not going to be as precise and won\u2019t have the cutting ability and retention of a very thin Takamura R-2, which might hold its edge for literally weeks of heavy use at a time but require you to not slam it into a dishwasher. That\u2019s not to say budget knives don\u2019t have their uses, but if you\u2019re looking for a perfectly balanced, handmade, precise, thoughtfully-designed cutting tool, you get what you pay for. If you know your knives, you can spot a bargain, but you still won\u2019t be getting any honyaki sushi knives for $40. The problems with today\u2019s knife users is a tendency to do no research, have unrealistic expectations, and not care for their tools. It\u2019s a \u201cdisposable lazy convenience\u201d attitude that is fundamentally incompatible with what a good knife is: a tool that can carry you through the rest of your life if you take care of it, respect it, and get to know it. No knife will be sharp forever but people are constantly replacing perfectly good blades and refusing to learn sharpening. People abuse their knives. People keep thinking out-of-the-box sharpness actually matters when it\u2019s sharpening skills that should, etc. The knife will take care of you if you take care of it, but this assumes that you actually uphold your end of the bargain. If you don\u2019t, you will never find a knife you think is \u201cgood\u201d because it simply will never exist. It\u2019s unreasonable. This may sound counter-intuitive but advertising a knife\u2019s sharpness is usually inherently misleading. Even a crap steel can attain a sharp edge with enough sharpening effort. The true test of good knife steel is how easy it is to sharpen, how easily it attains a scary edge, how long it holds the edge, and how the steel behaves through repeated sharpening. It\u2019s the test of time that actually matters, not out-of-the-box sharpness. I say spending less than half a year with a knife and never having sharpened it makes a review of that knife completely pointless. Japanese smiths know this and often intentionally pack their knives at a middling 4/10 or 5/10 sharpness. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t know how to sharpen, they expect you to put the finishing touch on the knife, to customize the edge to your need. The duller knife is also less prone to damage during transit. As long as the knife arrives with an okay edge that doesn\u2019t require like 30 minutes of hard work to make usable, it should be acceptable. But they give the western knife audiences too much credit. Nobody knows how to sharpen even though you literally only need to spend like 10 minutes over the stones with your new knife to have an absolute beast of a kitchen weapon. Instead, westerners will complain that the knife is dull, rusts in the dishwasher, etc. and send it back. It\u2019s ignorant. Cutting ability is also not the same thing as sharpness. Sharpness refers only to the keenness of the very apex of the blade edge. But so much more comes into play when seeing how a knife cuts. Cutting ability considers a myriad of factors such as the combination of sharpness, blade tapering, knife thickness, grind, the density of the item being cut, the edge geometry of the knife, sometimes even the polish of the knife\u2019s blade face and edge, and more. Try cutting an apple with an axe to see what I mean. You can sharpen an axe until it shaves hair but it is still going to be a lousy vegetable cutter. All that stuff being said, I\u2019ll go through some knives that I believe are of great value for their high performance. Masutani VG-1/VG-10 - This company saves money by using laser-cut steel on pre-laminated steel billets. However, their knives are surprisingly good cutters priced around or below $70. The heat treatment on these is excellent\u2026no chippy VG steel here. This is what VG should be, not like Dalstrongs and Shuns. The edge grind is also thin, especially on the nakiri, and their knives are still comfortable despite their low price. Takamura Chromax - Chromax is a proprietary semi-stainless steel, meaning it will rust if you neglect it, but this has never happened to me. The steel is around an astonishing 65 HRC. These are super thin knives that must be sharpened out of the box in order to fortify their delicate factory edges. I got a 210mm gyuto for $120 on Black Friday, which is insane. A black pakkawood handled santoku is available on Chef Knives To Go\u2019s website for $80, which is equally insane. These knives will hold an edge for a long time but, due to their incredible thinness, they do not tolerate abuse well. They will, however, cut finely as a fresh scalpel for weeks without a serious sharpening if you know what you are doing. Tojiro - This is perhaps the biggest knife company in Japan and is gaining steam worldwide. Their DP line made of VG-10 stainless is famous for being an excellent intro to Japanese blades. Heat treatment is consistent, the blades are clean and even, and the brand has an excellent reputation. All their lines are of good quality and value. Their DP gyuto used to be around $70 but has been hitting the $80s recently due to demand and branding. Still great knives. Fujiwara \u2013 Not to be confused with Fujiwara Teruyasu, who makes very high-end and expensive knives. Fujiwara\u2019s FKH and FKM lines are the new budget choice for many. One line is carbon and the other is stainless. Both are excellent starting Japanese knives that are easy to sharpen and that hold an edge for a respectable duration. A standard length should be around $70. Kurosaki Yu \u2013 This guy and his brother Kurosaki Makoto each make different knives but I prefer Yu\u2019s despite both of them making blades of incredible quality and beauty. I consider Kurosaki Yu\u2019s Shizuku line (made of powder metallurgy SG2/R-2 stainless steel) to be the absolute pinnacle of cutting performance for the price. For well under $300, you get a knife that outperforms literal $1000+ blades by many other makers. These knives are as good as it gets. The knives are thin, but not too thin, with enough of a convex edge to enable good food release. Excellent fit and finish, even a blind man cannot feel that the handle of this comfortable knife is made out of two pieces of material. They retain a decent edge for months. I\u2019ve had my 210mm Shizuku gyuto for about 2 years and cook at home, and have only needed to sharpen it twice. It\u2019s absolutely nuts. My only complaint is that the steel feels a bit \u201cnumb\u201d or \u201cdead\u201d during stone sharpening due to less tactile feedback than my other knives but that\u2019s a nitpick at this point. Tosa-Ichi \u2013 The knives I speak of are from their stainless-clad aogami super line. You can get a 210mm gyuto for around $140. These are thin knives with an excellent grind, consistent heat treatment, and respectable fit and finish at this price point. The company saves labor by using roll forging on pre-laminated steel but the results are great for the bargain-thirsty consumer. Aogami super is regarded by many to be the ultimate reactive carbon steel for knives. These edges at 64 HRC easily last for weeks even if you\u2019re doing nothing but prepping insane volumes of restaurant vegetables every day. Kohetsu \u2013 This is a house brand developed for Chef Knives To Go. Their Aogami #2 line, especially, is a great value in my opinion. The heat treatment is excellent, grinds are well-executed, and appearances are nice. These are thicker \u201cworkhorse\u201d knives that still boast great cutting performance. Their 210mm gyuto is only $115. Shigeki Tanaka - This smith took over his father\u2019s business and has been crafting some great knives for the price. He makes a wide range of knives, some of which are expensive and very high quality. The \u201cbargain\u201d knives are made of VG-10 or Aogami #2 with a black forge scale finish. Make no mistake, though, his heat treatment skills are great and his knives are excellent cutters. The VG-10 210mm knife is below $120 from some sources and the aogami #2 knife with black finish is $140 from some sources. Shiro Kamo - Another skilled smith who makes many lines of knives. He makes Aogami Super knives in the Shinko Seilan line selling for under $140. These have a thick \u201cworkhorse\u201d grind thicker than the Kohetsu knives, are hardened to around 63 HRC, and require maintenance, but the value is definitely there. There are many more, but you get the idea. I personally think performance maxes out at under $300. The sweet spot for a great knife is $80 to $200 if you choose carefully. Considering how these will bring you a lifetime of incredible cutting performance, joy in the kitchen, and enhance your cooking experience through a beautiful appearance, they are well worth the price. Below is a small portion of my knife collection. Top 3 pics: Ishikawa 185mm shirogami #2 santoku - This one has an interesting story as well as a unique single-beveled grind for all his knives, which are all usually double-beveled. Ishikawa is a 4th generation smith at Nakaniida Traditional Blades and the last remaining smith in his lineage. He has no apprentice and is getting old. Once he is gone, there will be no more of these. His process involves hardening the blade 3 times. This is probably the easiest-to-sharpen knife I have ever owned. It\u2019s so easy to get an incredible edge with minimal effort.

            "answer_text": "I am going to give a couple of my tips and stories, and then list a few of my knife recommendations. Because of my professional training, my knife recommendations are mainly for sushi and Japanese cuisine, though, they can certainly be utilized for other type of cuisines both Asian and Western. It\u2019s how you sharpen itThe first and the most important thing about knife is that it's all about how you sharpen it, not so much about the quality, type of steel and the make. (I had this conversation with the manager of a reputable knife store and he too said the same thing.) It's true that expensive knives use higher quality steel, yet the fact is somewhere along the way, they will become dull, and you must sharpen them. I\u2019ve seen so many home chefs with once beautiful now \u201cdull\u201d knives, sitting quietly and sadly unused in the kitchen. It\u2019s just like finding your partnerThe second thing to remember is that the best knife for you is the one feels great when you hold it in your hand. It's like finding a partner in your life. What's best for you will be different from what's best for others. In other words, just because someone said, \"This Masamoto sashimi knife is excellent,\" there is no guarantee it will be a great knife for you also. I certainly have used Masamoto Sashimi knives before, and I think they are fantastic knives. However, just because they are one of the most popular Sushi knives in Japan and US, it does not automatically mean I should buy them. I do like them. I suppose a good question to ask is:\u201dWould you buy the car of the year car just because it\u2019s considered to be the best?\u201d I chose my knife based on how it felt in my hand. Here are a couple of stories about knives to highlight what I am mentioning here. Story #1: Knife shop, Kappa-Bashi, Tokyo Kappa-Bashi is a famous street filled with restaurant supply shops ranging from kitchen equipment, plates, restaurant furniture, knives and just about anything you can think of in operating a restaurant. I was browsing one of the knife shops and heard this conversation between the owner and the customer. Customer: \u201cSo, which one do you think is a great knife?\u201d (Pointing at several knives he picked) Owner: \u201cWell, they are all great knives.\u201d Customer: \u201cYes, I know they are all good. I mean which I should I buy?\u201d Owner: \u201cIf you are asking for my recommendation, I can tell you that almost all the professional chefs buy inexpensive knives because they use them every day. They know they will damage expensive knives if they have to use them every day. Almost all the amateurs and semi-pros end up buying expensive knives. I suppose that is because they want to own and collect knives rather than use them.\u201d I don\u2019t know which one this customer ended up buying - my guess is that he ended up buying an expensive knife. Story #2: What I learned about a knife from the most talented sushi chef I\u2019ve ever worked with. I met Jin-san at this sushi restaurant in Long Beach, CA around 2002. He told me that he started working for a family-run sushi restaurant in Tokyo when he was fifteen, which meant, Jin-san had (roughly) over thirty years of professional sushi experience. He started his day at six in the morning by cleaning and finished his day at midnight by cleaning the entire restaurant. For the first few years, all he did was cleaning and doing errands that seemed to have nothing to do with sushi making. He practiced his knife and sushi skills on his own using leftover ingredients, sometimes purchasing his own at the fish market. Some fish suppliers were generous enough to sell him unwanted fish to Jin-san. He worked in Japan for a while before he was asked to work in LA. He was very gentle, polite, and most of all, he laughed a lot. One day I saw Jin-san filleting halibut, and I was shocked at how fast he filled the whole fish. It only took him a few minutes or so, where it would have taken me at least ten. Not only Jin-san was fast, but also, he moved so gracefully and beautifully. His knife handling was so precise that it had the appearance of choreographed dance sequence. Realizing my intense gaze, he started explaining the whole process to me - \u201cYou see that the trick is not about the knife you use. I have very expensive sushi knives at home. I have one that costs over $2,000, and I rarely use it these days. These knives I use right now, do you know how much they cost? They cost me $15 each at a restaurant supply store. You see it\u2019s how you sharpen your knives. I can tell how much of a chef he is by looking at his knife.\u201d The knife I currently use is 10\" chef knife I purchased in San Francisco Chinatown for $7. It's a great stainless steel knife that equals to any other made in Germany knives because it feels great in my hand. (though I do have a sashimi knife that cost over $300 and it is for the sushi class mainly for the looks.) So, my recommendation is to try out as many knives you like until you find the one best fits your hand. Learn how to sharpen your knives correctly using sharpening stone instead of the sharpening steel. (A sharpening steel will never \"sharpen\" your knives. They are meant to be used only as temporary relief between sharpening.) My Knife Recommendations Types of knife: Yanagiba - Also known as Sashimi Knife, not \u201cSushi\u201d knife as known in the western countries. Long thin, single edged blade. Usuba - Mainly for cutting vegetables. Both single and double edged. Gyuto - Japanese style Western Chef Knife. All purpose. Deba - Thick single blade, designed to cut bones and fillet fish. Masamune, Kamakura, Japan Goro Nyudo Masamune (\u4e94\u90ce\u5165\u9053\u6b63\u5b97) is considered as the greatest swordsman in the history of Japan. The shop is currently run by its twenty fourth generation master. Their knife is beautiful hand crafted carrying the Masamune tradition for the past seven hundred years. I\u2019ve used their knives and fell in love with them. They are available only at their store in Kamakura. Gyuto - Japanese style western knife,  Yanagiba (Sashimi Knife)  Usuba (thin blade, Single edge)  Masamoto & Aritsugi They are one of the most popular Japanese knife makers. Masamoto is based in Tsukiji (where the fish market is), Tokyo and known as \u201cThe knife maker of the East,\u201d while Aritugi is \u201cThe West,\u201d located in Kyoto with a branch in Tsukiji as well. They have variety of knives - a great Gyuto and Yanagiba/Sashimi knife starts around US$200\u2013300 range. Masamoto Gyuto & Yanagiba   Aritsugu Yanagiba, Usuba & Deba  ",
