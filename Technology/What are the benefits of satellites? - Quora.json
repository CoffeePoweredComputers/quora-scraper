So, here are a few people may not often consider\u2026 Feeding people: Today\u2019s farmers can incorporate satellite data to help maximize crop yields and minimize environmental impacts from their activities[1].Save People: Earth facing satellites are used for weather monitoring. Big hurricane forming? We\u2019ll know and can warn people now.Save the planet: (Maybe). So much if our Earth science data comes from satellites. At least we have the information. Hopefully we can use it wisely.Guide People: Any of the satellite navigation systems help guide people around the world.Add to our collective knowledge: Hubble, Spitzer, ISS\u2026etc. The last being as actual floating laboratory, where experiments can be carried out in the unique environment of microgravity.Footnotes[1] Farmers benefit from satellite coverage",

You can probably find more if you look. This is one of those questions I don\u2019t understand - it takes little or no time to find this out for yourself. ",
