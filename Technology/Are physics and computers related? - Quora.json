            "answer_text": "Yuriy Zyko provided some good information about a single \u201ccomputational cells\u201d. Computation also requires \u201ccomputational binding\u201d of individual cells. For example when 2 registers are \u201ccomputationally bound\u201d via a comparison operation in a CPU. As is pointed out in Integration Information Theory the more ways more of these cells are computationally bound the more intelligent or conscious it can be. This can be generically quantified and denoted as \ud835\udf31 (phi). There is also an important difference between abstract systems and phenomenal ones that run directly on physical qualities. Abstract systems represent information in a way that is abstracted away from physics. The only way any set of physics can represent 1s and 0s, is if you have a dictionary interpretation mechanism to tell you which physics represents ones and which represent zeros. We, on the other hand run directly on physical qualities in our brain like redness and grenness. Another example is a mechanical spring. For an abstract system to do desire like operations, you need to mathematically defined an abstract table that can be used to determine exactly how much tension will result from various input values. While a spring like set of physics just naturally performs a tension or desire operation. No interpretation table required. Since phenomenal systems running directly on physical qualities don\u2019t need these additional interpretation systems, this is more efficient. This efficiency is probably why evolution selected phenomenal over abstract computation systems. For more information on all this see the emerging expert consensus camp now being called \u201cRepresentational Qualia Theory\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The connection between physics and computers, more precisely by calculations, is determined by the minimum energy costs for processing one bit of information. The first answer belonged to L. Brillouin, Szillard and von Neumann and amounted to kTln2, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature of the computational cell. L. Landauer made a significant clarification. He showed that the scattering of such an amount of energy accompanies only the erasure of a bit, and all other operations - copying, transportation can occur with arbitrarily small energy costs if the speed of the operation is arbitrarily small. Landauer also considered a mathematical model of a computational cell in the isothermal approximation. As shown in the article ( Yu. N. Zayko, Estimation of the Computation Capacity of Classical Computers) the compute cells of classical computers operate in adiabatic mode. But the isothermal mode is interesting because when it is executed, such a computer (Landauer's computer) will be able to solve problems of non-polynomial complexity in polynomial time (Y. N. Zayko, Solution of NP-complete Problems on the Landauer's Computer) ",

These studies along with the need of computation/communication gave birth to computers and related sciences. Everything in the universe, how each things work are studied in physics. The topic has grown so much that we had to create branches in it. Computer sciences/devices/storage/communication these are physics too. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes , physics and computer science are related to each other. To develop computer hardware, you should have the knowledge of the components of electronic circuits and this is where physics has its role to play. And, to solve many complex problems of practical physics, you need different programming languages like fortran, c, java etc. Thus, both are interrelated. PS: I could have written a long answer, but i think the above answer would work. ",
