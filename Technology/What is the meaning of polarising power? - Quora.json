            "answer_text": "Polarisation occurs when a small cation distorts the valence electron shells of a larger anion. A cation's polarizing power relates to its ability to attract the valence electron shell (outermost electrons) from a nearby anion in ionic compounds and the tendency of the anion to become polarized by the cation is known as its polarizability. It is proportional to charge density i.e, charge/size ratio. It is the basis of Fajan\u2019s rules of covalent character in ionic compounds. For cations with the same radius, the higher the charge is, the larger the polarizing power is. For cations with the same charge, the smaller the radius is, the larger the polarizing power is. Smaller cations that have higher positive charges will have better polarizing power because the positive charge is distributed on a relatively small area. Li+ ion has highest polarising power among the alkali metal ions. Also cations having pseudo-noble gas configurations have higher polarising power due to poor shielding of inner(penultimate) 10 d-electrons and hence greatere effective nuclear charge. e.g, Ag+ , Hg2+, Cu+etc. The cause of diagonal relationship is the similar polarising power of the ions derived from these elements.
