            "answer_text": "Under no circumstances.Samsung is conglomerate & Apple has no chance to understand that huge portfolio.Apple has few products along their history. They fully depend on their iPhone for the rest of their services. In the huge Samsung portfolio, Samsung has Galaxy S that is on similar level to iPhones (their Note & Fold series is ahead of iPad by sales & capability, not counting the Chromebooks ;) Samsung already has better products than the best selling iGadgets. The key for Apple is building loyal (cultish) base.Samsung buying Apple will only confuse the customers in the dichotomy of value/productivity (Samsung) vs brand/prestige (Apple). ",

            "answer_text": "Samsung can\u2019t buy Apple. Apple can buy Samsung but don\u2019t want to. Here\u2019s why for the first sentence. Samsung as a conglomerate has a net worth of 326B$ Apple is rated with a Net worth of 2.04T$ and Have Spendable rating of about 430B$ if I\u2019m not mistaken so if Apple saw any benefit in buying Samsung. They would buy it. But with quite a risk. However both companies have VERY different approaches. And I honestly don\u2019t think any of them would buy each other even if they could. ",
