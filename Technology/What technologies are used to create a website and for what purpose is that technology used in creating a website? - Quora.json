            "answer_text": "For building a website, I would say we have many available technologies, and based on our requirement we should choose one. The website can be basically 2 main types - static and dynamic and based on website type, the technologies would be used.  For static websites, the technologies used are HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets), these are also called Client-Side Coding. For Dynamic websites, along with Client-side coding, we need server-side Coding and the technologies used are PHP, Python, Java, ASP, and many more. We cannot specify an exact purpose of using any particular technology as there are many factors involved while selecting it for the requirement like the development and licensing cost, website performance, maintenance cost, organization\u2019s internal guidelines, ease of scalability for growth and more and very important to avoid costly mistakes, the developer you have should be well-versed & an expert with the technology you are going to use for the project. But what I feel is, before we jump into complete development, why don't we test the same through ready-made solutions? There are many open-source and closed-source available platforms and why don't we test it for our requirement? I have a few to suggest: Zencommerce (highly recommended, as this is an Indian platform and very budget-friendly), Shopify (they are good but do not have customer support in India), KartRocket (they are mainly focusing towards shipping so I think their focus on selling online store software has somehow shifted).And you can search for many such e-commerce software...
