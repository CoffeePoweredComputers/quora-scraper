            "answer_text": "It will change it from a place where you can get a job doing what a future machine will do to one where you can get a job repairing the machines. I think you can expect the economy and business world to fumble around with this for a while. For one thing, the tech world is used to selling products to consumers who can and will spend a grand or so a year to upgrade their devices. There\u2019s no real push to upgrade existing stuff. Even look at Windows with its jillion security patches and its shitty way of installing bloatware on your devices until they run so poorly that they\u2019re next to useless. Look at the current way that companies have of intrusively saving your data. As more things automate, those things will be things that people will slowly begin to pay more to avoid. It won\u2019t happen smoothly. As it is now, the more affordable automation is with devices and machines that are generally pieces of crap. They\u2019re buggy, they\u2019re energy hogs, they\u2019re fixtures and not portable, and they break down a lot. Fixing it pays well. As even the better stuff ages, it will get problems that develop. Look at the number of ATMs that were still running XP when Microsoft decided to stop supporting it. As far as I know, a lot of scientific and engineering systems still use FORTRAN. All you\u2019ll have to do to have a job is outlast the last system in use that is created at the time you were trained. That could be your whole career. ",

            "answer_text": "Automation is best suited for tasks which are repetitive, predictable and do not require a lot of judgement calls. Automation does not do well out \u201cin the wild\u201d in tasks such as plumbing or carpentry. Take it out of a very controlled, factory-like environment and it will cope poorly much of the time. Computers that assist people in their jobs are not actually automation. A medical practice using electronic records is not being \u201cpartially automated\u201d, for example. Here are a couple of more specific examples: There are already some automated voice response systems doing incoming call processing for various firms. They are at least partially successful but in my experience are very limited in their responses. They will get better over time but there will still be a need for people to deal with the exceptions. Sales kiosks at fast food shops are likely to become more common as the \u201cfight for $15\u201d effort continues. These are jobs that are simple and repetitive but do not add a lot of value. However, real waiters will continue to be used at sit-down restaurants, particularly in the mid- to high-end market. Machines are not able to deliver the food to the table or provide information to the guests about menu items. ",
