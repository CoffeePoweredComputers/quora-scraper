            "answer_text": "agree with another answer. And I want to make some complement for USB Type-C. The rise of USB C Cable nowadays is neither surprising nor one-off. For those perplexed in selecting the proper cable, we offer an elaborated introduction especially to the USB Type C Cable in the following, which should be helpful in a way. USB Type C Cable allows you to charge your mobile phone, tablet and iPad, power your smart devices as well as transfer a deluge of data, including photos, music and videos, to laptops at the speeds from 480Mbps up to 10Gbps. USB C Charging Cable supports 60W/3A of power, having the devices fully charged at a prompt speed. USB A-C Cable is the most common, connecting the USB-A enabled devices and the USB-C ones. What worth mentioning is that the DP To HDMI DisplayPort Cable is particularly suitable for the high-speed sync of video data, enabling monitors to provide the occupants with the ultra HD 1080p video resolution. Type C mainly serves as a stable and secure port carrying myriads of both digital and audio signal from the compatible devices without compressing the data quality. USB Type C Cable is compatible for USB-C enabled devices new MacBooksChromebook PixelLenovo Yoga 900Yoga3ProDell XPS 13 (9350)Dell XPS 15 9550HP Spectre X2HP x360 Samsung Galaxy Note 8/ S8/ S8 PlusHTC U11...Broadly speaking, the USB Type C Cable has been regarded as the most compatible product in the current market. The next level of the evolution of USB Type C Cable is the comprehensive popularization of compatibility, exempting any possible inconvenience with regard to its adaptability to different devices. One interesting topic could be discussed is that <Will USB Tyoe-C replace HDMI?> Attention: some cables are one-way transfered For example, this VCElink USB Type-C cable cannot transfer data from HDMI to USB.  VCElink: http://c45.fun/IHD0lQ Recently, USB Type C Cable is specifically welcome among computer technicians, official clerks, college students and other groups of people exposed to electronic devices frequently. Alex Miles : (from Amazon) - whether the USB Type C Cable was durable, noting that several of his previous cables had a life span of only three or four months\uff1f It is generally believed that the cable will be worn out after a period of use. Well, this situation is less likely to apply to the USB Type C Cable, for it is specially designed smaller in size, which guarantees its good resistance to mill. And it is waterproof, the further concerns on its performance as the water splashed on the cable are unnecessary. However, one point should paid attetion is that the cable is not supposed to be exposed to extreme temperature or stroke by the great force. Also, occupants shall remember to unplug the cable after each use, so as to avoid damage to the cable due to excessive power.  Aaron Lanchester (from Amazon) - It is true that the speed of data transfer is satisfactory, yet the stability is a failure, for the transfer might be discontinued all of a sudden, which can be quite annoying. The cable itself is authentic and is appropriately used. Make sure that you do not buy a faked product or the one fails to meet the quality standard. If such situation happens again, more attention should be paied to the network connection, because the unstable connection is usually considered to be the major cause that results in the frequent discontinuation of the data transfer. In addition, the performance of device can account for this phenomenon as well. If the device is aging and out-dated, the stability with regard to the sync of data can be negatively influenced, which requires real-time updates of inner system and cleanup for applications not commonly used. The procedures being checked up and done step by step, the data is transfered further more stable and smoother. A typical question about the USB Type C Cable focuses on the relation between the Type C and the USB standard. Frankly speaking, there is no explicit relationship, since they are barely discussed under the same concept. Type C is basically an exterior connector for USB, while the USB standard is simply the standard for connector that distinguishes the different data delivering speeds. On April this year, the USB-IF organization just issued a brand new standard USB 3.2, which makes the super speed of 20Gbs possible. More importantly, this newly implemented standard is announced to be only adapted to Type C connector, highlighting the outstanding advantage of USB Type C Cable. At this level, the DP To HDMI DisplayPort Cable and the USB A-C Cable are presumed to lead a future fashion in the market in upcoming years. As is discussed at length above, we hope you have a general idea of the USB Type C Cable we introduce.

            "answer_text": "USB-C is USB, it's right there in the name. Type-C ports are just another option for terminating a USB cable. We have three (3) of them now; type-A, type-B and now type-C. Type-A is the one everyone is familiar with and is found on devices as an \u201coutput only\u201d or \u201chost\u201d port. Type-B can come in a few size variants and until OTA was a thing was designed for use as an \u201cinput only\u201d or \u201cclient\" port. Type-C ports on the other hand are installed on devices that negotiate between each other which device will fulfill the \u201chost\u201d role and which the \u201cclient\u201d role, this allows for bidirectional cables meaning you can put a type-C port on both ends and the devices themselves will decide if they are each sending or receiving power for example. The following chart displays the different options for USB cable termination and what each port is referred to:  Notice how the 3.1 port has a blue bit inside, that usually denotes that the cable is a USB 3.0 or 3.1 cable but in reality can be any colour so if you're unsure look for a row of extra pins or \u201ccontacts\" on what's called the \u201csubstrate\u201d (it's the little coloured bit).
