            "answer_text": "This is a question about the Twins Paradox - first proposed by Einstein - twin brothers - one takes off in a ship and achieves a relativistic speed, and when he returns. his brother is twelve years older Of the 50+ solutions to this, each has a number of refutations including the most recent one - jump-frames - which is naive when you think about it A pattern emerges in each solution however, in that - in their attempt to prove Einstein was correct, they don\u2019t actually use Einstein in their solution - they appeal to something else - denying Einstein- ironic, no? Einstein used a phrase \u201cmutatis mutande\u201d concerning frames of reference with motion - and motion alone - to explain things - this means each frame of reference is independent to all others - and the observer in one frame experiences the same events equally to all others for example: If I\u2019m on a platform watching a train approach, I consider myself stationary while the train is in motion - but - if I\u2019m on the train - I can consider myself stationary while the platform is in motion - it\u2019s all in the frame of reference of the observer Back to the Twins Paradox - If I\u2019m the brother in the spaceship, I can consider myself in motion and my brother stationary- or - my brother can consider himself in motion and the spaceship stationary - it\u2019s all in the observer\u2019s frame of reference Can you tell from the above which brother would age faster? Of course not, and neither could Einstein- that\u2019s why it\u2019s a paradox To the OP\u2019s question - no - the possibilty one will age faster is based on the observer, so neither will age faster The more folks try to solve this paradox the more they realize they\u2019re defending a crackpot Einstein received the Nobel for the photoelectric effect, not for Relativity Then, as now, a wide range of scientists can explain what we see without Einstein, and the only reason Einstein burst on the scene was largely political and public-relations- even his assistants claimed he was a shoddy mathematician \u201cThat light requires the same time to traverse the path A\u2192M as for the path B\u2192M is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own free will in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity.\u201d -Albert Einstein, \u201cRelativity ...\u201d, chapter 8, \u201c On the idea of time in physics \u201d,1916 In the above, we see that Einstein didn\u2019t actually measure the speed of light as constant- he stipulated it - as a convention Conventions are like English and Metric - both are accurate within their models - and choosing one over the other does not produce \u201cwrong\u201d measurements What if we had a different convention for the speed of light? It would resolve a lot of anomalies we see today, such as quantum entanglement speed has a formula: speed = distance/time But Einstein claimsd that time is relative. If we agree with Einstein, the above equation yields a relative value for the speed of light - and we deny Einstein\u2019s constant speed of light If we declare light speed constant, then time must be constant, and we deny Einstein\u2019s assertion of relative time Many experiments and measurements on the speed of light have been gathered over the last century, and one trend is significant to all this - the speed of light is measured as slower with each new measurement. How can this be if the speed of light is constant? ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not the travelling - it\u2019s the speed. If they travel slowly, there will not be a difference, or it will be so small as to not matter in any meaningful way. If they can get to a decent percentage of the speed of light, they will start appearing to age slower compared to someone on Earth. The closer they get to the speed of light, the larger the effects.
