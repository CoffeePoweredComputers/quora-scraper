            "answer_text": "Do radiation suits work? That depends on what you designed them to do. If you designed them to stop radiation from harming the life form inside, you probably lose. There are some suits on the market which are advertized to partially stop radiation; most have metal flakes in plastic plates that make up the suit. The only sure radiation stoppers are about 2 cms of lead, 4 cms of steel, or a couple of meters of water. These would be more like rooms you inhabit rather than suits you can wear. On the other hand, standards HAZMAT suits, while they don\u2019t stop the radiation, do stop the radiation carriers, the dust \u201cfallout\u201d, from getting lodged in your skin. The breathing filter keeps it out of your lungs. Perhaps even more important, when they are stripped off, they leave the fallout on the site and don\u2019t let it get tracked home to the wife and kiddies. They work by providing, in the first case, some shielding, and in the second, freedom from the fallout that radiation emanates from. ",
