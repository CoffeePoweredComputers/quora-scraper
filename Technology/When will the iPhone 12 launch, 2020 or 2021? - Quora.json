If they launched sonner then it will be plus point and all the apple lover is happy but due to the current suitation covid all big compines are holding there products not to launch in 2020.

            "answer_text": "So far, Apple has announced that iPhone 12 will be released one or two months late, mostly due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. I could see the iPhone 12 being delayed until 2021 but I don\u2019t think that will happen as the pandemic is gradually being compensated in quite a few countries. I believe iPhone 12 will be launched around Christmas. ",
