            "answer_text": " We are nowhere near it. Nowhere. Not even slightly. An exoskeleton that allows the user to have greater strength for lifting in specific circumstances? Yes. But not a suit. A suit that allows you to breathe? Sure, with GIANT tanks attached to it, for a couple hours. Let\u2019s break down what the suit is and why we can\u2019t have nice things\u2026 yet. (and I\u2019m not even going to use the new nano particle suit, just the one from Iron Man I - the very first movie, the basic suit). Fully enclosed suit: The suit is fully enclosed, meaning it is sealed against pressure, air, water. We can\u2019t do this. Why not? Why can\u2019t we just make a suit like this. See the next points. Self contained: The suit is self contained. Meaning it not only has its own power source (yes it\u2019s in his chest (or was) but the other suits have that built in). It also generates a breathable atmosphere, recycles his exhalations, generates moisture and uses a tiny tiny power source. Tiny Power Source: The self sustaining ARC reactor is a piece of technology that would solve most of our energy needs. This tiny device creates power on a magnitude that is unheard of, and apparently produces no waste, and almost no heat. Inertia Dampening: Did you see when Tony got shot out of the sky with a missile? Do you remember when he was instantly killed from the sudden change in direction his body and suit took? Yeah, neither did I. That means the suit has the ability to dampen the effects of sudden changes - serious sudden changes to vectors well above what would be possible with shock padding. We are talking about a device, an electronic system that somehow generates or negates the effects of force and gravity - instantly. It\u2019s the force equivalent of a surge protector - it has to clamp down and protect in nanoseconds and generate a force that we don\u2019t know how to generate electronically. Put one of these in a car and you could slam into a brick wall with very minor injuries if any. Recycling: His suit has the ability to allow him to go to the bathroom on longer missions. in a suit that tiny, that close to his skin that\u2019s some seriously advanced technology. We are talking about tubes and stuff, and chemistry, and pumps. All tiny, all really really efficient. Strength actuators: The suit does what our best exoskeletons can do - by a factor of 50 or more, and it is only a few inches in thickness around his body. That means all the joints have the special actuators that allow the suit to move and press against objects with a force that we can\u2019t even generate with a giant exoskeleton that has to be powered externally, and stuff that gets anywhere near that strength are all hydraulic. His suit has electronic motor type actuators. We are experimenting with these rubber band like electronic muscles, but we can\u2019t move tons with them. Mind Interface: You think he just moves his legs and arms around and then tells JARVIS (or the Redheaded chick - Friday) to do something? He would have lost many battles. Think about the times he turns around and instantly fires. What\u2019s he pressing to do that? you think he has to look at a button, a la-Stephen Hawking interface? Remember when he said to Captain America, \u201cI have a plan: attack\u201d and then instantly launched? How did he do that? He didn\u2019t say \u201cHey JARVIS, let\u2019s go now.\u201d He launched, with a thought. How about when his helmet closes, or reforms around his head. Do you see him say \u201cClose helmet?\u201d The suit is slow, and easily overcome by attackers if you manipulate it any other way than thinking about it. Repulsors: One of the big claims to fame of Stark Tech (at least in the movies) is the \u201crepulsor technology.\u201d This is essentially an inertia-less generator. It creates push from nothing and violates one of Newton\u2019s laws. Remember the EM Drive that creates so much buzz? That thing can\u2019t even generate enough push to slide a paper clip across your desk. The repulsors not only provide enough lift for the suit AND the wearer but can do it at great speeds, AND can be used as weapons by creating a burst of thrust. AI: Tony was able to \u201cupload\u201d JARVIS into the suit (and apparently had a bunch of other versions on what looked like memory sticks). That means the suit has some intense computing power, far beyond what is possible, and it fits in the suit along with everything else mentioned above. This AI is able to instantly respond to commands, constantly monitor the suit, his vitals, the environment and even incoming communications, scan radio and TV broadcasts (\u201ckeyword: hulk\u201d). This AI understands sarcasm. You don\u2019t understand what kind of finesse you need for that - since a good portion of humans don\u2019t get that. So Tony invented an AI that does exactly what an AI is supposed to do. Exotic materials: For the suit to be as strong as it is, to repel physical forces, to withstand the stresses of lifting buses or punching through concrete or being hit with a massive sword you need exotic materials. It\u2019s got to be really really hard but not brittle and it\u2019s got to be light. The suit is made of a gold-titanium alloy (and again, JUST going by Iron Man I - I\u2019m using older references just to show how advanced this stuff is). We don\u2019t have anything remotely like that. Sure, we have some cool ceramics, some steel that has other stuff mixed in. We are putzing with spider silk. Putzing. Actual Holographic displays: The suit has multi-level holographic projections built into the helmet. These aren\u2019t even as amazing as the one in his phone. We don\u2019t have that. We have parallax effect pseudo 3D at best, or we can project stuff on mist. yeah. lame. As you see any ONE of these inventions would revolutionize its industry and change our lives for the better, but you need ALL of them to replicate his suit. You need the actuators to give it the stretch but the suit would fall apart from stress so you need the exotic materials but then you need to power it so you need a power source that generates enough power in a tiny space that doesn\u2019t kill the wearer with radiation and heat, but you can\u2019t fly unless you have repulsors and then you can\u2019t control it because you don\u2019t have the mind interface, but then you are limited in what you can do unless you have the most advanced and complete and benign AI installed but you can\u2019t do that unless you have the computing power that is insanely powerful in a tiny space and none of that matters because a couple hits from physical attacks would turn your body and brain to jelly from the outside shocks so you need electronic inertial dampeners that would put the Enterprise to shame. And that\u2019s why we can\u2019t have nice things. PS - I\u2019m sure I missed something. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Like a great many things in comic books, theoretically, it is very much possible. As it stands, our current understanding of the natural world places no implicit limitations on any of the attributes of the Iron Man armor. The Physics of every aspect of that suit is in fact very plausible, and downright realistic. HOWEVER, the Engineering of an exosuit like that, is a whole other matter! Each feature of the suit, however benign they may seem, is a MARVELous feat of engineering purely in its own rite. To design a weapon that powerful, yet managing to keep it so nimble, lightweight, hollow, not to mention safe for humans that happen to be inside it, will require ungodly quantities of raw ingenuity. ARC REACTORFirst, foremost, and most obviously, consider the insanely glorified light bulb he wears on his chest: the infamous arc reactor. From this singular device emanates all the energy that powers the suit, a nontrivial amount that deserves its own post. Everything from the powerful lasers that effortlessly slice through Hammer-oids and debris stuck in helicarriers, to the insanely deadly pulses of ionized matter that he projects from the repulsors on his palms, presumably his heels, and every other thruster, in order to achieve continuous, rangeless, hypersonic flight, or blow a cyborg\u2019s robotic arm clean off with a single pulse. The amount of energy required to actually pull feats like these would at least be on the order of gigajoules. In fact, in the first movie, Tony specifically divulged a number describing the power output of his first prototype of the miniaturized arc reactor: 3 Gigajoules per second. No, seriously, three billion watts. That\u2019s big enough to be just shy of the total power output of the largest nuclear power plant in the United States, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, a power station with an output of 3.3 Gigajoules per second. Add to this thermodynamic nightmare the extra detail of the operating principle behind the arc reactor: it runs on nuclear fusion! While nuclear fusion is demonstrably achievable in laboratory settings, a fusion reaction has not been successfully mined for its energy; basically, present methods of fusion require more energy to kickstart than the amount of energy that is released from it. So, that (rather massive) wrinkle, though only an engineering problem, must first be solved. Then, we must miniaturize a Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), the design that the arc reactor is based upon. Just for clarity, a TFTR is essentially a doughnut shaped hollow magnetic tube that rapidly accelerates and contains high energy plasma. Plasma is the hottest state of matter that we know of, and it would easily burn through anything. Now, to contain enough plasma that can generate 3.3 Gigajoules of energy every second within a device the size of your hand, without it getting hot, is thermodynamically herculean to say the least. To do that, you\u2019d need some downright magic material that can somehow conduct electricity, does not conduct heat, is light enough to hold in one hand, and does not deform under enormous pressure. With the arc reactor, there are a slew of engineering challenges to solve, from the material science that will make it possible in the first place, to the development of fusion technology, and would probably take multiple lifetimes to solve. And that\u2019s just the arc reactor. INERTIAL DAMPENERSYou might be wondering why this would be necessary, that is until you consider the epic aerial maneuvers that Tony stark routinely pulls while in flight. Every roll, every twist, every abrupt stop, has to involve dangerously rapid acceleration and deceleration. Remember when he was taking the MK-02 for a test flight halfway through the first movie, and upon asking JARVIS about the altitude record of the SR-71, he suddenly aims his flight path skyward in an attempt to break said record? Or when he was in that dogfight with the F-22\u2019s on the way back home from his revenge vendetta in Gulmira, and he was being shot, then he suddenly decelerates so fast that the fighter jets barely get out of the way? G-forces (a measure of acceleration where one unit is the acceleration due to gravity on the earth) of this magnitude really should kill him instantly, or break his bones and knock him unconscious at the very least. You might be thinking of a G-suit right about now, but if you do the math, you find that a G-suit simply won\u2019t cut it. In the dogfight scene, he decelerates so much he presumably attains infrasonic velocity almost instantly. That\u2019s G\u2019s in the thousands. Forces like that should cause his brain to rattle violently in his skull, hemorrhaging his brain immediately. To fix this, he\u2019d have to have intricate systems to dissipate the forces incurred by his inertia, probably with some sort of magnetic dampening system that converts all that kinetic energy into something easily discardable, say, heat energy, so that he doesn\u2019t die when he\u2019s suddenly smacked in the face by a tank shell. Oh, and speaking of\u2026 TANK MISSILESPlummeting out of the sky, and falling so fast and hard he craters his crash site, he immediately gets up, WITHOUT BROKEN BONES (refer to inertial dampener problem), fires a tiny rocket at a tank, and after about a second of delay, the tank violently explodes! If I had to guess, the tank missile contains an RDX payload, and does not explode on impact. Instead, it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s some mechanism used by the rocket to drill through the tank\u2019s hull, then deploy the RDX payload. Could such a tank missile be built? In theory, yes. In fact, it might be the simplest component of the battle suit that is the Iron Man armor. SPECIALIZED MATERIALSFurther on the subject of tanks and missiles, among other more truly wonderful things like the arc reactor, the materials that are used to build these specialized components that do a wide variety of things, must be meticulously engineered, as no ordinary materials can even begin to perform well under these circumstances. For example, consider the material that makes up the bulk of the suit\u2019s exterior: it can absorb a punch from a tank shell without deforming or breaking, yet dissipating all that energy so as to not kill the Tony inside it. Steel can\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s much too heavy. However, one might be thinking: what of a Gold-Titanium (AuTi) alloy? Like with many superhero related things, one would think this would be an easy \u201cno\u201d, but as it turns out, the material is surprisingly strong, having improved yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness, of up to 50%, compared to commercially pure titanium. Now, the material doesn\u2019t quite hold up to the stress that the movies would have you believe, but perhaps coated with other more powerful materials that might, such as Titanium Nitride (TiN) or Titanium Aluminum Nitride (TiAlN), although these materials are typically used to coat Tungsten Carbide (WC) which is about twice the density of steel, which is undesirable if flight is desired. Then there\u2019s the matter of the arc reactor, by far the most fantastic piece of technology on that suit. Materials that would contain the heat and ionizing radiation that emanates from high-energy plasma, while sustaining a powerful magnetic field that confines aforementioned plasma, without pulling all the iron straight out of his blood, while remaining thin and light (you know, because it fits in one hand) would have to be engineered on the atomic scale, maybe even subatomic. Maybe. That\u2019s materials science research 100 space races ahead of its time. AFTERBURNERSOn the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and sometimes, in other nooks, crannies, and on extra backpack-like structures, there are powerful thrusters that double as weapons that eject possibly concussive bursts of high energy plasma. One could suggest building chemical rockets, but there are so many things wrong with that: the efficiency, the heat management, the power-to-weight ratio, fuel depletion rate. Of course, this isn\u2019t to say that alternative thrust methods don\u2019t come with their own challenges, because they most certainly do. Consider a propulsion scheme called VASIMR (VAriable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket). It works by heating a neutral gas propellant with radio waves until it becomes plasma, then accelerating it to breakneck speeds with a powerful magnetic field as it exits the nozzle, propelling its payload (a spaceship, some cargo, you get the idea) in the other direction, a la Newton\u2019s third law. Problem with this type of propulsion though, is that they pretty much do not work in atmosphere, so flying under bridges and over mountains isn\u2019t quite possible with that kind of thruster. Chemical rockets can do this without a hitch, but they do not last for long, given you have to lug the fuel around, while burning it. However, a possible workaround might involve ejecting small quantities of air (or plasma) at subluminal speeds, so that Newton\u2019s third law would allow thrust to be practical, although, at that level of speed, you\u2019d need a whole lot more than Newton\u2019s work to save you. Perhaps what Iron Man actually uses is some kind of chemical propulsion system that is somehow able to mine its fuel straight from the air at an alarming rate, without blowing the suit up in smithereens. That paradigm of propulsion would in fact enable the aerial acrobatics he routinely executes with seemingly no hitches; after all, he DOES leave a \u201csmoke\u201d trail in his wake. CYBERNETIC CONTROLAs far as one can tell, Tony\u2019s control of his suit is at least partly cybernetic, more than likely through his helmet. Cybernetic control has seen some major advances over the last few years, but it\u2019s still a far cry from being pin-point accurate, without requiring an invasive procedure. This is largely because the skull itself adds unpredictable noise to the signals that would be measured and recorded by an electroencephalograph, the input device to this cybernetic control system. As of right now, the amount of concentration required to use an EEG to say, flick a light bulb on or off, is far more than is needed to actually reach out and flick a switch. Scale up this problem, and it becomes obvious that the amount of concentration required to perform all the nuanced tasks that Tony Stark does while in the Iron Man suit is beyond herculean, further complicated by the fact that half the time, he\u2019s in immediate danger, making focus even harder to achieve. To fix this problem, if invasive procedures were off the table, non invasive EEGs would have to get astronomically better. Perhaps skull tissue would have to be scrutinized on an atomic level, have all its properties tested from materials science and electromagnetic perspectives, so that equations can be generated to better model the sorts of interference that can be expected from the skull barrier, thus improving the sensitivity and usefulness of noninvasive electroencephalograms. AUGMENTED REALITYAs of today, this one bit has actually been done more or less successfully. Tech giants in Washington and Silicon Valley have successfully pulled this off. My favorite example of this is the Microsoft HoloLens. Through lots of complicated methods, using extremely powerful (and proprietary) hardware, Microsoft released the first truly AR experience. Exactly how they did it, not a lot of people know, given it is proprietary technology. At least it\u2019s real though, meaning that these methods can be obtained with sufficient research. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEAlso known as JARVIS, Tony\u2019s robo-butler accompanied him almost everywhere, most noticeably in his suit, that is until he brought the bloke to life and that duty was relinquished to Friday, which is a whole other topic! To create something as unique and as powerful as JARVIS would be monumentally difficult, far surpassing the complexity of \u201cAI\u201d like Cortana (the real one, not the one in the video games) or Google Now. To do that requires answering once and for all, the question \u201cWhat is consciousness?\u201d. I know it sounds like a new-agey question, but it\u2019s actually a very profound question in the research fields related to cognition. To then come close to pulling off a feat of innovation such as this, one would have to innovate on so many levels, particularly in the field of computational neuroscience. This multidisciplinary field manages to require mathematics, physics, computer science, cognitive science, psychology, electrical engineering, and neuroscience. That\u2019s seven fields. Seven. One would have to be Rain Man on NZT48 and Speed to pull something like this off, in one lifetime. In summary, the sheer amount of work that\u2019d have to be done in order to fully realize technology like that, would take ALL of humanity several generations, and trillions of dollars to figure out. Or one unimaginably rich, young, and bored bloke, with a five digit IQ, and access to a LIMITLESS supply of NZT48. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I must go take my fingers to the spa. They\u2019re very sore. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am by no means a scientist or have any scientific credentials of any kind. I believe that all those who naysay the possibility of a real Iron Man suit should go suck a lemon. Nothing has ever been accomplished in the history of mankind by throwing up our hands and declaring that it cannot be done. Great achievements are accomplished by looking for solutions, and never giving up. Firstly, is this technology readily available now to function exactly as the iron man suits from the movies? No. Are these separate components plausible? Yes. Are they on the horizon? Some of them are. Others I cannot say, but a timeframe of 20 years does not seem unreasonable to me. JARVIS. He\u2019s an AI that basically runs the micro-functions of the suits, as best I can tell, as well as running the house, the workshop, interacting with Tony at a personal level, and taking care of a lot of the Stark Industries business. Neural networks have come a long way in recent years, and I feel they are a real contender for \u2018smart\u2019 AI. We already have Siri, Google Assistant, and Cortana (software) as portable forms of basic voice command AI, and The World's First Personal Robot is self-contained and able to develop pattern recognition to an extent. Protective exoskeleton. I\u2019m just talking about the ability to protect the wearer in this case, little more than powered armour. Believe it or not, this could be less than 2 year away thanks to the TALOS (uniform). Not looking too bad so far, are we? Power source. This is where a lot of people start raising their red flags. I\u2019ve looked around and this answer seems plausible to me. Ryan Carlyle's answer to What is the theory/concept behind the \"Miniature Arc Reactor\" built by Tony Stark? How did it work? Some of the science goes over my head, but what I do understand makes sense and is consistent with the physics that I already know. Granted, there are aspects here that are not currently possible, but the science theory seems sound, and we just need technology to catch up. Flight. This is a hard one. Even taking for granted the existence of a high-density power source, the methods of flight in the comics were apparently explained by using big words, but fall flat next to real science. It took some research, but I found Plasma actuator, Ionocraft, Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster, and Wingless Electromagnetic Air Vehicle, some of which have been studied since the 1960\u2019s. The last seems to be an evolution of the Ionocraft, and seems relatively plausible to provide significant lift for powered flight, given a high-density power source such as an arc reactor. Some of the methods here are able to function in a vacuum and others are unclear, so the WEAV system may or may not provide interstellar travel as portrayed in the comics. G-forces. Supposedly the acceleration in the suit would kill the pilot, and being hit by tank shells would turn the suit\u2019s occupant into paste from the kinetic force due to the relatively soft but fragile nature of the human body. Cars mitigate these problems by having crumple zones, not going into battlefields, and not being able to travel at supersonic speeds (usually). The suit as it appears in the movies uses CGI trickery to minimise volume, so it doesn\u2019t even have room for the weapons stored in it, let alone crumple zones. Thinking about the first movie, specifically the scene when Tony runs the second test of the flight components, the boots have little thruster jets giving of some kind of propellant that appear to help keep him balanced. It stands to reason that those small thrusters could be appropriated for mitigating the effect of g-forces during rapid acceleration and deceleration by spreading out the pressure across the pilot\u2019s body. Since controlling that would be quite fiddly for the pilot but is largely a simple process, JARVIS would likely take care of it. Additionally, given that JARVIS is brilliant and can detect incoming weapons, he could also use the thruster jets to dodge ballistic weapons that would impart lethal kinetic energy into the suit. In terms of what the propellant would actually be, compressed air could be one solution, but I\u2019d think that using small jet engines powered by electricity, or smaller versions of the propulsion systems used for flight would work just as well if not better, and require no stored fuel. Weapons. This is a little harder. Storing all the ammunition you need for those ballistic weapons would take up a lot of space and be quite taxing to move, and you\u2019ve got a massive energy cell already, right? Who needs ballistic weapons when you can use more precise energy weapons? We\u2019ve already established that the repulsors likely produce plasma, so ejecting that in high quantities would certainly cause a lot of damage, but I think might be ineffective over larger distances due to thermal absorption by air particles. If not then no worries! There\u2019s also the unibeam, which as mentioned in the resource for the arc reactor is probably gamma radiation, which I believe would cause damage at the levels shown in the comics and movies. The laser beam weapon that Tony uses in the second movie just before the final fight with Whiplash could also be quite effective. High-powered lasers are used all the time in industrial applications, so no problems there. However, whatever device projects the laser seems to burn out after a few seconds, so keeping spares on hand would likely be a necessity. For close combat, you\u2019ve always got fists and feet. For stunning or pacifying adversaries you could use a sonic or light-based weapon that overwhelms your targets, much like flash-bangs. And I suppose if you really wanted to carry some of those compact ballistic weapons, you could bulk out the armour a little in the necessary areas. So some of these aspects of the suit basically exist now, while others are likely a few years off. ",

            "answer_text": " Okay. If we are just speaking of an armored suit that augments the strength and weaponry of a person then we are extremely close. If we are speaking of something with all of the primary abilities of the Iron Man character such as flight, clean infinite power and his repulsor beams, that may never become a reality. The current version in the comic books is even more crazy than the movies, with a suit made entirely of nanites that can repair or replicate itself and any weaponry on the fly.. First I will break down the things we cannot do then I will treat you to some really awesome stuff we can do...  FlightWe just cannot have a flying suit like Iron Man's. Not exactly anyhow. The main reason for this is the tiny rocket engines and the repulsor beams. I go into quite a bit of detail about the flight systems of the suit as they are described in the comics and a bit about the technology as it was laid out generation by generation from Iron Man Mark I to VIII+ here... Ariel Williams's answer to How do Tony Stark's Iron Man suits generate lift for horizontal flight?   Repulsor BeamsOne of the key components of the Iron Man suit is it's repulsor beams and that is a kind of technology we may not have anything like for a very long time. The only logical explanation is they are some kind of graviton manipulation. This is so far out of our current technology that we cannot even begin to guess how it would be done if at all.  Arc ReactorIt is not entirely clear how the suit's reactor works. It is smaller than a soda can but can produce more power than the miniature nuclear reactor on a Virginia class nuclear submarine. It has something to do with zero point energy and a continuous self sustaining reaction that would appear to break most rules of thermodynamics that we know of. It could possibly be some type of cold fusion reaction but again we have no clue how to even begin doing this in such a small size. No reaction is 100% efficient so the waste heat alone from such a reactor would be enough to cook the person inside the suit. _____________________________________________________Okay so that was a letdown, what could we do? The answer is a lot, actually!  We could almost exactly copy the original Mark 1 prototype armor from the comics right now today or in the next few years.   The Mark 1 above is not very different from Raytheons XOS 2 powered armor suit below. Stronger than a human and it has heavier armor than a person could normally carry.  The video below shows how the enhanced strength from the exoskeleton allows a soldier to lift 200 pounds without any effort at all. A soldier can also carry a much heavier pack and armor. Lastly the suit reduces fatigue even for physical activities like pushups. The suit does all the work for him.  A prototype design concept for the future development, that can also be seen in the background of the video above.  Not to be outdone Lockheed Martin has their own powered suit called HULC.  It has less overall strength but still reportedly allows a soldier to carry a 200 lb load and it seems they have working units that are unteathered. No word on how much of that 200lb load is currently being devoted to batteries though.  PowerWhile nothing like an Arc Reactor, they expect a tethered version that would walk alongside a vehicle that carries a generator for the suit in 3 to 5 years. This would mostly be used to lift heavy materials in and out of vehicles for deployed soldiers. This could be very useful in allowing a very small team to rearm a vehicle or chopper in the field and to allow a small team to quickly unload bulk supplies and move on out of harms way. In 6 to 10 years they expect to be able to power the suit with its own internal power supply. The most limiting factor is battery technology but it is getting better. We would have trouble with finding a power source and would need to recharge frequently. This is actually okay because the Mark 1 had the exact same issue! The Mark one used \"transistors\" (capacitors they meant possibly?) to power the suit and allow it to be charged rapidly from any wall outlet. Unfortunately it ran out of juice very often. Still so far so good. You didn't expect us to start out with a Mark VIII dynamic nanite colony suit did you?  FlightAs I stated before we can't have flight like the Iron Man from the movies but the Mark 1 did not have that either. Supposedly it was able to make short jumps or bursts of flight using \"compressed air\". We have actually had designs similar to this for decades. The military designed a series of \"jump jets\" or \"rocket belts\" that used a highly concentrated mix of hydrogen peroxide and a catalyzing agent to create jets of high intensity steam that can allow a person to fly mostly vertically, which is just what the Mark 1 did! Some other models used liquid nitrogen instead. Either one can be deadly if the fuel tank ruptures. Dissolved by 90% pure hydrogen peroxide or frozen by liquid nitrogen is no way to go.   Okay, so that is obviously very cool but with a flight time measured in seconds and a world record of only 150 ft this will not do for a superhero or a soldier. Enter the Martin Technology JetPack.   In this video we see the device climb to 5000 feet and deploy an emergency parachute at 3000 ft. This was actually flown by remote control in a chaser helicopter with a dummy but that also shows how a navigation computer or assistant could help with flight in an emergency. The flight system is bulky but it could be attached to the XOS and then used to enter hostile territory. After you arrive you park it somewhere inconspicuous and then move in to deal out some Iron Man justice. Just don't forget where you parked it. Lastly if that was not enough for you flight enthusiasts whom want to truly soar like a superhero or jet as opposed to a tiny helicopter, there is a last option.  Yves \"Jetman\" Rossy has pioneered a wearable jet flight pack. It has the drawback that it is not powerful enough to reach flight altitude on its own but once in the air it can perform an impressive flight.  As daring innovators like these continue to create amazing devices it is only a matter of time before some type of human scale personal flight system is possible. Bonus...Now for the Navy we could go a different route for an Iron Man suit's propulsion.  Yes it does have a small 10 ft long chaser boat and does not fly very high but it could allow for some useful tactical advantages. This thing even runs on normal fuel. It could propel a Navy Iron Man underwater quietly and then allow him to burst up from the water's surface and dispense justice on some modern pirates. In conclusion... Yes, we could expect something very similar to Iron Man in the next 3-15 years if we are willing to settle for the Iron Man Mark I suit.  The number of ways in which such a device could change the battlefield or dangerous police and emergency rescue operations is almost too many to list. We could also have versions of these suits in use at factories and manufacturing plants around the world. We would no longer need a forklift or dolly for simple yet heavy or tiring jobs, we would become the forklift. The benefits to workers on assembly lines would also be enormous as workers would get fatigued much less often and injuries from strains would be very uncommon.  Eventually technology will allow these suits to work without the human at all but that is still a long ways off....  Or is it...    This answer as seen on Forbes.

            "answer_text": "Which one? The Mark 1 (Afghan edition) is probably possible today, given a generation leap in power supply density, that version is basically medieval armor with an exoskeleton and some weapons. The later versions with nanites and alien metals are complete black boxes so there is no point in talking about them. So let\u2019s discuss the Mark 2(end of first movie) version. Two technologies that are outside anything we can talk about in engineering terms, but are integral to the suit, are the ARC reactor and inertia management. The arc reactor has some insane power density which hardly bears even trying to quantify. The suit can super cruise, and assuming it only weighs 500 lbs(does not need special floors) and is as aerodynamic as an F22, it would need to produce the kind of energy associated with burning 26 gallons of av gas per minute, figure 894 killowatts/min before life support,AI, exoskeleton, inertial damping/repulsorbeams and so on. The inertia management portion is equally a handwaver. The suit routinely defies the first two laws of motion. We can only assume that there is some sort of field which permeates the suit, it\u2019s insides, and the immediate area which allows kinetic energy to be manipulated in such a way that Tony is not reduced to a protein slushy by going from mach 2 to zero in 2 seconds(and vice versa) and impacts from tank rounds. It is worth noting however that this level of inertia management could reduce or eliminate the need for energy when flying or moving heavy objects. Things we can talk about are armor, flight, exoskeleton, AI/interface, life support, and weapons. The armor is a generation or two beyond our current tech. A micro layered titanium and spidersilk with a diamond surface or some similar composite structure could begin to give the combination of hardness and toughness with lightweight that the Ironman suit shows. The exoskeleton is also a couple generations off, with the armor providing the framework, probably powered by electromuscles evolved from current on Electroactive polymers. Flight is another multi (tech)generational capability, although I don\u2019t believe ion motors will ever be effective inside the planets gravity well. I think Stark is using magneto-hydrodynamic arc jets; that is, air subjected to immensely powerful electrical arcs, reducing it to plasma, which is then forced backwards by powerful magnetic fields. In the realm of things we can talk about with mere advancements on existing tech the suit\u2019s life support system represents technology we understand and use in, for instance nuclear submarines and spacesuits, merely miniaturized and made automatic. Similarly, the suits in the first two movies use guns, rockets, etc which operate on understood principles, just without restrictions of propellant, warhead, or ammo capacity. The suit\u2019s AI seems mainly devoted to behind the scenes stuff such as managing flight dynamics, system monitoring and repair and so forth. The self-repair facilities are a decade or so out, but otherwise this is fairly easy stuff. The suit also has a great comm suite behind the scenes to allow Tony to stay in touch with Jarvis and Piper. The Head up display is also not out of our grasp, the bigger problem will be display management, what to show when and so on. ",

            "answer_text": "Well in all honesty, we are pretty far away\u2026 For a suit of this magnitude, you would need a few things: A steadily available, reliable, and rugged source of powerArmor that can either take a lot of hits or be easily and simply replaced on the fly and in dirty conditionsMotors that do not protrude, or are overly awkward, and won\u2019t hinder the user too much, should they fail or run out of power.On that note, also motors that are heavy duty and rugged enough they do not wear out.Features of an Iron Man suit (DISCLAIMER: I am not as well versed in the Marvel universe, and most of this information comes from the few Iron Man movies I have watched and the Marvel Wikis.) If we take some of the more obvious features, the suit flies and the wearer, if they are wearing implants or braces, the suit will put itself on the operator even when descending at rapid speeds, as seen here:  Extrapolating from this photo, the suit\u2019s rockets can guide it to the millimeter precision required for this delicate maneuver, as well as fly it in a less aerodynamic fashion. The suit also does not require wings to fly, which tells me it uses large amounts of energy to thrust the suit at high velocities, compensating for the lack of surface area. Now, also extrapolating from the movies, it appears the suit can take multiple hits from various weaponry, such as 5.56, 7.62, and even some laser weapons. In addition, the Iron Man suit has a variety of pods for lasers, rockets, etc. The suit also possesses an incredibly advanced form of Artificial Intelligence that not only performs the suit\u2019s functions, but can also receive orders from a distance, not sound like a robot, and respond to jokes and sarcasm. In addition, the suit appears to be completely sealed and have intermediate thermal protection, from the Avengers movie scene where Tony Stark guides the nuclear missile into a black hole. Since he did not freeze/boil instantly, and he could keep breathing, we can assume it is completely sealed and insulated to some extent. The suit\u2019s power is derived from some form of mystery fusion reactor technology that is small enough to sit on your chest. The Suit vs. Reality Realistically, even if one managed to manufacture a suit like that, you will not get a suit like that to fly. The amount of power needed to simultaneously power the systems, your HUD, your artificial muscles, perhaps your RPG/guided missile counters, and your weapons would far surpass any battery known to mankind, as of the date this was written. Speaking of power, it would be ridiculous to theorize how one would be able to shrink a nuclear reactor so it could be realistically portable and less cumbersome. A person might just be able to pull it off, but they would also most likely have to ditch any form of shielding and other safety equipment, so be prepared to have your life cut very short. In addition, think about it. You are carrying a nuclear reactor on your back! If it explodes, in all likelihood you, your battle buddies, and probably your defensive structures or equipment will also explode with you. And, if they have suits like this to, you all will most likely be obliterated. Its probably better than dying a slow, painful death from radiation sickness, though\u2026 Of course, you could always strap a SSTAR (Small, Sealed, Transportable Autonomous Reactor) and somehow strap it to your back. Here is an image with a comparison to a person\u2026  There is also the story of a teen who designed a home nuclear reactor. The story can be found here: US teen designs compact nuclear reactor Unfortunately, I cannot attest to the reliability and accuracy of the article. The kind of precision one needs for that kind of suit would all have to be guided by a computer that would have to be much more advanced than your standard desktop Compaq 8000 Elite. It would need to be able to process at a high rate, and maintain hundreds, if not thousands of protocols at the same time. At the same time, you would need to shrink a computer that has vast processing power into something small enough so it wouldnt impede on your efforts whilst not compromising on the effectiveness of the computer itself. Fascinating, isnt it? Artificial intelligence is pretty close to the mark. One of the most advanced forms of personal AI is Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, which comes with Windows 8. It is a rather impressive voice activated assistant, similar to Siri, and performs similar functions, though on a PC. However, it would have to be improved a little more to be able to take all the functions at once. New code would have to be added, such as code that tells when you need to replace something, and some code removed, such as the code that sets alarms for you. There are already full seal chemical protection suits out there, and it would be a simple matter to integrate one into an armored suit. For motors, currently there is no form of completely sideways, flat motor that is strong enough to pull of the gargantuan feats of strength portrayed in the movies. However, I read in a Popular Science magazine about a new leg for a robot called the Achilles. This robot combines strips of Kevlar with motors to create a realistic muscle system. When the motor pulls on a Kevlar strip, it also pulls an appendage up with it. Here is an image:  It is rather fascinating, and although it is meant for a robot, I can see it being modified for use in a suit. Armor If you plan on building a suit, you might as well put armor on it. Currently, armor includes a soft Kevlar material that is used in the plate carrier. This alone offers limited ballistic protection against light loads such as .22, 9mm, etc. but nothing as powerful as a rifle round. Then, there is the hard metal plate. This solid metal and ceramic plate is the actual plate that stops the more powerful rifle rounds. This is where the problem is. Since the actual plate will only take 3\u20134 hits before it cracks and is rendered useless, the armor is designed to be easily replaced. In fact, it is a relatively easy matter of sliding it out and putting a new plate in. This way, if you are hit a few times in the field and need a new plate, you can go to your HMMWV and get a new plate in a flash. Now, with an armored suit, the plates are all integrated into one suit. This means that if a plate is compromised, you would have to go all the way back to base to perform repairs (I have not watched all the Iron Man movies, and I would not know if you could. If so, please let me know). If you wished to seek an alternate, you could try to manufacture some kind of armor that lasts longer before it is compromised. But, good luck doing that without a miracle\u2026 Weapons Currently, there are no lasers small enough to fit on your wrist and cause the damage portrayed in the movie. Of course, you could get some of those electric lasers that can cut through metal, but if you did you would spend a long time sitting there, pointing your laser at a target, trying to get it to explode. As for rockets, there are small rockets. Estes Rockets Unfortunately, these small children\u2019s toys probably are not worth modifying into guided rockets with big explosions. In this case, it is probably more advisable to manufacture custom rockets for your suit. Modern attempts at making an Iron Man suit Of course, various militaries around the world have tried, and to some extents, failed or succeeded, in creating these suits. One of the most well known examples is the US Army Natick Soldier Center\u2019s Future Force Warrior. Here is several costumes portraying what the equipment could eventually look like:  Of course, this image was taken back in the late \u201990s, early 2000s. which explains the woodland M81 camo in the first picture.. The suit was projected to be available at about 2020. Here is an image of the final product:  This suit is designed to have full HUD support, chemically sealed, with a skin that changes color based on climate and other factors. It would also have an exoskeleton on it, not enough to be Iron Man, but enough to take a considerable load off a person. Although in late 2015 the project was mostly shelved and forgotten, its still a cool idea and a cool picture. In addition, although this project has been retired, there are other projects by the US military focused on exoskeletons. Here is a demonstration video:  And another video:  These videos showcase the US Army\u2019s attempts at an exoskeleton system. It is battery powered, though, and limited in that way. In summary, we are still very far away from a practical Iron Man suit. We would need to develop better armor, a better power source, and if you wanted your suit to fly, a better way of flying than just accelerating at high speeds. But, even as you read this article, the gentlemen at the Natick Soldier Center are probably working on an exoskeleton, a step forward toward the direction of an Iron Man suit. ",

            "answer_text": "The suit in the movie breaks a lot of rules. Is the suit theoretically possible? Let\u2019s ask ourselves a couple of questions. Question 1: How is a suit able to withstand so much damage and protect the pilot? In many scenes in the movie, you see Tony Stark get beat up to a pulp. He gets thrown through windows, onto concrete, in Civil War: Captain America a Vibranium shield punches through his armor. Iron Man\u2019s suit is made out of a composite of different materials. In the first movie, the MK-I suit was made up of titanium-nickel alloys. This is protect his breast from further damage. For the boosters on his feet, he would have to use a titanium-nickel alloy that would allow him to boost up to the air. Tony needs to have cushioning inside of his suit, am I right? For protection he would need some sort of padding and ballistic mesh. According to Scifi Stack Exchange, there must be some sort of antigravity built into the suit to reduce the damage done to the suit.[1] Also, the suit has Vibranium. It doesn\u2019t exist in our world. To create a suit like this would cost many millions of dollars. That\u2019s a luxury only a few governments in the world could afford. Question 2: How is the energy within the suit generated? It doesn\u2019t exist. How is the arc reactor able to generate power? In movie canon, the energy is generated through the arc reactor in Tony\u2019s chest. The original arc reactor was used to power Stark Industries. When Yinsen saved Tony\u2019s life he placed an arc reactor inside of Tony that not only saved his life but also powered his Iron Man suits. In Iron Man 2, the same arc reactor was poisoning Tony\u2019s body. He created a new arc reactor that was powered by a new element that he synthesized. Question 3: Would it be possible to recreate the Iron Man suit? And if so would it be possible to reproduce the suit en masse? \u2026if you have access to nanotech technology and millions of dollars to spend that you don\u2019t need.  In Iron Man 2 Justin Hammer tried to copy the Iron Man technology. Unfortunately for him this tech got hijacked by that main villain of the film and the robot suits were created to reign down terror at the Stark Expo. So\u2026the technology is pretty much impossible to copy. The only person who really has access to this tech is Tony Stark and he\u2019s a billionaire with infinite resources. Question 4: Super strength? In Infinity War, he has super powered lazer cannons.  In Iron Man 1, he has blasters on his hands.  How is energy channeled through the arms, chest, and feet? Movie magic.  The suit just isn\u2019t practical or possible. Footnotes[1] What is the armor in the RDJ Iron Man's outfit made of?",

            "answer_text": "Thinks for thanking of me, Jon Davis.  I\u2019m cherishing your A2A too long. This is awesome. \u2026anyway, I think we are fairly close to Mark I Iron Man.  As others have already mentioned, we already have the basic exoskeletons that can enhance (or at least ease) physical movement. Slap on some armored plating in such a way that\u2019s ergonomically friendly, and a few weapons (reloading them is going to be a pain, though), and I think that\u2019d be pretty close to what Tony Stark built in Afghanistan, if not better. Even durability wise, it\u2019s not that unrealistic, as Tony Stark still gets visibly buffeted by sustained rifle fire during his escape, and a machine gun nest manages to penetrate and damage part of the internal mechanisms. Come to think of it, even the \u201cperfected,\u201d gold-titanium alloy Mark III still sustained noticeable damage and scoring from small-arms, even though you probably wouldn\u2019t have thought much of it had Pepper not asked: Are those bullet holes?  As for how he survives the inertia of the impacts we see him withstand, that\u2019s a far more difficult problem. I think I\u2019ll use an alternate exoskeleton example to attempt to explain that.  Ignoring the fact that Halo takes place ~600 years in the future, MJOLNIR armor gets away with bone shattering impacts by way of an internal layer of \u201chydrostatic gel,\u201d which can selectively pressurize in response to impacts (such as falling from an aerial vehicle, or even from orbital reentries). I\u2019d assume that Iron Man\u2019s suit would have to have a similar system in place, possibly even a better one, given that Tony Stark doesn\u2019t have bones coated with an indestructible substance. I can\u2019t really say how viable that would be in real-life, or even if such a \u201cgel layer\u201d is possible to make (assuming that\u2019s how Iron Man survives doing half the things he does), but it is my understanding of physics that you (and the sealed container you\u2019re wearing) stand a far better chance of not getting crushed like a tin can if the pressure pushing from the inside of the suit is equal to the force pushing against it from the outside. Something like that would be necessary if we want a suit capable of withstanding tank shells and Thanos punches. JARVIS/FRIDAY aren\u2019t really essential parts of the suit, and I learned enough in my Computer Science studies that basic A.I. period, let alone those:  Is\u2026really hard, so I\u2019m skipping it. Onward to \u201ccore\u201d of the matter.  Again, as others have said: Nope. Another thing I think the first Iron Man movie nailed in terms of realism: no one but a comic book super genius can build a miniaturized \u201carc reactor\u201d the size of a lightbulb that can power a powered exoskeleton, plus all of its bells and whistles, let alone in a cave, with a box of scraps. You could conceivably make the suit itself work with an unlimited budget and materials: the range of motion, the durability factor, the integrated weapons, maybe even the repulsors (I mean, they do hurl Tony Stark across the room when he first tests them; there is recoil, so they don\u2019t completely break the Laws of Physics) and therefore the flight, but the power source for such a thing just\u2026well, the technology doesn\u2019t actually exist. It also doesn\u2019t help the fact that even the Palladium core was struggling with his more advanced suit; he needed to switch to Vibranium, a fictional metal, to make his future \u201cDrop of Blood\u201d-capable (is that why it\u2019s called the \u201cBleeding\u201d Edge?) armor and its predecessors possible. Most likely, I think if we ever did end up with a \u201creal\u201d Iron Man suit, it\u2019d look a whole lot more like the Iron Monger (which, ironically, was a refinement of the Mark I Iron Man suit):  It\u2019s got seatbelts (and presumably other safety features to prevent its occupant from going splat), there\u2019s more space to keep your computing circuitry with which to \u201cupload\u201d your A.I. friend, more places to hide your ordinance, there\u2019s more armor in general (which I\u2019d assume is a plus), and it would seemingly make more sense for it to be able to heave an SUV over its head than for a normal-sized, skin-tight Iron Man suit to do so. (I still would never expect it to fly, though) Probably the most important thing, there\u2019s also more space for a bigger, more conventional power source, but I still have no idea what it would take to get it running. TL; DR We are a long, long, long, LONG, LONNNGGG way from having a real Iron Man suit that isn\u2019t the Mark I minus the thrusters. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at what the state of the art is at the moment for suits Space suits, the minimum setting that allows you to survive in space.  Atmospheric diving suits, maintain the normal pressure while allowing you to go as deep as up to 700m in some suits.  Powered harnesses also known as \u2018exoskeletons\u2019 to demonstrate our current capacity for augmenting human strength.   Power source Let\u2019s explore the combustion engine options because they are simply far more practical than a battery. I mean, batteries and electric engines have their benefits but if I can get 600km out of a combustion engine that costs 1/3 of an electric power source that only gets me 150km, it\u2019s a clear cut case against the electric one. We do already have compact sized engines that produce a lot of force, for instance these Formula 1 engines:  Something of this order would give us a lot more power for a longer time than a mere battery pack or so. It\u2019s also in the size order that it still resembles a human if we make the engine block 30\u201370% smaller, we\u2019d still have a human suit of only ~1.5x overall dimensions of a human. I\u2019m sorry but we have to rule out nuclear reactors at this point for any attempt to have even remotely a humanoid suit. Not only are the reactors the size of a person they need a lot of support systems around them. Even with engines similar to F1 engines we\u2019ll still need huge angelic wings on the suit to radiate heat, which also is cool as hell so that\u2019s a good enough compensation for the lack of actual nuclear reactor.  Yes, fricking angel wings to radiate the heat away from the high performance engine. Because why would you ever have any other heat management solution for a humanoid power armor than ANGEL WINGS. Really. How close are we? Not very. These suits we have above, you can barely move at slow pace in them. They\u2019ve got the dynamism, balance and composure of a 12 months old baby. But for an Iron Man suit we\u2019d need the dynamism and kinetics of an Olympic athlete but with the force of a high performance race car - or a jet fighter. I\u2019d say space rocket but we\u2019re not there yet with our ability for sustained and practical energy release in miniature size. Because we\u2019re not there yet for the race car performance either. In other words we\u2019re looking to create this:  But this is where we are at:  We\u2019ll get there but our applied sciences need to do a lot of learning and maturing before we\u2019re quite there. Even on their own the components are not quite there yet and then they\u2019d need to be contained into a single integrated package, which makes it even harder. It\u2019s the difference of not just knowing how to joggle, throw darts or maintain a good balance while slightly drunk, it\u2019s about doing all those things while jumping through a burning ring. Some other notes I looked at other answers and people are worrying about things like inertia. I know several military pilots and while inertia is something they have to deal with it\u2019s definitely not a show stopper. I mean, you can\u2019t just take a fighter jet and fly it into the ground when you want to land. Yet they are quite fine with it and able to do aerial acrobatics, dancing around each other at 500kph speed, land on carrier decks in a storm etc. Today we have the most advantageous position for dealing with the avionics and inertia control - we have high speeds sensors and advanced avionics systems and automation. Meaning, one of the easiest parts about building the suit is to just integrate a modern cutting edge LIDAR system designed for robots and automated cars and integrate it with modern avionics suite. Thus we can allow the suit to automatically correct the input from the operator to maintain safe use as many modern jet fighters do - you can\u2019t fly them wrong because you\u2019re not really 1:1 flying them, the computer acts as your nanny! And a manual override mode can be included for those that really want to fly themselves into a wall. We can land tall and slender space rockets with these systems.  So, we\u2019re definitely getting there. But one thing. We can\u2019t make it look and behave exactly like a suit from a cartoon. It will look and behave differently just like real space rockets look and behave differently than the ones cartoons from the first half of 20th century or before. ",

            "answer_text": "There's plenty of room at the bottom. This single lecture by sir Richard Feynman , in which he put his hypothesis that tech can take things to a minute level, has inspired the modern day nanotechnology. Tony Stark's suit, after all, is by far it's best conjectural implementation.  The idea of actually building the suit is intriguing, tough and of course would cost a hefty sum of money. The jet engines, or the gas turbines which would provide the suit thrust for an upward flight are too expensive. Moreover we would be requiring not just one engine for the propulsion. Also, the coordination of the psuedosuit with the body movement may result in uncontrolled and violent actions. Because Newtonian laws are a constant reminder of the limitations of the human body.If anyhow, the suit works fine and you somehow reach the outer space, you are most likely to turn into a burnt Tortilla inside the suit during re-entry. With tremendous increase in your velocity due to gravity and also the increase in density of air, your body may feel like it has been put in a micro oven.Yes, heat shielding tiles can be used. But you need to spare around $1000 for each tile.Then comes my favorite part. The AI and the psuedosuit. The Google glasses may be of much help and be the Jarvis for your suit. If not all, some features like bone conduction transducer, the fantastic display screen, cloud storage and many other smart features can be encapsuled into the suit. (Make sure to have a good enough wake word, just like \u201c hey Jarvis!)However people have been putting constant efforts to build one of Marvel's finest superhero gadgets. A year ago or so, Richard Browning came up with a real and practical suit.  The suit has no such surreal features. But does quite the same work, when we are talking about human flight. It uses 5\u20136 mini jet engines, with the fuel stored in the backpack. It can fly upto a height of nearly 12000 feet with a speed of 32mph, costing around $445000. And, it weighs 27kgs. This is way lighter than the exosuit Hardiman (680kg) of course, whose ultimate purpose was to lift heavy weights only. But being built in the 60s, with not as much resources as available today, it has its own eminence. If not quite near, we humans aren't at far either, in engineering a real Ironman suit. Maybe, MAYBE, the coming years would witness a tremendous escalation of nanotech and AI and the engineers would build us a real and awe-inspiring iron man suit. Marvel would be jealous! Open to suggestions. Happy reading! ",

            "answer_text": "Of course I agree with all of the great, science oriented answers already collected here.But, since Iron Man is meant to be fun and even thinking through the proposition is fun and challenging, let me throw something else into the mix: Burkhard Heim. I have mentioned this odd, impressive, German scientist before. As a reminder, he was a young physics prodigy before WWII. During the war, he was made to work with explosives. During that time, an accident blew off his hands and left him mostly blind and deaf. Despite the setbacks (and 50+ operations) he finished his advanced degree and researched physics for the rest of his life, mostly doing mathematics in his head. His proposed Theory of Everything is both ahead of its time and controversial. He predicted the mass of several particles before they were known, but he also predicted 2 neutrinos that have been shown to not exist. He predicted that space too has a minimum unit, like matter and energy. If so, space is precisely addressable. His six (and 12) dimensional universe can allow forces to be converted into other forces, so electricity can become gravity, or antigravity and faster than light travel is possible. ---after work edit ---------- In a Heim-theory universe, Iron Man's suit could convert another force (like electricity) to forces that could negate the effects of acceleration, turning and stopping suddenly. The weight of the suit could be actively reduced with anti-gravity, allowing it to go fast on less energy. Repulsors and thrusters could use anti-gravity as well.   Energy density is still a big challenge, but we're getting better at it. Lithium-sulphur batteries are becoming available that have about 1200 mAh per gram. If we imagine Mr. Stark with 60 pounds of these petite batteries in his suit, he would have over 32 thousand amp hours on board - about as much as 360 RV batteries. The Solar One, solar powered airplane has 25 amp hours of battery capacity. Though it must be said that while his air resistance is small, his lift surfaces are not worth mentioning. There would also be a great deal of heat to dissipate, but if it could not be converted to a different form of energy, at least the suit is a big, metal heat sink. ",

The biggest one?  Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s going to take a LOT of damage. Body armor is good for maybe one or two rounds in real life. You\u2019re going to have to make something a lot more durable. When you get shot in real life, even wearing armor, you\u2019re going to be seriously hurt a lot of the time. You\u2019ll have bruises. I suppose you could do something with crumple zones like cars have, but that isn\u2019t going to be awesome. It\u2019s going to be beat to hell every time you go out and about to do battle.

It won\u2019t be Jarvis, but it will be able to manage some of your systems, give you status reports, identify things like targets, help you with flight, and give you directions to the nearest Starbucks.

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am by no means a scientist or have any scientific credentials of any kind.I believe that all those who naysay the possibility of a real Iron Man suit should go suck a lemon. Nothing has ever been accomplished in the history of mankind by throwing up our hands and declaring that it cannot be done. Great achievements are accomplished by looking for solutions, and never giving up.Firstly, is this technology readily available now to function exactly as the iron man suits from the movies? No. Are these separate components plausible? Yes. Are they on the horizon? Some of them are. Others I cannot say, but a timeframe of 20 years does not seem unreasonable to me. JARVIS. He\u2019s an AI that basically runs the micro-functions of the suits, as best I can tell, as well as running the house, the workshop, interacting with Tony at a personal level, and taking care of a lot of the Stark Industries business. Neural networks have come a long way in recent years, and I feel they are a real contender for \u2018smart\u2019 AI. We already have Siri, google assistant and Cortana(software) as portable forms of basic voice command AI, and The World\u2019s First Personal Robot is self-contained and able to develop pattern recognition to an extent. Protective exoskeleton. I\u2019m just talking about the ability to protect the wearer in this case, little more than powered armour. Believe it or not, this could be less than 2 year away thanks to the Talos(uniform). Not looking too bad so far, are we? Power source. This is where a lot of people start raising their red flags. I\u2019ve looked around and this answer seems plausible to me. Some of the science goes over my head, but what I do understand makes sense and is consistent with the physics that I already know. Granted, there are aspects here that are not currently possible, but the science theory seems sound, and we just need technology to catch up. Flight. This is a hard one. Even taking for granted the existence of a high-density power source, the methods of flight in the comics were apparently explained by using big words, but fall flat next to real science. It took some research, but I found some of which have been studied since the 1960\u2019s. The last seems to be an evolution of the Ionocraft, and seems relatively plausible to provide significant lift for powered flight, given a high-density power source such as an arc reactor. Some of the methods here are able to function in a vacuum and others are unclear, so the WEAV system may or may not provide interstellar travel as portrayed in the comics. G-forces. Supposedly the acceleration in the suit would kill the pilot, and being hit by tank shells would turn the suit\u2019s occupant into paste from the kinetic force due to the relatively soft but fragile nature of the human body. Cars mitigate these problems by having crumple zones, not going into battlefields, and not being able to travel at supersonic speeds (usually). The suit as it appears in the movies uses CGI trickery to minimise volume, so it doesn\u2019t even have room for the weapons stored in it, let alone crumple zones. Thinking about the first movie, specifically the scene when Tony runs the second test of the flight components, the boots have little thruster jets giving of some kind of propellant that appear to help keep him balanced. It stands to reason that those small thrusters could be appropriated for mitigating the effect of g-forces during rapid acceleration and deceleration by spreading out the pressure across the pilot\u2019s body. Since controlling that would be quite fiddly for the pilot but is largely a simple process, JARVIS would likely take care of it. Additionally, given that JARVIS is brilliant and can detect incoming weapons, he could also use the thruster jets to dodge ballistic weapons that would impart lethal kinetic energy into the suit. In terms of what the propellant would actually be, compressed air could be one solution, but I\u2019d think that using small jet engines powered by electricity, or smaller versions of the propulsion systems used for flight would work just as well if not better, and require no stored fuel. Weapons. This is a little harder. Storing all the ammunition you need for those ballistic weapons would take up a lot of space and be quite taxing to move, and you\u2019ve got a massive energy cell already, right? Who needs ballistic weapons when you can use more precise energy weapons? We\u2019ve already established that the repulsors likely produce plasma, so ejecting that in high quantities would certainly cause a lot of damage, but I think might be ineffective over larger distances due to thermal absorption by air particles. If not then no worries! There\u2019s also the unibeam, which as mentioned in the resource for the arc reactor is probably gamma radiation, which I believe would cause damage at the levels shown in the comics and movies. The laser beam weapon that Tony uses in the second movie just before the final fight with Whiplash could also be quite effective. High-powered lasers are used all the time in industrial applications, so no problems there. However, whatever device projects the laser seems to burn out after a few seconds, so keeping spares on hand would likely be a necessity. For close combat, you\u2019ve always got fists and feet. For stunning or pacifying adversaries you could use a sonic or light-based weapon that overwhelms your targets, much like flash-bangs. And I suppose if you really wanted to carry some of those compact ballistic weapons, you could bulk out the armour a little in the necessary areas. So, some of these aspects of the suit basically exist now, while others are likely a few years off. ",

            "answer_text": "That's the same as asking \"How realistic is superman under biological aspects??\"  Superman has two eyes, one nose, ten fingers, very realistic!  Ironman was designed to be realistic looking suit of technological armor  in the same way that Superman was designed to be a realistic looking muscular man.  But the moment you see an athletically built black haired man leap over a building in a single bound and perform feats of strength surpassing that of a locomotive is when he stops being 'realistic' and becomes a comic book superhero. That's what I'm getting at with Ironman, Ironman's armor looks convincingly like a protective suit of  armor and those artists have put a good amount of time in designing realistic looking flexible joints, that part is great. If Ironman's suit simply made him resilient to small arms fire and was strength enhancing enough to allow a healthy 6ft tall white American to jump like Michael Jordan, then yeah I could say \"that's a neat sci-fi power armor character with a realistic feel.\"   Can you believe a man can fly? But instead of something loosely grounded in the pretense of reality, Ironman can fly faster than the speed of sound and catch up to fighter jets with all of that awesome power contained in a frame slightly less bulky than a suit of rape prevention class aggressor padding.   This man is armored against human punches, his helmet is significantly thicker than Ironman's Ironman's armor can fly because there are glowing things on the bottom of his shoes that are about as thick as snowboarding boots. An actual fighter jet like the F-14 Tomcat is a massive 19 meter long vehicle with two jet engines each heavier than the biggest polar bears ever recorded, which consumes refined fossil fuel in a volume that outweighs a bull African elephant by thousands of kilograms.   And the inside of it is filled with many large, complicated things I don't know the function of ...while Ironman's flying is powered by an 'arc reactor' the size of an 8oz tin of tuna fish, installed inside of Tony Stark's rib cage where his heart should be.     Like this, but filled with infinite clean energy instead of delicious fish And that's fine because Ironman was never intended to be 'realistic' in the way Shirow landmates or Halo spartans were designed for. Instead Ironman was intended to exist in the same setting as the Norse god of thunder and a 3 meter tall invulnerable man that can pick up and throw 40 ton tanks, and be able to survive a fight with them.    Ironman is as realistic an example of power armor as the incredible Hulk is a realistic example of gamma ray exposure  With that being said, there are plenty of other works of fiction out there that take power armor design a lot more 'seriously'/'realistically' than marvel superheroes do. 'Short Peace' is a recently released collection of short films which has a segment where they show hard-scifi power armor troopers, I recommend you check it out:     It's based off 'Farewell to Weapons', a short story Katsuhiro Otomo did in 1977 and is considered one of the earliest examples of 'realistic' hard sci fi power armor.

With unlimited power, you can have a heavy suit with incredible strength and very inefficient thrusters and weapons.",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. Thanks for the A2A By the way. In one sense, no. We can\u2019t very efficiently create an exoskeleton that amplifies the dynamic strength of the wearer. Nor can we create, by the laws of physics as we understand them, a power source as efficient as the arc reactor (not to mention the spectacular amounts of heat we\u2019d need to dissipate). A helmet-mounted user interface that is as close to the eyes as we see in the movies also seems, as far as I know, not necessarily possible in an efficient way. So, power and optics out of the way\u2026 In another sense, yes. We can create full body armor that is very efficient in terms of weight and flexibility and ballistic protection (hope that makes sense; I use these terms intentionally vaguely\u2014 for the answer). We possess the materials in hand; it\u2019s just a matter of creativity at this point. As to weapons and power, remember this one thing: the soldier is not made by his weapons, or his suit, but by his mind. It\u2019s not about what\u2019s in your hands, but what\u2019s in your head; your brain is the most versatile and modular weapon in human history, and probably will continue to be so. It\u2019s a super computer with an untold storage capacity, and can accept weapon hardware and software of virtually all kinds (I trust you understand my metaphors here). Having said that, let me finish. We could create a suit of armor that provides some relatively efficient ballistic protection, without compromising weight and flexibility. Giving the soldier weapons isn\u2019t difficult at all. Power source: heart. As far as flight? Well, I think of chemical fuels. I believe some may underestimate the versatility of the field of chemistry sometimes. A chemical fuel could be modified to burn slower, but we\u2019d have to figure out the right nozzle pressures in order to create the necessary thrust. And then there\u2019s the controls. I\u2019m not going to divulge my own thoughts any further on this. Also, in terms of chemistry and basic propulsion physics, I\u2019m speaking very generally, so please don\u2019t lash out for \u201cincorrect usage\u201d in the comments. I\u2019m out. ",

            "answer_text": "If this is a question for which one really wants a thorough answer, then one must read the book Inventing Iron Man: The Possibility of a Human Machine by E. Paul Zehr. Zehr is a professor at the University of Victoria, in Canada. His work is focused on neural control of the human body and recovery for stroke and spinal cord injury patients, so he is very much interested in the future of technology that enables and enhances the human body. You might even see yours truly mentioned in the acknowledgements. Here\u2019s my Quora review of that book: Robert Frost's post in What is Robert Reading? But, in short, there are a few basic obstacles; because physics. Inertia. Inertia is defined as a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force. If we put a human in an Iron Man suit and that suit has the capability to experience great acceleration and deceleration, the problem is that the human body isn\u2019t designed to experience great acceleration and deceleration. The physics student in me cringes when I watch the scene in the first Iron Man film in which Tony escapes the terrorists in his prototype iron suit. He fires the thrusters that he had removed from the missiles and his suit is rocketed into the air and away from the terrorist camp. The suit arcs over the desert and then the thrusters fail and he falls to the ground. While his iron suit may have provided some protection, the problem is that after his suit hits the ground, his inner organs, including his brain would \u2013 thanks to inertia \u2013 continue traveling downwards at the same velocity with which he fell. His brain would smack into the side of his skull and be damaged if not destroyed. This, in a much less dramatic representation, is what we call a concussion. Even though American football players wear protective headgear, they experience many sudden stops from impacting the ground or another player and every time that happens, their brain bounces around inside their head, experiencing trauma. If this happens enough times, these football players experience cognitive decline and early death. We may never come up with a way for the human body to endure the abuses that the Iron Man suit must endure. Conservation of momentum. This is a topic of paramount importance to us at NASA. The rocket equation tells us that we have to account for three factors when designing a rocket. First, it must have sufficient energy to overcome the acceleration of gravity. Second, it must get that energy from its propellants. Third, Adding more propellant means adding more mass, which means more energy is required to overcome the acceleration of gravity. Tony Stark gets around this by waving his hands and saying \u201carc reactor\u201d. That arc reactor and its ability to store and deliver massive amounts of energy in a very small mass provides the suspension of belief that makes Iron Man possible. But, the arc reactor doesn\u2019t exist. In order for an Iron Man suit to either levitate above the ground, or fly, it must conserve momentum. It must eject a mass at a velocity such that its own mass will achieve some other velocity. A very heavy rocket slowly moves away from the Earth by expelling propellant at very high velocity. It takes a lot of propellant to do this, so we build rockets to have stages, so they can also shed the mass of propellant tanks once those tanks are empty. There are advances being made in this arena. Today, anyone can walk into a department or toy store and buy a drone that can do things that were not feasible fifteen years ago. This is possible because batteries have improved to store more energy in a smaller mass and miniaturization of motors and turbines have provided the ability to create significant thrust from a small device. But, there is a big technological gap between a small droid and a human-sized metal suit. If we ever produce a functional Iron Man, that first generation Iron Man will move quite slowly and have to stop to refuel or recharge very often. Those two expressions of Newton\u2019s laws of motion are the primary challenges. Other challenges are seeing fairly rapid advancement. Nano technology is making it easier to create machines that can do what an Iron Man suit needs to do, without making the suit so massive that it cannot be moved. Biomedical engineering advances are making it easier to create machines that can be controlled by reactions of the human body \u2013 essentially establishing links between the mind, reflexes, and machines. And artificial intelligence advances are making it easier to have machines handle the multitude of monitoring, calculations, and adjustments needed for such a suit to operate at acceptable paces and in complicated environments. Work is being done to facilitate the use of exoskeletons to enhance what a human can do and to protect them while they do it. But we\u2019ll have to have some revolutions in physics if we ever expect to see an Iron Man. ",

            "answer_text": "Iron man suit is nowhere near to be made in the foreseeable future. I given a lot thought about it especially while commuting .So, what will it take to create the iron man suit ? Let\u2019s dive in. The first Iron Man movie came out in 2008 and tony assembled the arc reactor and the primitive suit inside a cave in Afghanistan {that\u2019s like building a tank in my kitchen}. So this is the first iron suit . It\u2019s source of power is arc reactor (mystery tech) and has an exoskeleton that increases strength and provides shield against an offensive. Now , this can be achieved up to a level assuming we\u2019ve already got arc reactor and few people have already created exoskeleton . LG has done it.  For more info check out this video : LG\u2019s CLOi SuitBot makes exoskeleton suits more \u201chuman centric\u201d Now this is seems pretty much achievable in the current times. But the next suit that tony made is an engineering marvel. Functionalities are added that can\u2019t be achieved . But anything is possible if you are a billionaire ;). Let\u2019s see stark\u2019s next suit  This suit comes equipped with complete flying capabilities along with navigation tech. The thrusters are powered by the arc reactor and the reactor must be generating electric power which is used to power some kind of ion propulsion device as one can\u2019t see any fuel tanks in the sleek suit. Now ion propulsion is an experimental technology. NASA - Ion Propulsion Now coming to the navigation part the suit houses a flight system that analyses the environment and then provides required info regarding the flight (like in an fighter aircraft). The suit should have multiple cameras to send the data to both tony and the computer to analyse . This process should include significant amount of computing power that\u2019s not possible via a mobile computer , so the computer can\u2019t be housed inside the suit instead the suit should only consist of sensors ,weapons and a marvelous receiving and transmitting mechanism for data because latency can cause iron man his life. The only factor in tony\u2019s suit that i see can be achieved is the artificial intelligence assistant function as a lot is going on in this field . The suit also should have excellent computer vision technologies integrated that identifies paths , building and also identifies threats in real time and formulates the flight path. These are a few obstacles that you need to overcome and obviously you need to create the arc reactor first because that\u2019s what powers the machine. The next big inclusion to the suit is nanotechnology.  I have no clue about how this nano tech works but it does seem cool. This is the ultimate suit and i believe its very difficult to use this as this field is not yet developed enough to meet the stark standard , I like science fiction very much as it attracts people to science and engineering and science fiction is dream awaiting to be fulfilled . So not in the coming decades but maybe in the next century we might be able to achieve the ultimate iron man suit and that would be like great as people would be telling each other that this tech used to be in the science fiction comics and today its a reality just as we say today for mobile phone and other technologies.  Thanks for reading. ~D3v ",

            "answer_text": "The Iron Man suit sports a portable fusion generator. The current ITER system under development in France will weigh 23K tons and uses 100,000 kilometres of niobium-tin alloy for its field magnets. On earth, fusion reactors don\u2019t work via quantum tunneling a la the sun, but must overcome proton repulsion via the generation of super hot plasma. ITER is supposed to generate a temperature of 150M C, about 15 times the temperature of the sun\u2019s core. In the event the \u201cARC\u201d reactor breaches, Tony Stark would be instantaneously reduced to a plasma soup of his constituent atoms. Chances of a breach would always be high since no metal or physical container of any construction can resist temperatures of 150M C; I think our most heat resistant materials fail at about 2000 C, but I could be wrong about that. Nothing exists on earth that comes close to 1M C, never mind 150M C. I\u2019m also not sure how his \u201crepulsor\u201d rays work. Are they some sort of graviton projector? I\u2019m unclear how a super hot plasma generates gravitons; the sun doesn\u2019t seem to do this. And we\u2019re not sure if gravitons even exist. If they\u2019re a magnetic polarizer similar to an MRI, I\u2019d think that if the rays were powerful enough to polarize the protons in, say, a chunk of tin, anything magnetic close to the path of the ray would also be attracted to the beam and fillings, pacemakers, metals in tatoos would all be ripped out. So I guess the answer is we can\u2019t and are nowhere close. I also don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to be in his house when he was field testing his rig. Update: I just had to look this up. From 2016. +++ Researchers have discovered that tantalum carbide and hafnium carbide materials can withstand scorching temperatures of nearly 4000 degrees Celsius. +++ That still won\u2019t keep Tony cool in the event of an ARC breach. rick ",

            "answer_text": "It's likely that this question will be merged ANSWER: It is NOT possible to create the Iron Man Suit / armor while retaining al of its functions and the performance of the suit as depicted in the Marvel Studios films. It's possible to a build a cosmetically accurate and mechanical mobile suit that mimics most of the movements of the Iron Man armor. Advanced robotics and software driven gyroscopic tech has jumped by leaps and bounds. But this endeavor alone would take significant development time depending on its expected level of functionality and mobility. My biggest area of lessons outside of gaps listed below is reliability. Impact testing, especially with satellite communication radio and whatever repulsed electronics that's crammed into an extremely svelte package makes me need to see actual design and engineering schematics before I can comprehend the possibility of him taking a punch from Thor or a Lightning attack from his hammer. Arc Reactor- The first Iron Man was basically about his shady business partner fighting to obtain this technology. A near inexhaustible power supply that's 1/5 the size of a motorcycle battery is applications well beyond combat weaponry. If that tech existed today no hasoline vehicles would be permitted for sale by the year 2022.Assuming that repulse tech is available and scaled size, I think the it as a weapon and for flight will take long training period, despite the best gysroscopics and robotics software. But this aspect can be mastered as assuming the arc reactor is REALPROTECTION- This part extremely vague. How Iron Man can survive high altitude drops or sustain impact from Thor\u2019s Hammer, while War Machine can't even survive a fall is never explained. I do t begrudge Marvel a crack good theater with the near death of a close comrade (Captain America\u2019s fugitive friend leaves unharmed) I know that there is wiggle room for audiences\u2019 interpretation of the suits real padding m. He is an airborne combat fighter who has deflected projectiles but clearly cannot sustain impacts from falls. I would place Thor's hammer and strikes from the Hulk as variables that he never accounted for in the suit\u2019s occupant protection design.Weaponry. The weapons tech he has in the armor simply does not exist. He's had guided BULLETS. He used them in first Iron Man film, The Age of Ultron, yet he has developed no New Iron Man weapon apart from his Hulk Buster exo suite. He didn't use the same tech to use tranquilizers to apprehend his friend in Civil War.There is no explanation. As to how each piece of the Ironan armor can fly across the country at sonic speeds want has in Iron Man 3. Is there s mini arc reactor in each part and did he also manage to add additional flight repulsers to EVERY part from helmet to the boots on his feet?Final attachment assembly. One bad alignment when coming together\u2026 Stark is a genius and a master blacksmith, mechanical, nuclear physicist, astronautical engineer, software engineer specifically in guidance systems and artificial intelligence.In time, a suit can be built to fool people at close range and possibly grounded or with limited flight at a Theme Park attraction. We are decade away from an arc reactor and even then its technology will not be so easily deployed until its WMD ramifications are thoroughly vetted. But for now, cosmetics and some very good animimatronics gets peoplensome eye candy at Movie premiers ",

            "answer_text": "Hypothetically, if you didn't have to consider the cost of building it, and if it didn't matter whether it was actually practical to use at all, then with enough time and equipment you could probably put together something at least approximating a lot of the general concept behind the Iron Man suit of armor. Look at these things first... Future soldiers may be wearing 'Iron Man' suits Bionic arm gives hope for amputees How To Turn A Laser Into A Tractor Beam | MIT Technology Review How to Build a Miniature Version of the Navy's Electromagnetic Railgun Weapon Swiss man flies solo across Channel using jet pack      Think about merging all of these concepts together, and then read this article to further illustrate additional technologies to incorporate and how to streamline the whole concept... How Much Would It Cost To Build A Real Iron Man Suit? It would be bigger and bulkier, would have less energy-blasting capabilities, would be clunkier to fly, would lack a true sentient A.I. program to handle all the communications and activation of weapons systems etc, would lack the arc reactor to give it power and speed, and would cost a ridiculous amount of money, but in several years' time you could put together some semblance of a suit that achieves a lot of the same things as Iron Man. But compare what you'd have to the suit in the films -- do you think that all the stuff I've mentioned here really equates to that suit Tony Stark wears? Not really. Because the Iron Man suit is based on a level of science we haven't even really approached yet. Now, eventually? Sure, once we develop more advanced A.I. and put more money into energy weapons, and perfect pilot controls based on though and eye movement and voice, and miniaturize jet propulsion enough to make a flying suit streamlined and easy to control and faster, then you'll be able to get a lot closer to Iron Man's armor. This is probably, what, ten to twenty years down the road? Maybe longer, I don't know. But eventually, yes I think it will be technologically possible to achieve something close to the Iron Man superhero armor. ",

The whole \"flying\" in the air with nothing but a suit on. User interface -- estimate 5-10 years We're already getting there. Heads up displays have been used in military aircraft for some time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heads_up_display). These are being miniaturized too (e.g. Google's Project Glass: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111626127367496192147/posts). Speech recognitions like Siri and Google's Voice Actions are also developing well.  Exoskeletons -- estimate 10-15 years Work is already happening on so-called powered exoskeletons (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_exoskeleton). The main issue with these remains portable sources of power.  Human flying suit -- 30+ years  There is some work on jetpacks, e.g. here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpack but these are ridiculously unwieldy compared to Iron Man.  But, there are two problems with a human flying suit. The first one is power: where are you going to get a small, portable power supply that can support sustained flight at high speeds? It takes a lot of power to levitate a human. The second problem is control: How do you make it so that the human pilot can naturally control the flight? I estimated 30+ years for this one, because we'd either have to invent some high power density source (portable fusion?) and we'd have to see some pretty drastic improvements in adaptive control. ",

            "answer_text": "Helmet-mounted displayTony controls his Iron Man suit via a sophisticated helmet-mounted  display that is voice-activated. It could easily be compared to  helmet-mounted displays currently under development for fighter jets  like the F-35. Fighter pilots use these displays to guide their aircraft  the way Tony guides his suit. Last year, the companies developing F-35  HMDs announced they would be creating these helmets with a development budget of $54.1 million. ExoskeletonTony's suit is essentially an exoskeleton that gives Iron Man his super  strength and maneuverability. Several companies and labs, including  those at Raytheon and UC Berkeley, are developing exoskeletons like  Tony's that give the wearer additional strength. They are usually  designed for soldiers carrying heavy packs, or for disabled people as a  replacement for wheelchairs and canes. Possibly the closest to Tony's  suit is Raytheon's XOS exoskeleton, which allows the person wearing it to lift 200 lbs. as if they were nothing.Cost to develop one XOS exoskeleton: $10 million Portable nuclear power sourceTony's nuke heart can be compared to the energy source in the new  Martian rover Curiosity, a nuclear generator called a Multi-Mission  Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG),  which will power its large robotic body and lab for years with a small  nuclear power source. While the MMRTG with its 10 pounds of plutonium  dioxide is bigger than Tony's fist-sized heart, its components are  similar enough that we'll make the comparison.Cost of one MMRTG (according to NASA estimates): $36 million Jet packsConstructed inside Tony's boots are jets that allow him to fly and  hover. While jet packs don't work particularly well, we've seen a few  recent successes. Yves Rossy, pictured above, has actually piloted his  own jet pack across the English Channel. And there are a few companies  selling strap-on jet packs similar to equipment Tony has in his suit. In  fact, Jet Pack International will sell you a strap-on jet pack that could potentially be modified to fit inside Tony's boots.Cost of two jet packs from JetPack (one for each boot): $400,000 Wearable computersTony's suit is operated by wearable computers that are wired into each  body part and controlled from the HMD. Lucky for Tony, wearable  computers are pretty cheap. Basically you just take an awesome computer  and fit its components into cases that fit into your exoskeleton. Let's  assume he wants a few computers, some awesome antennae so he can store shit in the cloud, a few ARM processors, really good hard drives. And  let's have him run QNX because that's how Tony rolls. But other than  that we're just talking about a really kickass set of secure computers  with specialized cases. Sort of like the kinds of wearables that MIT  students (like the one above) have been developing for years.Estimated cost for wearable computers: $20,000 So, what's the final price tag? $100,420,000YES but it sure is gonna cost you a fortune to get your hands on one and of course there is a lot of research involved which will make it even more costlier.

            "answer_text": "Not to the same quality of the build that Tony Stark made it no. The micro electronics, power source and control mechanisms are all far higher technology than we current have available to the general population. If you have ever tried walking around in a suit of armour you will appreciate how big and bulky it is and how little protection it gives you. Iron Man is covered in various futuristic alloys, which give him protection from various projectiles and energy attacks with the thinnest of metal coatings. This is simply impossible with today\u2019s materials and defence companies would clamour to get a piece of that kind of technology. However weight problems aside the least possible of the Iron Man suit\u2019s capabilities lie in the laser beams and propulsion areas. Lasers of the power that the Iron Man suit generates have to have huge capacitors and energy sources which just don\u2019t exist on that scale. The best you can hope for at the scale you would expect to see is a laser pen type device.  The propulsion technology is also just as far fetched as it doesn\u2019t scale down small enough to fit inside little neat alcoves in a metal suit. As with the lasers you either need extremely large power packs or you end up with less than ideal results.  So whilst you maybe able to fabricate something with the working parts suitable to fit into relatively comfortably, all of the stuff that makes Iron Man a fun and dynamic hero i.e. all his kooky James Bond like gadgets are just not possible.

            "answer_text": "No, and for some reasons not mention so far in the other excellent answers to this question:  Iron Man's suit has no flight control surfaces beyond his speed brakes - Iron Man is shown repeatedly making complex aerial moves which should not be possible considering that he has no lifting surfaces, nor ailerons, flaps or a rudders. At best, Iron Man should be able to propel himself through the air like a missile or a rocket; but he should have limited or control when he does.The suit's wearer is apparently not subjected to any G-forces - Iron Man is shown making multiple turns, banks and accelerations that should have caused Stark to black out temporarily due to the Gs (gravity forces) that they would pull. This never happens.The near-instantaneous connection between the suit and Jarvis - Regardless of where the suit is at, the connection between it and Jarvis is in real time, with no delay. Either Jarvis is onboard (which the movie never states) or Stark has invented instantaneous communication and is wasting time building weapons when that technology alone would make multiples of billions.The surface of the suit seems to be composed of some substance which allows it to appear to be \"smooth\" and yet still be able to generate friction - The way the suit appears, Iron Man should be slipping and sliding  every time he takes a step or attempts to lift himself up. Yet the suit apparently possesses properties  that don't allow this to occur even those properties are never shown, nor discussed.The flying \"assembly\" process - How the various pieces of Iron Man's armor are able to fly great distances and then correctly assemble themselves is never explained - While Tony Stark is a genius, this type of process seems like it would have taken decades to perfect. How the pieces fly to an exact spot (again without control surface) , stop when they are supposed to do so and assemble themselves correctly is never shown how and why it would. This is another invention of Stark's that would be worth billions at which yet he seemingly has declined to sell. While Iron Man and Avengers franchises are great films to watch, nearly everything about Iron Man is technologically improbable both now, and for the foreseeable future. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is totally possible to create a Real looking Iron Man Suit Costume nowadays. Like you can see in http://TheIronSuit.com.  But I suppose you are talking about the suit like a weapon and all the features. I guess, we are very far away from that, maybe in 100 years. The most important thing in the Iron Man suit is the arc reactor, because it is the battery of the whole suit and in the comics or in the movie this arc reactor is the same that have a complete nuclear plant in something with the size of an apple. Even the governments with all the resources they invest in researching they are still not able to control the nuclear power at 100% and of course they are not able to compact it so much. And there is not other energy that we could use able to give enough power to a suit to make a man fly so easily. Besides the aerodynamics of the suit is a very complicated topic since there is nothing in real life that could show us that we are able to control our body in the way we see it on the movie.  But if we are still alive in 100 years, I am pretty sure we will be very close to do it. In the meantime, you can check this real iron man suit in the video below. If we were able to use nuclear power instead of batteries, we would be able to see this suit to do the same things than in the comics.   ",

            "answer_text": "Exoskeletons have been one of those future technologies that every advancement brings us halfway to the finish line.  Don't get me wrong, I think we're going to get them soon, but they might not be as fun and functional as the Iron Man suits.   A couple of snags so far: One is the control scheme.  You move your arm and then stop, but the suit-arm might keep going, potentially causing damage to your muscles and ligaments.  Tactile feedback would not be a good way to go.  Reading neural impulses would make an iron man suit much more practical, and also much more easily navigable.  There's a lot of functions that an iron man suit  Also, there's some Composites work that needs to be done.  To be plausible, the Iron Man suit needs to have stellar performance in terms of cooling and durability.  A gold-titanium alloy, like in the movie, produces a very hard and very strong metal, but it is unfortunately very brittle. Going in detail beyond the movie, the gold-titanium alloy is an ornate 3-D weave on the microscopic level.  I don't know much about composites, but if that's a plausible solution we don't have the technology to do that yet.   The answer might be a suit woven from spider silk.  Spider silk has the tensile strength of steel, is very ductile, can withstand temperatures from \u221240\u00b0C and up to 220\u00b0C, and is also hella expensive.   You could probably employ the entire population of some third world country, give each of them ten Golden Orb spiders apiece, and it would take them a couple years to harvest enough to make an entire suit thick enough for action.  Of course, not all of the exoskeleton's parts have to be the same material.  You could have different parts pure spider silk, different parts metal coated in thick spider silk, and some metal parts.  (I wish I weren't such a major arachnophobe-- spider farming is an excellent way to make money, and you supposedly can do it while watching TV!) And then of course, there's the Power Source.  You might have to settle for a battery-powered Iron Man, sacrificing either battery life or power, until fusion or arc reactors come along. ",

The key driver isn't anything as exciting as saving the world from nefarious villains but an ageing population and a decrease in able-bodied manual laborers.  I've attached a couple of pics below to give you an idea of how far advanced development is. First pic is from Cyberdyne, second from Tsukuba University. In Ironman terms, this is version 0.1, i.e. powered limbs. These power-assisted limbs can enable the physically impaired (aged, disabled, injured etc). No flying capabilities yet but you can see it's only a few steps away!   The second pic is a more advanced project but still a while away from commercial application. Power assisted limbs show an average build male able to life 30 kg (60 lbs) of ballast with ease. Starting to look a little more like Ironman for you?   As to where we go from here, the money's on military, industrial and healthcare applications to develop these exo suits within the next 5-10 years. This is Dr Yoshikyuki Sankai, founder Cyberdyne Inc with his HAL suit. Keep an eye out on him because he might just be Japan's answer to Tony Stark.   ",

One of the biggest problems is power generation that is small and light enough to be mobile but that still meets the power generation for a reasonable length of time (we don't have a magical arc reactor). The armored power is definitely plausible as well, although hard armor definitely has it's downsides. Composite armor and liquid armor that hardens on relative to the kinetic energy directed at it are much better for the average soldier.  Flying isn't something that will likely ever happen. You'd have to dial the power requirements up exponetially and of course all that fuel would weigh something too. By the time it became reasonable you'd have a flying vehicle that you ride in rather than just a suit. So not really plausible. In addition to that the g-forces that Tony experiences would kill or injure him pretty severely.  The reactors, which are his main source of power, propulsion, and offensive weaponry, are the part that is most implausible. It works like a rocket but without the fuel. I guess it just magically generates matter to expel and create thrust? In addition. the reason energy weapons are difficult in an atmosphere is the atmosphere is very difficult to push through. We use heavy materials with a lot of power behind them to push through them. Our energy weapons require dynamic lenses to go any distance without the atmosphere changing them. Laser weapons would possibly work in space, but on earth they'd have a hard time.  So yes, we'll likely see some kind of mechanized soldier soon. However, he won't fly or use energy weapons. It will still be super awesome though. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all guys its not my answer. \"Okay. If we are just speaking of an armored suit that augments the strength and weaponry of a person then we are extremely close. If we are speaking of something with all of the primary abilities of the Iron Man character such as flight, clean infinite power and his repulsor beams, that may never become a reality. The current version in the comic books is even more crazy than the movies, with a suit made entirely of nanites that can repair or replicate itself and any weaponry on the fly.. First I will break down the things we cannot do then I will treat you to some really awesome stuff we can do... FlightWe just cannot have a flying suit like Iron Man's. Not exactly anyhow. The main reason for this is the tiny rocket engines and the repulsor beams. I go into quite a bit of detail about the flight systems of the suit as they are described in the comics and a bit about the technology as it was laid out generation by generation from Iron Man Mark I to VIII+ here... Ariel Williams's answer to How do Tony Stark's Iron Man suits generate lift for horizontal flight?  Repulsor BeamsOne of the key components of the Iron Man suit is it's repulsor beams and that is a kind of technology we may not have anything like for a very long time. The only logical explanation is they are some kind of graviton manipulation. This is so far out of our current technology that we cannot even begin to guess how it would be done if at all. Arc ReactorIt is not entirely clear how the suit's reactor works. It is smaller than a soda can but can produce more power than the miniature nuclear reactor on a Virginia class nuclear submarine. It has something to do with zero point energy and a continuous self sustaining reaction that would appear to break most rules of thermodynamics that we know of. It could possibly be some type of cold fusion reaction but again we have no clue how to even begin doing this in such a small size. No reaction is 100% efficient so the waste heat alone from such a reactor would be enough to cook the person inside the suit. _________________________ _________________________ ___ Okay so that was a letdown, what could we do? The answer is a lot, actually!  We could almost exactly copy the original Mark 1 prototype armor from the comics right now today or in the next few years.  The Mark 1 above is not very different from Raytheons XOS 2 powered armor suit below. Stronger than a human and it has heavier armor than a person could normally carry.  The video below shows how the enhanced strength from the exoskeleton allows a soldier to lift 200 pounds without any effort at all. A soldier can also carry a much heavier pack and armor. Lastly the suit reduces fatigue even for physical activities like pushups. The suit does all the work for him. A prototype design concept for the future development, that can also be seen in the background of the video above.  Not to be outdone Lockheed Martin has their own powered suit called HULC. It has less overall strength but still reportedly allows a soldier to carry a 200 lb load and it seems they have working units that are unteathered. No word on how much of that 200lb load is currently being devoted to batteries though. PowerWhile nothing like an Arc Reactor, they expect a tethered version that would walk alongside a vehicle that carries a generator for the suit in 3 to 5 years. This would mostly be used to lift heavy materials in and out of vehicles for deployed soldiers. This could be very useful in allowing a very small team to rearm a vehicle or chopper in the field and to allow a small team to quickly unload bulk supplies and move on out of harms way. In 6 to 10 years they expect to be able to power the suit with its own internal power supply. The most limiting factor is battery technology but it is getting better. We would have trouble with finding a power source and would need to recharge frequently. This is actually okay because the Mark 1 had the exact same issue! The Mark one used \"transistors\" (capacitors they meant possibly?) to power the suit and allow it to be charged rapidly from any wall outlet. Unfortunately it ran out of juice very often. Still so far so good. You didn't expect us to start out with a Mark VIII dynamic nanite colony suit did you? FlightAs I stated before we can't have flight like the Iron Man from the movies but the Mark 1 did not have that either. Supposedly it was able to make short jumps or bursts of flight using \"compressed air\". We have actually had designs similar to this for decades. The military designed a series of \"jump jets\" or \"rocket belts\" that used a highly concentrated mix of hydrogen peroxide and a catalyzing agent to create jets of high intensity steam that can allow a person to fly mostly vertically, which is just what the Mark 1 did! Some other models used liquid nitrogen instead. Either one can be deadly if the fuel tank ruptures. Dissolved by 90% pure hydrogen peroxide or frozen by liquid nitrogen is no way to go. Okay, so that is obviously very cool but with a flight time measured in seconds and a world record of only 150 ft this will not do for a superhero or a soldier. Enter the Martin Technology JetPack.  In this video we see the device climb to 5000 feet and deploy an emergency parachute at 3000 ft. This was actually flown by remote control in a chaser helicopter with a dummy but that also shows how a navigation computer or assistant could help with flight in an emergency. The flight system is bulky but it could be attached to the XOS and then used to enter hostile territory. After you arrive you park it somewhere inconspicuous and then move in to deal out some Iron Man justice. Just don't forget where you parked it. Lastly if that was not enough for you flight enthusiasts whom want to truly soar like a superhero or jet as opposed to a tiny helicopter, there is a last option. Yves \"Jetman\" Rossy has pioneered a wearable jet flight pack. It has the drawback that it is not powerful enough to reach flight altitude on its own but once in the air it can perform an impressive flight.  As daring innovators like these continue to create amazing devices it is only a matter of time before some type of human scale personal flight system is possible. Bonus... Now for the Navy we could go a different route for an Iron Man suit's propulsion. Yes it does have a small 10 ft long chaser boat and does not fly very high but it could allow for some useful tactical advantages. This thing even runs on normal fuel. It could propel a Navy Iron Man underwater quietly and then allow him to burst up from the water's surface and dispense justice on some modern pirates. In conclusion... Yes, we could expect something very similar to Iron Man in the next 3-15 years if we are willing to settle for the Iron Man Mark I suit.  The number of ways in which such a device could change the battlefield or dangerous police and emergency rescue operations is almost too many to list. We could also have versions of these suits in use at factories and manufacturing plants around the world. We would no longer need a forklift or dolly for simple yet heavy or tiring jobs, we would become the forklift. The benefits to workers on assembly lines would also be enormous as workers would get fatigued much less often and injuries from strains would be very uncommon.  Eventually technology will allow these suits to work without the human at all but that is still a long ways off....  Or is it... This answer as seen on Forbes.

The primary issue isn\u2019t materials as I am sure we will eventually develop the super light alloys it would require. The issue would be power supply and output. The suit would need to be operated by some kind of electromagnetic system in order to avoid using pistons of any sort and there are physical limitations on how much electricity an element can store or transfer, meaning even with advanced future alloys the laws of physics would still get in the way.  Iron Monger however is much more realistic and probably will be feasible sometime in the future.   As you can see it has multiple exposed pistons and is basically just a bipedal robot with a cockpit. This allows for the necessary space to have all the components required for powering and moving the \u201csuit\u201d. ",

First off flight is so crazy its rediculous. Were talkin a mini reactor inside the suit plus mini jets which is just crazy. Straight up insane. Clockwork insanity pretty much. Secondly the big blasts and booms... i shouldnt be given it away but cmon whos gonna read this and actually believe it, is all about magic. Fire blasts, gun blasts, water efects, smoke effects, plus awesome lighting... and you got yourself a badass laser blast and what not. As far as the suit goes... its really all just a replica of a knights suit. So... yeah not much more to say there huh.  ",

There's simply nothing out there that can power an exoskeleton like suit for long, at least not long enough to be practical.  And such a technology is not on the horizon. And what's worse is that there's no technology on the horizon that has that kind of power capacity.  Walking is just too energy inefficient, especially in something as large as a human to be practical for our current battery technology. Sure, you can try to use a very large lithium polymer battery, but where would you put it?  If you put in the torso, you will exacerbate the problem that a lot of these designs have with being top heavy and hard to balance on 2 legs.  If you place them at the legs themselves, you get better balance, but the design is even more energy inefficient. The only practical design would be to cut the human out of the equation and replace it with a 4 legged design that can house a large battery without running into balance issues:  But even with this design, the Big Dog, the major issue is still battery life.

He can be out of the suit and the suit can still be as normal as human  The suit can increase its size to defeat any heavy beast.   The arm shooters he uses can be put in his wrist watch.

The thrusters in the suit are so powerful and produce thrust as that of a rocket and yet the suit doesn't heat up. When he shoots with his arm blasters he won't go even an inch back as the recoil energy is stored up in the suit. It consists of an artificial consciousness , so he don't need to work on every single part of the suit . Finally, its brain control enabled .

            "answer_text": " Sooner an army of Iron Man would be fighting for you to protect you and keep you safe . Yes JARVIS and Tony Stark\u2019s high-tech armor is coming to existence ! The Technology and idea depicted in the marvel franchise fiction movie Iron Man starring Robert Downy Junior is going to turn into reality soon. Get latest updates straight to your inbox. We hate spam as much as you do! The U.S. Army is working on a real super suit, which people have likened in the movie Iron Man. Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit is made to better protect soldiers on the front lines. It is predicted that the suit will be ready till 2018.The first suit would be fully weaponized and bulletproof. According to TechTimes, Iron Man suit may go beyond fictional comic books, saving the day in real life.This can happen till August 2018. Though the soldiers cannot fly wearing the suit but it is meant for Special Operations Forces and it it does repel flames and ammunition. In an announcement the Army said that it hopes the technology that is being developed for the suit can be used to create even better soldier prosthetic who get wounded in the line of duty in addition to protecting soldiers. Testing of prototypes will be done till June.   For those who lead the army in a mission -TALOS, or Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, is a battery-powered robotic exoskeleton designed to protect the lives of soldiers .The idea initially came in the mind of Bill McRaven when a U.S. soldier under his command died during war in Afghanistan. He vowed never to let such a tragedy happen to one of them again. TALOS is an armor which is in liquid form and that can solidify when it\u2019s hit by a bullet, which is more technologically advanced,as compared to Iron Man\u2019s suit, but it won\u2019t have flying capabilities or a built-in JARVIS, although it has in-helmet technologies that improve visibility and provide better connection with the rest of the army members. A chemical engineering professor from the University of Delaware Norman Wagner applied nanotechnology produced this adaptive liquid material. \u201cThese particles organize themselves quickly, locally in a way that they can\u2019t flow anymore and they become like a solid,\u201dWagner explained the technology to NPR.  Via TALOS is fitted with built-in sensors that monitor the heart rate , body temperature, wearer\u2019s health, just like Stark\u2019s suit .The suit is still under development and lots of modifications have to be done. The head U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, volunteered the project and hopes to have it completed for the U.S. Army as soon as possible to give each soldier \u201cthe advantage when he is most vulnerable.\u201d So , just the upcoming Iron Man movies is awaited , in the near future get ready for an Iron Man suit too!!

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. Iron man is a superhero story, not a \u201cproper\u201d science fiction story. So while the Iron Man suit has it\u2019s roots in real science, it works WAY better than it should. Powered exoskeletons are a technology we are developing right now. But they\u2019re slow and bulky. Armored exoskeletons are also a thing. But you run into the same problem. They\u2019re also not very economic. There\u2019s not much reason to put tank armor on your infantry. The arc reactor seems to be some sort of cold fusion. This has been a holy grail of sorts among physicists for decades. But little progress has been made on it, if only because the public is against such things. Jarvis is a souped up version of Alexa. I\u2019ll let you be the judge on how helpful voice recognition coupled to rudimentary AI is. The repulsors are a device that creates thrust from electricity while creating minimal heat. These are pure fiction, unfortunately. Having a man fly could be done if you solve the problems with energy consumption and heat dissipation. But he wouldn\u2019t be very aerodynamic. And the g forces Iron Man endures would kill him in real life. Telepresence is a real thing, but it\u2019s still in its infancy. So at the end of the day most of the technology that goes into the Iron Man suit is real technology. But miniaturizing it, putting it all together, and having it run as efficiently as it does in the movies is very unrealistic. And that\u2019s before all the nanotechnology bullshit he does in the latest movie. The MKI suit from the real movie is probably as good as we could get with real world technology. A slow, heavy bipedal tank. More or less useless in real world military applications. But very scary. The fall he took would still kill him though. ",

This cannot ever happen.  While a metal suit might block penetrating bullets or enhance his strength to move things. It cannot protect against rapid acceleration.  Put another way, being in a metal elevator won't protect you if the lift falls down the shaft. No matter how strongly the elevator is constructed.  A well-designed car protects us from impact by progressively crumpling to reduce the velocity.  The suit appears roughly 2-4 inches thick. There are no crumple zones.  So while a rigid suit might comfortably survive the impact, the soft swishy meat-body inside would be reduced to human hamburger.  EDITAlthough an artificially-intelligent, strength enhancing, impact nullifying, weapon platform, flying suit is impossible ... nonetheless the video below shows something which is real, and is pretty fricking cool. Do check it out. Sometimes reality puts Industrial Light and Magic to shame.    ",

Now, if you mean a mechanized suit that enhances a soldiers strength, allowing them to lift heavy loads, and carry more weapons and armor than they could otherwise, then we're already in the prototype phase.  Problem is, those prototypes generally have extension cords, which makes them a bit impractical in combat.  We simply don't have a compact way to generate or store the amount of power needed to run such a suit.  Absent a miniaturized arc reactor (which is currently pure science fiction), It's hard to even imagine a way to do it. There are a number of additional parts of the suit that are far beyond out capability (flight, implausible resistance to weapons, reliable automatic targeting), but all of that's  irrelevant if you can't even power the thing.

Though not quite the real Iron Man suit, an Indian student managed to create a similar one. Indian student builds real-life walking Iron Man suit -- for just $750 It cannot fly or do anything too fancy but it definitely is a good start. The video below shows how the enhanced strength from the exoskeleton allows a soldier to lift 200 pounds without any effort at all. A soldier can also carry a much heavier pack and armor. Lastly, the suit reduces fatigue even for physical activities like pushups. The suit does all the work for him.  Lockheed Martin has their own powered suit called HULC shown below.  DARPA Tests Battery-Powered Exoskeletons on Real Soldiers To last longer on the battlefield and to prevent fatigue, you need suits that run on power sources that can last a long time and DARPA seems to have found such a solution. 19 Military Exoskeletons into 5 Categories is a good example of powered exoskeletons in the current scenario. Immense applications in the future such as Mind-Controlled Robot Suits Help the Paralyzed Move Again It won\u2019t be too long before we really have a working model based on solving issues such as flight and repulsor capability and also long lasting power sources such as an arc reactor.

In CG it is possible to make different objects take up the same space or crush down in size. In real life pop-up shoulder guns have to have space to pop up from, thrusters in the palms of the suit would prevent the hands from closing, etc. A combat-capable exosuit is certainly possible (a feasible power supply being the main problem), and will become more so over time, but the iron man suit is an ideal, some eventual reality will necessarily turn out quite differently. The iron man suit is a creation of artists who admire engineering. A real suit would be a creation of engineering with some degree of artistry. Much of the early imaginings of SF and comics come from artists, and as such we tend to have imagined futures which are unusually aesthetic in comparison to reality. A 1950's ideal of a space shuttle was sleek and deco, the actual space shuttle was much more practical, and so on.  Sometimes you get an engineering result which is also artistically inspiring, such as VirginGalactic's spaceship2... That's always fun. ",

Google just released a feature of the Google Assistant which allows Google Assistant to book appointments with salons, restaurants etc for you. What is so great about it? Google assistant can now personally call the salon and talk with a human like voice and carry out the conversation required to book a reservation for a table. All this without raising any suspicion that the other person is talking to a robot. I was surprised that how well the AI was able to mimic the nuances in the human voice. If I was at the other end of the call, there is no way I would have said Hey! That's a robot!. It's that good. While the scope of this may be confined as of now but this now opens a realm of different endless possibilities. JARVIS/Friday like AI will be very much part of our reality in the coming years. I wrote a entire article about the Iron Man Suit possibilities in real life, you can check it out here. https://teamrohans.com/iron-man-real-life/ ",

The problem is that it is impossible for the suit to protect its pilot from rapid acceleration and deceleration. On account of Newton\u2019s second law F=m\u22c5a, you simply cannot accelerate or decelerate a human body rapidly without exerting a large force on it. Imagine wearing the Iron Man suit and getting smashed into a wall by the big bad. Seems like you could survive the impact, no? With that suit being so rock solid and all. Now imagine getting smashed into that wall with the same amount of force, but with no suit on whatsoever. That\u2019s how dead you would be. Because your body gets to endure the same amount of force in either case. (Okay, yes, the suit would provide protection by spreading the impact over your entire body, so you won\u2019t get your neck snapped or some soft tissue pierced. And it may soften the blow a little bit by shock dampeners, which distribute the deceleration over a slightly longer timeframe. But that will only make a difference for relatively mild impacts. The big ones will turn your innards to jelly, inside that suit.) ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest problem with a real Iron Man suit is that it would kill it's pilot. If you try to use the thing like a vehicle, running as fast as a car, or flying like a plane, the changes in inertia will turn your soft squishy body into pulp. For example, let's say you try to run as fast as a car. That means your legs have to swing forward and backwards as fast as a car. Since you're running faster than you could run on your own, that means the suit is pushing you. Aside from the exhaustion of moving your body to keep up, the speedy direction changes would be the equivalent of being hit with a paddle over and over again. That's why cars have seats and springs. If you try to get around the speed limitations of your limbs with thrusters you run into the speed limitations of the rest of your body. When the suit accelerates, it pushes on your feet, which push on your skeleton, which pulls on your flesh. If that happens too fast your bones break and your flesh tears. If your bones and flesh are strong enough to keep up, all the liquids in your body, which can't be made stronger, will shift down towards your feet. Your brain, which floats inside your skull, will get particularly banged around. So an Iron Man suit would require inertial dampening, which is equivalent to antigravity. ",

The main problem is the one most people ignore, that is the arc reactor. It is a self sustaining energy source. According to the second law of thermodynamics that's impossible, the input would have to be less than the output for that to happen. Not to mention the size. The smallest reactor we have made is about the size of a truck and it's not efficient. Then there's the virtual Butler. That would take ingenious level of coding and even Microsoft, Google, apple haven't made anything even close to Jarvis. And if you want to compare Siri and Jarvis\u2026 well that says a lot about you. Then the exoskeleton, it's possible but it will be slow and suit will resemble the iron monger in height and girth but a lot slower and noisier. Then the repulsor tech. We haven't made it. The closest we have is jetpack which last for 40 mins but they're big and heavy and can only carry a person. I'm will to bet it won't be able to carry a suit as big and heavy as a car. If we can overcome the then yes, we'll have something like the iron monger. Don't expect a nanotech suit that can go toe to toe with a Titan. ",

They can easily make one for you or guide you to make your own.  Even the flying part is already being solved by engineers, although in a different way\u2026.  But the reason we are still far away is that the arc reactor, which is the energy provider for the suit in the comics, it cannot be replicated. Basically, we need to figure out how to put the energy of a nuclear plant in a ball the size of a hand fist, and we are not even close. Another thing is the armory of the suit, of course it is very hard to put laser weapons and missiles in a suit that we have barely made flying possible. A big part of that problem is the energetic issue I mentioned before. And another thing is the aerodynamics. Even if we find a way to put enough energy in the suit to fly like in the video above, it\u2019s quite challenging to control where to go because a lot of aerodynamics is needed. So, as you can see, we already have the suit, we need to implement the features that make it super powerful. ",

            "answer_text": "Present technological aspects?The classical Iron Man armor in the comics involves the use of force fields to strengthen a microscopic suit of chain mail, with flat actuators, for the \"flexible\" parts of the suit - elbow, knee, and shoulder joints, etc.  (This has evolved into \"liquid metal\" and/or nanotechnology to match real-world advances in technology, but still relies upon the force field system.) The chest area is more of a rigid plate for protection, but this is also where the power system and most weapons are housed. This differs somewhat to the movie versions which are more rigid and appear to have \"hydraulic\" mechanical actuators like the reticulated gauntlets common to both versions.The comic-book version hand-waves some of the things the suit can do with very high-level descriptions of technology - personal level force fields, anti-gravity, \"inertial dampeners\", plasma repulsors, and so on.  None of these technologies exist even in their infancy.  Also, most of the suits weapon systems were based upon energy-discharge, which did not require ammunition - which would, of course, be, very limited in a suit of that size.The suit in the movies makes no mention of force fields or anti-gravity, or the \"inertial dampeners\" which would allow the kind of acceleration or immunity to impact that is seen.  Some of the weapons use bullet/missile projectiles but they never seem to need \"reloading\".Now this is where we must understand that this is pure fiction.  The arc reactor output is stated at 3GJ/s or 3000MW - about 14 times the output of the largest nuclear reactor put on a US submarine - an S8G reactor is 220MW output, and has a cylindrical compartment of 42'D x 55'H and weighs 2,750 tons (thank you wikipedia).  Even channeling that power requires superconductor technology that probably can't exist, ever. ",

TALOS, or Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, is a battery-powered robotic exoskeleton designed to protect the lives of soldiers on the front lines, especially those who lead the army in a mission. TALOS is a liquid armor that can solidify when it's hit by a bullet but it won't have flying capabilities or a built-in JARVIS, although it has in-helmet technologies that improve visibility and provide better communication with the rest of the troop. TALOS similar to Ironman suit has built-in sensors that chech the health conditions of the weaver by checking the heart conditions and body temperature etc. However it is not completely ready since its programs of the suits have not yet been fine tuned . In August 2018, Iron Man may go beyond fictional comic books, saving the day in real life   A chinese toy making company \u2018The Toy Asia\u2019 has also created a life size iron man suit without any attacking and defending capabilities and it doesn\u2019t have room for a person to step inside( its just a show case toy).It cost around $360k There are also lots of similar suit that are created now and then keeping iron man in mind but the only thing that I think almost similar now to Tony\u2019s suit is TALOS. .

If we knew how to make such devices, we wouldn't need superheroes! There\u2019s been great advancement in wearable tech, e.g. Google Glass and various brain wave controllers in video-game.\u201d Source: Iron Man 3: the technology behind Tony Stark's suit ",

A person could invent most of the suit and still have one major issue that would be virtually impossible to solve... if said person crashed into concrete, the way Iron man does, he wouldn't be getting up anytime soon as you would open the face mask and find jelly.  There is simply not enough suit to disperse the energy that the human body would be subjected to.   Now if it were a giant suit and you did something similar to the old school science project involving an egg, rubber bands, and a box then you might be able to avoid pink misting yourself on impact... it would be a BIG suit though.

Those of you who are not as old as I will likely not recall the first issues of Ironman where Stark used those new-fangled \"Transistors\" to power his suit.Of course, transistors can't \"power\" anything but they were new enough and \"science-y\" enough in the 50s so that it sounded OK to the average comic reader.Now, we have the \"ARC\" reactor which of course defies most all the laws of physics. Interesting to speculate how even this vastly-potent power source would provide flight.   In order to have flight, you need thrust.  That is, you need something to provide pressure against the air.   Rockets use reaction mass of the fuel itself.  Jets use vastly-compressed air mixed with burning fuel.  Props simply move air very fast.Stark's \"thrusters\" could do non of these things. There is no reaction mass, no fuel, no air compression.....You could shoot raw energy discharges out of your feet all day and about what you'd do is burn holes in the ground....Not fly.Marvel has always been a bit sketchy on physics.

In the movies, the Iron Man armor is powered by a miniaturized arc reactor owing to which it is able to carry out heavy duty stuff and fly over long periods of time. We're ages away from creating power technology like that. Even by taking a wild guess, I would say that it'll be at least two more decades before we even hear of something like that in reality. The other parts of the suit include the actual armor frame, all the sensors and weapons that go into it, the heads up holographic display and the AI assistant (Jarvis/Friday in the case of the movie). It shouldn't be too hard to create all that (or something close) with present day technologies. ",

In Ironman 2, the hammer guy says that each Armor costs around 300million. Even if we make one, it won't be like the one in movies. Say we made one. It took a nasty hit in a battle.since every component in that Armor are prototypes, finding spares would be a helluva task. Every time it takes a hit, it bleeds a lot of money.

However, it isn't armored like ironman nor can it fly primarily because we lack sufficient energy source that is still portable. So unless anyone invents a miniaturized arc reactor or nuclear reactor, maybe we could.  The other thing is the propulsion system for ironman. I'm not exactly sure what is his propulsion (it looks like a miniaturized rocket or plasma which we aren't really good at building one yet). So unless someone invents a super powerful portable battery and develops a powerful propulsion system, yes ironman is theoretically possible. ",

Since we are no way near to that advance supercomputer with artificial intelligence as high as human brain soo it is impossible to build the suit and rather complex are other functions of suit specially the flight tech.It is impossible to fly a suit and turn it with out any wings and turn mechanism ........soo answer is no not even in next 10-15 years ",

Not with the armaments that come with an Iron Man suit but there\u2019s already prototype suits that can house a human pilot that have been made;  That there is the NK-01. It\u2019s designed by a Chinese company named FutureWise and, although a prototype, they\u2019re planning on mass producing them. The US military have the TALOS (Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit) project which is in development and will be an armoured suit for soldiers. Obviously, neither of those fly but it wouldn\u2019t be unfeasible to have a jet pack attached into them and have palm and feet thrusters for aerial control also attached to them. As practical suits they\u2019re not ideal but I don\u2019t imagine they\u2019d need too much engineering to have them capable of flight. Just the, let\u2019s be honest, extremely high chance of injuries to test pilots is probably what holds back on live testing a flying suit. Taking off and flight is one thing but to be able to bring it in to land without any injury to the pilot is another thing altogether. But, if you happened to have a crazy multi-billionaire around, it\u2019s certainly a possibility that a flying suit could be constructed. ",

            "answer_text": "\"The good news, Mrs. Stark, is the suit is fine...\" The weakest element of the Iron Man suit is the man. Those suits take explosive levels of shock (kinetic energy) and somehow disperse or absorb that energy without leaving the occupant a broken puddle of bloody goo. The gunfire, bombs, and blows the suit takes should kill the person inside. Even bomb squad suits couldn't protect from these levels of violence.  The suits also execute high g-force turns in flight that would kill a fighter pilot wearing protective gear. In this case gravity, momentum, and centrifugal forces drawing blood to all the wrong places, leaving you dead.  So the proper approach to a working Iron Man suit is to improve rider. ",

We don't have any materials that would be strong enough to hold up under that kind of punishment yet still light enough to allow something as un-aerodynamic as a biped handle controlled fight. But we can create powered exoskeletons capable of enhancing strength. They look something like this:  With that extra strength you could provide considerably heavier armor than usual to give you some of the added protection of the ironman suit. They don't have the same kind of responsiveness that Tony Stark\u2019s suit has though. Anything that moved like that would shatter your bones if it lost synchronization with your movements, and given that it's intended to be shot at you have to figure that's going to happen more often than not, and always when it's least convenient for you.

After that there are no thrusters that can fit in a hand with no fuel consumption\u2026 no inertial dampeners to keep the body alive in the maneuvers done in the movie. The last problem is that there is no material in existence that can be used for the suit itself. We are getting close to the exoskeleton shown in the Aliens movie though.

The nearest we have are the jet packs fueled by risky rocket fuels like hydrazine, but they are incapable so far of carrying enough fuel for sustained flight and one doesn\u2019t want to run out at altitude. A fission reactor requires a minimum amount of fuel in a pile, likely eliminating it for so small an application. A fusion reactor theoretically might fit the task if anyone knew how to build it, harness the thermal output to the purpose, and shield the passenger from the radiation. But if do-able, it will be done for aircraft and rockets long before it is done for iron man suits. ",

The acceleration of the suit in the movies are simply unbearable for any human to sustain without serious immediate and chronic health complications. The ability to take a tank round is laughable as well. Even the old M829 meant for the first M1A1 Abrams tanks had a muzzle velocity of 1500m/s and a mass of 10kg. That\u2019s 15000kg m/s of momentum. No ~150kg human with an extra 200kg of suit is going to shake that off. The energy density of the arc core is another issue. It\u2019s an obvious weak spot and hazard to any surrounding\u2026well\u2026..anything. It would also be rediculously difficult to control with just 4 rocket motors. ",

Iron man is much far from fantasy than Thor and dead pool . From where do we get the power? Just ready the suit by summers and fly it on a sunny day. Solar power can be stored at the back side of the armour. Old style of iron man had a source at the back side. A supercomputer at the office which transfers files when needed to our system while flight. A vigilante in our world not a fantasy anymore,I ain\u2019t a great scientist but can say for sure that the suit can only be controlled by a mortal being. ",

I didn't know what to answer at that time but with the advancement in technology we were soon able to develop 1st aircraft in the 20th century and we have come a long way since then. So the same is the answer for your question that maybe it's not possible to make something like an ironman suit today but one day we'll definitely have something like that or even better than the ironman suit. P.S: Making a suit is not a problem. We aready have many replicas of ironman suit throughtout the world. The problem lies with its technology.Check out the videos below      ",

Also no known \"reactor\" even in theory can work without using a lot of heat. -repulsors. there is clearly no air intake, I don't know how those work. because Iron Man clearly doesn't carry any propellant. Even if there is an intake how does it work? A heat jet? How does he create such powers without burning himself? -Super armor. If you were to build a suit like that sure you can survive a few gun shots. But you are not going to survive tank cannons (even if your armor is that strong), missile blasts or blunt attack/falls. This is because armor doesn't protect you from acceleration and deceleration. If you get hit in the head really hard it doesn't matter what armor you are wearing, you're dead. I doubt armor of that thickness will even stop armor piercing rounds. ",

So theoretically, an object (bullet, missile, Hulk-thrown rock) hits the armor, the magnetic field holds the armor rigid, and the force of the blow never actually connects to Stark. Then, around issue 200, the Silver Centurion suit added force fields - totally not the same as his magnetic field. Really. In 230, he added an energy shield, and around 280, he added a Star Trek Structural Integrity Field. So, an exoskeleton that amplifies strength and carries armor is possible, but not yet practical. One that flies, provides the level of protection seen, and amplifies strength into the hundred ton range, plus all the other cool gadgets, not so much, except in sci-fi. ",

Then I would say not without quantum leaps in power generation, creation of a completely new generation of armor technology including systems to cancel external effects like vibration, friction, and momentum. The repulsors are probably the single most important technology. It is a highly efficient form of propulsion (not to mention the suit\u2019s primary weaponry) which operates strictly on electrical current, generates little to no heat, as well as no exhaust. Having repulsor technology would make the best and most efficient forms of propulsion look like the engine in a Ford Model T by comparison. I would love to say we could because we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about things like renewable energy, pollution from vehicles or even accidents from vehicles. ",

Well, let see, I doubt the weapon\u2019s he uses are available today in today\u2019s technology. He also uses jet propulsion for lift off. Although jet propulsion technology is available now, I doubt that his suit can hold as much fuel to power it for as long as he flies it. Also there\u2019s an AI with an amazing ability to communicate with Iron Man. Today\u2019s advanced AI\u2019s are not even close. So all in all, I think the \u2018suit\u2019 can be built but with all the crazy stuff the suit can do? NO. At least not with today\u2019s technology. ",

And contrary to almost anything else the Iron Man suit, this is not a problem you can just solve with better technology. The only way to solve that problem would be to invent a totally new technology that can somehow modify the way inertia works. Such a prospect is like FTL travel, teleportation and the like, it is pure speculation. ",

They are also seeing applications for this research in helping people to walk again but also to let disabled soldiers fight again. The exoskeleton is the beginning once that gets properly developed the armor will be layered on top of the skeleton. It will be a variable suit incapable of flight probably a close fit would be Halo inspired. Like the image below if they get the exoskeleton small enough. With the advent of more effecient batteries it may be possible sooner rather than later.  ",

And then, electricity shooters or something, (have plans for) on the hands and feet. That allows him to fly. NOTE: Tony Stark uses the Arc in his chest also for the suit. The Arc in his body is also giving power. It is keeping things out of his heart. He is using the heart to use some blood power going through the arc and generate electricity and keep him alive 50 times longer. (50 times longer from Movie 1. When trapped in the bad guy base.)

Even if, in a hypothetical situation, we build the whole suit which includes the weapons and other features, powering it the way Tony has, is impossible as of now. In simple words, the chest piece is a nuclear reactor, which provides immense energy not only to the electromagnet inside him, but also the suit. The nuclear reactor in the movies is small, very small. And in the real world, the smallest version of this is more than 20 times the size of the movie reactor. So it may not be possible now, but yes, it might be possible in the distant future. ",

Doesn't have weaponry.3. Parts not detachable. What kuratas have: 1. Can be operated by one person.2. Can be operated from outside as well as from inside the robot.3. Can be operated externally from a 3G enabled touch screen phone.4. Can be armed with multiple weapons, such as a 6,000 round per minute twin BB Gatling cannon, a \"LOHAS\" launcher which fires either water bottles or possibly fireworks.5.

For example, the Hand Repulsor Rays? Put too much power into those and youll have rocket powered arms heading god knows where. The built-in VR and AI systems? 15\u201320 years ahead of our time. An AI with full sarcasm and witty response mechanisms adds another 5 years of R&D to it. Finally: having a suit of armor than can take a direct hit from a tank? And still get up with no real damage done to it besides some blast marks and no penetration? Yeah. No frickin\u2019 way will anyone build an Iron Man suit like the one see in the movies any time soon. Sorry to to crush any dreams out there. :/ ",

It generates limitless energy on par with a full sized nuclear reactor yet never needs charging or fuel replacement.Violates laws of physics: When the suit slams into a landing on concrete and cracks it, the man inside would be crushed against the inner armor. Same with any rocket impacting the suit. Even if the suit easily held together. concussive forces would transfer to the soft squishy body inside. Think of standing on a metal plate dropped from 50 feet high. What do you think your chances of survival are when it hits flat concrete? Sure the iron plate is likely only scratched, but you are dead.",

What\u2019s far more likely is that such a suit would be an autonomous robot, and I fully expect to see such things on the battfield in my lifetime.

A Swiss pilot, Yves Rossy, created an actual jet pack as well so he is able to actually fly and use his own body weight as a way to steer. This jet pack uses small jet engines as propulsion under a small wing for lift but he has to jump out of a helicopter to achieve flight and needs to use a parachute to land  ",
