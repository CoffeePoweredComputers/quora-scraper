            "answer_text": "There's no way to know the answer to this definitively for two reasons. The first being that you haven't clarified which virus you are specifically referring to, if any. The second reason is that there is no proof one way or the other\u2026and in fact, there's really no evidence that Bill Gates has had a hand in the spread of some virus at all. So the best you can hope for is people giving you their conspiracy theories about Bill Gates, which will most likely prove to be very unreliable sources of information. Is there something in particular that caused you to ask this question? ",
