            "answer_text": "I'm guessing you mean luxury saloons, not sportscars (correct me if I'm wrong). Size is a part of it, lots of leg space for the back passengers. Expensive materials, workmanship quality, loooooong list of standard features and available options, good sound-proofing. Design too, it's supposed to look stately and representative, not like the super-customised thing of a 20-year old with too much money. Comfortable suspension - a luxury car passenger does not want to know if the nickel the car just drove over was face-up or face-down. Gimmicks like video displays for the rear seats and a separately adjustable A/C come into play as well. ",
