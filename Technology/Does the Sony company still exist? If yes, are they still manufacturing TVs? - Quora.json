            "answer_text": "Ofcourse Yes. SONY has been in the market for as long as I can remember. The point here is that SONY isn't as aggressive in marketing its products as lets say XIAOMI OR Samsung or Some other brand. Moreover, SONY TVs are a little expensive compared to the market prices. The Introduction of CHINESE Brands In India has shadowed SONY, which doesn't advertise its products as much as the others. Considering all this, SONY TVs have always been a source of profits for the company. SONY WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF BUSINESS COZ THEY HAVE SO MANY FEATURES THAT THE OTHER BRANDS CANNOT THINK OF OFFERING. LONG LIVE SONY\u2026\u2026. Peace! ",
