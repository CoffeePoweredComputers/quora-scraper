            "answer_text": "According to GSMArena, the Xiaomi Pocophone F1 has two main cameras with f/1.9 and f/2.0 aperture lenses, respectively. Smartphones do not typically have adjustable apertures, so the cameras are probably fixed at these aperture settings. The only exception that I know of is the Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+, which has two different apertures to choose between. The reason is the mechanical complexity of a variable aperture. Whereas a fixed aperture is simply an opaque disk with a hole in the middle, a variable aperture is typically made of several (5 or more) thin metal blades, which can be moved to form approximately circular holes of varying diameter:  (Picture borrowed from Wikipedia) In a phone it would probably also require an electromechanical actuator to move the aperture blades. Since the Samsung has only two aperture settings, I suspect they have chosen an intermediate between the two solutions: A flat disk with two aperture holes, either of which can be moved into position behind the lens.
