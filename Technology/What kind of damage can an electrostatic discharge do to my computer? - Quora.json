            "answer_text": "Electrostatic discharge is either the jumping of electrical charges or them moving thru a conductor to a device. For electrostatic discharge to jump from one object to another requires high voltages, normally 500V per inch. This would mean a very high voltage build up. This is same as lightning although normally for us is small, but still high voltage. With electronics this sudden high voltage and charge discharge with the charge suddenly jumping to a device can damage low voltage devices and components. If the discharge is simply from like you after walking cross carpet and building a charge in your body and then touching your computer or device normally it will not affect the device, most devices are tested to 2500 V and made to with stand such discharges. But if comes in contact with electronic components like the head set or mic jacks or other ports then this could get into your computer and do damage, even destroy components. When handling devices it is often good for you to touch like the metal of something like a water pipe or refrig before touching smaller lower powered devices. This will discharge any charge you might have built up in your body. In manufacturing plants the people working on sub-assemblies or PC boards and components are required to wear on their wrist a band that is physically electrically connected to the rest of the bench gear, even a special mat on the bench top, to keep all at the same potential and prevent any discharge of any electrostatic charges. They might have a charge build up, but if all is connected together then all is at the same potential. ",

            "answer_text": "Subtle stuff on the inside that you cannot see. I used to work in a component lab (1981) where we\u2019d look at bad devices by popping the lid off an putting them under a microscope an then taking a photo with a Polaroid camera. ESD on transistors has a very particular look to it, but you can\u2019t see it without doing what I did. But the transistor(s) are damaged\u2014not necessarily burned out completely\u2014and not going to get better. You could have a voltage bounce where something is temporarily flipped, and a restart resolves this, but that\u2019s not what we looked at in the lab. I had a computer 26 years ago get zapped by someone not me and suddenly we couldn\u2019t print. It was two years before I realized that the reason I couldn\u2019t print was the printer port was what got damaged (? printer port ?) and the other one was just fine. ",
