Although there are ways to make it extremely difficult, there is no possible method of propagating a website so that its source cannot be discerned and downloaded. This is an intentional feature of the open design of the Hypertext Transfer protocol which is the foundation of the worldwide web. Note that there are commercial products which facilitate downloading, but there is no need to pay for such products. The wget command (which underlies these commercial products) is available to anyone, free of charge. However, copyright may stymie the \u201cupload as your website\u201d portion of the plan. ",

HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the \"mirrored\" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system. https://www.httrack.com/ Happy coding. ",
