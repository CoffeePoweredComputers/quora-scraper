I can\u2019t confirm if this is the exact same camera, but I\u2019m pretty sure it is. I just purchased the item from a friend of mine to record some dailies with it and I think that\u2019s the moment that made me use this camera for the first time. What is your favourite camera phone out of the group?I think the one I\u2019m currently using. It\u2019s nice to be able to use a smaller device, because it makes using a digital camera easier. I\u2019ve recently discovered some interesting facts about this world. Can you tell us about them? ",
