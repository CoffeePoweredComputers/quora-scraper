            "answer_text": "There are 2 ways of describing it by the Japanese calendar: 2nd year of ReiwaEmperor Naruhito was enthroned last year, and this is the second year for his reign. The years aren\u2019t necessarily reflected by how long he was our monarch, but rather by ordinal numbers that his reign spanned. For instance, Naruhito was enthroned since May 2019 of last year. A year hasn\u2019t passed at the time of writing this. Considering his first year or reign ended on Dec 31, this is his second year, right?Either way, counting the years by the Emperor\u2019s reign has been common in Japan since ancient times and is still used officially, rather than Anno Domini. Its use is debated in Japan, as it applications are pretty irrational, and similar to how the US refuses to trash the imperial system over the metric system.2680th year of KoukiKouki ( or \u7687\u7d00 ) is similar to Anno Domini and is based in the year Japan\u2019s first emperor, Jinmu was enthroned back in 660 BCE. It\u2019s also considered when the country of Japan was founded. Kouki is only used by historians and scholars and is not widely used.Nowadays, most people generally prefer Anno Domini. ",
