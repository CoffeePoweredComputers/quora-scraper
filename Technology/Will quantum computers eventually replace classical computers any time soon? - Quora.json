            "answer_text": "No, quantum computers will not displace classical computers completely, they will be used for special classes of problems where they will be proven superior.  Currently, as of 2019, such problems are mostly in cryptography, but other fields are slowly coming into the picture, e.g. recent breakthrough result by Ewin Tang who designed a new quantum-inspired classical algorithm that exponentially (!) improves on the previous best one. Her great result shows the quantum recommendation algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash that was thought to be a showcase of exponential quantum speedup over classical is actually not so. Ewin Tang did it in a surprising way, by discovering a much faster classical algorithm, thus delaying, for the time being, quantum supremacy thought to be the case for recommendations. She has been working on generalizing her results to a new class of classical algorithms that are quantum-inspired and for which quantum supremacy, i.e. exponential speedup, is not true. There are two core problems right now with quantum computing that are to be solved and on which the fate of adoption of quantum computers will hinge: Hardware realization - which is a very tough problem as just getting a limited number of qubits to be in coherent states of entanglement for even very short periods is turning out to be very difficult. Qubits can become worthless very quickly and easily if quantum decoherence occurs.Software - programming of quantum computers is an incredibly difficult problem , with conceptual strangeness and complexity never seen before. At this point the basic quantum gates are well known, but we are currently at a loss how to define higher level programming constructs and come up with high-level quantum programming languages. Think of e.g. parallel programming which is even now an unsolved problem for general instruction streams and automatic extraction of parallelism. Quantum computing is (much) harder.One of the principal reasons why quantum algorithms and programming is so hard is because quantum computers exhibit speedups by very strange and poorly understood quantum interference effects where quantum cancellation of waves occurs. we are basically trying to harness this quantum interference by formulating a quantum solution where unwanted paths cancel (see a great presentation by Scott Aaronson on this subject).  In the early days of computers, it was relatively obvious how to come up with high-level programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, subroutines etc. This problem appears much harder for quantum computers. The current difficulties with quantum computing hardware realizations and software programming do not necessarily have to be insurmountable. We will likely come up with solutions. But we already know that quantum computers will not be a miracle solvers for any NP-complete problem, as some naive interpretations claim. They will most likely evolve to a separate class of computing used to solve and accelerate certain problems, along with classical computers. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not anytime soon, and certainly not the way you may think of it. First quantum computers are still a long way down the road (the problem being the engineering, not the theory).You may see systems emerge, most likely designed to solve a very specific problem, and some possibly \u201cprogrammable\u201d to a certain point (like D-Wave). But do not expect this to be your desktop or laptop. These systems will live in a remote facility or in the cloud and available as a service. But most importantly, it is fundamental to understand that quantum computers only fare better than classic systems when it comes to solve a very particularly category or class of problems (non-polynomial or NP), in other cases, their classic counterpart will perform as well or even better. We also only know today a handful of quantum algorithms (it\u2019s not obvious to program), and while in theory they should perform better, the \u201coptimized\u201d classic version can often easily beat them (Groover search being a good example). So the most likely scenario is that both classic and quantum computers will simply co-exist, the quantum system being there to complement the classic system when it comes to solve specific problems that would other take a long time to compute. I see this a bit similar to the \u201cco-processor\u201d. This is why is it important in my view for quantum computers, whenever they truly materialize, to be designed for interoperability with classic systems (e.g. cloud, web services, co-processing hardware).

            "answer_text": "I agree totally with Pascal Heus\u2019 answer. I have been researching the latest info on quantum computers. Some scientist now believe that the human brain is a quantum computer, and that life itself would not be possible without quantum mechanics. Quantum computers are thought to be very fast for a particular type of problem. I read about an example problem that involved a complicated travel itinerary. Say you need to fly from Atlanta to Sydney with multiple stop overs for 2 -3 days in NY, London, and Paris,and Amsterdam. Your company is frugal and they want you to get the lowest price possible. Check all available airlines and all schedules factoring in any available promotions, advance purchase requirements, and frequent flier specials. Every leg of your travels could be a different airline. This problem probably has millions of possible outcomes and a quantum computer can check all possibilities simultaneously. Quantum computing is best at problems with many variables and unlimited possible outcomes. Experts say that with the most advanced quantum computers, it would only take days, hours or even minutes to solve problems that would take billions of years using classical computers (yes, you read that right: billions of years\u2026). Or: quantum computers may one day be able to perform more calculations simultaneously than there are atoms in the known universe. To date, no quantum computer has solved a problem faster than a classical computer. That level of performance is still theoretical, and a long way off. Yet after decades of pursuing this holy grail of computing, quantum computers are finally on the brink of viability \u2013 and that\u2019s huge news. Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, there\u2019s no question that a new age of computing has arrived \u2013 and it promises to impact every sector of society before long. ",

            "answer_text": "Does your computer have a graphics card? Some people need it if they have specific demands for high-powered floating point computing, but some people don't. As foreseeable technology exploiting quantum-level phenomena appears now, that may be akin to how they could be used.  Any classical circuit can be designed in theory as a quantum circuit with Toffoli gates, but the as-yet few extant quantum algorithms limit the beneficial uses of quantum computation in practice to niche applications that your iPhone or laptop don't really need. For most computations a quantum computer would only be as fast as a classical computer (or slower), so it would be most useful as an auxiliary unit. Of the many models for quantum computing being developed (ion-trap, annealing, topological) the gate model would provide the universal functionality required for a CPU but it also seems to be the hardest to implement. Of course, the biggest roadblock to theorists so readily assumed that it's easy to forget: the current angle on quantum computing schemes dictates these designs operate in nearly impossible physical conditions including extreme cold and low magnetic interference, all of which preclude it from being employed widely.  But it's hardly a dead end. Classical computing bounced around various mechanical, physical and electrical designs until Shockley & co. invented the transistor, which proved to be the breakthrough needed to take computing mainstream. Take a look at the annealing device above: you can actually see the individual qubits that comprise the computing apparatus itself. It's still in the early years of quantum development so it just might take an innovation or two to take it mainstream. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum computer is something of a misnomer. Quantum computers perform a set of specialized operations. I usually use the analogy of a floating point unit. A good analogy would be a graphics chip. For certain computations, it can outperform a classical computer, but that doesn't mean that I want to move all of my computation there. Thus, if quantum computing is viable, I expect that we'll see quantum computing coprocessors in classical computers. I expect adoption to happen much as it happened with classical computing: First, there will be a few very expensive units dedicated to quantum computing. Eventually, there will be some universities that have quantum computing centers where it is possible to get some cycles on their quantum computer if you have the right combination of money and access. For example, the NSF might buy a quantum computer for a university for such a center and then the center will allow other researchers doing NSF-funded research access. As the prices continue to drop, then medium-sized companies will get them and eventually there will be units in your phone. Of course, some of this depends on how useful quantum computers are in daily computation. Currently, we have few practical quantum computing algorithms. If factoring and search of large, unsorted datasets are the only practical uses, then quantum coprocessors will be specialized devices that are purchased by people who have those needs. (In all of this, I ignore D-Wave since they do not provide a general quantum computer. However, their technology has started on the same curve with a few sold.) ",

            "answer_text": "Currently it seems unlikely to impossible that quantum computers will be anything other than a highly specialised and limited tool. The theoretical advantages of quantum computers (the ability to represent and calculate the results of problems that would be impossible or ridiculously slow to deal with on conventional/classical computers) are part of a massive barrier to scaling them to sizes that would make them widely useful. Experts estimate that the number of qubits (quantum bits that can take more than only two states) needed for a useful quantum computer, one that could compete with your laptop in solving certain kinds of interesting problems, is between 1,000 and 100,000. So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be at least 2 to the power of 1,000, which is to say about 10 to the power of 300. That\u2019s a very big number indeed. How big? It is much, much greater than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe (That's without adding in error correction which may need 1000 to 100,000 physical qubits to provide one reliable logical qubit). To repeat: A useful quantum computer needs to process a set of parameters that is larger than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe. I have read many comments saying that it's only a matter of solving engineering problems but in attempting a physical description of this possible future technology, any honest hardheaded engineer is just going to loose interest.

So there is simply not enough power in the typical home to run the refrigeration needed to keep the operating temperatures of almost 440 below 0 fahrenheit to run the thing. (Quantum computers have to be operated at a few degrees above absolute zero) And the power to run the thing is another matter\u2026\u2026 I really am surprised at the number of questions on quora that seem to treat quantum computers as potentially the next generation personal computer. They are ridiculously expensive, take a large amount of space, and a support team to keep them operational. Unless you have a mission critical need for several orders of magnitude more computing power than the vast majority of people need, they are way considerably more expensive and complicated to deal with than anyone wants to bother with.

There are some problems that are well suited to quantum computing, and some problems that are well suited to classical computing. For example the traveling salesman problem is an excellent example of a problem for which a quantum computing environment is a good solution. However something like sorting a very large list alphabetically, say a database sorting email addresses, is not a problem well suited to quantum computing and better served by classical computing. I believe that ultimately the approach will evolve into a hybrid computing environment with a modern processor and a quantum co-processor for specific applications, similar to how you have a GPU dedicated to geometric calculations and it complements your desktop CPU in order to provide the best performance.

One of the most promising uses for quantum computing today involves the use of single atoms coupled to silicon transistors. That is, the exact same components used in classical computers but scaled to single atoms. In this way, many of the things we learn in the pursuit of a quantum computer can be reused for the purpose of pushing classical ones yet a step further. Quantum computing won\u2019t provide us with a replacement to classical computers if and when Moore\u2019s Law comes to consideration but it will help solve some interesting and challenging problems in computing. Every new generation of computer hardware has roughly twice the processing power of the version two years before it. It\u2019s a phenomenon known as Moore\u2019s Law and it\u2019s held true for nearly 50 years. ",

But these are not general purpose quantum computers, but built for a specific task, like ENIAC. By 1980 general purpose digital computers were so common and cheap I could buy one with paper route money\u2026 So it is reasonable expect in 35 years time everyone will be able to afford a general purpose quantum computer. But keep in mine this would be the quantum computer equivalent of a VIC20 or TSR80. Meanwhile digital computers will have advanced by another 35 years. So more likely that quantum computer would be an add on like a math accelerator in the 80\u2019s, or a graphics card today. Just though as math accelerators were integrated in and now graphics cards, in say 50 to 60 years ago digital and quantum computers would be so seamlessly integrated together, there will be no distinction. We\u2019ll just call them computers. ",
