            "answer_text": "There have been a lot of good answers here so I\u2019ll try not be repetitive, but there are a few incredibly commonly overlooked things that make social media content better:Don\u2019t post just for the sake of it. Tons of people do this. They think posting more = good. It doesn\u2019t. Speak a language that is appropriate and relevant for social media in general, for your industry more specifically, the platform even more specifically, and most specifically in a way that resonates with the people you\u2019re speaking to.Strong writing and/or creative skills. True, you don\u2019t have to be a writer (and not all trained writers understand how to write for social media) but in my experience people with strong writing and creative skills have a HUGE advantage on social.Talk about things in a way that highlights the benefit of the content for the audience (as opposed to just saying stuff you want to say or promoting what you want to promote).Truly and deeply understand why you\u2019re doing social in the first place and be ultra realistic about what social is and isn\u2019t going to accomplish for you. This could mean taking a step back to question whether or not social media is even something you should be doing (this might sound contrary to what you\u2019ve heard from some social media marketers, but it isn\u2019t necessary, beneficial, or the best solution for some people/brands/companies). Plan ahead. Posting by the seat of your pants may be the only way you can keep up, but being strategic and planning out content in advance helps you to be way more organized and effective. Platforms that allow you to schedule content can be super helpful in that process but social media shouldn\u2019t be entirely automated.Yes, observe the ways in which other brands are successfully using social media, but be careful thinking what works for someone else will work for you. For instance: some audiences like quotes, some find them cliche, inauthentic and useless garbage filler content.There are a ton of subtleties when it comes to creating amazing content. Best of luck.

            "answer_text": "On social media, you have people who are famous strictly for being a social media personality. What does this mean? There are people who gain fame and popularity on social platforms like YouTube, Vine, Musical.ly , Instagram and Twitter for posting original content. They garner hundreds of thousands or millions of followers and subscribers, and they amass hundreds of millions of views. Some become successful enough to be interviewed by Vogue, walk on red carpets for award shows, walk runways at New York Fashion week, feature in movies, sell out tours, chart on Billboard, and so on. These social media stars accomplish all this without being known for other projects (prior to their success.) This means they weren\u2019t prominent actors, singers, or book writers before they amassed their large following and enormous influence. So how can social media be used for good? 1) Mental Health Many social media stars suffer from anxiety and depression, and a handful of them are very outspoken. They raise awareness by sharing their experiences and their road to recovery, giving hope and relief to many young kids around the world! 2) Love Army In times of natural disasters, a group of social media stars always spreads awareness and they use their platforms to raise funds for the victims. They use GoFundMe and their campaigns are always titled \u201cLove Army for (place of disaster)\u201d Usually they\u2019re successful and they\u2019re able to collect millions of dollars PLUS use their platform to persuade popular airlines to help them deliver packaged goods to the site of the disaster. Instead of raising money and handing it to non-profit organizations or any other NGO, they spend and deliver the money themselves, and they\u2019re very transparent in how the funds are being used. Also, since these group of social media stars are prominent figures on social media, they\u2019re able to have their other social media friends PLUS their movie actor friends spread awareness as well.
