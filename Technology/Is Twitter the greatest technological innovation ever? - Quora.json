            "answer_text": "The answer is No . There are countless of innovations in technology field , just to name a few - computer  machine , the internet , satellite and much more . Twitter is just a platform for social networking. Yes it is a very popular one , with enormous user base that can match population of a small nation . What special about Twitter is that it launch something very special in social network .  It is easy to use , straight to the point with minimal text and if done correctly , a single tweet have potential to garner massive attention through retweets . A giant in the technology sector , sizeable number of employees , and a respectable brand .  But that's all about it . To be honest , I'm quite new in Quora as before this I'm mainly answering question  in Yahoo . I believe there should be a place to help people for free , and Quora seems to be getting better while the other platform , starting to change due to many troll questions . Users starting to post question in order to generate popularity , or asking something that's plain ridiculous . Hopefully here will not be the same . ",

            "answer_text": "That's an interesting question. I am biased but... You know how writers keep saying that restriction actually helps in the wiriting process? For example, a haiku is an excellent way to get inspired by just picking the right amount of words. Sound familiar? Secondly, with the way things were going back when twitter was invented, it was obvious that the internet would turn us all into a bunch of consumers with ADHD... which is all right I guess, we are, but twitter made it into a good thing - don't have long attention span? Well, look at these morsels with incredibly important info. People rarely waste their tweets on stupid things. Twitter made short attention span sexy and the way to go. (Which tells me they're both genius and mean. Mad geniuses. Ha!) Finally, the same guys made Medium for Christ's sake. They saw that the media was making the Internet extremely noisy and crowded with ads... and bet on people being tired of it, so they put their money on minimal design.  Was it genius or what? I write on Medium now, not on Word.  As for twitter, it has its drawbacks - like the way it won't show instagrams or the way it hides twitter lists like they're cooties, but we all love it. ",
