            "answer_text": "Ok i would like to address the issue by citing an onsite example from the company where i interned. The company is the country's largest multi port private operator. I was specifically associated with their Liquid division , responsible for carrying out both jetty(where the cargo is jettisoned/unloaded-technically called a wharf where the ship is Moored alongside) and terminal( basically a storage facility for the unloaded cargo) side operations The basic operation is : Receipt of liquid cargo(consisting of chemicals, white oils,black oils etc) from  marine tankers via pipelines , transfering the cargo thence to the terminal via CCPL(generally) and thereafter dispatch of stored cargo to the corresponding party via road tankers The above is obviously the methodology adopted whence the cargo is imported. For export cargo , the operations are reversed. Anyhow , the terminal consists of tank farms which are an array of Above Ground atmospheric storage tanks which have their specifications and capacity usually dedicated to handle certain type of liquid cargo; (again based on factors such as volatility , reactivity with metals etc).  The tanks possess what is known as Full calibrated capacity i.e. installed capacity which is the maximum amount of liquid cargo which can be filled in the tank ,measured in kiloleters (kL).  Since tank storages are the major revenue centers (capacity leasing), they can either be dedicated to a large customer (which occupies the tank(s) on a long term basis , paying for the full calibrated capacity of the tank , irrespective of whether the tanks are filled with cargo or not)OR leased on a co-mingling basis. (Short term capacity leasing wherein two or more customers dealing in the same cargo can  co-mingle to occupy space in same tank(s)). Thus the design capacity would be redundant when the capacity is dedicated to a large customer since there is no maximum amount of work that the port handlers require to perform (in the form tank cleaning services , pipeline cleaning services) in a given period of time . Since the liquid cargo is dedicated in those tank storages and are not being replaced for the time-period the storage is dedicated , thus requiring no efforts and added cost from the capacity provider(leaser) in the form of cleaning services. On the other hand , on co-mingling basis there is an added pressure on the service provider to clean the tank prior during the end of the short leasing perios in order to cater to a party carrying different cargo. Thus the design capacity alters in these two scenarios .  As u can see from the above example , design capacity is not function of installed capacity. But in other organizations , it can be a function of the installed capacity of the individual units(machinery) contributing to the enterprise.  But , the major difference , design capacity is enterprise wide . Installed capacity is unit wide.  ",

            "answer_text": "Installed Capacity: Production Capacity of a plant based either on its rated capacity or actual capacity. Design Capacity: A plant or process, which has maximum output capacity for which it is designed. Theoretically Design Capacity and Installed capacity should be the same, but due to various variations and allowances, Installed capacity is always lower than design capacity. For example, A machine have design capacity to machine 60 components / hour, i.e., roughly 1 component per minute. It was installed as per machine design specifications, but while running due to variations in conditions, raw material, tools, it took 1.5 min per component. Hence design capacity is 60 components / hour but installed capacity is 45 components / hour. Hope you got clarified. ",
