            "answer_text": "No. The internet was invented in 1983, and the World Wide Web was invented in 1990. We will use 1990 as our reference date, since that's when the popularisation of the internet began. You can see in the graph below that the number of internet users has been increasing exponentially ever since then.  If Islam is in fact dying because of the internet, there should be a proportionate decrease in the population of Muslims worldwide that corresponds to the exponential growth of the internet. At the minimum, if your hypothesis is true, we would expect to see a significant decrease in the rate at which the Muslim population is growing. However, the chart below shows that not only has the Muslim population been growing, it has been growing at a greater rate than the the rate at which world population has been growing. Back when the internet was invented, Muslims accounted for 20% of the world population, but that number has been steadily increasing and will reach 25% by the year 2020.  So the number of Muslims in the world has not decreased, but what about the growth rate of Islam? We can see in the chart below that the growth rate of Islam has decreased since the advent of the internet. But this alone does not confirm your theory, because we can also see from the chart that the population growth of non-Muslims has been slowing down as well. The growth rate of Islam has been decreasing slightly faster than the rest of the population, but even so, the growth rate is higher for the Muslims than it is for the rest of the population.  By analysing the data, we can conclude that the slowing growth of Islam is unrelated to the rise of the internet. It is much more likely that the decline of the fertility of women in Muslim countries deserves most of the blame. The following chart shows that the decrease in fertility is proportional to the decrease in the growth of the Muslim population, which makes sense considering that fertility is one of the primary factors in the growth of any population subset.  Even with a slowing growth rate, Islam is expected to overtake Christianity as the largest religion in the world by the year 2070. The internet is also projected to continue its growth, which goes directly against your premise that the internet is killing Islam.  Islam is far from dying. Islam is thriving as the fastest growing religion in the world. ",

Technological advancement have both positive and negative outcomes but the misuse of internet and unethical content on social media mislead the young generation. Some evil doers spread wrong information by using social media that results in the distortion of religious facts, it increases persons vulnerability to peer pressure. Social media make people obsessed with other people\u2019s life people do good deeds but consider it compulsory to post it on social media so their personal lives are becoming public. Social media have negative effect on family value system. Social media is manipulating muslim women\u2019s mind against their veil, hijab but the other problem is if we read the statistics we fill find that these social networking platforms and social media is the cause of snatching away of the piece of a lot of people you will find wives complaining, husband complaining, children\u2019s complaining they become orphans of social media because every member in family is busy with his/her phone. Spreading messages in the name of islam that contain anti-Islamic content in order to distract youth, manipulating the minds of young generation.

But I think regardless of all the negative effect Allah give the ability to humans to differentiate between right and wrong if a person see misleading information or any controversy against islam he/she can raise voice and can quit using that platform a knife can be used to cook delicious food or to use as a weapon so one way or the other it is depend on Muslims to follow what is right, ethical and permissible in islam.
