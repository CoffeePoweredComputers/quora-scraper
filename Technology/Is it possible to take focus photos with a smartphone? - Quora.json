            "answer_text": "It's possible to take 'focus shots' to some degree and depending upon the kind of subject and composition. But NOT this type, coz most importantly this is a telephoto shot with a live subject. For a nice bokeh (out-of-focus background), you typically need a large sensor (DX/APS-C or micro-four-thirds or Full-frame)a large aperture (larger than f/5.6 preferable)large subject-to-background distance (at least a few metres)less subject-to-camera distance (the closer the better)Out of these two, the major limitation in a smartphone is the small sensor size (very small compared to typical sensors on high-end cameras). Also, the effect of aperture is most pronounced on a large sensor - so even if you have f/2.0 on a small Digi-cam sensor body, it won't amount to much. For this particular shot, you would need a telephoto-lens too, since the mobile camera resolution won't be enough to take a detailed picture of a bird perched far away. That's another limitation. The good thing: What you can do is take close-up shots using your mobile. Good mobile phone cameras can take pretty decent close-up shots of objects. Here, the extreme short distance (for example a couple of inches) between the subject and camera can enable a focused shot. But you need to ensure that your background is far away and non-distracting (read 'uniform homogeneous background'). Of course you can digitally manipulate your images later (using software) to get such effects in images but that is a whole other story. To summarize, this particular shot - NO you can't capture it with a smartphone handheld, not with existing technology. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer your question, it is actually possible to click photos where one object is in focus with the rest of image blurred using a smartphone. But the extent on which it is focused depends on many factors such as smartphone quality, specifications of the camera, object distance. Here are some unedited pictures clicked on my Yureka. A butterfly feeding the sweet nectar from a flower. I think it is never going stop. Perfectly settled on the flowers. I think this dragon fly has a better photogenic face than mine and having compound eyes it always looks straightly into camera from almost every angle possible. Here, though the first mushroom is focused, the second mushroom is not entirely blurred. You might get a better output on some other smartphones. Even a spider's web which is barely visible to naked eye can also be focused. Note that focus and blurring out is not the only thing that matters for taking a good picture. Happy clicking!!! ",
