This is due to people sharing their entire lives on Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, etc. There is less excitement hearing about someone\u2019s trip to Hawaii in person when you already saw the pictures, video and read about it on their social profiles. I suppose this is just a shift in how we share our lives now. ",
