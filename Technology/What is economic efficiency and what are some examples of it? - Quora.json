            "answer_text": "Economic efficiency is a state where every resource is allocated optimally so that each person is served in the best possible way and inefficiency and waste are minimized. While this is a general definition, lets look at some other factors often used to describe this term. 1. Production of goods is at its lowest cost. 2. One person cannot be helped, by means of reallocating the goods, without making another person worse off. 3. It indicates that there has been a balance between loss and benefit. Example So, let's take a look at an example to help us explain economic efficiency. Suppose a clothing factory has several machines to help sew the clothing. The machines can produce enough clothing that when sold could result in $100, $75, and $50. In this example, the most efficient option is the one that results in $100. Anything less than $100 is considered an inefficient use of the machines. While this may seem pretty clear cut, this scenario does not take variables into consideration. One obvious example, would be the amount of labor needed to operate the machines in order to produce $100. While $100 signifies maximum output, it also might signify more employees to operate those machines. More employees means paying more money in wages, which then affects profit. This is where consideration needs to be made about the balance of loss and benefit. Obviously, it would benefit the company to produce the maximum number of products, but how much loss, in the amount of more wages paid out, does the company really want to endure? Where do production output and labor paid balance? Also, it is important to point out that while the owner of the company may be happy having the machines operating at maximum output, in doing so, he is taking employees away from their families. This would illustrate that taking a resource away from one individual (time) helps make another better off (the company owner having machines working at maximum output). ",

            "answer_text": "An economy of scale is the notional expansion of the size of a plant to achieve lower costs per unit as a result of increased capital expenditure upfront, that is dispersed over many more units of output, resulting in an incrementally lower unit output cost. For example: a. A larger centralised plant is more economically efficient than several smaller plants because the large central plant can better utilise centralised resources across the entire production capacity. i.e. It reduces a bottleneck. b. A larger centralised plant will have a more \u2018liquid\u2019 and \u2018dynamic\u2019 capacity to manage inventories of interim semi-finished goods, and it can probably have a smaller inventory store as a result, particularly for those parts needed less often. This is particularly the case for maintenance plant. There are of course other factors to consider to set the full context. Smaller localised plants might make more sense for certain things like \u2018low value products\u2019 or cases where local raw materials is important, i.e. Timber milling or electricity production. Centralisation for economies of scale - examples would be car manufacturing or mining. Mining is interesting because there is the added dynamic of not knowing the final mineral resource to extract because carrying the upfront cost of exploratory drilling would be too onerous. There is a trade off between drilling metres, resource conversion, resource confidence (density of drilling) and the optimum production scale and production profile for a range of plant capacities, processing routes, and also mining methods. Its very complex. But much hinges on the expected size of the resource and optimal mining method to arrive at an ultimate mining capacity you can live with. Many a mining company has appraised their resource and found the returns didn\u2019t justify the project go-ahead. They don\u2019t abandon the project. They do one of two things: a. They sit on the project until higher commodity prices justify it b. They appraise the project to find ways to reduce costs c. They seek out more resources that would be lower cost to process (upfront - say because higher grade) , or able to justify a longer life mine that will achieve economies of scale, thus lower costs over project life, and thus more appealing internal rate of return (IRR). d. They might toll treat the ore at a neighbouring plant. Now, this might be construed as a \u2018type of economy of scale\u2019 in the sense that its achieving a higher plant utilisation rate, even if the decision was not driving the original plant development. It might justify a retrofit on the plant. ",
