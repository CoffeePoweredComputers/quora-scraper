            "answer_text": "The largest physical size of what one might call flexible, would be an 8\u2033 size with 1.2 Megabytes for one sided and 2.4 Megabytes for a two sided disk. These were used mostly in S-100 systems and others prior to the PC. There was a 5.25\u2033 flexible floppy size that was also very popular, both single and double sided. This was what PC\u2019s initially came with and was popular through the 1980\u2019s. The largest storage non-flexible (floppy media inside a rigid case) would be a 3.5\u2033 floppy, storing 2.88 Megabyte (but it never gained any general acceptance) and the popular type of that size was 1.44 Megabytes. Then there were various flavors of IOMega floppy disks with non-flexible cases that could store 5, 10, 100 (popular ZIP drive media) and 250 Megabytes. One of the early versions was the Bernoulli box, which media was roughly about 8\u2033x11\u2033x1/2\u2033 and could store 5, 10 or 20 Megabytes. Also there was a Superdisk floppy that could store 120 megabytes, but was never popular. For additional info see Floppy disk - Wikipedia ",
