            "answer_text": "There are surgeons operating on patients right now who can't feel their instruments. Similarly, there are workers in nuclear facilities around the world using remote manipulator arms to handle radioactive materials without a sense of what they're touching. It's an epidemic of numbness that afflicts virtually everyone who performs a manual job with robotic assistance\u2014from bomb disposal experts in Afghanistan to astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Haptics is about machines communicating through touch, whether that means a joystick that grinds to a halt when the manipulator it's commanding hits an obstacle, or a touch screen that buzzes with each tap on its virtual keyboard. Vibration is the most common form of haptic feedback, and the rattle of an incoming call on a silenced cell phone is its most common application.   Haptic technology provides tactile and resistance feedback to surgeons as they operate the robotic device. As the surgeon makes an incision, they feel ligaments as if working directly on the patient. Haptic technology aids in the simulation by creating a realistic environment of touch.  ",
