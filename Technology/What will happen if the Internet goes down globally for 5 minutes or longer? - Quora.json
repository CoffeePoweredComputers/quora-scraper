By T+3, when it\u2019s clear Twitter is *also* included in the shutdown, mild panic turns to fear and dread. At T+5, emergency supplies of anxiety medication will have run out worldwide. By the time we reach the eighth minute, markets will have crashed to a level from which it\u2019ll take weeks to recover, and governments worldwide will have activated their disaster management agencies. Law enforcement will be deployed to prevent the inevitable rioting. Ninth minute, Law enforcement joins in the rioting. In the tenth minute, humanity will have resorted to cannibalism, governments will have been overthrown, the dead will rise from the grave, cats and dogs will be living together, and the Brotherhood of Steel will be hoarding what little technology remains. Those who live to see the eleventh minute will head directly to Facebook and Twitter to post photographs of the apocalypse. ",

            "answer_text": "What will happen if the internet shuts down for 10 minutes globally? In the grand scheme of things, nothing. Services all over the internet go down all the time. People would probably just think, \u201cOh, my internet is down.\u201d It would be no different than any other localized problem they\u2019ve experienced in the past. People would see it as a local problem. They wouldn\u2019t know it was global for a while. But 10 minutes isn\u2019t likely to affect people since we lose service like that on occasion. People who support the services and networks would be working to figure out why their service went down. Depending on your hypothetical cause, they may or may not find the issue. But they wouldn\u2019t know it was wide spread either. They just know that their company is down and would try to fix it. Ten minutes later, they\u2019d ask \u201cHey, what did you do to fix it?\u201d And they\u2019d look around at each other in confusion. Or\u2026 somebody would say, \u201cI rebooted this server.\u201d Or \u201cI rebooted this router.\u201d And take credit. ;P ",

So things will stop. Everything will be back to old days of Addison and Tesla when just electricity was discovered. Yet lot of battery operating gadgets will work. Local Networking may work. You can say tye world will be unplugged for a moment and experience life outside. Which is quite necessary. I get the feeling that in future we might have to deal with this situation for some reason(s). May be solar Storms, may be politics involved, may be AI, may be virus\u2026some situations are necessary. Everything takes a break. Eventually one day. But wish everything goes well. ",
