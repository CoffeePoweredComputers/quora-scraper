            "answer_text": "Obviously yes, If you will buy house you can only save its rent and probably as time goes may be its value will increase. And if you will invest in farm you will get more benefits from the products of that, as time goes the valuation of farm will more increase because in both the cases your asset is only land. Whatever you are doing or invest on building on land will not increase in valuation. So in the same money you can buy more land because doing so you are saving the construction cost of the house. As time goes the valuation of farm will increase because of lack of land and increasing of the population. If you are dedicated towards some businesses in the farm then you can make farm house and may be party plot and the income of that is far better than the house because after buying house you can save rent and it is only 2\u20133 % (maximum 5 %) of your investment. but after all it comes to your priority, if you don\u2019t have house to live and you want it to make your HOME then its better to buy it. First priority is roti, kapada and makan. But if you already own a house then it will be waste of money and bad decision to buy another house, so in this situation you should buy a farm. Hope it helps. Keep smiling. ",
