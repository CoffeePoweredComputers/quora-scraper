            "answer_text": "What do you want to do on the Internet? Most smart TVs connect to the internet using a LAN cable or wifi. Once connected, you can use the built in web browser to visit webpages or dedicated apps such as Facebook, Youtube or Skype. The apps differ based on brand and model of the TV as they all have different operating systems. The TV remote will usually have a dedicated button to take you to the Smart feature, where you should be able to see the apps above. ",

            "answer_text": "It is worth noting that Smart TVs aren't normally designed to allow you to browse the internet. They do have a web engine which uses a browser at its core but the developers have disabled anything that you might be familiar with in respect to browsing the web. The main reason for doing this is that customers call the manufacturer and complain when some websites don't work, even when the problem is nothing to do with the manufacturer. So the Smart TV usually is limited to visiting a 'walled garden' of websites to limit the hassle for manufacturers. ",
