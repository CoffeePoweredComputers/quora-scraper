            "answer_text": "Oh my goodness, no! In fact, I regularly counsel people interested in IT degrees to consider forgoing a 4-year degree and consider a two-year degree, build a lab and pursue good certifications which will be cheaper, you will learn more, be more capable and most importantly you won\u2019t be in debt! Worst case, transfer that AA to a 4-year school and continue - often you can get away with it being cheaper than if you went 4 years straight. Your two year degree is a great way to get non-IT essentials that you will need, like Algebra, public speaking, technical writing, presentation skills. The certifications will get you the technical know-how. Together you will have a very effective entry-level resume. It will look better than a 4-year degree. All I have to my name, technically, is an AA in Computer Science. Today I am making more than MBAs and PhDs, and have been for awhile. If I had to start all over I would do exactly as I described above. EXACTLY. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not completely useless. If I was hiring a low-level position like helpdesk, that would give you a leg up over someone with no degree. But it isn\u2019t worth a lot, especially since a lot of associate \u201cdegrees\u201d come from unaccredited garbage schools. ",
