            "answer_text": "Weather forecast is based on rigorous, multidisciplinary sciences of the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and the interactions among them. The weather forecast that you see on TV or on your mobile app actually starts with collecting real-time data using satellites, weather radars, and ground and upper-air in situ measurements. There are now over 20 weather satellites worldwide and over 150 weather radars in the US alone. For each round of data forecast, many billions of data points are integrated into a numerical weather prediction model using a process called data assimilation. Weather forecast is an initial value problem. To produce a forecast, a model processes today\u2019s observed weather parameters (hence the name initial value) based on millions of highly nonlinear differential equations that evolve the dynamics, thermodynamics, and radiative processes for the entire earth surface, allowing the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and snow and ice to interact with each other. These equations describe the earth\u2019s atmosphere at tens of layers in the vertical, the upper and lower layers of the oceans; and the entire earth at horizontal intervals of tens of kilometers and at time steps of minutes. These models are very computation intensive and run on supercomputers. The accuracy of weather forecast still has much to be desired. This is because within the description above, there are several ways (not in a particular order) that errors could be introduced. (1) Weather observations are not perfect. Observations over land are tens to hundreds of kilometers apart. Over the ocean, they are few and far between. Satellites have improved weather observations, but they have accuracy problems of their own. (2) The equations that describe the atmosphere, ocean, and land at regular intervals over the earth also have gaps between them. (3) Over time, the highly nonlinear equations will magnify any computational errors or errors introduced into the initial value. (4) Imperfect understanding\u2014and hence imperfect mathematical representations\u2014of the physical processes of the atmosphere, ocean, and land in the model. More accurate weather forecast requires better understanding of the physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and land; more accurate observations (especially from satellites), more powerful computers, and perhaps a completely different paradigm such as machine learning.

            "answer_text": "When the premise of the question is bunkum, it\u2019s hard to get good results. Meteorologists are usually right about the next day\u2019s weather, better than a lot of other kids of predictions 5 days out, and can give you historical data for whatever\u2019s coming 10 days out. At the same time climate predictions can be quite accurate about climate\u2014not weather\u2014much farther out. I mention this because scientific ignoramuses often say \u201cthey can\u2019t predict next week\u2019s weather, so how can they predict next year\u2019s climate?\u201d And for that matter, scientific ignoramuses often believe that if something isn\u2019t 100% accurate it\u2019s 100% wrong. They don\u2019t know what the terms \u201cchaotic systems\u201d and \u201cprobability\u201d mean. So if the forecast says it\u2019ll be 81 degrees tomorrow and it\u2019s 82, I can live with that. Also, some aspects of weather are harder to predict than others. You can get an unstable weather system coming in whose actions are harder to predict than solid high pressure or low pressure zones. Also, dangerous man-cause global climate change has destabilized climates, making prediction innately harder than it was a century ago. Say a weather forecast for a hurricane looks like this:  The odds of it straying outside the blue zone are tiny. The odds of it moving along the center of the pathline are good. If it does veer out to the edge of the blue area, you can\u2019t say that\u2019s wrong\u2014only if all hurrican forecasts, aggretated, show low numbers of hurricanes moving along the centerline. Note that one kicker is the polar jetstream. It has slowed down and gotten wobbly due to dangerous man-caused global climate change. That affects the predictive accuracy of climate forecasts in areas affected by the north polar jetstream, such as the United States. ",
