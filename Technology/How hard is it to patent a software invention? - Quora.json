            "answer_text": "As the other posters noted, it depends on the country. In the US, the vast majority of software ideas are still patentable. Yes, the Alice Supreme Court decision did initially have a chilling effect on getting a valid US patent in software, but many of the court decisions in the second half of last year upheld the validity of US software patents. In the US, as in other countries, the more technical innovation there is in a software idea, the more patentable it is. Business method software patents are much harder to get in the US now for this reason - but not impossible. These patents relate to the application of software to a business problem. There is still room for patents for such ideas, but only in the US. A big factor in all countries is how the patent is written. The examination and enforcement of software patents are particularly sensitive to how the idea is described in the patent, more so than in other areas of technology. If you want to get a patent for software, you need to hire a US patent agent or attorney with a lot of experience in this area. ",

            "answer_text": "In Australia, it is hard to patent software, much like in the USA. Part of the problem at the moment is variability in IP Australia practice and ambiguity around how to implement the Full Bench of the Federal Court\u2019s decisions in Research Affiliates LLC v Commissioner of Patents [2014] FCAFC 150 and Commissioner of Patents v RPL Central Pty Ltd [2015] FCAFC 177. If the patent claims require the use of generic computer technology as a practical implementation tool, and if this generic technology is disregarded, and what is left is a scheme, abstract idea, or business process of the kind that is patent ineligible, then the patent application is refused. That sounds like a straightforward test, but it\u2019s not really and has led to some strange cases. ",
