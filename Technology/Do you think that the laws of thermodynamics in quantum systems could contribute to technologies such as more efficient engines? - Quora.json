            "answer_text": "While I agree with Robert Naumann, it is also clear that quantum mechanics in general, and entanglement in particular, lead to subtle new clauses, at least, to be inserted into our current laws of thermodynamics. If you are interested, the New Scientist magazine had an article on quantum thermodynamics a couple of years ago (07-Apr-2018, page 32). ",
