            "answer_text": "At IBC2014 I saw a holographic display which had a tiny display and was about the size of a bedside table. The problem is there was only enough space for a small object to be displayed and the resolution was limited. The bigger issue is image capturing, there aren't production methods for holographic capture yet and there isn't a market for that kind of viewing yet. ",
