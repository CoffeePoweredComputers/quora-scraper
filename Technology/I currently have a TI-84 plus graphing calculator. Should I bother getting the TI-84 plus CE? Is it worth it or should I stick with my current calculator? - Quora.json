            "answer_text": "My personal recommendation: If you will be using your TI-84+ for a few years, more than just math class, then it is worth getting the CE. Unlike what other answers might say, it is not just a difference of color. There are many other differences between the older 84\u2019s and the newest 84, especially if you upgrade the operating system. If you are interested in programming, the TI-84 plus CE has seven times the memory compared to the silver edition, and I don't know how much more user available memory compared to the older 84s. Operating system 5.4 on the newest TI-84 has added new features not available on older 84s, including piecewise functions, cut and paste, undo clear, extra key words, and in a few cases, extra parameters. Some of these new features are not going to be available on the silver edition or on the older 84s. For example, on the older 84\u2019s, if you wanted to calculate the log(12) in base 2, you had to calculate . On the CE, you use logbase and end up with . And one big bonus with the Silver Edition and up are the HELP screens, giving you some examples of using the parameters (see green screens below). If you know someone who has upgraded their TI-84 Plus CE to the latest operating system, you can get an idea of how many new functions have been added by comparing the catalog listing of all available functions, side-by-side, your calculator next to theirs, though I will admit, I have not learned how to use some of those new functions, because they were not taught in the advanced math classes I took at the college level. Look at some of the images and the article you will find here: Why the TI-84-plus-CE is better than all the other TI-84's You can\u2019t do this on the black-and-white 84\u2019s or the color Silver Edition:  Here are some new functions that are not even available on the Silver Edition:  and here\u2019s the new programming menu:  Images Source: Why the TI-84-plus-CE is better than all the other TI-84's I do own the nSpire CX CAS, the HP Prime, and the Casio CG50, but I still reach for my 84+CE first when I want to do something. . Original question: I currently have a TI-84 plus graphing calculator. Should I bother getting the TI-84 plus CE? Is it worth it or should I stick with my current calculator? ",

            "answer_text": "I agree somewhat, but I would ask what your calculator is being used for. If you are in high school, then the TI-84 itself is fine. I teach both AP Calculus and AP Statistics, and there are no capabilities needed that the TI-84 doesn\u2019t have. The CE does look cooler and have more memory, but nothing that will keep you from being successful in high school math classes. It has also been my experience that most colleges don\u2019t use these, but rather use Excel, Desmos, Mathlab, or something else. So I\u2019m not sure that the additional $130+ expense is necessary.
