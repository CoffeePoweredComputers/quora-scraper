            "answer_text": "Yes, both Greece and the former middle East used to be very intelligent before religion. Matter of fact, the word ALGEBRA is an Arabic word and many stars have an Arabic name. The middle Eastern and Greek people were very intelligent with math and astronomy but during sometime in history, education was viewed as bad and higher intelligence was destroyed, and scientists captured and killed in the name of religion or from invasion and war. Going back to your question, there ARE ancient technologies. One is called the \u201dBaghdad Battery\u201d which actually did store energy and was the world's first battery:     And here we have the world's FIRST computer. It was found in the sea but actually was robbed and fell off a ship. It was originally created in Greece and the point of it was to calculate the days and months as well as seasons. It is called the Antikythera mechanism. The Antikythera mechanism is an ancient Greek analogue computer used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance. It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games.   There are MANY more ancient technologies out there, many probably lost forever due to attempts from religious groups or extremists destroying these ancient relics or theives stealing them to sell on the black market. To this day, we STILL don't fully know what the Egyptian Pyramids are for and we ASSUME and concluded it's nothing more than a glorified tomb for ancient kings and queens\u2026 some suggest the pyramid was actually used as a POWER PLANT and it wasn't until recently that they finally accepted this theory.. One archeologist predicted there was WATER underneath the pyramid for the longest time and they recently DID find water and his prediction was true (as seen in the video below). There could be a link with the water underground being used to create electricity.     Underground chamber shaft with water underneath:  Pyramids now being believed to be used as power plants:  Antikythera mechanism - Wikipedia https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/astr/hd_astr.htm Study reveals the Great Pyramid of Giza can focus electromagnetic energy I'm not against religion but if you look at the past history, it does hold back the intellectual growth and discoveries which prevents knowledge to grow and prioritize the religious values over everything else. Some religious extremist groups recently have destroyed museums and ancient relics before as they wanted to erase history. War and politics also keeps us in a tribal like society and the only way to expand knowledge is to improve the standard of living for people and invest in education and prioritize it. There are plenty of ancient knowledge and truth that will be forever forgotten, we're only left with artifacts which we're still clueless about some of it and we can only create theories of how or why it was created. The middle East was once a place for expanding minds, many of the scientific terms we use are of Arabic.. such as alcohol or alchemy.. and many of the stars originally had Arabic names.
