            "answer_text": "Well, yes and no. The power is really energy stored in a internal battery. Once removed from a charger the battery is unloaded. However, an unloaded battery has a small amount of what they call self discharge. It may be a few percent per month. The amount varies with age and temperature and individual cells. So yes, it loses energy. (which is power over time) But a very small amount. After a month or so it may easily have some 90% of its energy still. ",
