            "answer_text": "Hi, Apple do give new iPhone as a replacement of your existing device if repair cost of your iPhone is high or irrepairable. Also your iPhone should be in warranty period. They do not give refurbished phones as a replacement until and unless your iPhone model is too old. Like iPhone 5S in current scenario. If you are facing major issues with your iPhone and it is in warranty period then there are 50% chances that you will get a new iPhone as a replacement after thorough checking of your existing iPhone.
