            "answer_text": "There are a lot of Electric vehicles on the market today . But it really depends on where you live. Many electrics are COMPLIANCE CARS only. They are made in small numbers and are only sold in certain markets. If you import one to another area you may not be able to get service or even software updates. I like to use the website Inside EVs to see what is available and how many are sold each quarter. Compare EVs: Guide To Range, Specs, Pricing & More As you can see by the list if you pull it up only Tesla is sold in high numbers and have the greatest range. The other COMPLIANCE CARS will depend on your location and needs. If you are in the Southern USA where it can get very HOT the 2 brands (Nissan and KIA/Hyundai= some models) with no liquid cooling or Battery Thermal Control would be best to stay away from. Their batteries wilt and lose capacity 10 times faster than other electrics. Their warranties won\u2019t help you most of the time. ",
