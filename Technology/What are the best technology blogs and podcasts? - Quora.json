            "answer_text": "Technology is such a wide industry - T-shirt decal printers are technology or NASA\u2019s AI that reads terabytes of space data is also technology, but no blogs or podcasts are going to cover both these topics. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re thinking \u201cmainstream\u201d stuff and consumer tech, like smartphones, computers, possibly drones and smart TVs. Given that most of these have already been answered, I\u2019ll focus on an emerging consumer tech, one which is super exciting and also bound to join the ranks of \u201cmainstream\u201d stuff sooner rather than later, and that\u2019s \u2013 voice technology. If you\u2019ve ever used an Amazon Echo or a Google Home device, or if you\u2019ve ever given your smartphone a voice command \u2013 you\u2019ve essentially used voice tech. This field is expanding at mind-boggling speeds and its potential to completely reshape how we interact with technology is astonishing. Here at Trinity Audio, we\u2019re keeping both ears to the ground on all things voice, so we've compiled a list of best voice-first podcasts. You\u2019ll find a bunch of cool stuff here, from technical analysis to opinions and news. Hope you learn something new from this - have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "I'll restrict myself to podcasts for the time being. I'm building a technology business myself and there is a fair share of technology podcasts that I listen to and enjoy. Here, I am going to share with you some of my personal favorite technology podcasts that you can take a look into. Note To Self The Note to self is one of the most popular technology-related podcasting shows which is hosted by Manoush Zomorodi which highlights everything one needs to know about maneuvering your life in this digital age. This podcast makes you look at all the sides of technology from a human\u2019s perspective, predominantly focusing on how it\u2019s affecting one\u2019s day to day life, health and their growth as well. Product Hunt radio An extension of Product Hunt, the Product Hunt Radio is a podcast channel which delves its focus on sharing everything new relating to the world of tech and digital. The main point of focus in the podcasts is to talk about the process involved that helps in shaping the applications as well as the websites we love. The podcast features several founders, investors as well as makers who share their success stories on this platform. Technology: NPR This is yet another one of the popular podcast which is conducted by the National Public Radio. Instead of longer episodes, this focuses on delivering shorter snippets encircling the latest technology news and commentaries involved. It is very amazing for people who are always on the go and need something short, crisp and snackable that they can listen to while on their way to work. The Big Web Show The Big Web Show is known around for providing the listeners with hour-long podcasts on technology and anything digital that one might want to delve into. Jeffrey Zeldman is the one hosting the show and does invite several experts in this niche to share their thoughts and stories relating to the field of technology. Some of the most popular niches that he is known for talking about include information architecture and interaction design for games. This Week in Tech Last but not least in the list has to be the veteran podcast which has been running for over a decade now. The show is hosted by Leo Laporte who invites guests to talk around about technology and the latest developments surrounding that. They do often cover some of the major headlines but the friendly banters and the spontaneity in the conversations is what makes it so amazing to listen to. If you are a hardcore tech enthusiast, you are definitely going to love each of the episodes that they share. Some of the episodes even carry on for 2 hours which is why they are best for flights and such if you are on the go and don\u2019t have a lot of time to spare around. Happy listening! ",
