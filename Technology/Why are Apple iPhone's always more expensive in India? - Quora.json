            "answer_text": "iPhones belong to the premium category of smartphones. And not just in India, they're expensive everywhere. It has been expensive since the original iPhone - which came out at $499 with contract. Apple keeps the profit margin high on its devices. It typically earns about $500 for every iPhone 6s that is sold. Coming back to India. Let us take the example of the recently launched iPhone SE. It started at $399 in the US, which equates to roughly Rs.27,000 in India. Add all the custom duties and taxes, and it goes up to Rs.31,000. They should technically sell the iPhone SE for Rs.31,000. But wait, the price for India is Rs.39,000. Logic defying? Well, it so happens that Apple does not sell iPhones directly in India. There are no Apple Stores in the country. Apple sells their devices through resellers like Colin Ingram and Redington. Also, it has premium reseller stores like Maple, Aptronix, Reliance Digital which sell their products throughout the country, and they get their stock through the main resellers. It changes hands twice before reaching the consumer.  The resellers and premium stores need to make money as well, and it reduces the profit margin of any Apple device sold. To make up for it, Apple sets the price high. That way, everyone makes money.  The fact remains that people still buy the expensive iPhones. Although Apple could still capture a huge market share by setting competitive prices, they are unlikely to do it.  The prices could come down once Apple gets permission from the Government of India to sell their devices directly, through their standalone stores. This is likely to happen soon, you can read about it here - Apple Set to Gain Approval to Open Retail Stores in India: Report Hope this answers your query satisfactorily.

            "answer_text": "Let me introduce to you the concept of Veblen good. These goods are in demand because they are overpriced. India is one of the biggest markets for Apple with immense growth potential.iPhones are an aspirational item, where the owner derives benefits from owening(and possibly flaunting ) the product rather than some real value derived out if it. Having an iPhone is a lifestyle and style statement. Apple used to make cutting edge technologically advanced phones which were ahead of the competition by two years. But no more, at best they make good to mediocre phones which have a technology lag of two years. Worst their phones have serious hardware and software issues which was unimaginable in the era of Jobs. Their design recently pure and simple sucks. This is reflected in the market when the new iPhone X launch caused a fall in their share price, $53 billion of their valuation was wiped out. The only way Apple and iPhones can remain relevant in India and China (Apple's biggest market) is by keeping the price extremely high and staying a veblen good. The moment they lower the price, aspirational factor is lost and the sales and profits will fall drastically. So iPhones are and will remain pretty expensive in India. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Apple is greedy and want to loot India like most MNCs. GST is 18% but their markup is 1.5x compared to USA, makes no sense. Even adding import duty of 12% shouldn\u2019t make it this expensive especially considering import company buy them in bulk so they probably get significant discount and have a partnership with them. Look at computer parts, they generally cost same as USA before GST and even after adding GST they are somewhat reasonable though one would say slighly overpriced but nowhere near the premium apple is charging. All major mobile brands noawdays in India have really phenomenal pricing except Apple, Google, Sony, Samsung etc. Chinese brands provide value for money products with adequate quality whereas American companies just try to maximize profit and nothing else. Indians also have this false, old and odd belief that better things usually costs more which is not true anymore as it\u2019s upto the intention of brand whether they want to provide value or being greedy and overcharge people for more than it\u2019s actual worth.

            "answer_text": "It is because the Iphones are not manufactured in India. They have to be imported. There is a 20% import duty on mobiles phones and also a 10% social welfare tax on the import duty. Plus a 18% GST in India. Let us take an example. The iphone Xs 64gb model costs $1000 in the USA. When it is brought to India the taxes paid are as follows- 20% import duty is equivalent to $200 ($1000 x 20%) 10% social welfare tax on import duty is equivalent to $20 ($200 x 10%) GST @18% on all the above costs combined is equivalent to $ 220 [18%(1000+200+20)] So the total cost after adding all the above duties comes to $ 1,440. Now lets take the value of 1$ as Rs 70 and convert. The phone costs 70,000 rupees in USA and costs Rs 1,00,800 in India. So the taxes paid to bring the phone to India increase the cost of the phone by more than 40%. ",
