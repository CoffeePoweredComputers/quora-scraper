We have been devising gadgets for as long as there have been humans and we\u2019ve been on this Earth a very long time. The gadgets we use daily today are a VERY recent thing. And if by \u201cgadgets\u201d you mean smart phones, they\u2019ve only been around in common use for about ten years or so. For the majority of my life I did just fine without the silly black rectangle in my pocket. Unsure if you intended that question to be rhetorical, but there ya go. :) ",

I would love to live like that for just the heck of it (at least for some days). Getting up with the birds chirping and going to bed by dusk. No TV, no mobile, no radio, no phone calls \u2026 how relaxing. Experience the shiver of having a cold bath, eating fresh veggies cooked on fire. Being undisturbed with your loved ones. Ooooh ! Irresistible. ",

Our way of living changes as new gadgets appear impacting our daily lives. Some times the change is unnoticeable.
