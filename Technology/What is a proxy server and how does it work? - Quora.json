            "answer_text": "What is Proxy Server? Web proxy is an intermediary between Web users and online resources. By directly accessing the website, you will submit a web request containing information about you (server or PC in use, your location, fingerprint of your browser, IP address, etc.). In response to the data sent, Web resources provide you with the content you requested. Unlike direct connections between users and websites, proxy-based connections provide a gateway for your web requests and the data you will receive from the website. The proxy server can hide or modify the data of your web request, and filter the content of the website to prevent it from obtaining unwanted information. This also guarantees you anonymous web browsing and data collection. How does it work? Every time you visit a website by clicking a link or manually entering a URL in a browser, you will create and send a web request, which will be forwarded to the proxy server. Then, the proxy server will modify and encrypt your data (such as Internet Protocol (IP) address) and send it to the web resource. After that, the website sends your data to the proxy server that processes the data, and then transmits the information from the website to you. In this way, it can be used as a firewall or web filter so that you only get the information you want to receive. Now that you have understood ``How do proxy servers work? ''The meaning of this question, let us take a closer look at what types of proxy servers exist. There are lots of proxy providers in the market but in my opinion you can check the given vendors as they are best in this field. ProxyAquaOxylabsLuminati",

            "answer_text": "In a computer network, a proxy server is any computer system offering a service that acts as an intermediary between the two communicating parties, the client and the server. In the presence of a proxy server, there is no direct communication between the client and the server. Instead, the client connects to the proxy server and sends requests for resources such as a document, web page or a file that resides on a remote server. The proxy server handles this request by fetching the required resources from the remote server and forwarding the same to the client.   If you are not convinced, lets we go down to have another way of explanation.The proxy (technically a proxy) server is a PC that may pass as a good intermediary between computer and also the web. Any visitors routed via a proxy servers will appear in the future from the Internet protocol address, not really your own computer\u2019s. Also, proxy machines do not need to commit resources in order to encrypting all visitors that passes via all of them, and for that reason can acknowledge simultaneous connections from the large number of more customers (typically many thousands)   ",
