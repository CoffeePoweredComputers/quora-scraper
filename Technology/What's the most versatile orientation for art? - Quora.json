            "answer_text": "I had a mentor, Dr. Bill Hubschmitt, who was one of the pioneers in digital visual art\u2014an early adopter of Photoshop and its predecessors. He had been a serious student of Vermeer, and once told me a funny story: He\u2019d sent a bunch of his works to a gallery for a show and they\u2019d hung a few of them upside down. This, he told me, was a sign that the works were compositionally balanced.  So a few years ago when I began working on The Frontier Project, a series of paintings about the paradox of human spaceflight, I focused on square compositions that could be hung at any orientation. This was to honor the teachings of Hubschmitt but also to refer to the directional possibilities of living off-planet.     But \u201cversatility\u201d is a word with a functional component. Versatile for what? When people buy two-dimensional visual art, no matter how idealistically, they eventually have to reckon with the question of where and how to hang the work. Most walls are rectangles, wider than tall, and for this reason landscape orientation makes the most sense for large scale works. Portraits make sense in portrait orientation, not only because that\u2019s the overall shape of a person, but also because portraits tend to either share a wall or be hung above certain furnishings such as fireplaces. If you\u2019re a commercial artist producing work for a gallery exhibition in the hopes of making sales, your best bet is to let the subject matter decide. It\u2019s okay to have variety.
