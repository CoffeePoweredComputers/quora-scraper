            "answer_text": "Is it possible to accidentally talk to Spirit\u2026 If you\u2019re thinking about someone who\u2019s recently passed, talking to him or her either out loud or in your mind \u2014Yes. But that\u2019s on purpose, not accidental. Spirit is able to use many electronic devices to get an urgent message across; You might hear a message come through your television speakers, on the car radio during a broadcast, over the telephone and/or while listening to voicemail. I\u2019ve even received messages on old YouTube videos; Was searching for a piece of old tube radio babble on YouTube; As it turns out, the bit that I randomly chose contains someone saying, \u201cHow are you Kenda?\u201d (in fact, I didn\u2019t hear it until I listened to the clip on Audacity; Stunned, I then went back and verified it was on the YT video) To further compound the weirdness, the original vid was uploaded 7 years prior, still amazed by that one. If you were talking to yourself out loud and heard someone answer you, yep that qualifies as accidentally talking to Spirit. If it only happens once then you\u2019ll count it among your unexplained experiences (When people find out what I do occasionally someone will pull me to one side and say, \u201cI\u2019d never tell anybody else this but\u2014 \u201c) If you tried to talk to Spirit and now regret it, then that\u2019s on purpose as well \u2014No backsies I\u2019m afraid, but don\u2019t worry about it; most likely Spirit knows you regret it \u2014we who actually record don\u2019t even get communication ALL of the time and some of us record every week.

            "answer_text": "I think thought and emotion are far more communal than people realize. We draw, usually unconsciously, from the vast field of human thought\u2014both that being created now and that created down through the ages. We \u201ctalk\u201d or tap into all manner of currents of thoughs that fill space. Humanity is really part of one group consciousness, one brotherhood of mind, or at the lower level, one mass consciousness. We participate without realizing it in a community of souls including those in the body and those out of it. It is our individual thought and focus of attention that tunes us in to its close correspondences in the psychic worlds .
