            "answer_text": "I don't think so. 4G phones in foreign were introduced mich before It came to India ( Thanks to JIO ) I think the same for 5G phone. There are limited number of them available now. The new technology will take time to grow up. On the contrary, It can happen that JIO launches it early. But on the safe side, 4G phones available now are great and will not be a waste of money. ",

In this year, I think 5G phones will be exclusive to flagship phones. So if you're thinking about 5G keep atleast 40K ready in the initial stages. ",
