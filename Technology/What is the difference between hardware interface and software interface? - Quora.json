            "answer_text": "A software interface allow you to access certain functionality in a system or a library without caring to the way it is implemented on the system or library side while also ensuring that if someone updates the system or the library the interface will ensure that your application will still work the same way even if there is a totally different specification on the other side. A hardware interface is a combination of mechanical electrical and logical signals that define how a piece of hardware communicates with the system basically ( and USB port for example together with the standard that governs it, SATA port etc.).
