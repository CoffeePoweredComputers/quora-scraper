            "answer_text": "Linked as in hacked? Several ways any or all of these could indicate a hacked phone: You notice apps on your phone that are new that you and your phone manufacturer or service provider did not install.Your phone is ALWAYS warm or hot to the touch even when you're no using it (because your phone IS being used by a background app or another person)You see apps suddenly turning on by themselves and shutting down really quickly like you started them and them quit them.Your phone frequently cycles on and off for no reason (this could be a memory block issue too, not always caused by hacking)Passwords are changed that you didn't changeYou haven't added a significant amount of data to your phone but you're suddenly out of storage space. Again not always indicative of hacking. Check to make sure you haven't synced your phone to install apps purchased on another device automatically (like a tablet)Your phone is suddenly so slow it's near unusable. I feel like a broken record lol but again, not always caused by hacking.You hear strange noises or crackling when taking and making phone calls.You notice charges to the App Store or worse, your bank account or credit cards that you didn't make.The most obvious: you get a message that you've been hacked and they want money to give you access to your phone again.Theres probably more red flags to look for, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. If you suspect you've been hacked there are steps you should take: your first instinct will be to change passwords. YES but do it on ANOTHER DEVICE not your phone. If you're hacked they'll be able to see the new password if you use your phone.Go into settings and wipe your phone. Hopefully you've already backed it up or are able to wireless back it up. DO NOT connect the device to your computer to back it up unless you are able to use a computer that has no info on it that a hacker would want. If you connect a hacked device to another device there's a good chance the hacker will then take control of that computer.I suggest a clean install and manually adding anything you want on the phone back onto it. If you install from a backup AFTER the hacker had access, they can probably still access your phone.Ways hackers can get into your phone (aka have you done these recently?): used free wifi AND logged into sensitive sites like bank accounts. Sometimes they will control a wifi hotspot and give you a fraudulent erosion of the site your visiting in order to obtain your passwordsUsed a public charging station. Apparently hackers can get into your phone through the USB cables now too.Answered any suspicious emails or gone to a phishing website by accident.Jail broken your phone and/or installed apps that were not in the iTunes or google play store.Again, I'm sure there's more things I'm missing in this list, but hopefully this will get you started in figuring out what is going on. If you have an apple device, the Genius Bar will assist you, regardless of whether your phone is still covered by a warranty or not, in determine whether or not you are indeed hacked. Not sure about android phones though, I think you're on your own if that's the phone you have. Good luck! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that everything is okay! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I'm not sure what actually is the question but if u want to know about someone spying you through your phone, this might help Someone borrowed or took your phone, they may have installed phone control app that you might never know The app shows up with the name \u201cAndroid System\u201d in the applications manager so it doesn\u2019t look suspicious. If you think someone could do something like this when you\u2019re not with your phone, secure your phone with a passcode that isn\u2019t easy to guess.Your phone is acting weirdly, Taking long time to reboot or shutting down, lighting up for no reason, suddenly getting much shorter battery life or running hot when you\u2019re not using it may indicate hidden processes are running in the background.Your data usage skyrockets for no reason, This could be because your phone is checking in with someone else, using GPS and sending them text messages or emails that communicate where you are and what you\u2019re doing.Once you got attack the best thing to do is factory reset, once you reset you will lose your data stored in the phone. You can backup your data but who knows one of your data has the same Spyware. After reset use strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access to your phone. There are free apps (app notifier for Android phone), which will email you when any apps are loaded or installed onto your phone. Hope this help, if not please make the question clear n simple\u2026.

            "answer_text": "You can have spyware installed on your phone. This cannot be done remotely - someone has to hold the phone and do it. It is difficult, but not impossible to remove this stuff. If you are thinking someone down the street can type in some magic password and suddenly all your text messages, emails and phone calls show up on their phone - forget it. This does not happen, cannot happen and phone companies have taken severe steps in the last 20 years to make sure the \u201ccloning\u201d that occurred in the 1990s never, ever happens again. Your phone cannot be \u201csynched\u201d with another device. There are substantial security measures in place to make sure things like this cannot happen. With spyware it is possible that everything your phone does is recorded and forwarded to someone at a later time. It does not occur in real time. But someone would get a report listing all of your text messages, for instance. It is illegal to do this with a phone you do not own, and if caught, the person installing this spyware could face a long time in prison. It is legal for a company phone to have this installed so the company knows how their property is being used. However, this isn\u2019t cheap to do as there is a subscription cost for receiving the information which can be as high as $50 a month. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other 2 answers. There are three other possibilities: (1) look in your phone settings under Connections - is Phone visibility turned on? If so, turn it off when you do not need it! (2) also in your phone's settings, look under Mobile Hotspot and Tethering. Are any toggles showing they are turned on (slid to the right)? Is Mobile Hotspot turned on? Is Bluetooth Tethering turned on? If either is on, turn them off when you do not need them! (3) also in your phone's settings, look under More Connection Settings: is Nearby Device Scanning turned on? If you do not regularly use any of the above, then them off when not in use. It may seem to be a pain to need to do any of the above but if you suspect that your phone has been hacked or linked to another without your permission and you cannot find any other solution to the problem, then unfortunately it is a pain that you will have to get used to.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to tell 100% but it is possible. I believe what they could see after linking the phones depends on what you have toggled to be stored in the cloud. I myself just noticed that when I went to send an email to my mother in-law and I typed in the first letter in her name so I could pick it from the drop down list. Well she came up but not her name. Instead it said \u201cmom\u201d. Well I have a mom and that is how I have her in my phone\u2026..mom. I wouldn\u2019t have put my mother in-laws name as mom. So then I started at A and worked my way to Z. All the names that I know were not my contacts but were my boyfriends all had a i with a circle.The only thing that I have backed up to the cloud is my mail. So I\u2019m guessing that is all that he could get assuming he used the cloud to link the phone. The same would happen if you were to try it on text messaging and contact list. That is sure fire way to know for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, this can\u2019t happen, because of the way that carrier network and network security work. That being said, it is possible for the network to get a glitch and connect your phone number with someone else\u2019s phone number. When that happens, you will likely get calls from people that are not intending to call you, and people who you know might try to call you and get someone strange. When this happens, the way to correct it is to contact your carrier, explain what\u2019s happening, and they can do some computer magic to straighten things out. If you are using iPhone, it is possible for multiple people to sign into the same AppleID account. This is strongly recommended against, and can cause no end of confusion. I\u2019ve seen this happen mostly with non-technical people and older customers. Ever since Apple made it possible to use Family Sharing to share purchases between different AppleID accounts, the use of one AppleID for multiple users has gone WAY down. Now, that all said, if someone maliciously cloned your phone (virtually impossible except by expensive equipment and a LOT of technical knowledge) there is not a lot that you can do other than monitor your phone bill to look for strange phone numbers being called.
