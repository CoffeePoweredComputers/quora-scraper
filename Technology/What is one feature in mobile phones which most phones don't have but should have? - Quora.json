            "answer_text": "Infrared Blasters. They used to exist in most smartphones, less Apple 5 years ago. They still do, in some Huawei and Xiaomi phones. It\u2019s a feature nobody really knows the value of unless they actually use it. An example. Back in my school, all the classrooms were air-conditioned, yet the remote is always missing. We would often spend the first 5 minutes of the lesson trying to beg, borrow and steal the remote from another class. The worst part is that there were several brands of aircons in the school. There was Daikin, Mitsubishi, Carrier just to name a few. Sometimes we couldn\u2019t find a suitable remote and would just give up. Unbearable in 35\u00b0C weather in Singapore. Annoying. One day, I remembered my old phone, a HTC One M7, had an IR blaster and promptly brought it to school the next day.  The IR blaster is integrated into the power button, a smart design imo. The remote app on the M7 didn\u2019t support Carrier aircons, but it had a feature where it could record the IR pulses from an actual remote, so that soon became a non-issue. I have no idea why phone companies decided to remove it. This, along with the headphone jack removal baffles me. Yes, phones in 2019 are light years ahead of those just 5 years ago, yet they are less utilitarian than their ancestors. I\u2019m glad to see IR blasters coming back in Huawei and Xiaomi phones. However just like the headphone jack, it could be taken away from us overnight. Cheers to more utilitarian phones. The things we use frequently in our lives should focus more on function than form.

            "answer_text": "The 3.5 mm headphone jack, without doubt. And it\u2019s not even a legacy feature that was admonished from smartphone years ago. It\u2019s a recent \u201ctrend\u201d that has caught on, seeing the headphone jack disappear from modern-day smartphones starting with flagships.  Manufacturers come up with all sorts of weird reasons to justify their exclusion of the jack. OnePlus, for instance, reasoned that they ditched the jack in the OnePlus 6T to make way for the in-display fingerprint reader[1] . And yet, there exist a plethora of smartphones with a fingerprint sensor embedded under the display that also include the jack[2] . Samsung opined that removing the jack gave them room to include an extra 100 mAh and the haptic vibration system[3] . The less said about this excuse, the better. The truth is, it all began with Apple\u2019s \u201cbold\u201d move to do away with the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, a move that Apple Vice President of Worldwide \u201cMarketing\u201d Phil Schiller boiled down to one word: \u201ccourage\u201d. Their penchant for getting rid of tech that works to replace it with newer tech just so they can make some more moolah got the better of them. Just look at how sales of Air-Pods have gone up after the removal of the jack. Flagship manufacturers are known to copy Apple just to stay in the \u201ctrend\u201d. First it was the Face ID, then the notch and now the removal of the 3.5 mm jack. What Apple does, we must too. And companies like Google have even begun making their own ear-buds, likely influenced by Apple\u2019s Air-Pods. History has shown that slimmer phones with all sorts of fancy tech can be made by keeping the headphone jack intact. As such, this move of removing it reeks of a sheer herd mentality; after a point, smartphone manufacturers remove the jack from their devices only because everyone else is. So yeah, that\u2019s one feature I\u2019d like to see back in mainstream smartphones. It\u2019ll probably either be a while before it is reintroduced as a \u201cnew feature\u201d or perhaps, we\u2019re well past the day and age where that 3.5 mm hole used to be a standard thing on these slabs of glass.
