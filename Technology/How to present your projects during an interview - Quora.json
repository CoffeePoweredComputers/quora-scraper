            "answer_text": "An interview is your one shot to market yourself as best as you can. Be OVERLY prepared. That means, yes, you\u2019ll want to be able to showcase projects you\u2019ve completed. Here\u2019s how to do it: Binder/Folder- You can never go wrong with the classics! Bringing a binder filled with your projects (writings, graphic design, etc.) is an excellent way for recruiters to see the quality work you produce! Don\u2019t put EVERYTHING in your binder. Only select the top 3 projects you want to showcase to them! Also, some interviewers want to keep the binders to get a better look at your work later on, so don\u2019t give them your final copy of work. Fill your binders with copies instead of the original version of your project.Phone/IPad- If your work can only be seen digitally, provide the tech! Have your IPad/Phone ready! If you don\u2019t prepare your tech beforehand, you may have trouble connecting to WiFi, finding the file, or downloading. Recruiters only have a limited amount of time so don\u2019t waste it. Prepare everything the night before so your Ipad/Phone is ready to show off your work! Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash ",
