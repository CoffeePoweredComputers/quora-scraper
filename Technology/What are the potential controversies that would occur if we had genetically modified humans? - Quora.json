            "answer_text": "If we get into a scenario where we can genetically modify humans and make them \"perfect,\" then only perfect people would be allowed to live.  Imperfections would be eradicated from the gene pool.  Anyone found with a genetic imperfection would be terminated.  Life would not be valued for humanity, it would be valued for perfection. If you can't imagine what this would look like, read \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley.  I first read this book in high school, and it so touched me that I've re-read it at least annually.  This book is a classic, and it discusses exactly what you have asked.  So if you really want to know what could happen if we allow genetic modification of humans, read that book. ",
