            "answer_text": "Condenser refers to the type of microphone and cardioid refers to the directionality or the pickup pattern of the microphone. Microphones convert audio waves into electrical signals and there are several types of microphones, one of which is condenser microphone. The condenser type uses a charged capacitor to vary the output voltage of the microphone corresponding to the amplitude of the input audio wave. All microphones do not pick up sound equally from all directions. The pickup pattern, also called as the polar pattern defines the directional space surrounding the microphone in which it is most sensitive. Cardioid pattern is one of the 4 basic polar patterns. It is called cardioid because the pattern looks like a heart when plotted two dimensionally.  Cardioid pickup pattern when the mic is pointing in the +y axis placed at the centre. ",
