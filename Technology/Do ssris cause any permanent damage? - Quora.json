            "answer_text": "Sure, but we do not know how often. We can and do observe permanent damage induced by SSRIs in some people, but we do not know much about all the changes, short and long term, that antidepressants cause and very rarely go looking for damages that might be present. Even if people die after taking them, there is rarely significant investigation into the role antidepressants could have played\u2014-including abnormal circumstances like suicide despite suicidality being a side effect many people experience when taking antidepressants like SSRIs. So, there are definitely instances where permanent damage is verified. However, we do not recognize or report many of the times it happens within our limited scope of detection, and we do not know enough about the human body and the side effects of SSRIs to say how much damage occurs and in how many people, especially when extending beyond that limited scope. It might be that smaller damages which still leave people reasonably functional occur in many or most patients, and science will probably not have an answer about that for a long time\u2014-we will probably stop using these drugs before we achieve the level of understanding and expertise necessary to more fully comprehend their risks.  Additionally, it seems like a lot of the dysfunction and severe problems caused by taking or discontinuing SSRIs is about bodily conditions that can be altered over time\u2014-not permanent damage. The side effects and withdrawal effects of antidepressants can be entirely disabling or even deadly without being permanent or involving actual cell death, so one\u2019s concerns in taking or tapering medications like antidepressants should be of a scope much more inclusive than \u201cdamage\u201d or \u201cpermanent damage\u201d. Also, side effects or problems can be permanent without entailing permanent damage in the sense of abnormal and irreparable cell death. As I started off mentioning, some side effects of antidepressants can potentially involve permanent damage, like serotonin syndrome (as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, cholinergic storm, etc), seizures, strokes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, organ failure (especially heart, kidney, liver), abortion, birth defects, growth defects in children as well as adults, tinnitus, etc. But, some of the serious and potentially debilitating or endangering side effects do not necessarily require damage of any sort\u2014-and some of them can be long term or permanent changes spanning the physical, biochemical, functional, and even epigenetic. These drugs change how your body regulates and manages itself, which is part of why the range of side effects is so vast and some people end up dead or permanently injured whereas some people end up no worse for wear.  In summary: there are more worrisome and prevalent risks and dangers involved in taking SSRIs than \u201cpermanent damage\u201d, but permanent damage is a possibility as well. Not everyone will respond in the same manner, and the medical attention you receive will not be likely to minimize your risks or provide you with sufficiently informed consent so an independent and proactive approach to finding care should be a priority.
