            "answer_text": "Yes, Samsung Galaxy M51 is worth buying because the phone has massive 7,000 mAh battery, powerful Snapdragon 730g processor, impressive camera setup, best display quality. The phone has everything which normal users are looking for in a smartphone, so yes Galaxy M51 is value for money smartphone and you can buy this phone without any doubt. The phone has some cons like it has only 60Hz screen refresh rate while Snapdragon 730g processor would be a great option but the phone also has 7,000 mAh battery and great display quality, so I think it\u2019s a balanced smartphone. Talking about Galaxy M51 competition, we have Realme X3 and Oneplus Nord both of this phones are priced at 25k. Realme X3 has a LCD display and average kind of cameras while OnePlus Nord is not available at 25k, you have to spend 27k to get OnePlus Nord. There is no news when the OnePlus Nord 6GB + 64GB variant will be made available. Also, Realme X3 is powered by Snapdragon 855+ processor which is way more powerful than what Samsung is offering. Now let me help you to choose a better phone.  If you want a smartphone for gaming then don\u2019t think much and just go with Realme X3 because this phone has Snapdragon 855+ processor and 120Hz screen refresh rate. In short, Realme X3 is the best option for gamers. Now if you want a bigger battery, best display quality, good cameras setup, and non-Chinese smartphone then Galaxy M51 is a good option. Also, you won\u2019t get the best performance like Realme X3 but everything else on Galaxy M51 is just amazing. By the way, you can play games on Galaxy M51, there is nothing to worry about performance but it won\u2019t be as good as Realme X3. In short, to get something you have to lose something. First decide, whether you want best display or best performance or Chinese or non-Chinese. I think you got your answer but still, I would say Galaxy M51 is a better option because I always go with AMOLED panel rather than 120Hz LCD panel. I also don\u2019t play many games on mobile, so I will be happy with the Snapdragon 730g but if you want best gaming experience then don\u2019t think about Galaxy M51, just go with Realme X3 or OnePlus Nord.

            "answer_text": "Hi there! Thanks for asking. Samsung M51 is a good phone, but in my view it is priced a bit higher. The price should have been around 23k Rs, however HDFC card can avail you a discount of 2000Rs. Let me tell about its features:- Build Quality- You shouldn\u2019t expect great build quality from Samsung Budget Phones. It is the worst in this price range where you get a cheap plastic back, plastic frame and Gorilla Glass 3. This is simply unacceptable in this price range. You can get phones with a better build quality\u2026Display- Great Screen. This phone Offers one of the best screens in this price range- 6.7\u2033 Super Amoled+ display, The only better display in this price range is the OnePlus Nord with Super Amoled Display along with 90Hz refresh rate.Battery- Best battery in a phone ever, no more comments. However, charging speed could have been better because it takes nearly 2hrs to charge fully.Camera- Smasung phones offer good cameras and M51 is no different. M51 takes great pictures, selfie and videos when compared to others in this price range.Performance- M51 offers decent performance in this price range with Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G. You can get better performing phones like Realme X3 or the OnePlus Nord.So, if you are looking for a phone to watch content on, then you can go with this phone without any confusion. Otherwise you can look for other phones like OnePus Nord or Realme X3. Do let me know if you want to know more about them\u2026 If you read this far, then thank you for your patience\u2026 Thanks again! ",
