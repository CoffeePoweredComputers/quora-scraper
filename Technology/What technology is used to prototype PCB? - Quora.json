            "answer_text": "Hi, . . OK, there are many ways. . . But I drew out a circuit, using a simple CAD software, then pasted it into a Word document, actually many copies, together with a scale ruler.. . The PCB manufacturing company, then photographed my Word document and used the film, to photo-etch the copper board. .. . The first board I made on cardboard, poking the components through the holes and soldering the leads.. . This was to prove the circuit worked. . . Then they made some 50 such boards, then another company assembled them for me\u2026 . Then I was able to build them in to the units and sell them.. . . Which reminds me, some rather complex radio channeling equipment was not made for our telephone application.. . So I made up the hybrids on cardboard, and they were then fitted into the equipment, which then worked in time for the opening ceremony. ",

            "answer_text": "Originally, an actual silkscreen printing process was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used instead. Normally the screen printing is not significant to the function of the PCBA. A minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a breakout board. ",
