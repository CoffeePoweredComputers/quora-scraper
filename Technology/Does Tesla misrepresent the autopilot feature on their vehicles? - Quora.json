            "answer_text": "I own a Model 3 with Enhanced Autopilot, and I\u2019m looking forward to the release of full self driving capability in the near future. As others have stated, it\u2019s impossible to use Autopilot and not know about its limitations. Autopilot works very well within those limitations. Before I had my Model 3, I thought I\u2019d be rather apprehensive about using it. I was at first, but it quickly became a favorite feature this car. Tesla makes it very clear that the responsibility for controlling the car is mine alone. As long as I keep my hand on the wheel and pay attention to the traffic around me, Autopilot is safe to use, and I use it often because it helps reduce driving stress and fatigue. Driving on the interstate highway system is where Autopilot really shines. It works so well that there is a tendency to trust Autopilot a little too much. I appreciate the \u2018nudges\u2019 that the car gives me when it detects that I might not be doing my part as driving \u2018supervisor\u2019. These nudges (often referred to as \u2018nags\u2019) happen at time intervals that shorten as speed increases. If I remain attentive, it\u2019s easy to avoid getting these warnings. If I find myself being warned often, I know it\u2019s time to call it a day. The public perception that Autopilot is being misrepresented by Tesla is a media fabrication. Frankly, I find that the media\u2019s coverage of all things Tesla to be grossly inaccurate. The public\u2019s interest in anything Tesla is exploited by the media as \u2018click bait\u2019 to attract attention, and, therefore, advertising revenue. The truth about Autopilot is that it makes driving a Tesla safer. Tesla claims that using Autopilot reduces the probability of death by 30% through accident avoidance, and NHTSA crash data appear to support that claim. My own experience using Autopilot bears that out. It really does make driving the freeways safer, but you\u2019d never know it by media reports that focus on the rare instances when a Tesla car is involved in an accident or fire. Shame. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a Tesla owner. I\u2019ve driven both Tesla Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot over the past two years. I use it daily. I also pay a great deal of attention to Tesla press releases, internet discussions of Autopilot, and I have read the Owner\u2019s manual for both the Model S and the Model 3. I\u2019ve taken delivery of two Tesla cars. I think I have about as good an ideal of what Tesla says about its products as anybody. Nowhere does Tesla misrepresent Autopilot. Particularly relevant to the accident reported in the question link, the Model 3 Owners Manual says: Warning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down Model 3. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death. 40,000 Americans died in traffic accidents in 2017. You don\u2019t see questions about them on Quora. It\u2019s just Tesla that makes the news. Any power tool has risk if operated unsafely. That applies to a car that can travel 80 mph (in the case of the linked story) or my miter saw that can cut off a finger in the blink of an eye. But let me ask, how many cars can crash into a stationary object at 80 mph and the driver live to file a lawsuit? Pretty damn safe car, I think. Updated to add: Those in the Tesla owner community remember Jason Brown, the first person to die in an accident where Autopilot was involved. In 2016 he drove under the side of a semi trailer that had come from a side road. What human paying attention would drive into something that big? The car at that time relied on vision, and there was little contrast between the large blank white space of the semi trailer and the sky. Tesla did three things in response: They used RADAR more heavily in the decision to make an emergency stop.They added nags to drivers, forcing them to keep their hands on the wheel, or the car would stop after repeated warnings.They became very explicit and deliberate in all of their communications as to what Autopilot was and what it was not, including repeated warnings that the driver had to pay attention.Before a Tesla driver can use the Autopilot feature, they must agree to the following:  In this most recent incident the driver was going at least 10 mph over the speed limit (70 is the highest legal speed in Florida). When was the last time you encountered a vehicle stopped in its lane on an interstate highway in 70\u201380 mph traffic? I\u2019ve never seen such a thing. We don\u2019t even know whether Autopilot was even turned on. It\u2019s entirely possible that the car in front swerved to miss the stalled vehicle, and the Tesla had no time to stop. In fact, it may be that the Tesla did initiate emergency braking and the impact was mitigated, explaining why the driver survived at all. Who knows what the real story is? Someone suing Tesla is not going to be an objective source of information. Tesla wasn\u2019t able to look at the vehicle data recorder. ",
