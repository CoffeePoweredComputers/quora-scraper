            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very good idea. And, as I see it, there are 2 parts to this: The mirror (which you can find by going online and searching for \u201cApple Smart Mirror.\u201d - or go to YouTube and search for \u201cHow to build your own smart mirror\u201d) andThe software to run in the smart mirror.Many people are trying to create products that do just as you describe, but with typically poor results. Why? I\u2019m admittedly a novice with this industry, but I have done some research based on a similar idea I had years ago. The problems that I unearthed are: Clothing manufacturers do not have a uniform standard in size measurement. An example would be a ladies size 6 from company A is not the same as a size 6 from company B. So people have had difficulty showing how company As 6 will look on you vs company Bs 6. So much so, that the image of you portrayed is not accurate. Which = bad product.Accurately portraying clothing fits over different body sizes. Every person\u2019s body is different. From arm lengths to shoulder size, from chest width to belly girth, and from butt to leg lengths, the variation is infinite. Technology developers have been trying to create a system that can accommodate portraying these differences digitally for decades. There have been some patents issued, so I would check any solution I came up with against the http://USPTO.org website and search for patents. (The site\u2019s search engine is terrible, creating an absolute ton of reading - but you have to do it). But to my knowledge, none of the patents that had been issued up to 7 years ago appeared to offer a satisfactorily successful and easy, turn-key, product. I say \u201ceasy\u201d because there were already quite a few products out there that require\u2026.Significant time investment to create a digital archive of all the clothes a person has in their wardrobe. The usual technologies ask you to take a snapshot of you, in each clothing item, in an identical stance, in an identical location, and preferably, at an identical time of day (For lighting purposes). The problem is that very few people are interested in spending the time to create the archive - which creates a very small niche market - which makes scaling difficult.Digital representations of color on a screen are not necessarily the same as what the human eye sees in real life, so matching digital images of varied clothing items mat not give you an accurate representation of how those matched clothes will look in real life.People change. Our weights fluctuate based on activity levels, diets, and even seasons (we all seem to gain weight over the holidays - and trim down for summer). This can make our clothing fit us differently, rendering entire image archives outdated.The primary reason that you don\u2019t see a lot of products that solve this problem is that, because of the reasons above, any technology that needs to be developed requires Hundreds of Thousands, if not Millions, of Dollars. And there\u2019s not many people who can swing that price tag, and are willing to risk that amount of cash, on a start-up. But you may have a very low-cost, viable solution. I wish you all the best.

            "answer_text": "Note, I\u2019ve not done this - this answer is more along the line of the types of requirements-gathering that would need to be done to accomplish this goal. You will need at least one (probably more than one) camera to get a decent digital representation of the person \u201cin the mirror\u201d. You will need some way of accurately [enough] numerically representing the person in the \u201cmirror\u201d for size (height, proportion, etc). You will need to have accurate dimensions of every piece of clothing you want to offer the ability of \u201cvirtual try-on\u201d for. You will need to \u201cknow\u201d how the clothes look from different angles (the person IS going to want to be able to turn and see the clothes follow his/her body as it moves). You will need someway of displaying the clothes as an overlay on the person in \u201cthe mirror\u201d - which will either necessitate they wear very little in their \u201cvirtual try-on room\u201d, or that you can computationally \u201cremove\u201d their clothing for purposes of the \u201cvirtual try-on\u201d. Good luck. ",
