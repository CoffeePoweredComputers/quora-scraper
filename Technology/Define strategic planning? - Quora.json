            "answer_text": "Defining it is simple.  The essence of strategic planning is turning a strategy into a plan.  Not deciding on goals or strategy.  That is up to the strategists, the leaders, the decision makers.  The function of a strategic planner is - or should be - to turn a strategy into a plan of action and to articulate that plan so that people in different parts of the organization will know what is expected of them, how their success or failure will be evaluated, how all of that will change over time, and how their roles fit into the overall plan. Unfortunately, a lot of SPs (or their bosses) confuse strategy with planning.  Defining goals and developing strategies is and always will be an executive function.  Planning is a staff function.  The skills and temperament that make people good at one seldom make them good at the other. The other common error is to confuse SP with tactics.  No SP should ever try to make long-range detailed microplans.  Planning at the tactical level has to be local and short-term.  Long-range plans need to be much more general and much more flexible about resources and methods. Is there a feedback loop between SPs and their bosses?  Of course.  Strategy and planning together make up a highly iterative process.  Often we know that we are developing a plan just so the decision maker(s) can see whether their grand ideas can be turned into something that looks like it would work.  Earlier in the process, we often outline alternatives and make suggestions.  Further down the road, we can and often do point out problems with a strategy and suggest variations. And at many points in the process, we gather, filter, and communicate trend data, forecasts, systems models, and other information that will help them design viable strategies or modify existing ones as needed.  In a small organization, the SP often also gathers intelligence, builds models, does forecasting, analyzes internal capabilities, and provides other decision support for the boss. But, in general, trained professional SPs who fancy themselves as master strategists are fooling themselves.  If not, they're in the wrong business and they should switch to the executive track so they can learn the leadership skills to go with their strategic abilities. Note:  I'm obviously not talking here about the person on the executive track who does a stint as VP of Strategic Planning.  That's a good opportunity for a future top gun to get a look at the whole enterprise and to learn about the planning process, but it doesn't turn him or her into a real SP. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, in the following I describe you what \u201cStrategic Planning\u201d means to me. It is an organizational management activity that is used to focus energy and resources, set priorities, ensure that employees and other stakeholders are working toward common goals, establish agreement around intended outcomes/results, strengthen operations, and assess and adjust the organization\u2019s direction in response to a changing environment. It is a disciplined effort that produces fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide : What an organization is?Who it serves?What it does?Why it does it?Effective strategic planning articulates not only where an organization is going and the actions needed to make progress, but also how it will know if it is successful.  Strategic management is the comprehensive collection of ongoing activities and processes that organizations use to systematically coordinate and align resources and actions with mission, vision and strategy throughout an organization. These activities transform the static plan into a system that provides strategic performance feedback to decision making and enables the plan to evolve and grow as requirements and other circumstances change. There are many different frameworks and methodologies for strategic planning and management. While there are no absolute rules regarding the right framework, most follow a similar pattern and have common attributes.Many frameworks cycle through some variation on some very basic phases are: Analysis or assessment, where an understanding of the current internal and external environments is developed.Strategy formulation, where high level strategy is developed and a basic organization level strategic plan is documented.Strategy execution, where the high level plan is translated into more operational planning and action items.Evaluation management phase, where ongoing refinement and evaluation of performance, culture, communications, data reporting, and other strategic management issues occurs. I really hope these informations could be helpful for you and for everyone who want to start working or building a businnes following a specific Strategic Planning. I also suggest you to watch this video to clarify your ideas about Strategic Planning. It was very useful in my case! ;-) Federico Fort ",

            "answer_text": "When I was last in corporate life, one of my job titles (I thought about having LEDs on my business card so I could change the description for each different environment) was Strategic Marketing Director EMEA and India - and as most of my role was actually firefighting, I seriously considered making myself Tactical Marketing Director. That introduction explains what for me is the difference. Strategy is longer term - in Private Equity companies that I\u2019ve worked for as a consultant long term amazingly enough turned out to be four weeks so it is a relative term - and tactics are the wriggles and more serious changes you have to make to address different circumstances from those anticipated. One real example of a strategy might help. We were bringing a radical concept to the market through a mobile app. We had applied for patents but recognised that this was at best a warning shot and not going to stop fast followers if we were successful. (Can you imagine whether we could have afforded to take on say Apple if they infringed our patents?) Patents also have different coverage depending upon jurisdiction. The strategy I developed was to have a development plan for the app and the business that added more and more features faster than anyone else - so we were in fact out-thinking the competition. The tactics were choosing which of the newer features we would bring into the market first, for example. There is a view, with a good deal of intellectual weight behind it that the gradual adoption - and that\u2019s quite interesting in itself - of agile techniques in business means that strategy is really dead. (For a brilliant and succinct overview of what this means in practice and how to implement it, see Robert Morley\u2019s book, Agile in Business.) In fact I have come to the conclusion now that actually the role of strategy is actually far more important because of agile, as there has to be an over-riding sense of direction. I think the real change is that strategy is no longer - if it ever was - set in place for twelve months and then followed through to the end of a set period. (I\u2019ve worked in corporate life where this did happen.) It begins to look more like a tactical response - but actually it is still necesssary to have that strategic thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "Strategic Planning is the creation of a \u201cplan\u201d or roadmap to take an organization from the current state of business to an ideal state. Strategic Planning can be conducted by a number of parties within an organization and is often outsourced to specialized consultants as well. There are several different planning methodologies for creating a strategic plan, such as Balanced Scorecard, A3, OKRs, and more. Each has its own different pros and cons. The important thing to consider when creating a plan, besides the end goal, is which type of methodology works best for your organization and culture. Every organization has its own unique culture that may impact the way Planning is both conducted and executed. A few basic tips to include when creating your strategic plan: Cascading levels of objectives, goals or projects \u2014 this ensures alignment throughout an organization, keeping individuals strategic instead of busy.Assign a sole responsible person \u2014 holding people accountable is often difficult in organizations. Assigning a task to several individuals, essentially assigns it to no one.Track a metric (if possible) \u2014 it's a lot easier to measure success with a KPI or quantifiable number. If not, at least collect uniform status updates.Collect updates \u2014 don't let your plan collect dust, ensure updates are collected at a regular frequency (monthly/quarterly). Enough to track progress over time and pivot if needed, but not too many updates.Review and Revise! \u2014 a strategic plan should be a living document. Treat it similar to financials that are reviewed and forecasted regularly. The more you discuss your strategic plan, the more serious employees will take it and the more successful you will be.Best of luck in your Strategic Planning process. And don't let all your hard work in Planning go to waste with poor execution of your plans. Jonathan ",

            "answer_text": "A good strategic plan separates the 'strategic' from the 'plan'. The problem with strategy nowadays is that we use the word to make any activity sound interesting or important, so it has lost its meaning. The right way to do it is to define with strategic choice through a strategic planning session, then write a plan . A strategic planning session evaluates and understands your unique capabilities (core competencies), market opportunities, competitors, market dynamics, customer segment profitability and other key data points to develop strategic choices. The goal is to choose a strategy of 'where to play and how to win': what markets will you serve (which customers, which geographies, etc.) and what will be your main competitive advantage behind which you will focus your efforts to differentiate, This is your strategy. Once you have your strategy you work on your plan. The plan is a document that outlines a set of co-dependent activities, with dates, resources, people responsible, budgets, etc. All these activities should support the strategy. The plan must outline specific goals and milestones. Goals must be SMART: specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound. A plan without a strategy is a list of activities with no clear goal. A strategy without a plan is a dream. I hope this helps you ",

            "answer_text": "Strategic planning is a management process that is used to set priorities, focus people and resources, look beyond today, ensure that employees and other stakeholders are pushing in the same direction. It is an organized and disciplined effort that produces fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization is, who it serves, what it does, and why it does it, with a focus on the future. Usually the leaders of the organization, along with the best subject matter experts, are involved in the execution of the process. Some organizations also use an external facilitator to manage the process so that it produces the best results. The document that the process produces is called the Strategic Plan. What is a Strategic Plan? A strategic plan is a document used to communicate with the organization the organizations vision for the future, its mission within that vision, the goals it wants to achieve within the mission, and the strategies, tactics, and actions needed to achieve those goals. All of these elements are developed during the strategic planning exercise. In developing the strategic plan, strategic management and strategy execution are also key discussion items. What is Strategic Management? Strategic management is the series of ongoing activities and processes that companies use to coordinate and align resources and actions with the mission, vision and strategy throughout an organization. Without this requirement, the steps needed to make the strategic plan a success would be missing. Strategic management activities transform the static plan into a system that provides strategic performance feedback to decision making and enables the plan to evolve and grow as requirements and other circumstances change. Said another way, the plan elements must be tracked for actual vs. original intent so that variances can be assessed and process changes made. What is Strategy Execution? Strategy Execution is basically the way how strategic management is implemented on a systematic basis. Many companies have a strategic planning department or group to ensure this execution receives the proper priority and focus. What Are the Steps in Strategic Planning & Management? There are many different frameworks and methodologies for strategic planning and management. While there are no absolute rules regarding the right framework, most follow a similar pattern and have common attributes. Many frameworks cycle through some variation on some very basic phases: 1) analysis or assessment, where an understanding of the current internal and external environments is developed, 2) strategy formulation, where high level strategy is developed and a basic organization level strategic plan is documented 3) strategy execution, where the high level plan is translated into more operational planning and action items, and 4) evaluation or sustainment / management phase, where ongoing refinement and evaluation of performance, culture, communications, data reporting, and other strategic management issues occurs.

The process also includes establishing the sequence in which those goals should fall so that the organization is enabled to reach its stated vision. Strategic planning process Organizations generally look three to five years ahead when engaged in strategic planning. The strategic planning process results in a strategic plan, a document that articulates both the decisions made about the organization's goals and the ways in which the organization will achieve those goals. The strategic plan is intended to guide the organization's leaders in their decision-making moving forward. The strategic planning framework and committee A strategic planning committee typically leads this process. Experts in the strategic planning discipline say the strategic planning committee should include representatives from all areas within the enterprise and it should work in an open and transparent way where information is documented from start to finish. The strategic planning committee works by researching and gathering the information required to understand the organization's current status as well as the factors that will impact it in the future. The committee should solicit input and feedback to validate or challenge its assessment of the information. The strategic planning committee can opt to use one of many different methodologies that have been developed to guide leaders through this process. These methodologies, or frameworks, move the strategic planning committee through a series of steps that include an analysis or assessment stage; the formulation of the actual strategy; and the articulation and communication of the actions needed to move the organization toward its strategic vision. nother piece of this process is the creation of benchmarks that will allow the organization to determine how well it is performing against goals and objectives as it implements the strategic plan. In addition, this planning process should determine which executives are accountable for ensuring that benchmarking activities take place at planned times and also for ensuring that certain and specific objectives are met. Strategic management Organizations that are most effective in aligning their ongoing actions with their strategic plans are those that actively engage in strategic management. Strategic management establishes a set of ongoing practices to ensure that the organization's processes and allotment of resources support the vision established in the strategic plan. In the simplest terms, strategic management is the implementation of the strategy; as such, strategic management is also sometimes referred to as strategy execution. Strategic planning is more than a step-by-step exercise, however. It requires individuals capable of strategic thinking, that is, individuals who can take information and offer insights on how that information can influence or impact the future organization. Moreover, strategic planning differs from long-range planning. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, long-range planning is based on the idea that the organization's present understanding of the future is reliable enough to ensure that the stated long-range plan can be achieved. Strategic plans, on the other hand, recognize that many elements in the future are unknown and that the organization needs to be flexible while still working toward achieving the strategic plan's stated vision. Given that distinction, successful organizations opt to view their strategic plans not as static roadmaps but as living documents that need to be revisited on a regular timetable as determined by the organization. Benefits of strategic planning Strategic planning has many benefits. It forces organizations to be aware of future opportunities and challenges. It also forces organizations to understand what resources will be needed to seize upon or overcome those opportunities and challenges. Additionally, strategic planning gives individuals a sense of direction and marshals them around a common mission. It creates standards and accountability. Strategic planning also helps organizations limit or avoid time spent on crisis management, where they're reacting to unexpected changes that they failed to anticipate and/or prepare for. https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/strategic-planning ",

This umbrella term covers just about every process carried out in an organization including setting priorities, placing specific goals and working towards them, fortifying operations and ensuring that employees and stakeholders work towards a common goal. It is an iterative approach, but overall continual; even after results are obtained, the work continues. For instance, the process of establishing agreements occurs after obtaining the results, following which evaluating the outcomes and adjusting the direction of flow if need be, takes place. An organization must consider not only the direction in which they are headed and the required activities to do so, but also predicting if they will be victorious. Read More\u2026 ",

The customer has to be comfortable with the design; otherwise, they will not be fully supportive of the new design.

If they hold out and stick to the revolutionary design, it may prove to be the correct choice, but not all companies have that kind of patience. There is more than one competition going on here. By submitting a revolutionary design and a conservative design, it shows that it is flexible enough to allow for divergent thinking. It shows that they are not so fixed to their own preferences that they will not listen to their customers. They want to win the logo contest, but they also want to win the accounts of all those companies looking in at the results. By going with C, they are playing the long game, which is where you win. ",
