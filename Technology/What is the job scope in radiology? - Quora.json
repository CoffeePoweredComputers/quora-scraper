            "answer_text": "At present world wide there is a very high demand for Radiologists. Here in India there is a mushrooming of hospitals, health care centers and diagnostic centres. The demand for radiologists will only go up. There are also severe subspecializations in radiology - GI, MSK, Breast, Neuro, interventional etc. I believe the demand for these will go up. It will probably go up till some disruptive technology such as computerised pattern recognition goes full fledged. After that the demand for diagnostic radiology will fall in a few years. ",
