            "answer_text": "Lead-acid batteries are one of the most common electrochemical energy storage devices. They are used in a variety of applications, most people are accustomed to using them in vehicles, where their ability to provide high currents for cranking power is valued. For remote power systems, deep discharge batteries are used. Unlike car starter batteries which are used to provide high current for very short periods, deep discharge batteries are designed to hold larger amounts of energy for longer periods of time. Although batteries are reliable, they have a limited life, are heavy to ship, and contain toxic materials that require removal at the end of their useful life. Typically, remote applications require larger batteries that have higher amounts of lead and more room for \"electrolyte\". Lead-acid batteries have moderate power density and good response time. Depending on the power conversion technology incorporated, batteries can go from accepting energy to supplying energy instantaneously. Lead-acid batteries are affected by temperature and must be well maintained to achieve maximum life expectancy. Battery Shelf Life like calendar life is the time an inactive battery can be stored before it becomes unusable, usually considered as having only 80% of its initial capacity. See also Battery Storage Battery Cycle Life is defined as the number of complete charge - discharge cycles a battery can perform before its nominal capacity falls below 80% of its initial rated capacity. Key factors affecting cycle life are time t and the number N of charge-discharge cycles completed. An obvious example is the Depth of Discharge (see below) which is a simple reciprocal mathematical relationship, but there are many more complex factors which can also influence performance. Lifetimes of 500 to 1200 cycles are typical. The actual ageing process results in a gradual reduction in capacity over time. When a cell reaches its specified lifetime it does not stop working suddenly. The ageing process continues at the same rate as before so that a cell whose capacity had fallen to 80% after 1000 cycles will probably continue working to perhaps 2000 cycles when its effective capacity will have fallen to 60% of its original capacity. There is therefore no need to fear a sudden death when a cell reaches the end of its specified life. ",

            "answer_text": "If you follow the manufacturer's instructions, the battery should outlast the warranty. The phone company used to use lead acid batteries throughout the phone network. These fixed installation batteries would power the equipment during power outages. By making every other specification worse, they could make a battery with a forty year service life. These batteries were expensive, but cost effective if they were to be installed some place that was hard to get to. They were also heavier, and less efficient. The lead plates were thicker and placed farther apart. All the chemical reactions happen at the surfaces of the plates. In the short term, the extra material makes the battery, bigger, heavier, and more expensive, but more tolerant of uneven wear and warping. The batteries had extra space at the top for extra acid. As long as the plates are entirely submerged in acid, the battery capacity won't change. These batteries lost acid over time like all unsealed lead acid batteries, but they started with a lot more. They also had to be used in a stable position, upright, and level. Most batteries were installed in places that were easier to get to, so they used smaller, cheaper batteries, and just changed them more often. ",

            "answer_text": "The standard answer is 3 to 5 years, according to the manufacturer, for car batteries and standard valve-regulated UPS batteries. Heat shortens their lifespan significantly. The way the battery is loaded also affects lifespan. We had 2 identical battery bank strings at an electrical substation. One was connected to load and would have an occasional drawdown. The other was the \u201cspare bank\u201d and was connected only to the charger at float voltage. After 6 years I tested the banks. All 10 batteries of the loaded bank tested good, and all 10 batteries of the spare bank tested bad. From then on we swapped the load periodically. ",
