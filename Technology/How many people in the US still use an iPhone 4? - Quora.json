            "answer_text": "It\u2019s December, 2017, and I\u2019m still very happily using my iPhone 4s! Yes, I loved my 7 Plus, but I couldn\u2019t afford the contract anymore, and I qualified for FREE service with another carrier. When they told me I could have an iPhone for just $50 (not per month, but a one-time payment) I jumped on it! Would I like it if I were working with a decent amount of memory? Of course. Am I angry as hell that I can\u2019t seem to just bring in a newer model from eBay and transfer my free service over to it? You bet! Does it run slowly? Sure. But I can use the TV app on just fine. And all the other stuff works perfectly! So, all in all I\u2019d have to say: EVEN AN OLDER iPHONE WORKS GREAT, MEANING THERE\u2019S NO NEED TO UPGRADE! THERE\u2019S A DESIRE, MAYBE, BUT NOT AN ACTUAL NEED. THANKS, Apple! ",

I love the size, look and feel of this old thing. It\u2019s the only iPhone I\u2019ve had and I got it for free with my phone plan. For me it\u2019s more of a side-device, a \u201cfun phone\u201d to take with me places in addition to my newer Android smartphone. It\u2019s comforting having it around still. ",
