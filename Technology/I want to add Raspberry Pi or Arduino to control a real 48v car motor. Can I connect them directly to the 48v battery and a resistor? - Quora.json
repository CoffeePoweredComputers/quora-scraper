Motor controller or motor driver used for controlling motor RPM, Torque and angle etcc\u2026 Find appropriate motor driver for your motor and controller via Arduino/ Raspberry Pi. In Automation, there is Pulse - direction type motor drivers are widely available. You can easily simulate this type of configuration in Raspberry Pi/ Arduino. ",
