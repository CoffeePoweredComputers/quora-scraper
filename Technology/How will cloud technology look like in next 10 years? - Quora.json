            "answer_text": "Honestly, advancement in this area has been sorely lacking for centuries, I don't expect any breakthroughs in the next decade. Cumulonimbus is still seen as the industry standard despite being literally millions of years old. I think this is a result of corrupt lobbying and entrenched interests in the cloud industry. Modern technology allows for much larger clouds, my patent for Cumulocumulus stacks has been stuck in the patent office for years, whenever I ask about progress, they act as if I'm mad. So I wouldn't expect any change. Feel free to contribute to my Cumulocumulus effort by releasing large amounts of water vapour into the atmosphere. ",
