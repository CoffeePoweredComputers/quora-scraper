            "answer_text": "In assembling this list of exemplary technological disasters, I\u2019ve omitted the most familiar-those whose names have entered into the language, like Bhopal, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Titanic and Challenger-in favor of some with fresher tales to tell and lessons to impart. These events vary widely as to when, where, how and why they happened. But they all show how trusted technologies can suddenly go wrong, and how flaws that seem trivial or, in retrospect, painfully obvious can have devastating consequences The Vasa sinking The Swedish flagship Vasa\u2019s first and final sailing in August 1628 left fine fodder for future management consultants-an all-purpose cautionary tale of an overbearing but technically clueless boss pushing through his pet project. King Gustavus II Adolphus, striving to make Sweden a superpower, had wanted four new warships built fast. Workmen were already laying the Vasa\u2019s keel when the king ordered its length extended. His seasoned master shipwright, fearing to challenge the famously hot-tempered king, went ahead. The shipwright then took ill, directed the project as best he could from his sickbed and died before it was finished. His inexperienced assistant then took over, and the king ordered a second gun deck, possibly spurred by false reports that rival Denmark was building a ship with double gun decks. The result was the most lavishly appointed and heavily armed warship of its day, but one too long and too tall for its beam and ballast-a matchless array of features on an unstable platform. When the standard stability test of the day-30 sailors running from side to side trying to rock the boat-tilted the Vasa perilously, the test was canceled and the ship readied for launch. None of Gustavus\u2019s officials dared bear the bad news to the absent king, who was by then off warring in Poland and impatiently awaiting his new superweapon. Minutes after her grand launching, with all Stockholm watching, the Vasa heeled, listed and sank, killing about 50. The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse When three \u201cfloating walkways\u201d crashed to the floor of Kansas City, MO\u2019s swank new Hyatt Regency on July 17, 1981, speculation first fixed on the patrons who\u2019d been dancing on them: perhaps their high-stepping had set off a harmonic wave that made the sky bridges buckle and crumble. The truth proved more prosaic. The hotel\u2019s engineers had originally designed two of the three walkways to hang on common, vertical metal rods. But the metal fabricator took a fatal shortcut, substituting shorter rods hanging from one level to the next. The second-floor walkway thus hung from the fourth-floor, doubling the weight on its connectors. The fabricator claimed to have requested approval for this change; the engineers insisted they weren\u2019t asked, though they had signed off on final drawings that included it. The designers had also asked to be on site during construction, when they might have spotted the change, but were rebuffed by an owner determined to avoid additional expense. When enough patrons filled the walkways, the connections gave way. Thanks to miscommunication and corner-cutting, 114 perished in the deadliest structural failure in U.S. history. The Iroquois Theater blaze What the Titanic\u2019s sinking represented at sea, the burning of Chicago\u2019s Iroquois Theater marked on land: a supposedly indestructible, up-to-the-minute design-in this case, a theater advertised as \u201cabsolutely fireproof\u201d-destroyed with an enormous loss of life. The Iroquois\u2019s owners acted with as much haste and hubris as their Titaniccounterparts, installing no firefighting equipment, forgoing fire drills and opening before the sprinkler system was ready. Instead, like so many others, they relied on a single technological magic bullet: an asbestos curtain that would drop down and shield the audience in the (rather common) event of a backstage fire. On Dec. 30, 1903, as vaudeville star Eddie Foy regaled the overcapacity crowd in Mr. Bluebeard, an oil-painted backdrop brushed against a hot calcium-arc spotlight and ignited. The asbestos curtain started dropping on cue but caught on a stage light. Crew and cast opened the stage door to flee, admitting a powerful gust that sent fireballs shooting out over the unshielded audience. Fleeing patrons either found the doors barred or could not turn the newfangled latches on them. Six hundred two died, more than twice the toll of \u201cthe Great Chicago Fire\u201d 32 years earlier. The Eschede train derailment Sometimes even the safest technology is vulnerable to the not-so-perfect world around it. In the 34 years since the inauguration of high-speed rail, no line anywhere in the world had suffered a fatal accident. All that changed on June 3, 1998, on the Inter City Express line near Eschede in northern Germany, when a small improvement in comfort derailed this carefully managed system. High-speed trains generally run on solid \u201cmonobloc\u201d metal wheels, but to dampen noise and vibration the Inter City Express (like many lower-speed light-rail systems) wrapped these in metal \u201ctires\u201d cushioned with rubber inserts. Inspectors examined the tires daily, but even ultrasound failed to detect a minute crack in one tire. It broke, causing a partial derailment. But the train continued upright and likely would have reached a safe stop if it hadn\u2019t chanced to pass under an old-style roadway bridge that, unlike newer bridges, rested on a central pillar, which stood between the line\u2019s two tracks. A swinging car clipped the pillar, and the bridge collapsed on the train, causing a massive pileup and 101 deaths. So it goes, all too often, when new, high-performance technology is inserted into older infrastructure built to operate with a greater margin of error. The high-speed train was a round peg in the square hole of an outdated rail corridor. The Ashtabula Creek Bridge wreck The United States\u2019 deadliest bridge collapse demonstrates the dangers in transposing what works in one material to a new, unproven one. In 1863, Cleveland railroad magnate Amasa B. Stone Jr. announced a bold advance in bridge technology-so bold it was never imitated. For two decades, the state of the art in American bridge design had been the reliable Howe wooden truss system, which added threaded iron upright supports to a classic structure of diagonal wooden trusses. The iron connectors provided more strength and eliminated the painstaking joinery of all-wood truss construction. So, Stone reasoned, why not go all the way and re-create the Howe design entirely in iron? Trusting too much in this newer, costlier material, Stone ignored both its potential for hidden weak spots and an essential flaw in his design: the bridge was assembled like an interlocking jigsaw, held together by pressure rather than the firm attachments of the wood originals; if one joint went, the whole structure would. Nevertheless, Stone proclaimed his 1865 creation \u201cabsolutely sound,\u201d and it stood for 11 years, even as its parts shifted. Then, on Dec. 29, 1876, as a passenger train crossed, an iron support with a hidden air bubble collapsed, the bridge tumbled down, fires spread from the train\u2019s tipped-over woodstoves, and more than 100 riders perished. Recently, Chocolate Flooded A Street In Germany After A Production Facility Incident And today in Weird Yet Fascinating News, we have this: A chocolate flood in Germany at the production facility of chocolatier DreiMeister on Monday almost caused a holiday disaster. Happily, though, the crisis has been averted; the fire department and employees of DreiMeister both pitched in to help with the cleanup, and the factory has since opened again. No injuries have been reported, and officials say that there\u2019s no danger of a chocolate shortage plaguing the holidays. DreiMeister has been producing spectacular truffles and specialty chocolates since 1973. The company\u2019s production facility is located in West\u00f6nnen, a suburb of Werl located about 40 km away from the city of Dortmund \u2014 and it\u2019s there that the chocolate disaster unfolded on Dec 10. At about 8 p.m. that night, reports the Washington Post, a tank in the facility overflowed, resulting into roughly a ton of liquid chocolate flooding out of the factory and onto the nearby road, Weststrasse. When the chocolate met the outdoor temperatures, it did what hot chocolate usually does when it\u2019s chilled: It solidified, leaving the road covered in a thick layer of hardened chocolate. ",

            "answer_text": "The day AT&T\u2019s lines went dead The Y2K bug was the long-awaited disaster that didn\u2019t happen; the AT&T crash 10 years earlier was the software disaster everyone thought couldn\u2019t happen.Ma Bell had one of the world\u2019s largest and most famously reliable networks: hurricanes and earthquakes couldn\u2019t shake it, a 1989 U.S. Congressional report on the general unreliability of government software lauded the dependability of AT&T\u2019s, and the company\u2019s ads impugned the glitches that pestered upstart competitors Sprint and MCI.Then, on Jan. 15, 1990, a single switch at one of AT&T\u2019s 114 switching centers suffered a minor mechanical malfunction, momentarily shutting down that center. When it came back up, it sent out a signal that made other centers trip and reset-and send out similar signals. The centers crashed, writes Leonard Lee in The Day the Phones Stopped, \u201clike a hundred mud wrestlers crowded into a too-small arena,\u201d each pulling himself up by pulling down the others.American Airlines estimated it lost 200,000 reservation calls, and CBS couldn\u2019t even reach its local bureaus to check on the story. The culprit proved to be a single line of faulty code in a complex software upgrade recently implemented to speed up calling. AT&T\u2019s much touted backup switching system carried the same fault and suffered the same crash.\u201cThe condition spread,\u201d AT&T chairman Robert Allen confessed afterward, \u201cbecause of our own redundancy.\u201d The company did not keep that redundancy sufficiently insulated from the main system; it could have retained the old software in its backup system until it had thoroughly road-tested the new. But just maybe, the company\u2019s programmers had come to believe their own good press.",
