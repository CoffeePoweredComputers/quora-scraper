            "answer_text": "Multimedia streaming platform Netflix had announced their new marketing stunt StreamFest, that'll let all users stream for 48 hours on Netflix at no extra cost, starting December 4. Only available to the Indian audience in its initial testing phase, StreamFest will be a good marker for the market, and depending on the response they may be tempted to launch it elsewhere as well. What is unique is that none of the users will be asked for payment details to explore Streamfest. Unlike the free 30-day trials that required users to submit their payment details. After those free trials, Netflix would deduct money according to the plan subscribed by the users. Netflix did cancel their free monthly trials all over the world in order to launch StreamFest. All you've got to do is have the Netflix app in your desired device, and that's it. Ideally try using Netflix post December 4th and you'll find the option of StreamFest while you create your account. It's an weekend of free streaming therefore it only works in the weekends that much is clear. Baring that there isn't much information available at this point of time. Hope that satisfies your query.
