            "answer_text": "Today there is no reason to use an Ethernet splitter. An Ethernet splitter is a \u201cY\u201d cable. You need a \u201cY\u201d at each end. As others have said, 100 Mbps Ethernet uses 2 of the 4 pairs of wires. The \u201cY\u201d connects the second signal to the unused pairs. There are some disadvantages: You don\u2019t save Ethernet ports. If you have two signals on one cable, each signal will need its own port on both sides of the cable.Cat 5e cable (which is 80% of installed Ethernet cables) supports 1 Gbps (1,000 Mbps). Most modern equipment supports 1 Gbps. But this requires all for wire pairs. A cable splitter restricts you the 1-tenth of the maximum speed on Cat 5e cable.Some devices are installed where power isn\u2019t available. This is especially true of WAPs (Wireless Access Points). These can be used to create WiFi throughout a large building. Bu they are often installed in the ceiling where there are no power outlets. WAPs can usually use PoE (Power over Ethernet). This standard uses the unused two pairs in an Ethernet cable to supply power.Using an Ethernet switch is a superior solution and costs only a little more than a pair of \u201cY\u201d cables.For example: You might have an Ethernet cable running through a building servicing a remote device such as a computer. You might find later on that you need a second port at the remote location, perhaps for a printer. Don\u2019t use a pair of \u201cY\u201d cables. Buy an Ethernet switch. They cost about the same as a pair of \u201cY\u201d cables. The remote location will have 10 times the bandwidth. You will be able to support as many devices as you wish at the remote location. ",

            "answer_text": "Splitters aren\u2019t for sharing a connection. An ethernet splitter is intended to reduce how much cat 5 cable you need when connecting two networks. A network here does not mean the internet, it means either two computers or two LANs. Splitters must be used in pairs. The way they work is because a LAN only uses 4 of the 8 wires in a cat 5 ethernet cable, when there eight wires total in these cables. An Ethernet splitter can save on cable by creating 2 lanes of traffic down one cable. Hopefully you can see now how they allow you to save on cable. So for example if you wanted to put together a pair of computer devices in 2 separate rooms, you wouldn\u2019t need to use separate cat 5 cables, only two ethernet splitters. When using the splitters then you only need a single cable and a splitter at either end. This is a typical scenario of how ethernet splitters should be used. ",
