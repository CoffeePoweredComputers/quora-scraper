            "answer_text": "It depends on your personal choice, though my suggestion would be to buy a wireless mouse.  There are several advantages and disadvantages for using wired as well as a wireless mouse. Wired Mouse vs Wireless Mouse: Wired mouse has a limited space to move and the cable restricts your free movement. Wireless mouse has much larger movable area and the area depends on the range of the receiver.For wireless mouse, you need to consider the battery. Since it is running on battery, the charge will get depleted very fast if you do not manually switch off the power button on the mouse. For wired mouse there is no battery required as it draws power direct through USB.Sometimes the signal from the wireless receiver can get intercepted if you have other wireless devices functioning in the vicinity and can delay the screen response time for the mouse pointer. For wired mouse this condition does not happen.For free movement and cable tangle free movement, wireless mouse is more advantageous compared to a wired mouse.If you are using a wireless keyboard, some mouse manufacturers such as Logitech allows users to use multiple devices using one receiver know as unifying receiver. This will allow users to free up USB ports for other devices. Users can connect mouse, keyboard and pen with a singe unifying receiver.https://support.logitech.com/en_us/software/unifying",
