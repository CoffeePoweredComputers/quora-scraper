            "answer_text": "Im wondering if this question is a trick question? Anyways what the heck here goes. The Dominican Republic is an island in the Caribbean, which is today a sovereign nation. Having no relation politically nor culturally to Mexico. Mexico as is known is located in continental America, with a small portion Cancun jutting into the Caribbean sea. Mexico is an independent nation state (some say a failed state). So the simple answer is no. ",

            "answer_text": "I wonder if English is not the first language of the person asking the question, because the question makes no sense. Is the Dominican Republic, a sovereign nation-state, Mexico, another sovereign nation state? No they are two separate nation-states with very little connection other than having the same colonial master, which were over thrown almost 200 years ago. So no, no one with a measurable IQ and a basic education considers both nations to be one nation. ",
