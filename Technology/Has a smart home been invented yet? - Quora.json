            "answer_text": "Homes are not smart. The term Smart Home just refers to homes with some form of automation. Anything from an intruder alarm which calls the police if broken into could make it a \u2018Smart Home\u2019. A mood lighting system like Rako or Lutron which enables different keypad buttons to do different things, depending on what time of day it is, could be classed as Smart Home like. How about there presence of voice control? Install an Amazon Alexa and a compatible TV and you can say \u201cAexa Turn the TV on\u201d and the tV will switch on. Is this the level required for a Smart Home? So what would you class as a Smart Home? Until we have a definition of what a Smart Home is, there is no way of telling and if or when one was or will be invented. ",
