            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there are number of smartphones with great processors, especially the chip-sets that are mainly designed for gaming. According to me, as of the present year, the new Realme 6 is one of the fastest smartphone incorporated with the MediaTek Helio G90T equipped with the HyperEngine Gaming Technology. The Realme 6 is a budget smartphone and among the very few ones to sport a 90Hz display on a budget. The phone features a 6.5-inch full-hd+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate. It also has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. Realme 6 packs a 4,300mAh battery which offers very good battery life and supports a 30W charger with the smartphone.  The phone is available in three variants, 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, 6GB of RAM with 64GB and 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. The 4GB RAM is priced at 13,999. The 6GB with 64GB storage is for 14,999 while the 128GB one is for 15,999. The 8GB variant is for 16,999. The Realme 6 is a dual-SIM (GSM and GSM) cell phone accepts Nano-SIM and Nano-SIM cards. The dimensions of Realme 6 are 162.10 mm x 74.80 mm x 9.60 mm (height x width x thickness) and it weighs around 191 grams. The phone is available in Comet White and Comet Blue color options. The phone features a 6.50-inch capacitive touchscreen that has a resolution of 1080x2400 pixels with a 90Hz refresh rate. The phone has a glass front with Gorilla Glass 3 protection, plastic back, and plastic frame. Also, the smartphone is equipped with a 2.05GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio G90T processor that lets you multitask and access different apps at the same time without any interruptions and give you a smooth experience.  As far as the cameras are concerned, Realme 6 comes with a quad-camera setup on the rear with different features like autofocus, LED flash, HDR, and panorama. There is a 64 MP primary camera with f/1.8 aperture; an 8 MP ultrawide angle lens with f/2.3 aperture, a 2 MP macro lens with f/2.4 aperture, and a 2 MP depth shooter with f/2.4 aperture. On the front, the mobile features a 16 MP camera with f/2.0 aperture to click stunning selfies. Features on the front camera setup include HDR and panorama. The smartphone from the brand runs Realme UI based on Android 10. Also, it houses a decent 4300 mAh non-removable battery with a 30W flash charge support. As per the brand, the smartphone can be fully charged in 60 minutes. Overall, I think Realme 6 is an amazing smartphone and this can be taken over to be the fastest smartphone. Its all because of the Helio G90T processor and the 4,300mAh. ",

            "answer_text": "The fastest smartphone for 2020 has not been launched yet, at least in India, but let us know about this a little later and before that, I think we need to understand the concept of a smartphone and a pricey phone with the difference between them. You may presume that an iPhone 11 Pro Max would be the fastest just because it extorts an undue sum of money out of your pockets but this may not be true. Even if you consider something like Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra to be the fastest only because it is again a pricey deal, you may be wrong. And I would not call even OnePlus 8 Pro as the fastest smartphone because it has its certain issues with its Snapdragon processor.  And most importantly, will these so-called fastest smartphones in 2020 remain fast enough in 2021 as well. There are hardly any chances because no matter how costly a smartphone you purchase, it is bound to slow down with time. The major element responsible for the speed of the smartphone is its processor and as of now, there are several smart processors which could offer you the desired performance and speed without any hassles. So whether you choose Apple\u2019s Bionic A13 processor, Samsung\u2019s Exynos 990, Huawei\u2019s HiSilicon Kirin 990, MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus or Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 865 processor, you can get the desired speed in your smartphone. However, even when the performance of these chipsets is comparable, there is a lot of difference in the price of the smartphones which are powered by these fastest ever chipsets by each of the brands as mentioned before the chipsets.  However, as I said, spending a lot of money does not stand synonymous to getting great performance and talking specifically about Android smartphone processors, while Exynos processors always have some issues, even Snapdragon 865 is not free from troubles, The connectivity issues, the heating issues and the battery drainage problems in Snapdragon 865 processors are an open secret to the world and I don\u2019t think they qualify as the fastest smartphone processors with all these issues even after spending such a huge amount of money. And while I have seen several comparisons of these smartphone chipsets, my money for the best and the fastest smartphone processor would be on Mediatek Dimensity 1000 Plus. This is one of the latest processors launched by the brand and you would have already heard about it in the market. This is the same Mediatek chipset that has promised a refresh rate of 144Hz and I am really excited about this as there are some other amazing features as well.  However, the most important part in it and a sheer advantage over Snapdragon 865 is the integrated modem in the Mediatek Dimensity 1000 Plus chipset and this not only offers more space in the smartphone but also enhances the upload and the download speed. None of the Snapdragon 5G chipsets has an integrated modem and they use an external modem for the 5G. Against this, all the Mediatek 5G chipsets have an integrated Mediatek helio M70 modem which is a good advantage for the chipsets. Another very important aspect is the 7nm size of the chipsets which is same in both Snapdragon 865 and Mediatek Dimensity 1000 Plus chipsets. However, even with this, Snapdragon 865 is obsessed with heating issues and this causes a battery drainage very quickly while playing games. Against this, Mediatek Dimensity 1000 Plus contains Mediatek\u2019s Ultrapower saving technology and this promises to save a lot of power in the smartphone which would be really helpful for the gamers.  So as far as the fastest smartphone is concerned, I think the first one for the Android users at low cost would be IQOO Z1 with Mediatek Dimensity 1000 Plus chipset and this would not even break your bank.
