            "answer_text": "Depending on how you define the term modify, we are probably able to do this already, at least experimentally. We can for instance transplant insulin producing cells into a diabetes victim, and this works, but so far it\u2019s not working very well or very long. These cells are genetically a little different, unless they come from an identical twin. As far as I know, it\u2019s not possible to inject genes directly into human cells in individual people at this time, and get any useful result. But this sort of experiment is working in laboratories with MANY species of cells. The usual way is to use a virus as the tool to get the genes inside. ",

We are just on the cusp of being able to genetically modify our kids - that is the easy part Modifying ourselves - our adult selves - is an entirely different level of difficulty I think that we will be able to do that - but it\u2019s at least 50 years away ",
