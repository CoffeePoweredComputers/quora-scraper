            "answer_text": "\u201c5G\u201d antennas are expected to be smaller, more numerous and part of more high-gain systems than those that have served 3G and 4G systems, and they will need more advanced steering and scanning techniques in order to function well at millimeter wave frequencies. There will be three primary differences in 5G antenna design: the interface between the antenna and the radio frequency front end, the use of arrays instead of single antennas and reliance on beamsteering. In general, antenna systems for 5G will need to support higher gain in order to maintain the same or similar range as previous technology generations. Earlier this year, Qualcomm demonstrated a 5G antenna system with about 27 decibel gain, which, is about 10 to 12 more db than a typical cellular base station antenna. While 5G antenna systems can produce high gain, the problem is the beamwidth will reduce. Third-generation and 4G systems have gotten very good at providing broad radiation patterns from a single, omnidirectional device antenna, but you\u2019ll have to consider direction of arrival for high-gain antenna systems. Luckily, a variety of beamsteering approaches are being developed as part of 5G \u2013 as well as beamscanning and reporting to the network on the status of several beams that a wireless device might potentially make use of. *Inspired by an article at RCR Wireless news.
