You would need to complete the sentence by explaining what it is about their ubiquity. \u201cWith the ubiquity of computers, they are now in every home and office.\u201d That is wordy. It would be better to write \u201cComputers are ubiquitous. They are in every home and office.\u201d That makes it a a complete sentence. It would be even better to write, \u201cComputers are now in every home and office.\u201d. Your goal in writing should be clarity. You should be writing so that others grasp your meaning easily.
