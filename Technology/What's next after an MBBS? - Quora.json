            "answer_text": "After MBBS what? Of course, the best option is without any doubt is doing PG. After all only the best students after scoring high marks in XII board exams and in NEET entrance join MBBS. Basically, they are focused and hard workers, right from their childhood. Even after completing MBBS, they wanted to do PG in their dream branch and in their dream college. While preparing for NEET PG and when they are solving MCQs, they realize how much time they wasted in their college life. When they sit for mock tests, suddenly they start coming to reality. Now they start shifting the goalposts. Initial goal: Dream Branch, Dream College Dream Branch, any government college in my cityDream Branch, any government college in my stateDream Branch, any government college in a nearby stateDream Branch, any government college in our zoneDream Branch, any government college in the countryAllied branches in dream collegeNext best-allied branch in the dream branchAny branch in any college.This is happening because of the cut-throat competition. So many are not willing to take the risk of giving one more attempt, they start compromising. Instead, it is always better to have Plan B in place. Let me share our own experience of Plan B. When my daughter got 10919 rank in NEET PG 2017. She was so upset, she was not coming out of the room and not talking to anyone. Switched off the phone, deleted Whatsapp and out of facebook. I thought I should support her now more than ever, as she was at the low point of her life. Though she got seats in the branches that she was not interested. I told her not to take those seats. She said she will work and prepare. I said \u201cNO\u201d. You simply focus on your goal and don\u2019t bother about anything. I just google to find if there is any career opportunity for MBBS students. The first thing that the search engine showed me was \u201cUPSC CMS\u201d. I searched more about CMS, where can they get jobs, their role, the salary, the career growth etc. After two days, there was a notification for \u201cUPSC CMS 2017\u201d. She had low morale at that time, \u201cDad, you have seen my rank na, just forget it, waste of time and waste of money.\u201d I told her that there is no fees for the girl student and you can use this exam as the mock test. Just give a try. Very reluctantly, she said yes. She was getting back to her form and started preparing for her goal (PG General Medicine) very seriously. By the time of August, she was in good nick. UPSC CMS Exam was in August 2017. She did not prepare anything extra for UPSC CMS. How did UPSC CMS things happen to my daughter? No exam feeFull day exam and during lunch break, free lunch packets were distributed to students.Written exam results declared, she was shorted listed for interview.DAF filled and after a lot of research we preferred Railways as the first choiceCalled for the interview (not willing to attend as she didn\u2019t prepare and felt it was the waste of money for flight tickets. As luck was with us, here interview date was next day after PGI entrance test. So she agreed)Luckily for her, no general knowledge questions were asked. Only on subjects for 40 minutes(as her preparation was at the peak, she was able to answer almost all the questions) Interview board, one IAS officer and 4 specialty doctors.After the interview, she was asked to give the PNR no. of the ticket, she said she was not having that and did not submit.After a few months, reimbursement in the form of money order for her tickets.UPSC CMS rank list announced. Her rank was 149.Called for a medical checkup. (She already joined PG(medicine in her dream college)Received appointment order with 6 First class pass.Dec 17th, 2018, asked to report at NAIR academy.Reported and applied for EOL (extraordinary leave for 3 years to complete her PG)Back to her PG duties.National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR), Vadodara  Not the 5-star hotel reception, reception of NAIR training center  Not an international university classroom, NAIR\u2019s classroom  Hostel for trainees  TT  Snooker  Basketball  Mess  Good pay, good perks, good working atmosphere and above all professional and personal work balance. For those joining railways after MBBS, you will have a quota at AIIMS PG. For those joining after PG, you will have sponsored seat for the super specialty. For those doing PG, will be given 3 years EOL. Some of the best doctors have come from Indian Railway Medical Services. So, while preparing for your goal, have UPSC CMS as Plan B. You don't need to prepare anything extra for that. Two years from now, there will be a lot of people retiring, so there are going to be a lot of vacancies. So all the 4th year MBBS students, keep this in your mind too. I am timing this post as a morale booster to all those who are going to appear for NEET PG 2019. Be relax and be composed. All the best for the NEET PG. But remember that first attempt is not going to be easy. Don't compromise on your branch, have your plan B. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Yesterday (July 30, 2019), a 2nd year student at the Baba Saheb Ambedkar Medical Hospital, New Delhi ended his life, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even care to ask for his name. I had never known him, and for me, he was just another figure in the worsening statistics of suicides committed by Indian medical students. Until somebody, one of the closest people in my life, told me they'd been friends and studied together. That's when it hit me- exactly how close to home this issue was; this is all of our lives now. I'm a person who confronts the idea of death (of even loved ones) with more logic than emotion. But the idea of suicide still sends chills down my spine- the thought that, despite having achieved what lakhs can only dream of, someone still feels so hopeless in life that they see no point in living; inspite of all their dreams and all that they hold dear. And yet, it has become not just a reality for medical students, but, in fact, something very common. I looked up the news and found 2 other names of Indian medical students who couldn't bear to live their lives anymore (in the last 2 days itself). So, this is my plan after MBBS, and my way of showing solidarity with all those who are struggling, and those who have decided to give up the fight \u2014 I will work my ass off to become the best possible doctor I can be. I am confident, more than ever now, that I need to apply for USMLE after MBBS, and learn as much as I can. I believe one needs to be a part of the system to understand its flaws, but, at the same time, it requires a perspective from beyond the confines of the system to bring about the smallest of positive change. Moreover, I've seen that India listens to Indians only when they gain some sort of international recognition. So then, so be it. I'll establish myself such that when I speak, people HAVE to listen, and when I write, people HAVE to read, and not just input my words, but also act on them. I will lead by example. When people talk about \u2018brain drain\u2019, it really isn't people moving out of the country. At least, they're still serving the humanity, and a seventh of the humanity is India. Brain drain is when students kill themselves under unnecessary mental pressure to perform. Brain drain is when innocent doctors are lynched by angry mobs for no reason whatsoever. Brain drain is what signifies the crippling, apathetic condition of Indian medicine and its people. This answer is not only for the readers, but more so for me, a reminder of what I aspire for. Whether I go on to become a clinician, a surgeon, or a researcher, at the core, my aim would forever be to help free the brightest of India\u2019s mind from this sinister system. If I could make even an iota of difference in the way people think and act, I would consider it an achievement. May you rest in peace, Devendra Deepanshu Jain! ",

            "answer_text": "After you MBBS you have to decide whether you want to continue studying further or you want to work. You may also want to study while you work but I'll discuss this part later in my answer. Firstly if you want to study further, here are the options MD/MS/DiplomaDNBResidency in USPG in UKPG in any other country (I'll elaborate further on this)Diploma coursesCertificate coursesMBAMPHLet me elaborate why pg in any country. As you might be aware that a degree obtained from countries other than US/UK/Canada/Australia/New Zealand is not recognised here in india while at graduate level courses you have to appear for FMGE, post hraduate degrees are not recognised. But no matter if the course is not recognised you will have the knowledge and a diploma above an MBBS student. Also you may appear for royal college examinations in that speciality and then practice further. If you want to work right after MBBS here are the options Duty Medical OfficerJunior resident in a specialityCombined Medical Services Exam to get into defence, railways and delhi govtCasualty Medical Officer in private hosp or govtCivil Assistant SurgeonMedical officer at PHCMedical officer at factoriesReasearch analystMedical science liaisonMedical advisorClinical reasearch specialistClinical investigatorMedical officer at an Insurance companyResident Medical OfficerSetup your own clinic/HospitalMedical writingThe list is really long. But i have personally experimented a lot post MBBS and have finally decided to settle in clinical side. But do remember if you are just an MBBS and want to setup a clinic then you may want to go to tier II or tier III cities or may be somewhere the specialists may not be easily available within tier I city. Additionally go for certificate courses whether family medicine or diabetes or clinical cardiology which may help better your diagnosing skills. But do not experiment much with your career but stick to just 2\u20133yrs post MBBS. Also remember that less no. of years post MBBS the higher the chances to secure a pg seat. All the best for your future ",

            "answer_text": "So plans after doing Mbbs. About 50 years back, MBBS was considered as the King or Queen of all subjects. Once you do an Mbbs, your life is settled. No need to worry, \u201crishtas\u201dstart pouring out, you are the apple of everyone's eyes. Today, 2019. MBBS has no value anymore. The fact that I said the above is because this question wouldn't have popped up, if Mbbs was enough. Now, why Mbbs is not enough nowadays? Aren't we being taught the same curriculum as was done 50 years back? Yes we are. Then what's the problem? The problems are many. Population spurt :- Ours is a democratic country with a CPR (Couple Protection Rate) way below 60%,which is the ideal value. Now what is CPR? Obviously not Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation! It's the % of eligible couple who are using family planning methods which are available. Now, if we have such a less CPR, it is evident that the population is becoming expansive. More and more people are being born. The population pyramid is bursting. This is the reason why we need more Doctors. More Doctors, better Doctors to treat the more complicated diseases that are evolving due to population spurt.Detoriorating health status:- This calls for specialised Doctors in all fields. The condition of this country is becoming worse day by day. 138th country worldwide in terms of GNP. Can you imagine? Such a large country, so much talent, and yet so poor! So, we need specialists in all fields possible.Disbelief of the patients in Mbbs Doctors:- As soon as the concept of Specialisation arose, people(lay man) lost belief in simple Mbbs students. Earlier Mbbs meant Doctor, now Mbbs means Junior Doctors,who are obviously treated with no respect in a country where eduction status is almost going negative. People here go to school for the mid day meal scheme, take the food, and run back home! Such a country, and it's people would surely not have knowledge to treat an Mbbs as an Mbbs.So, why do we have to have a plan after Mbbs? Can't we just settle and have a life like others? I personally thought Mbbs is the end, obviously everyone thinks that. We all are made to think those from class 10 onwards. \u201c Give another exam, and then your life would be settled\u201d. It's a lie. Guys, don't believe in that. All my life, I had been lied. :\u2019( But don't get disheartened, this is not the only reason you will get to stress over in Mbbs, there would be a thousand more! And for the plan, I wanted to open a clinic for the poor, get associated with an NGO, help the needy and educate them to be good citizens who will be the future of our country, so that they don't mess up with our country\u2019s future, like our forefathers did. But alas, just like others I would also sit for the most awaited and awful examination Neet PG or Next, whatever I have in my fate! Wait till I get a decent seat and then struggle to make an existence while my friends in other streams travel overseas with the love of their lives and get settled and take care of their parents. But still amongst everything, I try to find a silver lining in everything, \u201cLet's hope for a better tomorrow, there surely would be one\u201d. So, ya the plan is to sit for Neet PG and if I crack, take a surgical speciality and be a badass surgeon. ~ Abhipsa Dasgupta (\u0985\u09ad\u09c0\u09aa\u09cd\u09b8\u09be \u09a6\u09be\u09b6\u0997\u09c1\u09aa\u09cd\u09a4) ",

            "answer_text": "Almost everyone who has passed final year MBBS prepares for PG entrance exams. And hardly anyone qualifies in their first attempt. I'm currently an intern, working 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week. I didn't join any PG classroom coaching because I seriously don't want to waste any more of my parents' money. So I joined Allen Institute's online test series, and I'm preparing subject-wise according to it. Now I know for sure that I'm not gonna crack it this year, so currently my plan is to join a non-PG residency at some private hospital after I finish my internship. I'll work there for an year, earn enough to survive, afford a coaching and give some back to my parents. I'll keep on preparing for the PG entrance, and hopefully crack it. If I don't, I'm gonna sit the next whole year at home, study day and night, work as hard as I can, and get myself that PG course. However, I'll also be giving UPSC exams and if I crack it before I get a PG admission, I'll opt for it and settle down. Maybe keep trying for a PG for next 2-3 years, but I won't be studying like my life depends on it. I'm happy with the UPSC job. Backup plan in case I still get nothing after 3 attempts? Join a PHC as an MO, earn some 50k (6th pay commission), study and try still for either a PG or UPSC, and if nothing really works out, live my life as an MO at a PHC. What a sad life anyway.. If you're interested in Army, you could always try for the SSC. If you're interested in better government jobs, you may try for interviews to various government MO posts, but it doesn't work without bribes or references or both. If you're interested in private practice, nobody trusts a brand new doctor - they'd rather trust their Hakims and Homeopaths than a truly qualified MBBS doctor. If you're interested in working at a private hospital, you may try applying to them, but the pay isn't good - anything between 15k-40k depending on the location and patient load. ",

During MBBS: Pass in all the subjects respectfully with good marks.Publish my research work in the journal. (On my half way already)Participate in as much as extracurricular activities in College like quiz, symposium, debate, social work, etc. (Though have already participated in 15\u201320 events in 2 and 1/2 years but still 3 more years to go.)Recieve a gold medal in Sports.(Reached finals in Table Tennis and semifinal in Badminton but desperately want to win a gold medal.)Gain more clinical knowledge than theoretical by examining patients in hospital.Organize a Batch Trip. (or atleast a Goa trip with my gang of friends :p)Work for the welfare of my batch and college being the LR (lady representative of my batch).Intern at online medical sites like webMD, plexusMD etc. After MBBS : Admission in Pg in the branch of my choice(I Know it is difficult to get the desired branch but would surely work hard to achieve it).Ophthalmology > Anaesthesia > Medicine But may be by the end of the mbbs my choice may again change. Superspeciality in Endocrinology if possible. I have some affinity towards hormones since 10th standard, I find them very interesting.For a Doctor Who has just freshly passed PG, opening an independent hospital is difficult unless until his/her parents are doctor (which in my case is not) so join as a resident doctor in government hospital or in private hospital.World Tour with my Family after settling down in my career.Marriage. But not a grand one. A simple Wedding.Buy a large house together.Have lots of Dogs <3Charity: Help the needy and become a Philanthropist in order to make the world a better place to live in. (If I become super rich and give free medical service to Needy ones.) P.S. : Large house is not compulsory but Dogs Are. ",

I will share whatever I would have got during journey with all! Helping others is the greatest joy for me. I will try to find different ways to educate general population to remove some stigma and to act better in emergency situations. (Like CPR & immediate response) I want to join/make channel of specialist doctors who reach out to people and provide free medical services.  Engage to many more research activities. After completing Mch, wanna specialize in one of the special field - like as of now it's Functional neurosurgery. I want to enjoy that feeling of knowing almost all possible in any field. (Although it's very very small.) Personal goals :Marry a girl who can love me with all my craziness! (I hope someone somewhere exist!) After completing education, I won't live away from my parents!!! Never. Write a book after completing education. Donate expenses for cornea transplant surgery for atleast one blind girl! Donate maximum books I can to poor students whose barrier to study is money! Plan B : If I can't get into Mch for the first time, I will take drop, irrespective of my rank in NEET or other exams. Now I will go to home, study for a year more with more dedication and try to get into Mch after a year! All other remains same. Plan C : At worst (I hope it won't happen), I won't be able to clear nimhans exam on 2 attempts, I will check possibilities with my NEET rank! If I can get some good neet rank, I will try to pursue MS gen. Surgery from reputed institute and try to get Mch after MS. All otger remains same. If I won't be able to do that even, I will join MD PSM in high institute. (No doubt about that now). I will join some good research institute and engage myself in the world of curiosity! At some point if I feel, I will join teaching field too. Just like Najeeb sir. Not to earn, to help students learn!!! Personal goals are not going to change anyway! ",

What I can tell are my juveline-ish priorities and I shall make an attempt in the same. I have talked to several brilliant minds, and as a pro of being in a premier college, I get more chances to talk to more. As far as I am concerned, I am pretty sure on joining the Armed Forces. Which out of Air force or Army, shall be left for the final year to decide. But not Navy . I\u2019m kinda sea sick, and I can love the beaches and sea for not more than 3 days. Permanent commission or short service, again, for the final year marks to decide. If I were to be given the choice, I would take my time. Permanent commission maybe would win. But then, I\u2019m too young for that. Now for the PG, we have to serve as a Captain for 4 years before the PG, and that Is a big pro to me. I will learn more art of medicine, and look what fascinates me more. So the final decision about the PG stream is totally dependent on my 4 years of service ( And the rank in PG exam, Of course :P ) As of now, I love surgery more than medicine, and Psychiatry and Gynecology are at the top of my priority. ( Yeah, allies of medicine, But not medicine :P ) Now If I were to pay out of the forces, I can Imagine how my life would be. I would\u2019ve surely tried for AIIMS PG. I got to See AIIMS recently, and their PG system and schedule ,to me , was mesmerizing. Simply amazing exposure, as it enjoys the privilege of being in the Capital of the country. I would\u2019ve done my internship seriously, and looked onto what mesmerizes me more. Then work hard for the PG entrance and tried getting in. But then, This is a path which , I , most probably am not going to take. Another field that I find fascinating is medical research. I have just learnt the basics, and started a few research projects, And One of them is under execution, just beginner level. I have planned to take more courses on statistical analysis. Getting posted on various destinations across the country is something I\u2019m looking on to , as More research ideas can be Executed. ( An Example being high altitude physiology research during our field posting) Now Since The path after MBBS is pretty clear, I would love to master the skills that the MBBS graduates are supposed to know. I agree that MBBS graduates cannot do much in special cases, But then, there is a lot that they still can, and we as budding doctors lack many of those skills. Anyway, there is a lot left to learn. I am yet to take more options in consideration, and yet to learn a lot more, talking to a lot more people! Lets see what time Unfolds! :) Have a great day! ",

Medicine, Surgery, Anesthesia, Radiology and so on). This is possible after sitting for NEETPG and also separate exams for Central Institutes like AIIMS, PGI Chandigarh.DNB is also a way of specialising which in considered equivalent to your MD/MS degree. (Except for teaching posts, where MD is looked more favourably than DNB)Residency abroad \u2014 Eg. You need to clear USMLE for Residency into USA. If this is your goal, you should start preparing early itself and not after you've completed MBBS.UPSC exams- Clearing UPSC Medical exams and their interview will get you a Govt. job in different areas such as Rail, BSF etc. The pay is decent and has the benefits that a Govt. job offers.RMO- You can start working as an RMO in private hospitals/Nursing homes as an MBBS doctor.MO \u2014 You can join as a General Medical Officer in your State Health service. You will need to sit for an interview at the least.Own Clinic- You can set up your own clinic and start looking after patients as a General Physician.MBA \u2014 Ace the CAT exam and you're in. A classmate of mine got into IIM-A after MBBS.UPSC \u2014 I do not need to elaborate on this. There are popular Quorians who went into IAS after MBBS.Research- PhD programmes are present in NIMHANS, IISc for those interested to switch to Medical Research.Medical Journalism \u2014 Medical blogger, content writer.Entrepreneurship\u2014 Why not ? You are one of the brightest minds of the country. If you have a great idea and are willing to take up the challenges of it, it is surely one of the things you can do!To think of it, you can pretty much do anything if you're willing to go for it. If you're a great artist, amazing photographer, brilliant writer you can pursue them even after you've become a doctor! :) Edit 1\u2014 There are some Masters program as well. Eg. Masters in Medical Science and Technology run by IIT -KGP. There is a separate entrance exam for this. If you have more options in mind, feel free to add ! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I have a very stereotypical plan at the moment. 31st December I finish my internship at AIIMS, Delhi and 1st January I will have to join residency (Internal Medicine) at the same, starting that grueling journey of 110 hours a week, which I am quite looking forward to! After 3 years of PG, I plan to crack the DM (super speciality) entrance for Neurology (most probably). Followed by 3 more years of DM. Post DM is where I haven't gotten things quite worked out and that is how it is with life. You don't know what might happen tomorrow so you don't make plans for the decade. All you can do is have a dream that gives you focus. In my 1st year I dreamt of a residency in Johns Hopkins but I gave up on that dream as I planned to stay in India and felt it better to do residency here to get more appropriate clinical exposure.I also dream to work on a committee of WHO so as to contribute on a larger scale.I very strongly want to work with Doctors without Borders (M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res) for probably a year.With a penchant for teaching, I would love it if I could be a faculty member in AIIMS, seeing patients and doing solid research along with inspiring young minds.Lastly, I would like to end up in a charitable hospital like the Sir Gangaram hospital in Delhi. Private or corporate practice is something I feel is not my cup of tea as I feel I cannot affect many lives or contribute enough in such an environment with various restrictions.Of course these are just ideas running in my weary mind at the moment. All I'm sure about is the next moment, where I plan to tuck myself in and go to sleep. Bonne nuit. ",

I have a long life, I am in no hurry. I want to relax first, click some wildlife photographs, travel a bit, loose weight, fall in love, write a book and then maybe decide for career. There are two possible scenarios. Do the post-graduation. Preference in decreasing order- Psychiatry>Forensic>OrthopaedicsUPSC CSENow, The problem is the order of preference. First two are ridiculed by society and considered pathetic, thus by my dad and friends. This makes the choice of career a very very difficult problem. One year back money and a Rolls Royce were my only goals. Now, my goal is changed. Peace is what I am really after. I don't want to make millions and work 20 hours a day. I know I have a lonely life ahead. At least, I don't want to be tired in it. Sometimes, I want to change the world little bit. I want to do some social work maybe. ",

            "answer_text": "The medical field is full of some of the most respected scientists in the world with doctors being chief among them. But the career is not for everyone. In fact, Most of the doctors are finding alternative career paths to switch, Earlier the snapshot has conducted a survey on newly qualified doctors regarding career switch, shockingly more than half of the respondents are started thinking about the second career and majority mentioned stress, too much bureaucracy, lack of sleep, long working hours and failed expectations as reasons. Things Influencing doctors to switch career Time remains an issue for doctors because the role itself demands long working hours so, due to this they often missed out functions, events, work stress like fear of losing patients makes them to look for a career change or self-employment. Sometimes incorrect decisions of a doctor can cost his career and also spoils the reputation of the hospital. By keeping this kind of things in mind doctors are not accepting challenges and eventually leads to dissatisfaction with the job. Though doctors feel responsible for the role eventually they feel bored of doing regular check-ups, wasting time in billing and time charting, attending to insurance companies to justify the prescriptions and other tests. All the patients aren't same they do some research about something before they visit and they don't convince my doctors' diagnosis and they give a bad feedback about the doctor. The scope of MBA after MBBS Most of the doctors study MBA after MBBS to settle in hospital administration or choose it for a career change. Administration is a part of health care industry and is very crucial, as patients count is increasing rapidly due to modern lifestyle and various other factors which means increasing and managing the staff is demanded and this is done by a hospital administrator.

From the cancer ward to the pediatric ward, there are a variety of staffing issues and concerns that must be addressed. In the area of administration, there are many opportunities which include patient or employee care and/or operations of a health organization. Doctors with dual degrees are more successful than single degree holders and as per the New York Times analysis in 2014, hospital administrators earn an annual salary of $237,000 and clinical physicians $185,000.

Yes last few examinations I faced was mostly like this so you can guess the expression of my face  Basically it's too tough handling housestaffship, weekend classes and examination preparation  But that said, I choose this life cause only post graduation in clinical subject more specifically in general surgery would please me, that said I have already got a lot free advice on why and how it is not suitable for women to do post graduate in general surgery. Most commonly cited reasons given to me were it will hamper my family life, spouse life, also that m.ch will take another 3 years after MS! Yes true life can get real tough but may be that's what I strive for may be that's why I didn't choose a peaceful life after MBBS  But if that was the case I shouldn't have joined medical on first place.

The root of this problem lies not only in irrational use of antimicrobial agents but also insufficient interactions between patients and doctors.

Following options are: Pursue a job in Govt set up like PHC or Community health centres as a Medical officer. You may get chance to do PG after 5 years of service and retire as Distric health Officer or health secretary. Pursue MBA in Hospital administration and join corporate hospitals. You lose feel and skill of doctor as you can't treat them with medicine! Pursue MD/MS degree in speculation like General surgery to Paediatrics to Patho etc. Do DNB in any medical specialisation . You can try to do 5 years course of DM Neurology or Cardilogy or Mch of Neurosurgery from eminent medical institution of India. Clear PLAB exam and get chance to work as Doctor in NHS in UK. Later do post graduation in UK. Take up USMLA and pursue medical career in USA. Clear Australian medical service exam and migrate to Australia. Last three options require lot of money, time duration and will power. Do social service by doing general practice in your home town with nominal charges \u2026. Most rewarding and gratifying job. ",

            "answer_text": "What is best to do after MBBS? Well, post-graduation definitely.. What branch to take depends on various factors: Money is high in radiology. Guys love orthopaedics. Girls want a cool branch and hence take dermatology, ophthalmology, ENT, para-clinical and pre-clinical departments. But this is too much simplification. It doesn't work this way many times. Many guys don't like surgical fields and take medical branches. Or they want to spend time with family and take cool branches. Many girls love surgery and take up surgical fields. So every person is different. Post internship, you will develop a certain liking to few branches. And post entrance exams, u will be able to choose even fewer branches. So do not belittle any branch. All are good. Decide well before choosing. Do not regret after choosing. ",

            "answer_text": "Alot In context to continuing medical profession MBBS is just the second step. Miles to go\u2026.. Next would be postgraduate and later Mch, a superspeciality course. If you are an Indian you have to crack neet pg examination (or some other competitive exams like AIIMS , DNB June session ,PGI, Nimhans etc )and according to your rank you will be allotted the feild of your interest in prefered college. After that you can seek superspeciality course and again you have to crack a competitive exam for it. Meanwhile another option is you can start practicing just after MBBS by joining as a medical officer. But in today's scenario I can think you should think of atleast taking up a postgraduate course. Besides all this routine stuff there is an another option too Apply for a job in either Navy or defence and after I guess 3yrs you will be having scope of getting a postgraduate seat by cracking a exam that would be easier than rest of the competitive exams. I do not know the exact process related to it so just enquire about it more. Hope this helps you out. :) ",

I have a secret (no longer) dream to pursue IAS after completing MBBS but my parents are reluctant to enroll me for its preparation since it is the toughest competitive exam of our country and success rate is really low. Moreover people often say that there's no point of doing MBBS if you had to take up IAS and stuffs like that so my parents have thought of enrolling me into DAMS from 6th semester probably for PG preparations. If I do PG my desired fields are Gynaecology, Paediatrics or Dermatology. So basically I'm still quite uncertain about my future now. I'm just focusing on my preparations for 1st Prof exams. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, respect the degree. The degree should always be abbreviated in capital letters (MBBS). Secondly, you should know that it is very popular degree in India and you can find tons of information through the internet. As someone said person with MBBS have tons of options such as qualifying for MD and MS clinical post graduation in India, applying for US medical residency programs, various jobs in the government in India such as medical officer and such, can go in pharma field as doctor, private practice, and tons of other options. The problem is getting into MBBS program. So you should focus on that if you are genuinely interested in the medical field. ",

Use the time of compulsory internship of one year for getting hands on practice of cases+prepare for PG entrance exam if you have determination or prepare well for going abroad. Frankly speaking, if you are not keen on studying further , get set for government jobs. Appear in exams for UPSC, state govt entrances, Armed Forces Medical Services. For these jobs, you can get through easily if you refresh your MBBS knowledge. So, choose from PG, job in State health services or Central Govt services. ",

Will give neet and aiims pg and if I clear it then I will be doing general surgery and then superspeciality mostly in cardiothoracic branch. Not sure because I am still in 2nd year, my mind may change after knowing other subjects. 2- Join Army: I don't know why I got inclined towards army after I finished my 1st year. I am thinking to join army as a medical officer after completing my mbbs. This is actually my Plan B. Let's see. P.S. My father wants me to crack UPSC after my mbbs. ;) Thanks :) ",

Post all the education , one can do a job in private or government sector OR start his/her own clinic or hospital. A few of mbbs doctors do not pursue further education. They start their own clinic as general physicians OR work in PHC as medical officers. Few of the mbbs doctors prepare for USMLE or UK examinations (for post graduation). Though the number of doctors going abroad has reduced nowadays due to bleak chances of getting MD seats there. Rarely few mbbs doctors pursue MBA / UPSC exams. Hope this helps. ",

Basically these are the things which everyone wants in their life, but they are unable to fulfil there demands due to some reasons or the other. Its very good that you have thought about it at an early stage. The most interesting thing I would like to tell you is that.. You can have all your demands fulfilled during the MBBS course itself.. The course itself provides a lot of time to enquire into your own self. So my humble request to you would be that brother just try to get into MBBS college. For your future aspect, first study for 5.5 years and after that if still your requirements remain the same then also you can safely lead a life fulfilling your demands by doing post graduation or residency in either india or abroad. Dont worry dear, I am sure your requirements will change after 5 years. ",
