It seems daily that the \u2018upheld as gospel\u2019 can never be compromised 'laws of physics\u2019 are being bent in ways which make their \u2018forever this way\u2019 proclaiming scientists look like blubbering, attempting to save face, neanderthals who said there would be no such thing as fire and then see flint begin to glow. I'm hopeful/happy as each new experiments results: 1.Quantum computers reversing quantum particles to an intial state. 2.Now never before interacting electrons have been brought to entangled states, so quantum computing gate teleportation methods may use electron means instead of light. (John Nichols and team, University of Rochester NY). 3.The means of measurement of of electrons by a quantum computer can be correlated from an end result to its beginning souce with the same energy output. (Singapore 2019). The above 3 violate many physicists core belief's about physics by there existence. Just as is the case with my stern belief that - A measurement of the end state of a quantum particle by it's \u2018in the future\u2019 experimenter decides in an instantaneous way the result seen by a present moment experimenter in his now taking place observation - \u2018moment.\u2019 ",
