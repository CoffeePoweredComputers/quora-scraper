            "answer_text": "Thinking of invention *ideas* is easy.  You can have hundreds a day.  Every time you solve a challenge, you have an invention idea.   Turning these ideas into *inventions* is a different matter.  That's why patents don't protect intellectual ideas, they protect the device that is based on the idea.   To get better at coming up with invention ideas, keep your eyes open.  Keep a look out for things that you don't know why they are the way they are.  Don't just accept that that is the way they are.  Instead, ask yourself why it might be that way.  Coming up with reasons (that someone else might have had) for the way the thing is will give your mind practice at thinking about why something solves some problem.  Even if you get the wrong reason, that's not a problem.  It is still exercise for your brain.   Try to turn yourself back into a kid and ask, \"Why?\" all the time.  Except ask it of yourself.  After you've tried to come up with some reasons, go look it up online and see if you can find out some of the real reasons.  Sometimes, you can't find the answer online and then you might have to ask an expert.  I never knew an expert that didn't mind showing off their expertise by explaining something.   Sometimes the best challenges are the ones that you think are really stupid and you can't think of any good reason to do it that way.  But you might be surprised when you do finally learn why.  I'll give you an example.  I wondered why plumbers sometimes put insulation on the drain line underneath the sink.  Insulation is to stop heat leaks.  I could understand why you would put insulation around the hot water line going to the sink.  Maybe even the cold water supply line to keep it cold.  But why would you need to insulate the waste water?  It's not like you need to keep it warm.  Boy that must be some stupid set of plumbers!  Well, maybe I couldn't get past the disbelief enough to let my mind think of reasons that might make sense.  I got a kind of invention blindness that time.  But in the end I asked an expert - I asked a plumber!  He told me it is so condensation would not form on the outside and drip onto the tiles and make them slippery!  Awesome.  What an idiot I was.  Not because I couldn't figure that out myself, but because I couldn't let go of the idea that it was a stupid and useless thing to do.  I learned a very valuable lesson that time.  There are often different ways of looking at things.  Different reasons for doing things.  Don't be dismissive.  But do find out.   So, keep looking at things and tying to figure out why they are the way they are and you will start to have more invention ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "Cheat Sheet for Innovators I\u2019ve been an inventor for fifty years. I have many patents and have spent much of my life in R&D departments. My patents involve software, electronics, and mechanical devices. I have a cheat sheet that I refer to when I need ideas. Note that this is more of a train-of-thought than an outline. The ideas are not intended to be used as-is, but to spur other new ideas when considered. I try to add to this sheet when I need to think of something new or a new way to do something. But I don\u2019t usually delete obsolete or used ideas from here, as they can still be used to spawn new ideas; so you will find some things listed here that have already been invented but that I wrote of many years ago. Quora\u2019s text-input editor, of course, stripped all of the useful indentation from the document. Sorry. I hope this sheet can be useful to you\u2026  Idea Tree for Innovation Snippets to tickle your creative side...

Look over the list repeatedly, trying to identify potential value in the answers. Highlight or underline those worth pursuing.  Sample Ideas These are not meant to \u200bbe \u200bthe ideas but rather to be the \u200btriggers\u200b that spur fresh ideas from your own experiences. Read these to get your mind in gear and to carry the inertia forward \u2013 uncharted territory combined with your own perspective on needs (necessity, after all, really is the mother of invention) will drive innovation. Get those gears turning\u2026 24) Leverage Your Own Talent a) Are you a good writer? Start an online business for writing resumes, composing advertising copy, or proofreading/editing/polishing for authors. b) Are you good with people and have some nice dress outfits? Become a sometimes local\u00ad rep for companies that occasionally need local representation. c) Do you have experience and credentials in some specialty? Become a consultant by first writing a series of blogs and building your profile, then create an online presence that you can market. d) Do you have some creations that you are especially proud of, be they sculptures, woodcrafts, ceramics, or clothing? Don\u2019t sell them but, instead, use them as a portfolio to advertise for custom work, as people often have very unique needs yet cannot find a qualified provider \u2013 and they are willing to pay for it. e) Maniac Mechanical Computer (Kit - fairly sophisticated) - Mechanical computer to be assembled. Probably plastic parts but maybe laser-cut wood. Base plates lock together as a back-plane \u2013 connected via address/data/control bus: probably 16-bit rotational but maybe multi-lever binary buses. 6x2 text display (5x7 font) for output, 20-key mechanical pad for input. (i.e. 0\u2026F, Enter, Fn, BS, Esc) 25) Curmudgeon App/Website a) There are plenty of social sites such as Facebook and Twitter for sharing your day\u00ad-to\u00adday experiences. But many people prefer to rant and have trouble finding victims to listen to them because people may not agree with them and are sick of listening to them. b) It would be great if a website/app allowed people with like minds to congregate, yet allowed those who disagreed to intervene as well. The rants could be relentless so the app would have to be able to make efficient use of screen real estate and direct the user\u2019s eyes based on his/her interest and key factors. c) Ideally it would parse the ranter\u2019s text to identify his/her topic and stance and then be able to route him/her automatically. d) Rants that were heavily liked or disliked ought to be saved and then automatically injected into future conversations as blasts from the past. e) It would be nice if it could chart public opinion versus rants as well. 26) Soda Vend Mechanism a) It\u2019s apparent from the plethora of mechanisms in soda vending machines that nobody has yet discovered the way these machines ought to work. b) A good solution will be reliable, low\u00ad-cost, have few moving parts, will not shake or break the bottles, accommodate all bottle/can size and shape variations, and be easy to load. Simple objectives \u2013 dreadful solutions. c) On the web, research the ways these machines operate, learn about common problems with them, get familiar with the patents related to their mechanisms, and try to think of a better way. For instance, if there are five rows of ten racks each then there should be no more than fifteen possible slides or pivots\u037e ideally even fewer. 27) Mobile Phone User Interface Improvements a) What are the most annoying aspects of the user interface on a mobile phone? b) Does it bother people that they often are unsure of whether their tap was hard enough so they tap again only to have it go past the expected page? c) What about buttons and links that pop up just as the user taps, causing a different action that what was intended? d) And going back is often a problem when a user is deeply nested into pages, because they either have to wait for each to load or end up going too far back. e) What about images that are too small to see yet that won\u2019t zoom when you pinch outward? f) There are many such issues on all type of smart phones and tablets. g) Would you expect to be able to amend these situations with an app or would you sell your solutions to the handset manufacturer? 28) Outdoor D\u00e9cor a) Home improvement stores do a huge business and you could be wealthy if you invented even one product that they wanted to carry. Look around in your house or go outside and look around. b) See those ugly white risers that support the hedge sprinklers? Why can\u2019t you buy an inexpensive breakaway sleeve to drop over the risers that was green and leafy and blended in with the bushes? c) Fingerprints and gunk all over the window in the storm door? You ought to be able to buy static-\u00adstick patches to protect those areas, maybe with floral prints or sports team logos. d) Scratches and flaking paint on the window and door frames? The paint for those can be found but if you found a small bronze, white, or aluminum metal touch-\u00adup kit right next to the checkout, you\u2019d buy it in a heartbeat. e) Concrete chips and potholes? You don\u2019t want to buy a big can of concrete adhesive and hefty bag of concrete. It\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t buy a really good kit for fixing small areas. f) Dry rot on your eaves? You need a strip of white L-\u00adshaped plastic to cover it, but the ones you can find have inner gussets or staggered holes. 29) Scan via Mobile Camera a) Most people have a lot of items they want to scan, categorize, and often do character recognition on: records, checks, collectibles, business cards, and all of their old photos. b) There is a popular scanner that comes with software for this very purpose. The problem is that scanning is a slow operation and most people now use mobile devices and don\u2019t want to carry their scanner around with them. c) It would be great if there were an application that would work similarly, ran in the background so you needn\u2019t wait for it, and that would ingest images from the mobile device\u2019s camera rather than a scanner. d) Large images could be snapped in multiple pieces and the app would stitch them together before processing them. e) What are you waiting for? Start coding! 30) Leverage Disruptive Changes a) Adoption of smart phones means women will need their purses less. How might this disruptive change be taken advantage of? b) A \"makeup mirror\" phone app, uses the front camera, horizontally flips the image? c) A flat/sturdy pocket \u00adsize makeup kit? d) Key chain makeup dongle? e) Disposable high \u00adquality makeup in vending machines? f) Skype plug-\u00adin for makeup photo\u00ad-enhancement? 31) Novelty Items a) Try to come up with clever novelty products such as an adapter that allows a beer tapper handle to be attached to a flush valve for use on urinals and toilets in bars and clubs. b) How about a cat litter box that prevents cats from tracking the litter particles all over the room. 32) Easy Mobile Apps a) DealFinder \u00ad Monitors your e-\u00adreceipts and amazon purchases for items you buy often and then searches for deals on them when it is about time to buy more. b) Toxic Sewage \u00ad Interactive video game that involves gross acts, similar to those on fear factor but even crazier. It allows you to select an avatar/player/victim such as a politician, actress, or even a friend from your photos. c) Custom Group \u00ad A brandable/customizable app to be used for a bowling league, HOA, boy scout troop, small company, or church. Has chat, documents, news, roster, scheduling, reminders, map/nav, etc. Also with a website for setup/mgmt. d) Battery Saver \u00ad Dims your screen when you're not looking at it, turns off GPS or Bluetooth when it is not in use, Kills certain (configurable) apps when they are idle for so long, keeps track of which apps are killing the battery, notifies you, and is more aggressive with those. e) Plaint \u00ad Like Paint for mobile with the addition of some image processing, vector recognition and edge\u00ad-detection, and soft\u00ad-drawing with auto\u00ad-shading and textures. f) EdWord \u00ad An editor and word\u00ad-processor that keeps the text and the formatting in separate files so that it can be used with regular text files. g) DubDub \u00ad Sound recorder with metronome, MIDI accompaniment, mixer, rate\u00adchanger, ability to remotely share so that recordings from different places and times can be merged. h) FollowUp (App or Website) - A news aggregator with one significant difference: A [FollowUp] icon on each story can be tapped/clicked, in which case subsequent updates to that news story will be pushed to the user. If there was a crash, find out about the fate of those who were hospitalized. If a politician made a promise or threat, keep abreast of his/her progress thereafter. ",
