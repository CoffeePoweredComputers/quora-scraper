            "answer_text": "Chill\u2026.Dude!!! First of all, why are you dying to know their phone number??? This question is being followed by lots of people, at least 300. Now the thing is\u2026. phone number is a very personal thing. If you are trying to send them some message, you can find their mail address and send them fan letter. why phone number??? Look, I get it. Every fan wants to get to know them better and personally. Hence we almost over analyze our idols. From which brand toothpaste he/she uses to where he/she goes. If we consider BTS, these fellas are almost 24x7 online posting videos, photos, performing in shows\u2026 Have you ever imagined yourselves at their shoes?? WOULD YOU LIKE BEING WATCHED 24X7, without a break???? I would never. I am a highly private person. If my siblings even try being with me 24x7 I feel uncomfortable. And a whole camera broadcasting everything ??? NO WAY. Have you ever thought, how they feel ? Every time being self conscious and tense because they are being broadcasted. No chilling time. They have to broadcast their fun time as well. They are never off duty. We chill with their songs and they shed blood sweat and tears in making those. We only get and get. Still we want more. Imagine, YOU are being constantly watched. you can\u2019t even meet your parents. By chance if you meet your siblings, untill and unless you are officially revealing their identity\u2026. fans will spread fake dating rumor. You make love songs but can\u2019t even meet the love of your life\u2026 have you ever imagined how much painful that might be?? Still we want to invade their personal space. And if they revealed their phone no? People whom you don\u2019t even know will spam them continuously. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT!!!! ANYONE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK THEM!!! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THREATENING THAT MIGHT BE???? THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL STARS!!! WHAT IF SOMEONE KIDNAPS THEM AND DEMAND RANSOM OR KILL THEM!!!!??? OMG. DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD REVEAL THEIR PHONE NUMBER???? No please. You don\u2019t want them to get killed, do you? Purples \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "*Inhales* \u2026 I\u2019ve already answered this question, but seeing this type of request again makes me a little annoyed. I will say this one more time only, so please don\u2019t request this type of question to me ever again. PERSONAL. PRIVACY. IS. A. THING. Why is it so hard to understand? I get that you want to get to know your idol, but you do realize they are human beings too right? Put yourself in their shoes. If you were an idol that was relatively famous, would you suddenly want your phone to be flooded with messages of \u201cPLEASE MARRY ME\u201d or \u201cI LOVE YOU PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE RESPOND OMG AHHHHHHHHH.\u201d Or even more so do you want someone to leak your number so that you would get spammed with hate mail??? Random hateful strangers asking you to die??? I\u2019m sorry to be like the 20th person to break it to you but nice try. We are never going to be anything more than fans to BTS. Whoever the lucky girl they decide to date, don\u2019t leak HER phone number either. That\u2019s just rude and immature. Support the couple please. There have been so many \u201cscandals\u201d that result in an unnecessary suspension of a group or an expulsion of a member. It\u2019s stupid. Fans like this really need to suck it up and face reality. Don\u2019t be obsessive over your bias. It\u2019s weird, not to mention creepy. Admire them yes, but remain RESPECTFUL. They have private lives not to be pried with. If you try, you might even find a court case on your hands. Yes, the company can even sue you. They are legally able to do so. So just\u2026 Don\u2019t be a weirdo you weirdo. Get it? Got it? Good. I\u2019m sorry if I come off rude but it\u2019s the truth. Enough is enough. This applies to all other obsessive and saesang fans in all K-Pop fandoms. Just stop, and please just respect idols\u2019 privacy. At the end of the day, all idols are regular people too, and they deserve to be treated as such. Thank you, and have a good rest of your day :) (BTW, if this answer looks familiar, yes, I did copy and paste from another deleted question that asked the same thing. It\u2019s below my pay grade to write the same thing again and again for the same petty question.) ",
