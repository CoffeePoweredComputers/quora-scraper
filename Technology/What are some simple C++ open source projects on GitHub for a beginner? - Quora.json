            "answer_text": "With the ever changing face of open source and the vast number of projects, it is a bit hard to say exatly which projects out there are suitable for a beginner. Instead, I\u2019d like to tell you about 3 simple steps on how would I go about finding a good open source project. CodeTriage is a free service helps you find projects, by picking a handful of open issues and delivering them directly to your inbox. You can choose from the projects with high to low health (number of issues). Red - (new and active) High chances of finding something you can work on,Yellow - (evolving) Moderate chances andGreen - (stable and matured) few chances, may be.2. IssueHub allows you to search issue labels to find the right project. You can use beginner label and add cpp to the language filter to find interesting projects.  3. and finally, use Github search and filters to find what you (almost) exactly want (I suggest repositories with most forks).  The open source is ever evolving and there are always new resources and projects sprouting around and a vast community continuously working on solving the issues. So, it is a good idea to develop a sharp eye to grab the opportunity at the right moment. There are a few other places where you can go for more recommendations likeyourfirstpr, firsttimersonly, up-for-grabs, c++ topic on github, etc. I found scrabble to be a relatively simple repo and space invaders is a favourite.

            "answer_text": "Its difficult to find open source projects for \"beginners\". By the time some open source projects become popular enough (when a lot of developers start contributing to it) they also become fairly complex spanning over hundred of files. Most of them will have a comprehensive test suite, coding style guidelines, etc which may be difficult for a beginner to grasp. I think that it's best to start with larger organisations with a wider community. Some projects (say Google's TensorFlow) will require at least basic domain knowledge which again is a difficult thing to do but some won't require much domain knowledge. A very large and active developer community also means that they are have more experience with beginners and that they have wider variety of tasks for a beginner. They will be able to guide you in a better way. A curated list of popular C++ frameworks can be found here : fffaraz/awesome-cpp. Go ahead and explore this list. I am sure you'll find something interesting. ",
