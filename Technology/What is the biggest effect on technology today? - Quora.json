            "answer_text": "Your question is worded strangely, but in attempting to understand it I infer that you would like to know what might be the most powerful and influential area of new and emerging technology. If that is the case\u2014and forgive me if I am wrong\u2014I would suggest nanotechnology as one of the most powerful future technologies, starting with semiconductors. Biomedicine will be tightly linked to this effect. If by your question you are asking what is having the biggest effect on technology today, I would say that the relative reduction in the level of basic research, as opposed to applied research, is having a profound effect. This shift reflects the drive for short-term profit from salable new products, rather than the need for scientific speculation of lesser immediate potential value. Secondarily, I would suggest that the fact that more engineers and scientists are working on new technologies than lived until, say, the late 20th century, is accelerating technological change. I hope other, better informed Quorans will suggest other technological considerations. ",
