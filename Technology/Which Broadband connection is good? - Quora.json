            "answer_text": "When you look to find a broadband connection in the market, you can easily get many options to choose from. But picking a right and reliable broadband connection among all is quite a challenging task especially for those who don\u2019t know much about the broadband technologies. No matter whether you want a web connection for home or office, it is always good to have the best internet connection at your end. That\u2019s why it is always good to look and compare all the features and plans of available Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in your area for best selection. Answering to this question, I must say that it is not possible for anyone to tell which connection is good or bad because one connection which is good in any particular area might be not working well in some other area. Similarly, one connection which is not performing well in any particular area might be working perfectly in some other area. Therefore always look to find connections which are good in your area only. If you ask me about the best broadband connection in Gurgaon and Delhi then I will suggest you to go for either TriplePlay Broadband or Airtel Broadband. And if you look cheaper and better between both the connections then TriplePlay has little edge over Airtel because of wider unlimited data plans and prompt customer service. Being the local service provider, TriplePlay assures you top-class speed, better connectivity and unmatched customer support round the clock. ",
