            "answer_text": "The term, \u201cuncanny valley\u201d (\"Bukimi No Tani\") was coined by Japanese roboticist, Masahiro Mori. https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley It is a concept relating to human responses to things that are human-like.  This famous graph shows the valley. It is a valley of human emotional response. For things that have human-like feature, but are not really pretending to be human, we have a favourable, familiar response. This is baby Groot. He\u2019s not trying to pretend to be human, but he does have eyes, mouth, and basic humanoid shape. He\u2019s cute.  This is a real baby, also cute. Awww!  This monstrosity is an animatronic puppet. It is much more lifelike than baby Groot, but there is something horrendously unreal and uncanny about it.  The CGI replacement is no better:  Argh! Kill it with fire! So, as human-likeness increases, we have a more favourable familiar emotional response to it. Until it gets very close to being like a human, and then we have a strong feeling of revulsion. Artificial humans (robots, puppets, or CGI characters) suffer from this effect. Motion is a large part of the problem. Computer graphics are so good that now still images of humans often cross the valley, but as soon as they move, we know there is something off. We have evolved highly sophisticated emotion detection abilities, so we can detect even minute problems with motion. Especially eye movements. It is how we can often tell when someone is lying, by the small unconscious movements, like where they look, how fast they blink, the dilation of their pupils, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a name for the fact that a depiction of a human being that's really close to looking real, but doesn't quite get there, makes people uncomfortable, whereas a fully unrealistic depiction or a fully realistic depiction doesn't have this effect. That space where an image is both too realistic and not realistic enough is the \u201cvalley\u201d. The classic example is that we're perfectly fine looking at both hand drawn animation and actual photos of people, but less-than-perfect CGI animation of humans tends to creep us out. There's interesting research going on to determine what factors contribute and combine the most to drop an image into the valley (skin textures? eye movements? Etc\u2026) in order to help with both entertainment and AI interface design. ",
