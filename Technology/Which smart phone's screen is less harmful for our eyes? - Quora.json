            "answer_text": "Phone screens do not harm normal eyes in any way. The brightness is measured in nits (candelas per square meter). The brightest phone screens are about 250 nits. The colors of light in phone screens are similar to daylight. That means the amount of blue light relative to red and green is about the same as in sunlight. That means there is far more green light than either blue or red. That is just because that it what we perceive as white light. If you walk outside and look at a sidewalk, you are looking at a couple of thousand nits. That means you are looking at ten times the blue light (as well as every other kind of light) that comes from a phone screen. Clinical studies have shown that using smartphones have no effect on myopia progression. People believe that blue light is harmful because a lens company wanted to sell blue blocking coatings and misrepresented or lied about blue light danger. If blue light were a danger, humans could never have survived outdoors and hunted for food. If you think there is some kind of magical blue light from computer screens, you have been misinformed and you haven't used logic to spot the scam.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s actually not the screen that proves harmful to the human eye, but the color of light it emits. So, according to that info, every smartphone screen capable of changing color is safe for your eyes. Nowadays, smartphone manufacturers and software providers include usually include a feature in their smartphones allowing you to adjust the screen\u2019s brightness along with the color to better soothe your eyes. For example, the iPhones starting from the iPhone X (Also, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus) come with a display feature called True Tone. True Tone uses the ambient light sensor jutted somewhere near the front camera to detect the lighting in the surrounding and adjust the screen\u2019s color according to that. This, however, isn\u2019t useful when you excessively use your phone. I\u2019m talking hours at a stretch. So, it\u2019s always helpful to limit smartphone usage. But yeah, there are provisions in modern smartphones to prevent eye damage. And that\u2019s good to know. ",
