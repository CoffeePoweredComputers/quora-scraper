If you misinformed the internet your data is worthless otherwise, you are public, once on the internet, there\u2019s no hiding. Take Alexandra Martinez I have to admit she\u2019s more famous than the real life me already crossing 1M visit since joining Quora. But is a contradictory character. I think I put woman in my intro, in some adults sites I am a transgender and on facebook I am a male. I have in age from 29yo (currently) to 45yo (currently) so, when advertisers gather that data they don\u2019t know if to sell me fishing sporting goods or the last female fashion trends or send me to popular cross-dressing stores. There are so many of me out there that if the census was done online there would be at least 24 versions of me living in New York and I think one version of the real life me lives in California a state I haven\u2019t even visit. I think you are in control of what is available out there and once in a while click the \u201cdeny\u201d button when they ask about sharing your data. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of information on the internet however that doesn't mean there is a lot of accurate information on the internet. Corporations gather data in order to be able to sell you things. If when you were giving them the information you had engaged in a vigorous disinformation campaign, told them you were transgendered and 102 years old an ovo-lactarian and had an annual income of $200. Their data would be worthless. It is every American's duty to contaminate the data miners database with as much hogwash as possible. Consider it your patriotic duty. ",

There was an obscure picture claiming my name. Why, I don\u2019t know. My only comment is that I am not much older than the young woman pictured, more comely, in my opinion, and I am a modest woman.
