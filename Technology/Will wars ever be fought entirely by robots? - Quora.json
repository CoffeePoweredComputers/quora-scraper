            "answer_text": "A robot is just a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Those actions might be physical, digital, or even economic, but in the end the idea is to inflict some kind of harm on human beings. The most prominent modern examples of robotic war machines are the Predator and Reaper drones. Yet increasingly, some \"machines\" are designed specifically for digital warfare, whether on a small scale (corporate hacks) or an international scale (Stuxnet). We live in a highly connected world, digitally and economically. The major global players of the past were capable of incredible physical destruction, and they still are. But after the end of the second World War, the world's economies began to intertwine; today, a recession in a country the size of Greece impacts players as large as China or the United States. Today, losses are not measured so much in lives as in dollars. In this world, the greatest weapon is not firepower, but economics. Our hyper-interconnectedness has made the world economy incredibly sensitive to global events (e.g. Greece, tsunamis, Middle East turmoil, Congress), and because it is so sensitive, it is increasingly susceptible to exploitation and attack with minimal effort.  President Obama has not resorted to physical warfare in Iran, because physical warfare is expensive and ineffective, as America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade have shown. Instead, computer scientists developed the Stuxnet virus and world leaders imposed crippling economic sanctions, both of which will probably prove cheaper and more effective in containing the nuclear proliferation in that country than bombing it. Because of the new world economy and our hyper-connectedness, war will continue to evolve and employ weapons which can do far greater damage than just physical force, and at significantly less cost. So while wars in the future will be won and lost by machines and economics, their effects will always extend to people, and they will require people to develop, operate, and execute them. ",

            "answer_text": "In a strictly literal sense, maybe, but that point is a long ways off.  In a much more accurate sense, no.  \"Robots\" can be programmed to alter their behavior based on conditional programming, but they can never truly make decisions in the same sense that a human can.  The most likely scenario that would see lots of \"robots\" in combat is in the form of drones: Machines directly controlled by humans from a distance.   In that case, though, you still have to look at it from the perspective of who is doing the actual fighting.  If someone dies by a sword no one says \"That sword killed someone!\", because a sword is incapable of thought, the fault has to lie with the person controlling it.  So even if wars are fought largely or entirely by drones in the future it still wouldn't be \"Fought entirely by robots\" in my mind because the machines are still incapable of thought and controlled by people.
