            "answer_text": "In modern world there are lot of technologies that are good for application development. To choose the best you need to first of all define your constraints. Do you require a mobile or a web app ?How soon you want to get developed ?What are the complexity in development ?What mobile platforms you want to get it developed for ?Typically for a web application you essentially need html. But you cannot keep modifying static pages. All you need is Javascript to change those. Also you need to communicate to the database and display it on the view. To tackle this application development can be broadly classified into front end web development and backend web development. There are lot of popular front end technologies based on Javascript (React / angular / JQuery). Similary for backend Django / python / Node. So to build your application you need to find the correct stack which is best suited. Also if you need to build a mobile app then you must consider cross platform development frameworks like corodova / React native which can simply share codebase between the web and mobile application. If you are just going to make android / ios app as a solo platform app you can look at swift / objective c respectively. So before choosing find what is your actual use case and time for development. There are lot of application development companies which can help you for the same. ",
