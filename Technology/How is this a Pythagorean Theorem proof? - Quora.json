            "answer_text": "It is filled out to a proof as explained in Pflueger's answer, but there are an immense number of details that need justification. First, is there such a figure in the first place?  How was it constructed? We're given one of the blue triangles with sides a, b, and c with a right angle between sides a and b.  Extend each side a and b by a length equal to b and a, respectively.  And that can be done why? Then construct perpendiculars at the ends of those lines.  And that can be done why? Those two perpendicular lines intersect.  Why? And they cut each other off at distances a + b.  Why? And they meet at a right angle. Why? Thus we have a large square with sides a + b. Draw the other three lines labelled c. Each one has length c. Why? Why? Why? Thus we have shown that the yellow quadrilateral is equal sided. And it's got four right angles.  Why? Thus, it's a square. That's part I of the proof. Part II is the other dissection of the big square into squares of sides a and b and four a by b triangles.  That's easier.  Why? Part III is the subtraction of the four a by b triangles from each figure to get the result.  This is the most subtile part.  It's also very intuitive, but the justification of cut and paste methods for finding areas is complicated.  Euclid took it for granted. ",
