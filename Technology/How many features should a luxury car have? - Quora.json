            "answer_text": "Your question could be asking one of two things so I\u2019ll answer it both ways.. First of all, nothing. There shouldn't be any \u2018standard\u2019 features on a luxury car. The very thing that makes them luxurious is that they are different from most other cars on the market and much better for it in their own right. I mean, do you buy a rolls (designed around the rear seat experience, because you expect to be chauffeured) or a Bentley (designed around the drivers experience)? Secondly I\u2019d perceive your question to ask what I\u2019d expect to find on any luxury car, that\u2019s just expected or it wouldnt be luxurious without it. That varies from person to person.. That\u2019d be for me; A big engine with plenty of torqueA sleek exteriorLeather interiorA proper clock on the dashLots of legroomDual Climate controlHeated seats front and backAs up to date as possible stereo systemCupholdersCigar Lighters all roundReversing cameraParking Sensors front and back",
