            "answer_text": "I believe you may be able to detect a hidden cell phone if it is connected to your WiFi, since you can scan all the connections that was made together with the assigned IP address to hidden cell phone.. If the hidden cell phone is not connected to your local WiFi, it may also be possible to locate the hidden cell phone by calling its number to ring it.. There are also software applications I believe that are available to do exactly as you described, which would only work when the hidden cell phone is still powered ON.. ",
