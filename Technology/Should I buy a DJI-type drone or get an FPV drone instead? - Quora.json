            "answer_text": "Your decision should depend upon the purpose you require drones. DJI Drones are excellent choices due to their ease of operation and long flight times. However, if drone racing is something you are interested in, then FPV (First-Person View) flying could be your new path! Important elements to consider: Learning to fly FPV drones without crashing them could be a difficult task. The racing drones are made to be fast and agile. In contrast, a DJI drone with a Vision Positioning System (VPS) and additional sensors can fly with utmost precision.FPV drones also don't fulfil the function of high-end resolution cameras. FPV racing drones are known to record shaky and grainy videos during their flights.FPV Drones also offer shorter flight times when compared to DJI-Type drones.With FPV flying, your drone operating experience reaches a whole new level. FPV drones are surely the best choice for drone racers. However, anything apart from drone racing, we suggest you turn to other options! Before making any purchase, make sure you've done your research well, so you invest just right! ",

            "answer_text": "I would really encourage you to do some research of your own before buying something as expensive as a readymade multicopter. RCGroups is a good place to start: Remote Control, Radio Control Planes, Drones, Cars and Boats. The DJI looks over-priced for what it does and is something you are liable to become bored with quickly. Remember this: R/C model aircrafts are extremly accident prone; you will thank yourself for starting small when you get firsthand experience of this. For aerial photography multicopters work great, and the DJI looks like a nice (but expensive) out-of-the-box solution if that is all you want to do. If, however, you have an interest in model aviation or want to have interesting flying experiences I would not recommend it. There are many types of \u201cFPV drone\u201ds. For flying experience a mini race quad looks very nice, and can be affordable, but they are n o t beginner toys. I hope this helps! ",
