            "answer_text": "As technology develops, do you think it would ever make sense to say that a computer knows things? Depends on what you mean by \u201cknows things\u201d. All the way back in the late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s, computers knew where on the disk drive your data was, and lots of other things in the operating systems problem space. Expert systems also \u201cknow things\u201d in a given problem space, whether it\u2019s tax accounting, or diagnosing contagious diseases, or steering a car through traffic. And there\u2019s some AI systems that \u201cknow things\u201d about the problem space that us humans can\u2019t comprehend. Google\u2019s AI systems for playing the game Go were noted for their tendency to plunk a stone down on turn 30 at some apparently-unrelated part of the board, only to have that stone suddenly be crucial, related, and a winning move at turn 120 or so. But neither the humans or the AI can tell us how or why that move on turn 30 was chosen\u2026 Do we have a general knowledge AI that \u201cknows things\u201d? Not currently - it turns out that requires a *lot* of knowledge, much of it fuzzy. Remember - it takes humans like 2 decades to learn all of that stuff, and a lot of it is \u201cusually but not always\u201d things, like \u201cthings fall down, unless they\u2019re balloons or birds, unless the balloon springs a leak or the bird gets hit by one of the blades on a wind turbine\u2026.\u201d And it\u2019s really hard to get computers to play nice with squishy data like that\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Computers are machines designed to execute code for a specific purpose. Your PC is a general purpose machine designed to run various programs, i.e. email, web browser, productivity software and/or games and such. A PC can be designed to provide higher performance in graphics processing, for example, for gaming or advanced design software. Mainframe and \u201csuper\" computers are usually designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Machines used for \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d are usually specifically designed to run the associated software. Because these devices are machines designed for a particular use the only thing they \u201cknow\u201d is what they are programmed to do. AI can be very useful in performing specific tasks but do not have a capacity to \u201dknow\u201d anything other than what the algorithm is designed to do. These machines do not have any semblance of consciousness nor do they have any ability to achieve anything remotely like a biological nervous system or the ability to become sentient. We have a very incomplete knowledge of how human intelligence and ability works and the best more advanced devices and software can do is mimic one or two aspects of this. It may be possible, if quantum computing can be made to work, to expand the ability of a device or programming to better mimic human intelligence, but we are no where close to building a device that can be said to \u201dknow\u201d anything other than what it is programmed to do. The idea that a \u201dsentient\u201d computer is possible or desirable remains science fiction. In any case the \u201cdanger\u201d of such a machine is easily blunted by an off switch or a fire axe close to the server \u26cf\ufe0f ",
