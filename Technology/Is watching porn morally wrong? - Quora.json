            "answer_text": "Is watching porn morally wrong? Diogenes of Sinope said \u201cNothing natural is shameful.\u201d They called him \u201cDiogenes the dog\u201d for his habit of publicly relieving himself, but a lesser-know tic of Diogenes (lesser-known now - it was pretty dog-gone well-known then) was his habit of not just defecating or urinating in full view, but masturbating as well. This guy was so good at philosophy, he could make a fool out of pretty much anybody - to their face - and so fair with it that they walked off impressed by the man! He didn\u2019t bother writing much down for future generations (none of which survived, and since he didn\u2019t cultivate a gaggle of devoted fan-men like Socrates did, all we\u2019re left is a handful of sayings and anecdotes). Diogenes reasoned that future generations wouldn\u2019t get any more good out of philosophy than the people of his own time did. Waste of time. Might as well roam the teeming streets at noon with a lit lantern, \u201clooking for an honest man.\u201d In short, pretty shrewd individual. Alexander the Great met him once. Not a nice guy, Alexander. None too forgiving. He walked off observing, \u201cMan. If I wasn\u2019t already me, I\u2019d be that guy.\u201d Fat chance, Alex. I tend to hold with Diogenes on this one. Nothing natural is shameful. I\u2019d say that covers masturbation. It did for him. I\u2019m not sure if it covers porn. Porn covers an awful lot. There\u2019s porn and there\u2019s porn as it were. My stance is: humanity is beautiful, heart-breakingly so. It\u2019s our vulnerability, our need that makes us so especially achingly beautiful, especially when this is shared. Or our easy confidence, as if brazen. Either of these extremes is given a big leg up by nudity! \u201cOh! My clothes!\u201d We\u2019re so weird about our own skin. It only makes us more lovely, more to be cherished and protected. If the kind of porn you dig is two beautiful human beings going at it in a real (often amateurishly real) celebration of their mutual hot hard frantic reciprocal urge, or their deeply intense, intent tenderness, or even some half-ass perfunctory servicing - their celebration and enjoyment of each other, basically - and they decided \u201cLet\u2019s record this! Good stuff!\u201d Well that seems pretty harmless, even good. Unless one of them was a DICK and recorded it on the sly, or uploaded it without permission! In which case I hope the guilty party gets their teeth knocked out, all of them - but that\u2019s me. Privacy is sacred, unless both say otherwise. I get cold fury at people violating each other so. But the act itself, sex, come on. Is a highest and deepest human good. People ashamed of human sexuality should be (and are) ashamed of themselves. If the kind of porn you dig is two hard-eyed (or dead-eyed) pros going at it like it\u2019s their business, or maybe acting out a scenario for you to make it spicy - plumber & implausibly grateful customer, perhaps? - hell that seems okay to me, too. If giving someone sex is fine, and giving someone money for whatever is fine, then I say sex = whatever. It works. If it\u2019s still photos you dig, I\u2019d say the content is what matters. Naked people? Nothing natural is shameful. But if the porn you dig, moving or still pictures, is stuff that depicts the humiliation and degradation of another human being like it\u2019s hot - and to you it is hot? Just be aware this tends to feed your streak of cruelty, and your wish to degrade others. It desensitizes compassion as it normalizes desire to see another in dismay. To put them there. Nasty stuff. Big note: the more you relate to humans excessively through such disconnected means as porn, the more risk you run of having a harder time relating to one in a fully-engaged way, person-to-person. You turn people into ideas, into fantasy food - fit for a purpose that does not include much. So there\u2019s all that. Consider it I\u2019d say, and go easy on what you rely on. Nothing natural is shameful, but even Diogenes would take a look at some of this stuff, or at a crippling overreliance on any of it, and say \u201cThat ain\u2019t natural.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It offends the morals of some people, and not of others. The question is, why would it offend anyone's morals? No, that is not a rhetorical question. I want you to consider whether it should or whether it shouldn\u2019t. And why. To answer that question, you need to consider what is the purpose of morality. And where morality comes from. When you consider the issue, this is a question more about morality than about porn. Some people take their morality from what other people tell them about what a \u201cGod\" wants. Other people take their morality from what other people tell them is the law. I prefer to take my morality from the basis of benefiting society as a group and its members as individuals. I think whether my actions will cause damage to anyone or to society as a group. And I don't believe that most porn harms anyone. Some porn harms people. Child porn is the most obvious example. So \u2026 what you you think? ",
