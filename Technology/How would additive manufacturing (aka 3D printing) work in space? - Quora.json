            "answer_text": "Additive manufacturing in space or to be precise in micro-gravity has  many benefits, as for many industrial researches micro-gravity is  invaluable in solving many ground based problems. As of now a fully  fledged space based manufacturing facility is not readily achievable and may be a subject for science fiction.  However, some of the broad areas in which micro-gravity research finds \u2018real world\u2019 and some of the space based applications that are associated with them are: Materials Science, Fluid Science, Cold Atom Technology etc.  In  this respect, manufacturing in micro-gravity for  re-fabrication/repair of worn out high cost components in particular has many advantages.  One of the areas which has remained a nightmare for material scientists, in particular, is to predict when the  solidification process switches from columnar to equiaxed. The solidification phenomena is highly dependent on differences of temperature and density within the work-piece. These differences are dependent on convection currents, which upset the predictions that the  materials scientists try to make and so  it is extremely difficult to even develop a numerical model to predict such transformations with reasonable tolerances. On the other hand, convection is relatively absent in micro-gravity and, solidification in micro-gravity can offer the advantage of controlling convective currents  by  using rotating or alternating magnetic fields, so as to develop customized crystal structures.  Apart from this, knowledge of many thermo-physical properties of  materials such as, melting point, latent heat of fusion, coefficient of thermal expansion, viscosity and surface  tension at a range of temperatures near its melting point are very important. However, as many materials are highly reactive in their  molten state  the accurate measurements can only be made in micro-gravity with a   droplet of the material suspended in a magnetic field, which otherwise would  react with the crucible that containing it. Without this  data, fabrication of the materials is highly dependent on a lot of assumptions. With respect to space applications, heat transfer/circulation to prevent some sections of a  satellite from overheating and others from freezing solid is another area of research with possible spin-offs towards real world applications. Research in this area is important because as on earth heat transfer occurs predominantly due to convection and conduction. However, in a micro-gravity situation such as a space-craft, temperature and density differences does not help the buoyancy affects to creep in and cause the  surrounding air to flow in the absence of thermal convection. Apart from the above manufacturing processes which are potentially hazardous  can be performed in space with minimal risk to the environment of the Earth. However, the heavy capital costs of assembling the manufacturing facilities will be required to be economically profitable for self-sustenance. ",

            "answer_text": "There would have to be a force on the new particles to consolidate with the previously laid down particles.  If it were plastic, the molten plastic would have to be pressed into the laid down plastic.  If it were metal, molten drops would have to be shot at the laid down metal.  The common Earthbound practice of having a bed of particles melted by laser would not work well, since the particles would all start floating around. ",
