Gene Hammons's answer to What is the best accounting software for restaurants? There\u2019s more - but you\u2019ll have to look them up on my content page yourself. So essentially, in 2012, I started a consulting practice answering the specific question, \u2018What ERP is Best for My Business\u2019 and work full time getting the right consultants to the client organization to study, uncover, discover, probe, and learn every little thing about the business - and then and only then, we make some recommendations and invite the software vendors to \u2018prove\u2019 our recommendations. We end up working in some fashion (either long or short engagements, depending) with about 15 companies a year. We\u2019ve helped implement Netsuite twice and Intacct twice, but all the others have been different systems, Oracle, SAP, Syteline, Unit4, Microsoft Dynamics AX, NAV, GP, Sage X3, Epicor, Lawson, and so on, because those systems were best for those clients. So for some companies, we spend a couple of weeks and it\u2019s pretty obvious what is likely the fit. Some complex companies take longer. But it\u2019s true, there is no single best ERP software for all businesses, there is however, the best solution for a particular business. ",
