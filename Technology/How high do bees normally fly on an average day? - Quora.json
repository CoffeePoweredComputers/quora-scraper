            "answer_text": "Scientists have found that honeybees can and do fly at very high altitudes, over 25,000 feet. It is the temperature of the air, not the actual elevation, that is important. But in practice, most bees fly quite low to the ground and go up, if they do, only to the elevation that lets them fly across the highest object in their path, say a hill or a tree. The reasons are a) on or near the ground is where pollen and nectar are, and that\u2019s what they are looking for b) bees have evolved to be efficient foragers for nectar and pollen, and they don\u2019t waste their time and energy flying higher than they have to. So, typically, bees fly the most direct route to where they have been told by other bees is a good place to forage, and then they fly directly back to their hive. So, on average, they probably rarely fly more than 100 to 200 feet above ground level. ",

            "answer_text": "When a bee leaves the hive it flies horizontally at the height of the exit way. A few years ago I visited a lavender farm in France which had a hive with a timber \u201cchimney\u201d. The bees left at the top at roughly 2.5 metres up and flew away above the heads of visitors. This replicates natural hives is hollow trees. Two years ago I was chatting to a member of the British Beekeeping Association at a country house show. about the hive. He told me that the society recommends a high fence around beehives. This was in answer to my question for keeping hives on allotment plots - about 7 feet high should protect other plot holders. Of course, when they reach their destination or a suitable \u201cairport\u201d of flowers they descend and forage. Given that they are laden for the return flight I suppose they fly at a lower altitude. Perhaps research evidence will challenge this comment\u2026? ",
