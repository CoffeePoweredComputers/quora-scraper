            "answer_text": "The best you can do is one that looks like a ball point pen that has a plastic nib on the end. A little more comfortable to hold but still wont produce any finer line than the rubber kind. A normal touch screen simply doesn\u2019t have the touch resolution to produce a fine line. The screens that support the electronic type stylus, have a fine mesh metal screen behind the touch screen to detect the position of the stylus. ",
