            "answer_text": "The person who inspired me the most in my life was my father. Not because he was a great man or because he was the model of success because he was none of those things. It\u2019s because he was the one who cheered me on and believed in me when no one else did. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 People often find themselves living their whole life believing that something is true, only to later find out that what they believe in is completely wrong. Fact, when people say that they are inspired by someone, more often than not, what they meant to say is that they aspire to be like that person. Cause truth is, the person they aspire to be didn\u2019t inspire them. It is them who found inspiration in those people. Meaning that it is them who inspired themselves. Inspire - fill someone with the urge or ability to do or feel something, especially to do something creative Aspire - direct one's hopes or ambitions toward achieving something To inspire someone is to be the one who motivates them to act. To be the one who tells them that they can achieve what they want to achieve. Not someone who you don\u2019t even personally know. The thing about people is that most of them value their interpretations of something far more than the truth. Which cause them to attach these delusional meanings onto things when there is no meaning there to begin with. Take for example, movies and entertainment. People often assume things about them that aren\u2019t even true. Stating that it is portraying things like pollution and religion. They draw all these meanings into those things which the author themselves didn\u2019t even think about when they created it. They are so full of themselves that they think their interpretation of something is more accurate than the person who create it. That is why they act as though the thing they interpret is actually true when it is merely their interpretation. That is why other people don\u2019t get \u201cinspired\u201d the same way they do when indulging themselves in something. ",

            "answer_text": "My wife, my 5-yr young daughter and my 6-month young son inspires me. Everyday when I wake up beside them ( we all co-sleep in one bed) I praise and thank God/Universe/Divine that I have this beautiful, wonderful, healthy, witty, funny, enthusiastic family even though I\u2019m just an ordinary person. They inspire me to develop myself and become a \u201cbetter me\u201d than yesterday because I want them to do the same. They inspire me to take action on my plans to have a passive/extra income because I want to be with them most of the time. Their laughter and bickering and playfulness re-charge my energy after work everyday when I come home. They inspire me to share to other ordinary person that with a simple shift in mindset they can achieve their goals and realize their dreams if they\u2019ll just believe in themselves. Because that\u2019s how I got them; I used to be a bummer that scared to have a family because I knew they will only suffer due to my lack of skills, incompetence, no talent, no political/government/business connection whatsoever. I can\u2019t even hold a job for more than a year, that time. But when I discovered and practice the 3 LOA\u2019s ( Law Of Attraction, Law Of Attention and Law Of Action) my life started to turn around. Everything I ever dreamed of became reality. I\u2019m working on my dream job, I have time for my family, I drive a car, we live in a small and simple home-sweet-home, we\u2019re always perfectly healthy and happy most of the time. They inspire me to have faith and keep a grateful heart so the Abundant Universe will keep pouring it\u2019s blessings towards us. They inspire me to find ways no matter how many times we fail and be ridiculed because in the end, we know it\u2019s not the success that matters, it\u2019s what we become during the process. And when we succeed, we inspire others to take action and focus on their goals until they, too, succeeds! ",
