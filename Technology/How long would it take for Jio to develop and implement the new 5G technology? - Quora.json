            "answer_text": "Jio is not going to develop the end-to-end 5G technology. They may license or buy a few components in the 5G solution from other vendors. For example, recently they reported that they used Qualcomm\u2019s Virtual RAN platform to test the 5G New Radio (NR) functionality. They also have some 5G components through their Radisys acquisition. Jio would implement 5G in India when the government starts the spectrum auctions. The spectrum auction is expected to happen in 2021. So, Jio would launch 5G in 2022 or late 2021. ",
