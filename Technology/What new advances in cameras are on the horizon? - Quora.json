            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know for sure of course, but it seems very clear mirrorless cameras will be a major direction of development. I sure would love to see micro 4/3 cameras keep developing - the small size is great and I really like being able to use lenses from different vendors. My greatest interest in not in more mega pixels, but in improved sensors with greater dynamic range and a high speed electronic shutter - it would be great to get rid of noisy and slow shutters. ",
