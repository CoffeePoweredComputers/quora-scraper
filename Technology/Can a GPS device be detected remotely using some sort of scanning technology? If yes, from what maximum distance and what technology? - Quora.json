            "answer_text": "From a basic level, a GPS device is a radio RECEIVER. It should emit no signal, other than electromagnetic noise that all electronics emit. Now, modern \u201cGPS\u201d devices do more than GPS, they usually connect to the internet for mapping or traffic information, which means they must emit a signal to negotiate with the ISP. Or the device reports real time information on position, which again requires a signal. Those signals can be detected. ",
