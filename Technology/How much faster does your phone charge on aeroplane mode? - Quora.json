            "answer_text": "Certainly a bit faster since turning off all radio communications does mean less power is being used. Wifi and Bluetooth are fairly low power, but cellular radio can be much higher if you are a distance from the cell tower. The amount each model phone uses compared to its screen or processor will be different. Most battery saver modes or apps turn off some or all of the comms and just turn then on periodically so you don't miss messages. If you want it to charge even faster turn it off and attach the charger. Then the power consumption is almost 0 and all of the power from the attached power supply can be devoted to charging. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s just using less power while it\u2019s charging. Charging rate simply being (input power - operating power) = battery charge power. So in airplane mode your cell is using significantly less operating power, meaning more is going to the battery for charging. ",
