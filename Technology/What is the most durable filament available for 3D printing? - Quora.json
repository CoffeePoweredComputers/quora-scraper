            "answer_text": "ABS It\u2019s probably one of the most common of filaments. It\u2019s quite strong but the main issue is it\u2019s hard to print. You need a heated bed and it tends to warp on larger prints. But that said it is very strong and durable. It is great for prototyping. PLA PLA, is becoming more common because it is easier to print. But, strength wise it\u2019s lacking quite a bit, it\u2019s quite brittle and can warp at very low temperatures (like being left in the car for about 30 min). However, it is very easy to print and doesn\u2019t warp while printing and you don\u2019t need a heated bed. PETG It\u2019s becoming more popular in 3D printing and rightly so. PETG is used in a lot of common plastic objects and it\u2019s pretty strong. Furthermore you don\u2019t need a heated bed to print this. Although it is difficult to print you will get very very strong results. Nylon It\u2019s amazingly strong and it has some interesting properties restarting colour. Nylon is arguably the strongest on this list which can be printed on a regular printer. You will need an all metal hotend to print because it needs to be heated up to 240 degrees and a heated bed would help. Polycarbonate It\u2019s strong but hard to print. Polycarbonate is the strongest on this list but it\u2019s extremely hard to print. First it needs to printed at a high temperature, second it doesn\u2019t stick to anything and third it could absolutely destroy your nozzle. Filament list from weakest to strongest -PLA -ABS -PETG -Nylon -Polycarbonate From easiest to print to hardest -PLA -PETG -ABS -Nylon -Polycarbonate ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with ABS. (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene as it\u2019s known by in it\u2019s hometown) is the grandfather of home FDM filaments. Temperature: Print at 210-250\u00ba C with a heated bed at 80\u00ba C or more. Print Performance: Due to the nature of the plastic, ABS tends to be very easy to print with from a hot-end point of view \u2013 as in it\u2019ll extrude beautifully from most hot-ends without fear of jamming or clogging. Strength: ABS is a rather strong plastic if printed at sufficient temps to get a great layer bond.ABS has a decent amount of flex to it and it tends to bend rather than snap when put under pressure. __________________________________________________________________________________ PLA (Polylactic Acid if you\u2019re asking for it on the street) is the sweet smelling hippy cousin to ABS \u2013 IT BIODEGRADES AND SMELLS LIKE CANDY WHEN YOU PRINT! If that fact alone doesn\u2019t interest you, then read on. Temperature: Print at 180 \u2013 220\u00ba C and while you can print without a heated bed, I recommend one running at 60\u00ba C Print Performance: In almost the complete opposite to ABS, PLA users sometimes have difficulties with jamming in the hot-end (especially all-metal hot end users) due to the sticky and expanding nature of PLA as it melts. Strength: While you can still print incredibly strong objects with PLA, it tends to be a little more brittle than other plastics. Rather than bouncing when dropped or struck, some printed parts may just shatter or chip. __________________________________________________________________________________ Choosing the right filament brand is difficult with all the different manufacturers out there to pick from. Many filaments out there won't properly extrude and you end up with low quality prints. This usually happens with cheap China made filament, where quality control is lacking. The higher tolerances in diameter and roundness causes issues due to the inconsistent size and amount of material being extruded. If the filament is too thick in areas, the nozzle may jam. When the filament diameter is too thin, the gears in the extruder may lose grip, causing little to no filament to come out of the nozzle.  Another common issue to be aware of in cheaper filament is the presence of voids. If not careful, during the manufacturing process, tiny bubbles create these pockets of air within the filament. These cavities will reduce the quality of the print by leaving voids in the surface. Loud popping sounds when printing is a good indication of these air bubbles as well. This is caused by the rapid expansion of the air and moisture pushing out through the heated nozzle. Thanx for reading. For more Head over to: All About 3D Printer Filaments ",
