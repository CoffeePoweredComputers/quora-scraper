            "answer_text": "Sure, the atmosphere and water systems weren\u2019t that well understood, let alone the effects of stuff spewn into the air, dumped into rivers and creeks, or buried in the soil. So people did all sorts of what\u2019s now clearly very foolish and self-destructive stuff usually because it seemed convenient and cheap at the time. Dumping anything in the closest river was the worst polluter and made many rivers unnatural colors and unsafe to drink, many rivers are still in that condition particularly in China and India. The coal smokestacks that are the standard visual image for the industrial revolution (mostly because artists look for easy to find images rather than accurate ones, factories\u2019 big pipes dumping wastes into the river is more accurate and significant up into the 1970\u2019s) reflect how hot of fires the steam boilers, smelters, refineries, steel mills, etc. were. The hotter the fire the more completely it combusts/burns the fuel so the least smoke, just as wet wood puts out far more smoke than dry wood. So as fire sources became more efficiently designed and then filtered in many cases near the end, emissions shrank precipitously over and over. Now a forest fire spews far more toxic and otherwise regulated chemicals than a coal-fired factory does. That coal and wood were typically how buildings were heated during the industrial revolution is where much of the smoke (like London\u2019s \u201cPea Soup Fogs\u201d that were actually coal smoke trapped by the natural air inversion over London, tens of thousands of Londoners heated with coal with little or no chimneys to vent it more than a few feet above the house unlike a tall factory smokestack.) People were poisoning themselves all the time with the pollution of the era so it\u2019s fairly clear they didn\u2019t realize the causes. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Local air quality in say, London, may be better today than it was during Dickens time, but that\u2019s because petroleum products and such burn cleaner than wood or coal. We burn higher quality fuels than we did back then, the difference being that we burn a tremendous amount more than we did in the 1800s. The global population today is nearly 8 times as large as it was during the Napoleonic Wars. Half of all carbon emissions have been pumped into the atmosphere since Seinfeld was on air. ",

            "answer_text": "The first factories of industrial society followed the practices of pre-industrial society in polluting. There were complaints, and laws passed, in the early1600s in London, England, about pollution from both Tanning, and from Brick Making far before the industrial revolution was felt. Pollution per ton of end goods produced rapidly declined in even the first parts of the industrial revolution, because productivity increased so strongly. Later, as technology grew, pollution was lessened because the wealth from yet greater productivity could be applied to ameliorating pollution. ",
