            "answer_text": "It all depends on how exactly are you limiting yourself? Therefore you\u2019ll find your own answer on how to stop limiting yourself. But as a general life philosophy, borrow a leaf out of M. Scott Peck\u2019s book: The Road Less Traveled: Life is Hard. When you accept that. Live becomes easy.The reason is simple: Your expectations are really what limit you, not just your actions. Too high or too low expectations will either result in your frustration and anger, or cynicism and loss of faith. Try to rid yourself of all expectations, but keep only those that make yourself feel alive, loved and connected to yourself. On a more practical note: If you aim to achieve and grow, you can always set your expectation (goal) to be 15% higher than what you do now. If that proves too difficult, adjust it down by 5% until it\u2019s achievable. If it\u2019s too easy, adjust it up. Obviously you can\u2019t always calculate the maths to be perfect, you may need to use your intuition with these percentages as a general guide as life will always involve variability. That said, accept your weaknesses, accept your challenges, start where you are with your readjusted expectations, be humble in beginning your path with the work you do, put your head down only to look up at checkpoints and intersections and my friend, when you do look up you\u2019ll be surprised how far you\u2019ve come.

            "answer_text": "thats the question isn't it? a hell of a lot of trees have died, ink applied to it and words spoken trying figure out how to motivate folks. What has been universally accepted is this. Think of an idea of where you want to be. Write it down. Think of steps to get you there. the more detailed, researched and numerous(and simple) the better. Write it down. Refer to this list often, follow the steps. modify the steps as you grow, learn and complete steps. revisit your idea from time to time, it could be you have moved beyond it, achieved it, or gotten off track. Immerse yourself in the culture, literature and ideas of your goal. this will help you with both the idea, and the steps toward it. Procrastination is a problem, your body and your mind want to comfortable and lazy, this is a problem. I find that when my alarm rings an 5 AM I have a tendency to hit the snooze button 3 or 4 times. this ruins any chance I have of attaining my goals for the day. my mornings are mine, my work has me till evening and evenings are for honey dos and family. So by sleeping in an ruin my steps. to combat this when my alarm rings I count backwards from three. 3..2..1. then I move. the race is on. it helps. Good luck and fair seas. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a funny part of the query. Suppose you don\u2019t know driving a car and think it to be difficult and are scared for driving for odd reason which could have bearing of some image in mind. A time comes when driving is necessary to be independent to go to work and you take a bold step in learning which of course is not difficult but the fear in mind still exists. You starts driving smaller distance daily and gradually gain the confidence. You no more see the limitation. Achieving beyond limitation exists till one has not achieved and once stepped in the unimaginable thing would appear very simple. However how does this happen? I have some personal experience and later on has been my endeavor in bringing the art in my junior colleagues which is a self- motivating process. More than 30 years ago I was working in another organization and was given responsibility to get electro-dialysis technology form a govt research institute in Gujarat. The technology had many parts like making ion exchange membrane, making a stack which was assembly of numbers of membrane and then establishing a process to desalinate brackish water. I had a small team and we worked with a deep sense of interest. Each step was involving complication in handling a process and / or dealing with unfriendly chemicals. Irony was that I didn\u2019t get enough support from staff except freedom to work and were able to bring a new technology in the organization. Luck as it could be water mission for drinking water by Sam Pitroda in Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s era and the organization being offered a significant order made the technology bring in its manifestation. The people by whom I got the technology in a very small lab scale got excited as it was beyond their knowledge of tackling certain steps not easy in manufacturing scale and I did invite one of them to visit and see himself and feel happy for the hard work they have researched. I switched the organization where I was to create research and development from nonexistence entity then. I had a view that the task suited more for a scientist in PhD or M. Tech but the starting dream was on electro chemical process which I had some idea. Within one and half year we made a patent that passed through in one stroke because it was having some unique dimensions which few global organizations working on the product were not aware and made them think in the technology. These things I see as achievements which were not known or hidden till they were tapped and brought out and of course there was a team involved with me working with same spirit. The idea of achieving beyond limitation then was my mantra in grooming young scientist and engineers and have succeeded to a larger extent. My aim was to keep motivating, giving a freedom but guiding at each step with one important point to get extracted by every individual more than s/he thinks. My job was also to know their education and experience and interest which needs to be explored so that s/he enjoys in the work. It amounted in giving individual attention according to their need and also collective discussion to enjoy them as team. The process was also in bringing transparency with each and has been a huge task which cultivated a culture with difference. Each individual who have worked more than 5 years is proud to know his/her potential much more than they were aware of building their confidence. It is laborious process and needs the mind keep away from unwanted thoughts at least during work. Knowing on self-potential and being confidence and the nature they work has relation with science or technology along with art in working team where they need to keep motivate their subordinate makes a continuous process. Thus I feel proud about it but the individual who have to maintain and feel satisfied have to keep nurturing and adding useful traits without stagnating their thinking is my advice to them and all who read.

Therefore, I choose to think of a human individual as a complex function, the domain of which is not clearly defined. Setting a limit when the domain is unknown might account for an error. Therefore, you never know unless you try. And even if you fail, it is still unclear whether what was wrong was the domain or the problem was in the implementation of the function. So setting limits for yourself is rather pointless. ",

Look inside yourself and see your own behaviors, thinking patterns, self talk, self doubt.  These are the only limitations present, all within yourself.
