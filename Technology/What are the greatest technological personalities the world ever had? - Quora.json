            "answer_text": "As previously mentioned, there are several categories we could choose from within \"technology\". Is this the inventor with the big idea or the one implementing the great idea for use in the world? An interesting selection that fits both descriptions is the late Steve Jobs.  Primary or co-inventor of more than 240 patents, he brought the world the first personal computer, the iPod, the USB mouse, the power adapter, and the iPad, to name a few. A quick scan results in a boggled mind considering the impact that these inventions had. All have been relentlessly built upon and replicated. All have forever changed the way we interact with each other. To add to this, Steve Jobs was a dynamic personality. One my favorite quotes is, \"Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.\" Later in life when he returned to his struggling company, Apple, he vigorously brought it out of its slump, gave it direction, and made Apple a household name. In a day and age when we are seeing, by far, the largest spike in technological development that human history has ever seen it is fitting to recognize a man who was at the forefront of that explosion.
