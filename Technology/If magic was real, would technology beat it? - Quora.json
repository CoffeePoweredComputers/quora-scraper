But a random D+D wizard of about 15th level and above could solo the modern world easily. The Culture, on the other hand, would likely not have too many problems wiht that wizard (Um. Probably. D+D wizards are broken). What can your magic do? What can your tech do? Without those questions, it really isn\u2019t answerable. The same applies if we are hypothetically talking about the \u2018real\u2019 world. (I\u2019m actually running a long-term RP game based on very much this principle - a small group of people get magical powers in 2018 on New Years Day, and become ageless alongside it. A lot of the point of the game was how these near immortal characters change and are changed by humanity. Kind of Midnight\u2019s Children, but Shounen and not as well told. : P ) ",
