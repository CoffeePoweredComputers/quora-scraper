One of the main themes in Interstellar is that characters can age at different speeds depending on where they are in the universe. When McConaughey (Cooper) and Hathaway (Brand) make their ill-fated trip to Miller\u2019s planet they age by only a few hours, but return to find shipmate Romilly, is 26 years older.Could that be true? Well yes. In 1912 Einstein predicted that gravity is a product of huge bodies, like Earth, bending space-time. The typical illustration is a heavy ball placed on a rubber sheet. The sheet bends to the weight of the ball and stretches time out.On Earth the effect is minimal, adding just a few microseconds a day to the time of space. Although it does mean that time is moving ever so slightly more quickly in a penthouse compared to a basement. Consequently GPS satellites orbiting the Earth need to be adjusted to take into account that they are moving through time slightly more quickly \u2013 40 microseconds a day - than a person with a Sat Nav on earth.Compared with other bodies in the universe, Earth is quite small and so the time shift is minimal.However bodies with more mass have a bigger impact on time. A neutron star for example is so dense that it slows time by a few hours. At the surface of a black hole time is slowed to a halt.What is even more extraordinary is that space is bending into a different dimension, somewhere that is not part of universe \u2013 known to astrophysicists as \u2018the bulk.\u2019Miller\u2019s planet is as close to the huge black hole Gargantua as it can be without getting sucked in. The black hole is estimated to have a mass of 100 million Suns, and spinning at near to its maximum speed. While unlikely to happen in nature, the effect would mean that anyone on that planet would age just one hour while those outside of the black hole\u2019s pull, like Romilly, would age seven years. ",
