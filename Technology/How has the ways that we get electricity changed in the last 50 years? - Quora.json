            "answer_text": "50 years ago coal and oil were the main sources among fossil fuels, while natural gas was less important. Since the middle of the 1970s oil power plants declined while natural gas became more important. Nuclear energy grew fast in the 60s to 80s, but then the growth rate stagnated. As for renewable energy, only hydro was widespread. There were a few biowaste power plants run by sawmills or sugar mills and municipial waste power plants. Large scale wind farms emerged in the 1980s and solar energy in the 1990s. https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources  ",
