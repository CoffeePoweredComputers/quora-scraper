(Coming to the point;) Micromax was incorporated as Micromax Informatics Ltd. on 29 March 2000. It started selling mobile telephones in 2008, focusing on low pricing to compete with international brands. Micromax's co-founder Rahul Sharma once saw a public call office being powered by a truck battery because of frequent power cuts in its locale. It prompted him to launch a feature telephone with an extended battery life. Micromax launched X1i, its first telephone with a month-long battery back-up. In 2014, Micromax's sales exceeded those of Samsung to become the mobile telephone manufacturer shipping the most telephones in one quarter in India. On 24 January 2014, Micromax became the first Indian mobile company to start sales in Russia. As on 10 April 2016, Micromax announced a strategic partnership with digital payments company TranServ and global payments technology major Visa to offer the next generation of payments solutions in India.
