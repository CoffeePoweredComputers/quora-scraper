            "answer_text": "It really depends on your use case. If you're the kind of person who values mobility then yes, the Echo Input Portable Edition would be worth it. However, you still would need to be connected to WiFi, so you're still restricted to being within Wifi range which kinda beats the purpose. I suppose you could connect the device to a hotspot for Internet access when travelling, in which case all you have is a glorified voice controlled music player. The same functionality can be obtained by using the Prime Music app on the phone. Using this device on the move just does not add on any new functionality. Frankly speaking I bought echo dots for all rooms in my house when they were on sale. This is a much better way to implement alexa in the home rather than buying the Echo Input Portable Edition. I wouldn't buy it because I don't see the advantage over the standard echo dot. ",
