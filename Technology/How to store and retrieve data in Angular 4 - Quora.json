There are other modules out there, but this is going to support future versions of Angular as per the modules documentation. Import the modules class into the app.module.ts file and your component where you want to access the ngx-webstorage. You can access the stored variables or data along the different components throughout the application. The documentation is good enough to help you out. If you want to \u2026below is the sample code to understand it's simplicity.

            "answer_text": "There are many libraries available for storing and retrieving data as mentioned in other answers. I would suggest it depends on your use case, you can approach for native Web Storage API or Client-Side Storage - HTML5 Rocks. However, if it\u2019s more of UI state management in your app then I recommend introducing NgRx in the app for storing and retrieving the state of the app, otherwise native storge window.localStorage or Window.sessionStorage or IndexedDB API would also be okay to use.
