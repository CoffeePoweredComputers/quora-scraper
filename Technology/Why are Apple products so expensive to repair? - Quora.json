            "answer_text": "Everything with Apple involves a mark-up, including the cost of repairs. Where it chooses to be, Apple is the market leader, with all its rivals scrambling to make lower-priced copies of its best products. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Apple is neither the first nor the best in everything, but its many victories, and its mythology, give it a cult-like following in the world of consumer electronics. Steve Jobs knew you don\u2019t sell the steak. You sell the sizzle. By combining great products with great design, Apple gets people to pay more. It constantly innovates because it knows its rivals are going to copy the look and feel - and sell it for less. But even when you buy an Apple clone, you know you\u2019re getting less. Even where you\u2019re not, you\u2019re getting steak, not sizzle. So, Apple has no incentive to fix its products on the cheap. It doesn\u2019t want to hire a larger staff, to go into the repair business, with lower margins. After all, who makes the original product? What are the prevailing labor costs in China? Who does repairs? What are its labor costs in America? No business makes greater profit by expanding into a business that provides less profit. And if Apple fixes Apple, what does that do to demand for Apple\u2019s next product line? The longer you extend the service cycle of a used Apple product, the more you cannibalize sales for Apple\u2019s latest-and-greatest. So, Apple charges a premium - because it can, and (from its own point of view) maybe it should. I bought a $2,700 16\u2033 MacBook Pro. Ten months into my warranty, my granddaughter dumped water onto the keyboard. The one-year warranty doesn\u2019t cover liquid damage. Apple charged me $761.41 to fix it. A week after I sent it in (on their dime), they suspended repairs, to tell me it would be $1,600 (with tax). I was flabbergasted. I thought to myself, \u201cWhat\u2019s their cure for water damage? Another laptop?\u201d I felt screwed. Repairs can get expensive but $1,600 isn\u2019t the cost of a repair. I could buy a pretty nice laptop - brand new - for less than the cost of repairing a laptop whose one-year warranty would expire in two months, and whose repair warranty would expire one month after that. So, I declined the repair and they returned the laptop (on their dime). But then I got to thinking, \u201cIs this better? I paid $2,700 for what is now a boat anchor. That\u2019s a bigger loss than having to pay Apple.\u201d So, I looked for someone local who could help me. I found two amazing guys at a store five miles from my house. They fixed my laptop and got it back to me the next day. Total charge? $450. (Computer Xpress, Lakeland, you rock!) But in talking with these guys, it became apparent that Apple\u2019s $100 labor costs, on a $1,500 repair (The other $100 was for taxes), were more than likely the costs of sending me an entirely new laptop. And if not, I would have gotten back a laptop with brand new innards - extending my laptop\u2019s obsolence by about a year. I have nothing but the highest respect for Apple, which has played the game with gusto, and whose products (and reputation) are envied throughout the industry. I went with the $450 deal because it made more sense to my budget and needs. Right now, I have other needs for that $1,150. And as long as Apple takes advantage of its market position, there will always be a need for the two guys who helped me out. That\u2019s the price of being so big. These guys had their own production-cost advantage, enabling them to do for $450 what Apple wouldn\u2019t do for less than $1,600 (taxes included). I don\u2019t think either choice is the wrong choice. I think you just have to do what works for you - which also includes buying Apple\u2019s market-leader instant-cool product line or buying something that gets the job done for less. ",

            "answer_text": "apple is expensive to make or repair. The cost of making an apple product include office renting, hiring engineer( hundred of them), hiring managers, hiring CEO, hiring off staff, hiring accountant (hundred of them), hiring cleaning staff( hundred of them), hiring lawyers for checking copy right and consultancy. And there are hundred of other cost involved. And to make the product, apple needs huge factory, labors and material and machines. Those are huge cost. They need to sell hundred thousand of product to break even. They need to sell million more to make profit. So those are the reason they need to mark up (pricing their product high) in order to make profit. ",
