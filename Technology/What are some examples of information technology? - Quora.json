            "answer_text": "Information Technology is a very vast and fickle subject, as the potential of Information Technology is always something professionals and even not so professional individuals tend to think about. I'd say two examples of Information Technology or an \u201cinformation system\u201d Any organization with their own networking infrastructure. This would typically include a few to a lot of workstations with certain permissions being set for each user. Some may have access to an FTP server, a DNS Server, a mail server such as Microsoft Exchange, et cetera. You'll probably also see some typical Networking devices such as Switches and Routers for intelligent packet transfer and access to the internet. The amount of configurations for a network seems to know no bounds.A website that someone would go to in order to complete a task or learn a new skill. This is a rather basic example but still indeed an information system. Websites generally have certificates they use to verify and update their security. SSL/TLS in particular is a very common protocol used to provide a layer of security for website domains.The idea behind an information system is that the combination of people and technology are working cohesively to accomplish a task/get something done. The definition may be fairly simple but actually working as a professional in the industry is no easy task, and it comes with being open to learning new ideas and concepts, as well as keeping up to date with the latest technologies, how they are used, the security flaws of said technologies, and how these technologies are able to communicate from start to finish. It's a lot to learn! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the question said some examples of information technology. 1. Telephone and radio equipment and even switches used for voice communications 2. Basically, any traditional computer application program that can accept,process and store data is an example of IT. Summarily, one can define Information Technology as any technology through which information is received or transmitted. So, if you can think of any such technology based on this definition, then you already have the examples. ",
