            "answer_text": "#1 Solar Roads If they can work through some legitimate issues, solar roads could have a massive impact on society as we know it.  Companies like http://www.solarroadways.com have been working on the concept for awhile now. The concept is roadways are essentially massive solar panels and conduit. No more running wires underground or above ground. Imagine possibilities like: Plug into the road Phone died? Plug it into the road. Need power for\u2026 anything? Plug it into the nearest road. Mesh Network of Electricity Like a mesh wifi network at home, a road would act as \u201cbackbone\u201d to carry electricity across large distances. Wireless electricity (yes, another innovation in R&D) access points could transmit electricity from primary roads to endpoints. Heck, this could be used to lay new internet infrastructure too. Even with wifi, air still causes slowdowns in network traffic. Now real traffic could be used to help with that. Self-powered cars So we\u2019ve seen how you can lay a phone on a pad to charge it. Imagine an electric car that can charge itself just by touching the road. Think of the implications this would have on the oil and gas business (which is increasingly turning into \u201cenergy\u201d companies). Imagine tax dollars being used for \u201croad and fuel\u201d infrastructure. I wouldn\u2019t mind paying taxes as much if I didn\u2019t have to pay for gas. Better roadways A self powered road with heaters could prevent icing in colder climates. These roads can have LED lights in them. Imagine not having painted lines fade away. It\u2019d also be easier to setup detours, identify problems for drivers before you get there (like turning the road red as a warning), etc. Is an emergency vehicle coming through? Turn the road to an emergency color and print instructions right on the road. In a driverless society, roads would really act more like a track, and you\u2019d always know where you are. Oh, and \u201cupgrading\u201d the road could be as simple as a software update. When a road is damaged, it would be known immediately if a monitor detects a problem. Better parking lots Need to reconfigure your spaces? Just reset the layout instead of repainting lines. Off Grid Living Even if there aren\u2019t roads, an off-grid house with a solar driveway could potentially provide sufficient power for a home. I wouldn\u2019t mind not paying an electric bill. There\u2019s more to off-grid living than just power, but it\u2019s a major hurdle that could potentially be bypassed. This could, conceivably, make more remote/affordable land more practical for development. This could have positive implications on creating sustainable and affordable housing that doesn\u2019t suck. #2 Glass Advancements in glass could have a major impact as well. Those solar roadways? Made possible by a stronger glass. Beyond that, Corning put out a video with a vision for the future with glass. It does a better job of explaining than I could.  \u2014 There are lots of problems with these technologies, but human kind tends to be pretty resilient and resourceful. Maybe we\u2019ll see some of these someday in the near-ish future. If so, they\u2019ll change life pretty substantially. ",

            "answer_text": "Transportation as a service via self driving cars. It means most people (excepting hobby-racers and tradesmen) won\u2019t need to own cars the way they do now. The obvious benefits for most people: no insurance, no car payments, no driving headache, able to use drive time for other things. The obvious benefits are going to be secondary to the mostly invisible secondary benefits of urban land reuse. With this change we\u2019ll need only 10\u201320% of the cars we currently have on the road. This means that across the US hundreds of millions of parking spaces will free up. Half of many urban areas is parking. Don\u2019t believe me? go to google maps and look at a business park or a shopping mall\u2026check out the size of the building compared to the size of the parking. Three things have become more expensive over the past 40 years: housing, medical care, and education. This will help solve the first, and if we\u2019re smart we can solve some of the third with this.
