            "answer_text": "Why every other year? Here\u2019s the thing: if you are buying a phone for show or to look cool, you are burning your money. Sure, it\u2019s always nice to have a high-end phone, and I am not saying to not buy one if you have the money. But the benefits you can expect from upgrading from say, the iPhone XR to the iPhone 12 are, in my opinion, not enough to warrant the upgrade. If, however, you were upgrading from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 12, that actually might be worth it. Basically, as long as your phone works for everything you need it to do reasonably well, your only justification for an upgrade is not that you need it, you just want it. By the way, you should never ask a salesman why you should upgrade. They get paid to sell you stuff, which means you probably will end up buying it anyway. Ask yourself whether you need to upgrade, not by asking what new features this phone has, but by asking yourself what your current phone lacks. Phone manufacturers generally think that you will keep your phone for two years though, which is in line with your suggested \u201cevery other year\u201d strategy. Going back to the previous example, an upgrade from the XR to the 11 will be far less rewarding than from the XR to the 12, even if neither are actually worth it. Phone manufacturers will probably hate me for this . . . ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I think a phone should be good for at least 4 years. If they phone is \u201cdying\u201d due to the battery \u2014 which should normally be the first thing to die \u2014 then replace the battery AT LEAST ONCE before you replace the phone. That\u2019s MY norm. It is not like anything meaningful has really changed since my iPhone 5S. I am on an iPhone 8 now, and I would rather not \u201cupgrade\u201d from fingerprint to face id. But hey, upgrade every year if you like. There are people out there that need less expensive refurbished phones. Do your part to help make them available by paying full price for a phone as often as possible. ",
