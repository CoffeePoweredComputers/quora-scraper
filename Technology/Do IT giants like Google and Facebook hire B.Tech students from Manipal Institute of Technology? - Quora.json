            "answer_text": "I was asked to answer this question some time back but I feel in the right zone today to write this one. If your question was intended for campus placements then no Google and Facebook doesn\u2019t come to our campus, in fact I guess Google doesn\u2019t go to any Indian engineering college for hiring now but do graduates from MIT Manipal end up in IT giants like Google and Facebook? Hell yeah, there are already few alumni graduated from our college working in these companies. IT giants like Google, Facebook don\u2019t discriminate on the basis of your college for hiring, they have a mark set up for their employees, if you match or cross their mark, you will surely be hired by them.  I received the above mail from Google almost an year back, one of the best mail I ever got. In my telephonic round they asked a question based on trie, I wasn\u2019t acquainted of tries back then and couldn\u2019t clear the round but the Interview was one hell of an experience and motivated me to code more. Right now I have offer from Honeywell and currently interning at GeeksforGeeks as a technical content writer but Google dreams are still on, I still code everyday and improve daily. The point of all this being that your alma matter plays only a small amount of role if you dream of IT giants like Google and Facebook, if you have good knowledge of data structures and algorithms and are passionate about computer science in general then don\u2019t bother about the college, MIT Manipal has a good reputation in general amongst IT companies and you will be given equal opportunity and consideration provided you are good enough for them. There are lot of openings which keep popping up in these companies, feel free to apply to these positions through portals like Google careers, etc., participate in competitions like Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, ICPC, etc., contribute to various open source projects through GSOC, etc. and rest sky is the limit. Talking of MIT Manipal as a college it\u2019s an amazing college where you would never fall short of opportunities, this place is full of GSOCers, ICPC qualifiers and other tech savy enthusiasts who do a brilliant job in their respective fields and create a name for themselves in the tech world. To be more precise you could end up in companies like Google and Facebook through your graduation from MIT Manipal by applying off campus and you would find decent resources here to accomplish your goal, it\u2019s to you how you use them and optimize your time. In the end I would like to conclude by saying that \u201cKeep your head straight, do your work and the rest will follow\u201d. ",
