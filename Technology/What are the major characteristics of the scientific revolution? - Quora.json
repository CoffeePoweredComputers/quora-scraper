            "answer_text": "The modern \u201cscientific revolution\u201d can be said to have properly begun with Sir Francis Bacon\u2019s publication of his Novum Organum in 1620 in which he held that the only thing which qualified as scientific fact was the result of the observation of nature\u2014 not any kind of philosophical introspection \u00e0 la Aristotle and Plato. He early promoted the simple undirected observation of nature, but it was quickly realized that such undirected observation would only too rarely yield observations of anything of particular interest to a scientist, so the use of the experimental method and (selectively) directed observation was added. Tycho Brahe can be said to have introduced the modern system of making carefully documented (and repeated) selected observations. (In his De nova stella (On the New Star) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm. His precise measurements indicated that \"new stars\" (stellae novae, now known as supernovae), in particular that of 1572, lacked the parallax expected of sublunar phenomena and were therefore not tailless comets in the atmosphere as previously believed but were above the atmosphere and beyond the Moon. ibid) Galileo Galilei can be said to have introduced the modern carefully controlled and documented experimental design. Both were immeasurably aided by the introduction of the printing press in the 15th century and the (now) relatively easy and inexpensive publication of their results. Finally, in 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he eschewed the \u201cmaking of theories\u201d based on mere rationalization (i.e., which could not be supported by the description of a mechanism to show how the theory worked). He espoused the use of mathematical formulas which could describe general observations of nature, which he called \u201claws.\u201d In particular, Aristotle\u2019s fourth cause, Teleology, was altogether eliminated from any acceptable scientific explanation.
