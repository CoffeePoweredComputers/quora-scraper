            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t read all the answers in here yet, but the ones I have are quite interesting. What\u2019s most obvious to me about education today is that we are still operating on an Industrial Era model meant more to produce factory workers than free thinking members of an advanced society. Kids are measured against averages and moulded into workers in one of a handful of fields, stratified by income brackets. This model produces bored and boring people. I think children should get much more choice and autonomy in their studies from an early age. Most curriculums now are so focused on being \u201cbalanced\u201d that students have to sit through years of dreadfully boring material. This kills the will to learn in many bright people. Curriculums of the future should be designed to help students identify what sparks their curiosity and go as deep as possible in the areas of life that fascinate them. Academia is designed to funnel people into the workforce. Personally, I believe the future of work is entrepreneurship. Every year, millions more are quitting their 9-to-5 jobs to start businesses. I don\u2019t see that trend slowing any time soon. Education of the future should be focused on getting students ready for the world of the future. We are an evolving species with changing needs. Here are 9 suggestions off the top of my head for making the education of the future better than the education of the present: Education should go \u201cminimalist\u201d on traditional subjects: we spend over a decade building a foundation of knowledge in subjects that don\u2019t have much practical use in our life (thanks, Trigonometry). That time should be given back to students and filled with more relevant material.Coding, web development and programming should be prioritized: these subjects should replace much of the traditional academic foundation. It\u2019s the most important area of human knowledge right now, as these areas are powering nearly everything else.Foreign language is a must (especially for lazy Americans): the world talks to itself now. If you can\u2019t speak more than one language, do you even human?Entrepreneurship and business focus first: students should be taught to understand how business works, not just how to work for one. This gives them the tools to be self sufficient.Personal finance: education of the future must teach students how money actually works, and how to make it work for you.Emotional management and other \u201clife skills\u201d: lots of kids probably need therapy they aren\u2019t getting. That should be part of school.Human body basics, nutritional guidance: the \u201csex talk\u201d has to happen earlier and we have to stop being so prude. It\u2019s not serving the students, who often are misinformed about their own bodies. And teach them to stop eating trash.Meditation and brain training: students should begin meditating at 5 years old. No exceptions.Teach jiu jitsu in school: it\u2019s a natural confidence booster.Any other suggestions I should add to this list? If you like my ideas here, you should check out my work on YouTube. Hope this helps! D ",

            "answer_text": "All the answers already here are fascinating. However they all appear to assume that a highly motivated and self-driven student is the only kind we have in the classroom. Such a student benefits from auto-didactic methods disproportionately more than a peer who isn't so driven. Indeed if all students were so motivated to learn, then the creation of MITx and similar alternatives (with credentialing attached) should put all schools/ universities out of business, to be a bit hyperbolic.  Also some current methods of grading - esp relative grading - make the assessment process competitive rather than collaborative, which means peer learning is limited, sometimes at the behest of the students.  The reality is that: Students have variable levels of motivation, cognition and learning methods. They may or may not understand the sequentiality of learning certain modules i.e. prior art in a field. This applies to some fields more than others.They may not understand some content. They may not have the time or dedication to complete assigned readings. They will always have questions and if not, can be made to question their tightly-held beliefs when in a setting that makes them think. I am unconvinced this reality will change very much.  So the future we are discussing is likely about using the existing tools of motivation, facilitation and enabling along with new tools of technology and emergent social contexts, to address the same problems of variable motivation, cognition, and learning styles, while ensuring the brightest students don't get bored and the slowest learners don't get left behind. The future of education in my view should really be - in some classes, is - the present: Multi-disciplinary teachers (by any other name if you prefer) will be anchoring, enabling, catalysing discussion, creating activity, creating openings for discussion which advances the learning agenda - basically anything but simplex mode lecturing Meatspace will continue to play a role because virtual - apart from Second Life perhaps - is not yet fully able to replicate real-time and emotion and articulation Technology will aid and supplement learning, and broaden access but not be the only way to learn (e.g. MITx credentialing will need many checks to ensure it is not being gamed by a learner)(Clearly my views are affected by being from a developing country, but also by having experienced several education systems within the country and outside the country in three continents.)

            "answer_text": "How will future of the school look like?  In the future, I believe, students will spend less time in the classrooms reading the information in their books. Everything will be different. For example, they will study biology in close connection with nature, in woods and fields. You will have the possibility to see live each animal or plant species and at the same time, you will listen to the theoretical material about them. Foreign languages will be studied in countries where people speak these languages. Students under the guidance of their teacher will visit England, for example, and during six months communicating with the British, they will learn English faster and easier. If we imagine that super high-speed transport is already created, so during even one lesson we could visit a couple of continents. Golden suggestions: Develop independence and aspiration to work.Define what can and what cannot be discussed.Develop curiosity and interest in studying.Cultivate culture.Encourage questions.Encourage personal features.Develop critical thought.Create conditions for collective and personal work.Be attentive to a child's life and studying.Suggest the child possible variants of the future.Some differences between modern and future school  Computers: Of course, every school will be computerized and in a very short period of time. But only senior students will have computer classes because if children from the very beginning use computers only, they will not learn how to write. Grades: The evaluation system will be more extended. Perhaps, there will be a 100-point grade system, because the more grades exist, the easier it is for students to study, for teachers to teach and for parents to follow their children success. Plus, computers and the Internet will replace paper pamphlets. Interior: Today schools become more and more comfortable and well-equipped. So likely in the nearest future the saying\"school is my second house\" will be completely acceptable. There will be bright wallpapers instead of grey walls, soft and comfortable couches and armchairs everywhere. So let's just hope that in the future children will be calmer and stop destroying everything around them. Teachers and students: People without suitable qualification will never teach at school. All the teachers will pass a very detailed interview. What about students: as they were always dissimilar, they will stay different. Someone will study better, others will study not that well, someone will take part in sports competitions, others in scientific conferences and so on. Entertainment: Already now many schools organize collective outings, trips, walking tours, etc. In such a way the education quality will get better as well. Schools will also have different interest clubs and workshops, where children will have the possibility to grow and master their natural talents and skills.

            "answer_text": "My kids have had an unusual upbringing. So they could end up becoming serial murderers!  The two elder ones, 12 and 14 (Maryam Qureshi) finished their school exams last year, and have since been meeting friends, playing sport, learning languages, reading and coding. I feel it is a tragedy that we force our kids to spend their teens learning Circle Theorem, Latin or Shakespeare - unless they need it or actually want to study it. Now, sure, in today's society kids must go through this grind to get good jobs. I get that. But is a world with our kids studying stuff they actually use and enjoy possible? Yes, and I reckon that within half a century society will look back on today and say we got things completely wrong. Our education system is geared towards academia, but today less than 1% of us end up as academics. And academic theoretical study is, for most kids, dull. My kids are starting a business - they're coding an HR bot for Slack - Slack is essentially a Skype for businesses - so businesses will be able to do performance reviews via their bot. They're learning tons, yet applying it and enjoying it. In a few decades I believe an average education will be more like this - we will realise learning is more engaging, effective and useful, if it's applied. ",

Students aren\u2019t being prepared for the \u201creal world\u201d and no one is taking responsibility. There\u2019 s a huge blame game going on. We\u2019re losing teachers at higher rates than ever before and there\u2019s a lack of community and communication. It looks like the future of education is in dire need of help to keep it. But, since I\u2019m a teacher and grew up in the public school system, I believe we can change that. I believe we can work together to show our children we care about them. We need to reinforce the community aspect that is central to our schools. We need to make schools a safe place for our students again and our teachers. We need to hold our students just as accountable as our we do our teachers. The entire school system needs to be supported. But the support can\u2019t be from inside, it must be from the communities around the school system or it\u2019s not going to work. ",

What we have now are classrooms and the traditional way of teaching where teachers are the information givers and students receive the information. They read their prescribed textbooks and take notes from the board. This will change in a huge way. People now have access to all kinds of information - they can learn anything they want be it physics, chemistry or psychology from the internet at their own pace. The teacher does not have to be the source of knowledge. The role of the teacher will change. I hope the following changes occur: Classrooms as we know it will not exist, there will not be \u2018traditional lectures\u2019 instead more collaboration with peers will be encouraged with teachers as facilitators and not knowledge giversWith the role of AI increasing \u2014 more focus will be given to improving the creativity and innovation of studentsThere will be no or little memorization, the focus will be on applying the knowledge not replicating itTests will not test your memory - in fact, I believe tests should be abolished it should all be project-based learning with an emphasis on problem-solvingStudents will be taught to learn and cope with disruptions",

Some may also choose pure science to take up career in teaching for NEET and JEE aspirants.Students will get themselves enrolled to Techno schools which will give JEE coaching and NEET coaching right from Pre nurseryThere will be No value left for for language teachers and other cultural activities. Also formal education will become mere history.Kids will have no basic manners and no life skills as they would be externally tortured and programmed only to get a good rank in their class every week .Children will stop having a childhood and every person would be running in the rat race, with no guarantee of winning.The society will be divided into children who have studied in top schools and those who have studied in normal schools.LKG students will start learning syllabus related to JEE and NEET and will be taught shading OMR sheets before they even learn alphabets and numbers.The urge to excel in every little thing will be increased to such an extent that children will have to face double the pressure and competition than they can tolerate,at their ageI think there is a serious need to transform the present education system or else everyone would go crazy and no normal person will be left .

As he searched he finally came to a building that he recognized. It was a building full of rooms with children in desks and a teacher at the front of the class writing on a chalkboard. At last he celebrated, something familiar, it was a school similar to what he remembered in 1800\u2019s.

Anything that eliminates the possibility for discursive as well as non-discursive methods of communication is inherently inferior. (Keller, Jan 18, 2012, UVU). I have a recording if anyone cares to listen. But, I do think it's critical -- unless we had some sort of holodeck -- that we continue to use people with people in the same place and time as the primary method for education. ",

Also measuring and monitoring the results is easy, but even it would be different for philosophy, I like the idea of watching the lectures at home and really use the teacher help to better understand hard concepts and do exercices in class.

Digital tools can play magical role in improving education. Digital resources and modern communication will change format of education. Digital resources are huge, it is very easy to locate and connect them to educate or convey the message, the basic idea of education.
