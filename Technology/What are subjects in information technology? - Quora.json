            "answer_text": "To give you the background \u2013 There are several main Computer majors and their associated career categories and you need to know these just to get the lay of the land. These degree titles are often found in Associates, Bachelors and Master\u2019s degree programs. Generally most IT employers are looking for a 4 year Bachelor\u2019s degree in an IT related major as a minimum requirement.   Now some of the titles colleges use may consist of different course curriculums. As an example one school may have more programming classes in the same major while another school has fewer.  Schools may call their general IT program Computer Information Technology, Computer Information Systems or Computer Information Science. To really tell what the major is about you should look at the courses that a particular school offers in that major. Here are the majors and some associated jobs:   Computer Science (CS) - Computer Science is one of the premier technical degrees and usually has a Programming emphasis - people with this major usually are developing application software, web development, embedded code and robotics. Sometimes depending on the college the degree may cover some more general topics as listed under CIS below. CS is a difficult major and may include a number of advanced math courses. Many CS students find themselves not enjoying programming, not being gifted at it or not having the math and logic skills to be good at programming and they will switch out into CIS. CS majors that are able to graduate can also qualify for jobs listed below under CIS.    Computer Information Systems (CIS) - This may also be called a variety of other names like Information Technology (IT), Information Systems (IS),  Computer Applications  (CA), etc. This is a general technical degree and is the degree that I have. Holders of these degree work in a variety of technical jobs like these:   Computer Technician, Service Center Coordinator, Help Desk Staff, Storage Administrator, Network Administrator, Systems Administrator, Systems Engineer, Enterprise Administrator, Active Directory Administrator, Exchange and Messaging Administrator, Backup Administrator, Disaster Recovery Specialist, Database Administrator, Computing Security Specialist, Ethical Hacker, Corporate IT Acquisition Specialist and Data Center Administrator, just to name a few.
