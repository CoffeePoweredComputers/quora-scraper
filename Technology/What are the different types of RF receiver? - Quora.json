            "answer_text": "At the receiver end, an RF amplifier follows the antenna section and down conversion in frequency is performed by Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifiers. Super heterodyne receiver is a typical example of an RF receiver system. A dish antenna set up for residential purpose is an RF receiver. The reflector comes with an horn (LNBF) that sends the signal received by the reflector down a 75 ohm RG6 cable, which connects to the set-top box. ",
