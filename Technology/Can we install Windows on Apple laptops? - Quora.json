Important: If you\u2019re using a portable Mac, connect it to a power source before continuing. Connect an external hard drive or insert a flash drive into the USB port on your Mac; keep it connected or inserted while you install Windows and the Windows support software.Open Boot Camp Assistant, located in the Other folder in Launchpad.At the Select Tasks step, select all tasks, then click Continue.Follow the onscreen instructions.When you\u2019re asked to create a Windows partition, specify a partition size. If you have multiple internal hard drives, you can select a different hard drive from the one running OS X and create a single partition on that drive to use solely for Windows.Note: You can\u2019t resize the partition later.If you need help determining the best size for your Windows partition, refer to your Windows installer documentation. For Windows 8, create a partition that is at least 30 GB.Click Install.Boot Camp Assistant creates a Windows partition named BOOTCAMP, restarts your Mac, then opens the Windows installer.Install Windows Follow these instructions to install Windows on your Mac. In the Windows installer, follow the onscreen instructions.If you\u2019re installing Windows 7, you\u2019re asked whether to do an upgrade or custom installation. Choose Custom.When you\u2019re asked where to install Windows, select the partition named BOOTCAMP (you may need to scroll through the list of partitions to see it).WARNING: Do not create or delete a partition, or select any other partition. Doing so may delete the entire contents of your OS X partition. \u200b\u200b\u200bIf you see \u201cDrive options (advanced)\u201d below the list of partitions, click it. Otherwise, proceed to step 4Click Format, then click Ok \u200bClick Next.The installer formats the Windows partition using the NTFS file system.Follow the onscreen instructions to finish installing Windows.After you install the Windows software, your Mac automatically restarts using Windows.Use the Windows setup screens to configure Windows.After you configure Windows, an installer appears. Install Windows support software After installing Windows, the support software installs Boot Camp drivers to support your Mac hardware, including AirPort devices, the built-in camera, the Apple Remote, the trackpad on a portable Mac, and the function keys on an Apple keyboard. The software also installs the Boot Camp Control Panel for Windows and the Apple Boot Camp system tray item. After you configure Windows, if you kept the external USB drive that has the Windows support software inserted, an installer starts automatically. Otherwise, insert the external USB drive, then double-click the setup.exe file located in the BootCamp folder.Follow the onscreen instructions.Important: Do not click the Cancel button in any of the installer dialogs.If a message appears that says the software you\u2019re installing has not passed Windows Logo testing, click Continue Anyway.You don\u2019t need to respond to installer dialogs that appear only briefly during installation, but if a dialog asks you to install device software, click Install.If nothing appears to be happening, there may be a hidden window that you must respond to.

            "answer_text": "There are a few different ways to run Windows apps on Macs, ranked from least expensive to most expensive: Wine You can use Wine, a freeware application that provides a Windows compatibility layer, to run Windows apps without the Windows operating system. This is the least expensive way to run Window apps on Macs because you don\u2019t need a Windows license or installation to do so. This method is the least resource intensive of all of them because it does not have the overhead in disk space , RAM usage, and CPU usage of running the Windows operating system. Wine apps are installed in a hidden \u201c.wine\u201d folder within your macOS home directory, do not require a Windows operating system install, and run right along side your Mac apps without requiring you to reboot, which is very nice. Note that some Windows apps may not be as stable or robust running within this compatibility layer as they would be running in a legitimate Windows operating system install. With that said, though, many, many apps run just fine this way. For instance, I routinely play the Windows version of Call of Duty 4 through Wine, where it\u2019s actually more stable on my Mac than the native Mac version of the same game! This is always my first choice when I need to run some miscellaneous Windows app on my Mac. It's usually as simple as downloading the app, double-clicking it to install it, and then launching it with Wine. Boot Camp macOS comes with a built-in feature called Boot Camp that lets you install Windows and Windows apps on a partition on your Mac\u2019s startup drive. This way is more expensive because it requires you to have a legitimate copy of Windows to install and activate. It also requires you to have enough free space on your startup drive to be able to create a partition on it large enough to hold Windows and your Windows apps. And you can\u2019t easily put that partition on a separate drive. The major drawback is that this requires you to reboot your Mac any time you want to run Windows apps, and then reboot again when you want to use Mac apps. You can\u2019t run Windows and Mac apps along side each other. Despite that shortcoming, Windows apps do run very well and very fast this way. For certain apps (primarily apps that make use of 3D graphics like games and VR apps) this is the best solution since the apps have direct native access to the GPU. But the fact that you have to reboot is a turnoff for a lot of people, which brings us to\u2026 Virtual Machines You can use a virtual machine like VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop, or VirtualBox to install Windows into a virtual machine that runs on your Mac. This way is more expensive because it requires you to have a legitimate copy of Windows to install and activate. And VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop cost $79.99 as of this writing, while VirtualBox is free (though has fewer features, much less integration with macOS, and is harder to set up). Using a virtual machine is also more resource intensive since the VM shares CPU, RAM, and disk space with macOS. Since Windows requires a significant amount of RAM to run properly, you should have at least 8GB of RAM installed in your Mac (more is better - at least 16GB would be best). Like Boot Camp, it also requires disk space to allocate to a virtual hard drive large enough to hold the Windows operating system, apps, and user files you will create with it. But unlike Boot Camp, it doesn\u2019t partition your startup drive; instead it creates virtual disk images stored as normal Mac files. And you can put the virtual disk image files wherever you want - even an external drive. It is more CPU intensive because you are running the entire Windows operating system and built-in apps within macOS. Despite the increased resource usage, this way is often the one people choose because it lets you run Windows apps along side Mac apps without having to reboot your Mac. And as long as your computer meets the system requirements of the VM software you use, the speed is generally terrific: with the exception of 3D action games, you generally cannot tell any speed difference between this and Boot Camp. This method also provides some really nice integration functionality between Windows and macOS. For instance VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop let you drag and drop files, copy and paste, and so on between Windows and macOS. VirtualBox doesn't have as many of those features; and setup isn\u2019t as easy either (you get what you pay for). ",
