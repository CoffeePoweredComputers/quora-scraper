            "answer_text": "Probably Doctor Who, which has a far greater range. For this, I\u2019m going to ignore the extended universes of both franchises and focus only on the television/film aspects. If we included those, Doctor Who would have an even bigger advantage. Star Trek has relatively few big players here: The Borg - immense in terms of technological ability, power and sheer numbers. They keep going, they adapt, they grow with every conquest. They are one of very few races in the franchise that have managed to do anything with Omega particles. They\u2019ve been beaten off by humanity on several occasions, but they\u2019ve never attacked in force. A single Cube at a time? If the Borg viewed humanity as a threat, they\u2019d send several. Humanity only survived as much as it did with help - Q gave them advanced warning of them, Guinan knew of them, Picard\u2019s experiences with them gave them an edge, and the Voyager crew had an entire species from another universe to force the Borg into an alliance with them. The Organons, the Traveller, others - various older races exist in the Star Trek universe that we know relatively little about. They show immense powers, to god-like levels (hey, Kirk even MET a few Ancient Greek gods). They tend to stay pretty quiet and not get involved unless they have to, which is a relief, but the source and limitations of their powers are thus unknown. V\u2019Ger / Probe Ship - honourable mention must go to these space probes, both visiting Earth in the feature films and both fearsome in technological power. V\u2019Ger was capable of destroying whole fleets of starships and then storing their patterns in its memory. There was no destroying this creature - communication was the only option here. As for the space probe from \u201cThe Voyage Home\u201d - nothing Starfleet or any other races nearby had could stand up to it. Anything that got close just shut down. Again, communication was the only thing that prevented destruction, only it wasn\u2019t by humans in this case. The Q / Continuum - these are the top of the tree for Star Trek; a race of omnipotent beings that shape the flow of the universe according to their desires. They\u2019re into civil war cosplay. Most of them don\u2019t get involved, but Q is the main exception; despite all his comments, I think he likes humans and finds them interesting. Why else would his brethren have banished him to become one? What\u2019s unclear is how they work - is their power technological, or a natural ability? The former seems more likely, or I don\u2019t know how they would be able to (for instance) grant their powers to human beings, which they did on at least one occasion, or remove them from their own kind. Doctor Who: At the lower levels, we have plenty of formidable foes. The Daleks and the Cybermen are both numerous, advanced and deadly. Both would pose a significant threat even to the Borg, and that\u2019s before you even factor in how dangerous the Daleks were at the height of the Time War. The Time Lords - a race of nigh-immortal beings of immense knowledge and full control over time travel. Their homeworld is inaccessible to most other races. In their early days, they were a conquering force that brought order from chaos, wiping out even the Great Vampires. Forget Dracula - these things were ENORMOUS, would wipe out whole planets in their thirst for blood and healed from injuries so quickly that the only way the Time Lords found to kill them was to build bowships - literally, crossbows the size of spaceships. (See \u201cState of Decay\u201d.) But even they aren\u2019t the highest level of power. The Osirans - think Ancient Egyptian gods. Most of them are long dead by the time Doctor Who brought them up, sacrificing themselves in order to contain the deadliest of their race; Sutekh (\u201cPyramids of Mars\u201d). Trapped in a pyramid on Earth (despite the story title), Sutekh is discovered by an explorer and quickly starts his bid for freedom. Even held in place by Osiran technology, Sutekh is able to control minds (human or Time Lord) and even hold back the force of explosions through sheer strength of will. The Doctor was only able to stop him by trapping him in a time corridor and letting him age to death. If he\u2019d got free, there would have been no stopping him. The Eternals - a race of immortal beings from the void, fascinated by \u201cephemerals\u201d as they call mortal races. Even the Time Lords are insignificant to them (\u201cAre there really lords of such a small domain?\u201d). They can make things appear just by thinking about them, but in their eternity they seek nothing more than entertainment. They rely on ephemeral minds for ideas; they can pick up those ideas and make them real. The Guardians - even the Eternals are beholden to these two beings, one White and one Black. Between them, they control the balance of existence itself. Their power is known to be technological, but it\u2019s on a scale that even Time Lord science cannot fathom. Gods of Ragnarok, Chronos, Azrael, The Beast, numerous others - there are plenty of other omnipotent-level beings in Doctor Who, most of which we don\u2019t see much of. Much like Sutekh, we usually encounter them after they\u2019ve been contained to some extent by other immensely powerful beings. Who trapped the Beast around that black hole in \u201cThe Satan Pit\u201d? We don\u2019t know, but even trapped there he was extremely dangerous. Chronos, likewise, was immensely powerful - yet trapped for thousands of years. What he/she/it is going to do now she\u2019s been freed, we don\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost certainly Doctor Who. While the alien species in Star Trek might naturally be more powerful, that\u2019s not the question. The alien technology is. And, when that\u2019s the question, the answer is most certainly Doctor Who. In Doctor Who, the Time Lords have figured out time travel. They have figured out how to create a device that allows them to manipulate anything related to technology (sonic screwdrivers). They have also figured out how to create space ships powerful enough to hover right on the edge of a black hole, without getting sucked in. The Star Trek universe, while having some powerful technology, is nowhere near as strong as the technology in Doctor Who. -Allons-y! ",
