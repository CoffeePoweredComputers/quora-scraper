Volume Buttons Wake On Redmi 8 Don\u2019t just rely on the power button of the Redmi 8 to wake the device up. Instead, you can also the volume buttons for the same purposes.

By expanding a notification, you can reveal action buttons or just view more content and then take the appropriate action. This gesture will work on the lock screen as well as from the home screen. Camera Shortcut Redmi 8 With a phone that features an amazing rear camera, Xiaomi should have included a quick camera shortcut option on the Redmi 8. While the lock screen shortcut is there, it is simply not as fast as a physical shortcut say like double pressing the power button which is found on plenty of other Android devices. This option is present on the Redmi 8 as well, it is just that it is disabled by default. Enable it from Settings -> Additional Settings -> Button and gesture shortcuts and from the Launch camera option select the power button option. Fingerprint Scanner as Shutter Button on Redmi 8 Use the rear fingerprint scanner on the Redmi 8 for more than just unlocking the device. You can also use it as a shutter button while in the camera app. A handy feature to have especially while taking selfies where it can be quite difficult to press the shutter button from one\u2019s thumb. Make sure to enable the option from the settings menu of the Camera app. Screenshot Gesture On Redmi 8 Want to quickly take a screenshot on your Redmi 8? The old way of pressing and holding the Volume down and Power button simultaneously exists but there is a far more convenient gesture which involves simply swiping down on the screen with just 3 fingers. This screenshot gesture has been available in MIUI for a long time but on the Redmi 8, this feature is enabled right out of the box. In case it is disabled on your device for some reason, you can enable it from Settings -> Additional Settings -> Gesture.
