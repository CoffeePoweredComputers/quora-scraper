            "answer_text": "Not at all. You just need a drone big enough to carry the weight, a thermal imager, and a means by which to operate the camera remotely and store/transmit the images. I\u2019ve connected a FLIR Duo to a MAVIC previously, and that worked fine, both recording and transmitting the images back. Getting the balance right with somethign like the Mavic is difficult, and they don\u2019t like carrying things beneath them, but it is possible. With other drones in the sub-1Kg range? It might be a bit challenging due to load carrying capabilities, but in the above-1Kg range, it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem. Cameras like the Duo are designed to interface to a normal PWM signal from an RC controller, which allows functions to be controlled directly from a transmitter. ",
