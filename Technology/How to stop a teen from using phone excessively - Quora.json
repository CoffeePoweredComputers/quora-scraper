            "answer_text": "What makes someone use of their phone \u201cexcessive\u201d? My guess is that you have a teen who uses a phone significantly more then you do. Which in and of itself means\u2026 exactly nothing. Are you having trouble getting them to do the things you want them to do, School, chores, etc? That\u2019s not the phones doing, any more then Fortnight/ Rap music/ Comic books/ MTV/ Walkmans/ Paperbacks/ Teen Magazines/ Private phone lines/ Crosswords/ The Post Office are ruined all the kids. Your not going to get teens interested in doing things that are boring or work by trying to take away or limiting the stuff they want to do. You could have the entire world composed of a classroom and an endless gray featureless void, and kids would still not pay attention in class. I dont have some magic formula for how to motivate people. And I am extremely suspicious of anyone who claims they do. I have some strategies I recommend trying though: Edward Wilhite's answer to How do you get teenagers to do chores consistently? Granted I dont have numbers or examples to back those up. There is one thing I also recommend, which is to establish a new line of communication and start getting some insight into what they are doing with their phone and why. Transparency and Guidance - This one will be a bit nebulous but she\u2019ll want to have a general idea of how and what you use your phone for. As well as make sure that you don\u2019t fall under the influence of things like creeps, scammers, hackers and extortionists. You promise to come to her for guidance and advice if anything weird or suspicious comes up.Rule 1: The scarier it sounds the more you should think before acting. Its near universal that these people will try to scare you into doing something you know you shouldn't (open a file, send info/pics)Rule 2: The first thing to do if they say \u201cdont call the cops\u201d is to call the cops. Even if they have something bad, they want worse, risk taking a lump now and tell your parents rather then risk giving them more leverage.She should be teaching you and providing guidelines for how to spot and avoid dangers as well as what is and isn't appropriate behavior onlineYou should have regular check-in sessions where you talk about the things that you do and the apps/platforms that you use. She should know at least your usernames, if not be friends on all of the platforms. If shes smart she\u2019ll start reaching out and take an friendly interest to you online.Edward Wilhite's answer to How can I turn off the Life 360 without anyone knowing? It would be worth considering folding that into a regularly scheduled parent/child relationship checkup time. Basically you set apart a block of an hour or two every week or two, get somewhere out of the house. During these sessions you ask/answer questions, raise small issues or concerns and talk about the relationship. Is there anything that I do that hurts you/makes you feel unheard, unloved, not understood?Is there anything you need from me as your parent that I\u2019m not giving you?Is there something I used to do that you wish I still did?Can you tell me something that made you smile today?Can you tell me the last time you felt proud of your accomplishments?Now during the session your running under slightly different rules. First off this is an \u201cHonesty Hour\u201d You\u2019re honest and open even if what your saying may hurt to hear. You and your kid should try not to take this personally or take offense, even if it hurts they are not trying to hurt you. Leaning and practicing classic non-confrontation communications techniques here will help with that\u2026 Edward Wilhite's answer to How can you deal with a teen who won't talk to you anymore? ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a teenager in the 1970s, landlines were all we had. My parents chose to pay for an extra phone number for me and my brother to share to not have the whole household competing for one phone line. My bedroom was in the back of the house and I could be on the phone all night if I wanted to without being noticed too much. Now that probably sounds a bit permissive. But let\u2019s add some details here. 1. If my grades slipped, that phone was going to go away. 2. If my chores slipped, that phone was going to go away. If I refused to cooperate with reasonable requests, that phone was going to go away. I often tell teens and parents here that I believe the most important thing for a good relationship between teens and parents is for teens to show responsibility and for parents to show basic respect to their teens as people - particularly in the area of privacy. My telephone privileges were part of how I learned to be responsibility and it was well worth my own effort to show responsibility. I never didi loose the phone. I did my homework because that was a habit ingrained early on and by the time I was a teenager, getting good grades was something I wanted for myself. It was a personal achievement, not just something I did to make adults happy. More importantly here, things like that I learned, from experience, made my life easier: give something, get something. The more responsibility I showed, the more I was treated like an adult and allowed to set my own schedule, etc. This was something that both my parents and my grandparents promoted and it was very effective with me. Now, obviously people are different. But I think it\u2019s reasonable to figure that most teenagers want increasing freedom and less parental monitoring. The trick, I think is to get them to buy into the idea that the pathway to what they want is showing personal responsibility, and that doing so can be very rewarding, fostering self-respect, never mind the respect of adults. So, try to work with your teen who\u2019s always on the phone. Approach it from the perspective that they want more freedom and you want to see them demonstrate the responsibility that is needed to get that. Promote it as a win-win and see what happens. If your teen is determined to be irresponsible, you\u2019ll have to take a different path and then they should know that it is their own decisions that are leading down that path. ",
