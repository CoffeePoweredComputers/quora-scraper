            "answer_text": "Air travel is in a period of great change! Currently, the industry is working on many potentially game-changing innovations that could find their way into common airline use over the next couple of decades. Electric propulsion\u2014In 2014, Airbus debuted its all-electric E-Fan demonstrator aircraft. The two-seat test plane is powered by two electric motors each powering a variable geometry fan. Through the E-Fan, Airbus wants to show the public the viability of electric aviation. In 2015, the E-Fan became the first twin-engined electric plane to cross the English Channel. Hypersonic travel--Electric planes might deliver quiet, eco-friendly air travel, hypersonic flights get you to your destination fast. In 2015, Airbus patented a hypersonic jet capable of reaching 4.5 times the speed of sound. The design patented by Airbus shows an aircraft powered by a combination of turbojet, ramjet, and rocket motor. The hypersonic passenger plane could fly as fast as Mach 5, or just under 3,900 miles per hour. Biofuels\u2014Modern jet engines, for all of their refinement and efficiency, still run on kerosene. But one day, kerosene may be replaced by biofuels. While it isn't as revolutionary as electric propulsion, biofuels represent a step in the right direction towards cutting down on greenhouse emissions. Currently, there are a variety of biofuels based on everything from recycled vegetable oil to plant-based ethano. Virgin Atlantic is even working with a Chinese firm to develop a biofuel using waste gases captured from steel mills. Autonomous flight\u2014 Autonomous flight has the potential to deliver increased fuel savings, reduce the operating costs of airlines, and support pilots in their strategic decision-making and mission management. It remains to be seen how quickly autonomous flying will take hold. Biometrics\u2014In the past decade, the check-in process has gone from paper printouts to app-based QR codes. But in the near future, all we'll need is to simply show up. That's because the next step in the evolution of the airport experience is biometrics. JetBlue announced this year that it is working to perfect facial recognition technology to be used instead of paper or electronic boarding passes. All passengers will have to do is stand in front of a camera and take a picture. The photo will then be matched to the US Customs and Border Patrol database.       ",

            "answer_text": "I think that in the years to come, most of the advances will happen in the realm of automation and data analysis. One of the major deficiencies and hazards we face today is ATC. Most of the protocols and processes are from the 1960's and modern technologies (such as GPS) have not been fully integrated with ATC. The idea is to give the pilots access to more information for them to have better situational awareness allowing more ATC related decisions to be done by pilots. Minor things such as constant monitoring of aircraft and its systems are also becoming better and better and probably the Blackboxes will evolve to no longer reside only in the aircraft, but to also stream the data to a satellite where it can be backed up in case of an aircraft is not found. In the longer run, the idea of reducing the number of pilots is also in the table. It will probably start with single piolt aircraft but that is something that is quite far in the horizon. ",
