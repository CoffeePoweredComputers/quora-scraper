            "answer_text": "This is one of those ideas that dates back to the middle ages. Patent for such an idea became so common that United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) had made an official policy of refusing to grant patents without a working model. It\u2019s the Perpetual Motion Machine that is an hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source. This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate the first or second law of thermodynamics. Here are some of the designs.  This is an overbalancing wheel, designed by Mariano di Iacopo (Siena, 1382-1458)  The Capillary bowl To build a perpetual motion machine we must accomplish many things: 1.) The machine should not have any \u201crubbing\u201d parts: Any moving part must not touch other parts. This is because of friction that would be created between the two. This friction will ultimately cause the machine to lose its energy to heat. Making the surfaces smooth is not enough, as there is no perfectly smooth object. Heat will always be generated when two parts rub on each other (and that generation of heat is energy transference i.e, the motion machine losing energy). 2.) The machine must be operated inside a vacuum (no air): The reason for this has to do with the reason listed in number one. Operating the machine anywhere will cause the machine to lose energy due to the friction between the moving parts and air. Although the energy lost due to air friction is very small, remember, we are talking about perpetual motion machines here, if there is a loss mechanism, eventually, the machine will still lose its energy and run down (even if it takes a long, long time). 3.) The machine should not produce any sound: Sound is also a form of energy; if the machine is making any sound, that means that it is also losing energy. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s just say that somehow, we are able to build a perpetual motion machine. Will we be able to get energy from it? Yes, but only up to the energy that is used as an input to start the movement. A perpetual motion machine in real life will just be an energy storage. We must remember that the energy cannot be created; it always has to come from something. So, if you happen to be able to build one, you will need energy to start the motion. This is the only energy that you will be able to harvest, since, as stated previously, energy cannot be created. Kind of a pointless device, really. ",

If there are any such ideas, then they have to have been invented, don\u2019t they? Even if I came up with such an idea, the very act of the idea coming into my mind would be the invention of the idea.
