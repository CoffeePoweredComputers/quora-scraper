            "answer_text": "There are number of good phones in this range, this task is difficult and confusing. I believe that specifications of the phones just tell the half story, a great user experience matters more than great specifications. OnePlus 2 has  superior specs sheet at a comparatively lower price gives it an edge over flagships from other leading manufacturers. It is available in 16GB and 64GB variants priced at Rs 22,999 and Rs 24,999, respectively, and seems like a perfect blend of elegance and solid specs. Moto X (2nd generation) is another great option especially for those looking at pure form of Android. Moto X second generation 16GB model starts at Rs 21,999 online, while the 32GB model starts at Rs 22,999. It comes with a good display and the call quality is impressive.You can also check out the Galaxy S5, an older Samsung flagship that is now available online for as low as Rs 21,999. Another good option to consider is the HTC 826 that is now available for Rs 24,500 after a price drop.
