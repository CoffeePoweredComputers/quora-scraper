            "answer_text": "As a professional alarm engineer I'm not sure I should answer this question as it is possible I may provide information to nefarious people looking to enter people's houses illegally. If the system is armed there is no way to disable it without triggering it into full alarm mode. If the system is not armed any attempt to disable it will produce a local alarm (the external siren will sound along with any inside the building) \u2014 removing power from the panel itself (mains and batteries) will cause the external siren to continue until the battery is exhausted. If remotely monitored with a police or security company response any of the above would result in a visit from the relevant persons as the signal sent to the monitoring company would be classified as high priority. I strongly recommend calling a reputable professional if you are having problems with your alarm system as dangerous voltages are present in both the panel and the external siren (mains voltage in the former and upwards of 6000v in the latter to drive the flashing strobe unit).

I would not like to be providing anyone with answers that may lead to the stealing other peoples belongings. If your intentions have to do with the alarm in your own house then consult the manual or call a professional. ",
