            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure we could become more dependent on technology than we are today. Back to the stone age? Everyone but country farmers would likely starve within a year if the power went out today. Actually, most of the farmers are liking to end up starving too, since without technology, the diesel for their tractors couldn\u2019t be produced or delivered. We\u2019d (those that were left) soon be back to hunting and gathering, and THAT technology won\u2019t support even 1% of today\u2019s population. The real question is, can we maintain our technological lifestyle as the climate emergency continues to worsen and impact our civilization without any sign of abatement? As all the forests burn, the fish die off, the crops fail due to floods and drought, the cities go underwater and billions of people are displaced, how will we do? Perhaps we need to start asking some more serious questions. Like, what are we going to do to change the unsustainable direction we are heading in? ",

In either way, you\u2019ll be confronted with commercial and governmental organizations that are highly dependent on technology to process you interactions with them, so you\u2019ll find it impossible to avoid dependency altogether.
