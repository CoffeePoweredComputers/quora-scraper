            "answer_text": "Depends on the quality of the screen display, the screen technology, and also the size of the screen. A small 4 inch screen is probably bad fpr your eyes if you look at it in the dark for too long, but a 6.8 inch screen would be better because the font size and everyone will be easier and your eyes don't have to work hard trying to read small fonts. If you have an LCD screen, the screen gets too bright at night.. even on the lowest settings.. the LED backlight can irritate your eyes at night, that's why I think OLED screens are better to look at in the dark.. OLED panels can get darker by default, and the black colors don't light up and overall OLED just seems easier on the eyes. If you use the screen in the dark at night, I suggest using a Bluelight filter so it doesn't affect your melatonin production which helps you sleep naturally. I used to play on my computer ay night which has a LCD screen, sometimes I get nightmares after using the computer in the dark for too long.. the brain gets confused because it's supposed to be night time but it's seeing bright lights. If you have a Windows PC, I suggest installing a free app called \"f.lux\" which is a Bluelight filter for the PC and it turns on automatically when the sun sets. With Bluelight filters, newer display technology, and higher quality screens.. using the phone at night isn't as bad as it used to be.. back in the day, we had fat CRT PC monitor screens and tube TVs with low quality resolution and refresh rates.. today, smartphone and laptop screens are much better and so it's easier on the eyes. However, if you are under 18, your eyes may still be growing and developing\u2026 so it's a good idea to limit the amount you spent looking at a screen, especially at night in the dark. ",

            "answer_text": " Short term usage of phone in the dark will do nothing to the eyes. Problem starts when it is prolonged and without taking adequate breaks. Bright light especially when blue light is strong (eg from your phones or laptops), can cause damage to your macula( strongest part of your eyes concerned with vision). However this damage takes years to occur and evidence for this is inconclusive. Blue light can also cause delay in sleep induction if you use it just prior to bedtime. Prolonged, short term exposure to bright light can cause phototoxicity of the retina( sensitive nervous tissue of the eye). Although this is very rare. Best to use a blue light filter and take adequate breaks every 20 mins to protect your eyes. Take care of your vision always. ",
