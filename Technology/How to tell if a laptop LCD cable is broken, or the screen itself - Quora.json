            "answer_text": "Telling that the screen itself is broken, is that you will either see the crack, which causes the display to bloom out usually in a black pattern a section of the screen. Its much like how a rock breaks your windshield, but the liquid inside the display, causes the display to bloom into strange shapes. Smaller defects n appear as spots, pressure spots near the edges, where it may have been pinched. Then you can have lines in the display vertical or horizontal thin ones, often white lines. If you have multiple lines, distortion or flickering, then that is a sign of a bad cable or edge connection inside the display. On older LCD displays, the other issue is backlighting, where you can see an image if you shine a flashlight up close, or in an LED display the same, or you may see a portion (band) of the display that is black. The LEDs that backlight the display are in strips, behind the Panel, and are in strips. Usually a whole strip, but often the entire display loses illumination. If this happens in a laptop, your much better off to just replace the display. Technicians may be able to open up the display and take it apart, and fix the bad LEDs behind the display or mounted at the edge of the display. But this is far beyond the average DIY and then you take the risk of dust and dirt getting inside the display as well. And unless you can unscrew the edges of the frame, well you get the picture. As for MacBook Pro, the Retina display generally cannot be repaired, especially if it is cracked. Its both glued together and if you attempted to open it would just crack it more, but really if it is already cracked there is nothing you can do but replace it. Other notebooks and older ones, the LCD has FL tubes that light it. If it is dim in one area then the display needs replacing, but it is inside the outer frame and bezel. Most of those have either hidden under rubber covers, or on the edge of the frame, there are screws to allow you to take it apart, and then the LCD and FL tubes are inside and the display comes out with typically 4 screws, and the cables plug into the FL high voltage inverter board, located at the bottom or maybe right edge of the display. The Inverter board can also fail, causing backlight not working. There is usually 2 white HV plugs that you can unplug as well as test them using a neon bulb or the end of the FL lamp will glow if placed near them or using a clip lead off the FL bulb to ground (frame) and holding it close to the white inverter plugs. However, even that is no real test, as the inverter will shut down if the bulb(s) are broken due to a hard drop of the laptop. It measures the current of the bulbs and will shut down if there is no current draw from the bulbs. There will be voltage usually 12 volts, at the pins of the cables going into the inverter board, that you can measure with a meter. Also, 5 volts go into that as well. If the cable going to the display is broken it usually can be spotted, or you could pull and pluck it and the display may flicker or go on and off. Usually the break occurs at the point where it passes thru the hinge area. If you took the bezel frame off the display, you will usually see it, the frayed wires, or area where the cable looks to be partly severed. You MIGHT attempt to respice and solder it back together with heat shrink tubing, or you might be able to find a cable assembly new or used from a cracked display to fix it. ",

            "answer_text": "If the LCD itself is broken, you might see dead or stuck pixels that look something like this.  Sometimes certain colors or pushing on the screen LIGHTLY will make them go away. This helped remove a good bit of stuck pixels on a very old Gateway LCD of mine. I can\u2019t guarantee that what I said is a permanent fix, however. If the screen CABLE is broken, usually the backlight will randomly shut off, dim, or sometimes weird colored lines will appear on the display if you have the laptop open at a certain angle. ",
