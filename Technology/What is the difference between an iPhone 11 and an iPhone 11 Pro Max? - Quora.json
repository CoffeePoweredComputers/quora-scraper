            "answer_text": "In terms of design, both phones are bangs screen and back glass body, the iPhone 11 is 6.1 inches, and the iPhone 11 Pro is 5.8 inches. The front panel design of the iPhone 11 is larger than the iPhone 11 Pro, and it is an LCD material, not an OLED material, so the display effect will be inferior. From the screen brightness contrast of the two mobile phones, you can directly see it.  The iPhone 11 Pro is a little smaller and should be considered a small screen phone, but the size of the iPhone 11 may be more suitable because for many users, the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max is really too big to handle with one hand. The iPhone 11 Pro series has a wider dynamic range display, the daily display brightness is 800 nits, and the highest temperature is 1200 nits, so if you want better audio and video, then choose iPhone 11 pro.  The iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro are actually a little different in terms of craftsmanship. The iPhone 11 pro series is made of matt glass to avoid fingerprints, and it will be closer to the border on the screen extension, and the frame is made of stainless steel, so it can create better control of the black edge. However, the iPhone 11 has new versions such as green and purple, and it looks like the value will be higher, and the integration with the camera will be better.  Of course, the most obvious difference is taking pictures of the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 Pro has an additional camera. Although both iPhones support twice optical zoom, the iPhone 11 only supports 5x digital zoom and the iPhone11 Pro can support 10x digital zoom. In other aspects of shooting, for the general consumer, in fact, the two phones are not much different, they are able to support 4k resolution video capture, the front camera is also 12 million pixels.  In terms of performance, the two iPhones basically use the same A13 processor, which is also a 64GB starting storage combination. But here I want to tell you that the iPhone11 is a cheap version, 64GB may be used for one year and you can buy a new one next year. And the iPhone 11 pro is really not enough if you buy the 64GB version unless you want to continue to replace the new one next year. The details of the experience, these two iPhones are based on Intel's baseband, so the signal problem is not known! On the charging battery life, the iPhone 11's 5W is naturally not comparable to the iPhone11 pro's 18W, but the battery capacity of the two phones is almost the same, and the iPhone 11 Pro's charging life will be slightly longer. The starting price of the iPhone 11 is $699, and the starting price of the iPhone 11 Pro is $999. The difference between the two iPhones is $300. The iPhone 11 actually exists as a cheap version, the main selling point is the price point, and the iPhone 11 Pro as a true flagship phone is definitely better in terms of configuration. Therefore, personal advice, if you plan to change the new mobile phone next year, and do not want to spend too much money, then choose iPhone 11. If you want to use the mobile phone longer, then try not to choose the 64GB version of iPhone 11 pro. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, what I am writing here is just some recommendations for you, and it really depends on what you decide in the end. So, let me start with the colours. For the iPhone 11, there are more colour choices which include purple, yellow, green, black, white and red. Although the iPhone 11 Pro only has four colour choices, it includes 2 of the latest colour choices which include Midnight Green and Space Gray. Then there is silver and gold. In terms of the designs, the iPhone 11 uses a glass and aluminum design, while the iPhone 11 Pro uses a glass and stainless steel design. You might think that the iPhone 11 Pro is bigger than the iPhone 11, it\u2019s not. The iPhone 11 size is 6.1\u2033 while the iPhone 11 Pro size is 5.8\u2033. Personally, I like phone sizes under 6\u2033 because I sometimes use my phone with one hand, and if the phone is bigger than 6\u2033, it\u2019s really hard to handle. But if you are not that kind of single hand phone user, you can decide yourself. Okay. Let\u2019s move onto the next thing - storage/capacity (or whatever you like to call it). The iPhone 11 can only support up to 256 GB of storage, while the iPhone 11 Pro supports up to 512 GB of storage. Now let\u2019s talk about the cameras. Both the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro has what Apple calls a TrueDepth front camera which accurately captures face data for using Face ID to unlock. The front camera of both phones are the same (12\u2009MP f/2.2 with flash). Next, let\u2019s move on to the special part, which is the rear (main) camera. The iPhone 11\u2019s main camera is a dual camera which includes wide and ultra wide mode, and they are both 12 MP cameras. The iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s camera is a 12 MP triple camera which also includes wide and ultra wide mode. The difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro has a telephoto camera, and telephoto cameras can be used to shoot distant objects like wildlife, and it can also be used for portrait photography. Both phones have a night mode which allows them to take clearer photos at night. For the video recording, both phones support 4k video recording and up to 60 FPS. Talking about the technical stuff, both phones are using the latest Apple A13 Bionic chipset and a Hexa Core Processor. The iPhone 11 battery size is 3110 mAH, which is just slighty different from the iPhone 11 Pro which has a 3190 mAH battery. The 18 watts fast charger doesn\u2019t come with the iPhone 11 which means that you will have to buy it separately, but the iPhone 11 Pro does include a 18 watts fast charger in the box. And obviously, both phones have a non-removable battery. Finally, time to talk about the display. The iPhone 11 uses a Liquid Retina HD display and the iPhone 11 Pro uses a Super Retina XDR display. I would say that both displays are pretty good. The iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s screen brightness is brighter than the iPhone 11, and the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s screen is 1125\u2009x\u20092436\u2009pixels while the iPhone 11 is 828\u2009x\u20091792\u2009pixels. For additional information, both phones are waterproof and is rated IP68, and both phones support Dolby Atmos. In conclusion, I would recommend the iPhone 11 Pro as the price is reasonable and it\u2019s a great phone overall. I hope this helps! ",
