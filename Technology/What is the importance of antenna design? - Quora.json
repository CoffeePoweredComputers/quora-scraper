            "answer_text": "Like everything in the world there are requirements that define what is needed and to which degree plus how I he needs are to meet the objective. With eyesight we need to be able to navigate the natural world and find food whilst staying safe. If we want to see in the dark we need more light sensitive eyes. To see colour we need more light and optics that don't respond differently to different parts of the light spectrum. Should we need to see objects a long way off we need higher magnification lenses. Ok? what's this to do with antennas? Well they are just eyesight lenses but for the collection of frequencies a lot lower than the visible light spectrum. So to fullfill the requirements of input capabilities for whatever application you are trying to use, there are different qualities that need to be met. If you want to receive signals across a wide range of frequencies, or from very weak sources, or from a very precise direction, then the antenna has to be different for each one. A radio suitable for the pre-teens need only be a bit of wire as they will just be receiving strong signals from any direction. A radio telescope requires a vast aerial array to receive specific and extremely weak signals from a tiny bit of the sky. Each requirement needs different electrical and mechanical properties. ",
