            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not so much that Linux killed UNIX as much as the x86 ISA caught up with the RISC chips which most UNIX OSs ran on top of, and Linux was a cheap, friendly UNIX substitute. UNIX operating systems were, and most still are, tied to expensive RISC processors. AIX, Solaris, and HP-UX are tied to the Power, SPARC, and Itanium ISAs respectively. The x86 ISA expanded to 64-bit, and the x86 manufacturers were able to increase the performance of their chips to levels that were equal, or better, then the RISC ISAs. In the heyday of the UNIX systems, x86 systems were cheap, crappy systems only suitable for end users, and the RISC systems were the industrial solution for production and people serious about work. Once cheap x86 systems were on equal footing with RISC systems performance wise, or close enough anyway, businesses made the decision to go with the cheaper, \u201cgood enough\u201d systems. UNIX operating systems were really expensive, and they weren\u2019t very user friendly. SCO Unix was one of the few Unix OSs which ran on x86, and it required licensing fees, while Linux did not. Running Solaris was an expensive proposition even without the cost of the hardware. Linux support licenses could be purchased from Red Hat, and they were a fraction of what IBM, Sun, and HP were charging. Once again, business went with the cheaper, \u201cgood enough\u201d solution. Something that gets over looked is just how user friendly Linux is. Linux is still user focused, even after all these years. People generally preferred the GNU tools, and all of their extensions, to the more limited Unix tools, so when an OS came about which featured a GNU userland people were very happy. Having used Solaris, it can be prickly. Decisions are made based on stability rather then what enhances the user\u2019s experience. Linux is still something that is meant to be touched by users. It accommodates people rather then working against them or forcing people to accommodate the machine. If you\u2019re wondering where the BSDs are in all of this, they were getting sued by AT&T, and it took them 5 years to get a full OS after the legal battle. With their future in jeopardy, businesses went with the clean room implementation to avoid any problems, and people were looking for a SysV style OS rather then a BSD style OS. IBM, in particular, was looking for a Sys V, Unix-like OS to run on their x86 server line. One that could be enhanced collaboratively to avoid the fragmentation of the \u201880s Unix Wars. Overall, people were looking for a Unix-like OS with a Sys V init system which ran on x86 hardware, and Linux fit the bill. In the meantime, x86 has become the dominant ISA in the computing landscape, and Linux has been brought along with it. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Unix is still alive and well, but it's market share has definitely shrunk. In certain high availability applicatons some companies feel more comfortable running Unix Than Linux. One also has to look at the history of Unix to understand - there were a couple of variants. Unix emerged out of Bell Labs and Berkeley. For years the two variants influenced other Unixes that were based on them\u2026 kind of like what has happened to Linux, many things sprouted from one or two things. Attempts at unification of Unixes in the 80s led to SysV. the most popular version of SysV was release 4, SVR4. However, Berkeley Unix still carried on separately and didn't join this specification. Features from Berkeley did leak into SVR4, so the two started having similarities. The main Unixes that are still SVR4 now are HP\u2019s HPUX, IBM\u2019s AIX, and Oracle Solaris. These are still entrenched in many large corporations. I would guess that they are around 15\u201320 percent of the high end server market, combined, on proprietary hardware. In the early days SunOS (now Solaris) was a Berkeley Unix. Berkeley Unix has basically become BSD. OSX is a BSD offshoot. Government, banks, and oil companies are the biggest consumers of Unix these days. The reason is partly familiarity but also partly the ability to have robust support at a moments notice. There is a lot of legacy software around too that companies, and especially government, don't want to spend the money to port over to Linux. Unix has a high cost, but it is stable and secure, and while Linux rivals it in uptime and reliability, the few companies that offer support don't do as well at it as the large Unix companies. HP realized in the 2000s that their code compilation for printers was an order of magnitude faster on Linux Redhat with x86 than on HPUX on HP workstations, and so, the death knell for HPUX was sounded there on their workstations. HP maintained the HPUX operating system on servers however, to keep customers happy I believe. One could almost say the same about other Unixes, they have been maintained for two reasons - one, the customers especially ones with legacy software, still want them (and the warm fuzzies that a support contract provides) and two, there has to be support and a decision on end of life before a company does away with a product like that. They don\u2019t just pull the plug one day, normally. As some others have noted Unix, like Linux, reinvents itself over the years. Linux will most likely become an approved Unix at some point. In conclusion I'd say that most of the old guard Unixes are not dead and will not really disappear, it's just that hybrids and trickle downs and some unification will make everything be called Unix later on\u2026can't say how long though for sure.

            "answer_text": "What happened is that Unix outgrew its own self. It reached a level of maturity and wide adoption that the Unix community felt the need to standardize the system interfaces in order to maintain a lower level of common functionality between different vendors. This resulted in different regulatory bodies appearing along the way, eventually culminating in the Open Group, the current holder of the Unix trademark. At one point, everyone wanted to be Unix, or be like Unix. Andrew Tanenbaum created Minix as a clone of Unix (it's MIni-UNIx). Richard Stallman created GNU as a UNIX clone, despite the name (GNU\u2019s Not Unix). Linus Torvalds created Linux as a UNIX kernel clone. BSD and it's derivatives (FreeBSD, NetBSD, \u2026) are all Unixes. Solaris is Unix. MacOS is a derivative of FreeBSD, hence Unix. Unix has grown so big and influential that it was no longer practical to continue it as an OS. It transformed into a system specification (Single Unix Specification - SUS, or POSIX). That is the specification most systems today are aiming to implement (most, not all). So in answering your question: no, Linux did not kill Unix, simply because you can't kill Unix. It transcended to another level now. Very few systems in history could reach that level. ",

            "answer_text": "Linux is a UNIX derivative just like Solaris/AIX/HP-UX/Tru64 I spent late 80s, early 90s working with Sun/IBM/HP on their proprietary UNIX systems. Initially these ran on proprietary CPUs (SPARC/POWER/PA/Alpha) and were derived from AT&T System V/BSD/Mach based origins but essentially proprietary form of UNIX. Commodity Intel CPUs became faster and slowly started challenging proprietary CPUs in terms of performance and in the early 90s Linus Torvalds created Linux a UNIX derivative kernel and GNU provided the tools and compilers and magically we had a free UNIX derivative. In 1993 I installed Slackware Linux on my PC and this blew my brain\u2026.we had a free UNIX able to run on a low cost PC. Enterprises were much slower to take on Linux, once commercial support was available with Red Hat and more and more commercial software vendors ported their applications to Linux it was only a matter of time before Linux took over from proprietary UNIX derivatives. Linux was UNIX at much lower cost. Even today I still believe that commercial UNIX has more features than Linux, but Linux is free and Intel CPUs offer amazing performance\u2026..why would anyone still run expensive UNIX when low cost Linux is a small fraction of the cost. What killed UNIX? Low cost, powerful commodity hardware and open source. The same will soon kill propitiatory networking and storage. ",

There are is NetBSD, FreeBSD, and probably many more too. Linux most certainly sidelined UNIX in many areas especially in commodity servers (i.e. simple 1U 1\u20134 processor servers). Various UNIX Operating Systems don\u2019t see much action in cheap servers (i.e. under $10,000) but are still pretty big business in bigger machines (i.e. over $250,000). In my last job we used pretty much the cheapest SPARC Solaris machine that Oracle made, it ran for many years then had a board failure. Oracle was out within 24 hours and the machine was fixed. That\u2019s pretty much what UNIX is about these days, it\u2019s about SLAs and support. If a large bank has a problem, they want a number to call, and not be told \u201cHave you tried the OpenSSL mailing list?\u201d. You can get service contracts of course on Linux too, but a lot of big companies have a long history using UNIX on large machines with great success, and that\u2019s pretty valuable to them. ",

            "answer_text": "Unix as such divided into two in the 70s, the AT&T flavour and the BSD flavour, which was developed out of the Berkeley university in California, and this was widely used by third-party workstation manufacturers in the early 1980s such as Sun, Silicon Graphcs, Hewlett-Packard and so on. In the late 1980s, AT&T decided to capitalise on their product by releasing System V, Release 4 which became the basis for a number of commercial versions of Unix in the 90s and early 2000s for everything from the Amiga 3000 to the big workstations. Solaris remains based on it. Unix came to be used as a common term but as a brand name, it could only be applied to the AT&T product. BSD was released as open source in the 1990s and quickly divided into a number of different operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD and, later, Dragonfly BSD. Mac OS X and iOS are partly based on FreeBSD and this accounts for the biggest share of individual Unix users today. Linux has a limited desktop share, but is still widely used on web servers and is also the basis for Android. So no, Linux has definitely not killed Unix; Unix is alive and well on every Mac, iPhone and iPad as well as on some supercomputers and database servers. ",

All the technology, ideas and expertise was subsumed into what is Linux today. We can justifiably say that DOS 2.0 borrowed concepts from Linux even though DOS predates Linux. Windows NT and its progenitor OS/2 used none of the Unix technology and precepts so did not compete or contribute to any demise. What happened to Unix had more to do with MS-DOS 2.0 borrowing and popularizing the subdirectory nomenclature of Unix [cd/../.] Thus, when the Intel 80386 processor architecture became popular and brought hardware support for Unix process and paged memory security model, the inevitable PC implementation of Unix that we now call Linux subsumed the entire Unix ecosystem on generic PC hardware platform. My background includes both SCO Unix and SGI Irix and I propose that the learning curve from any 90\u2019s decade Unix flavor to the Linux distributions with XFree86 was negligible if not zero. The Unix vendors at the time were charging for their hardware while Linux would run on commodity hardware which improved thru 486, Pentium and AMD64 varieties by riding the wave of Windows popularity. Linux subsumed Unix. Long live Unix. ",

I\u2019m an IBM AIX specialist since 1997 and believe me, a LOT of DBs and apps are very much alive on AIX O/Ses on IBM Power hardware in data centres around the world. It harnesses raw processing at the best of ways. Virtualization, Active memory expansion, Active memory sharing, High Availability clusters across remote data centers, Partition mobility (moving systems from 1 kit to another without users even logging out or the system rebooting) are some of the features. Its proprietary and it works in ways other O/Ses will hardly ever come close to. It is expensive but super RAS (Reliable, Available and Scalable). Linux has a big part in it too, so the answer to your question is NO. ",

Apple managed their migration from PowerPC to Intel, but few of their customers were commercial workstation users and CAD experts. Meanwhile, Linux was a POSIX flavor native to x86, not a port compromised by lack of optimization. FWIW, I also suffered with MIPS IRIX, too many flavors of AIX and a couple of flavors of BSD on x86 before it became clear that Linux was more stable and better supported generic PC parts. Then, networking effects took over. ",

The proprietary UNIXes don\u2019t seem to be around much, but, while they\u2019re not officially UNIX, the BSD family descends directly from UNIX, and the BSDs are definitely still in use, FreeBSD in particular for servers (~1% market share, including a couple of big names, I believe), and OpenBSD for high-security systems. Linux largely dominates, I think in large part due to having stepped in at a critical moment (when BSD was temporarily down) to build a large community and having held onto that advantage since. The BSDs have much smaller communities, which means less support, fewer developers, etc. ",

Android is Linux which is Unix, so if you count cell phones, Unix is the most popular genre of operating systems around. They just all have more specific names now than <whatever-vendor> Unix. The reason it appears no one talks about Unix is that variations between varieties of Unix have increased to the point that you want to call the separate versions by their more proper names. That does not stop them from sharing an important core of functionality that will always be Unix. ",
