            "answer_text": "From my experience as a young man, there are many things that make me feel masculine: My work has quite a distinct gender differences between women and men in terms of work: the ladies are usually secretaries and on the computer, while we gentlemen do most of the physical labor required in our department. This separation between the sexes is not written by law, nor strictly enforced; men in our department are just stronger than women, and woman indeed do more than just sitting in front of a computer and answering calls, but that\u2019s rare and when it happens its not intensive. Heck, sometimes they ask me just to lift a box from the floor to their tables. Feels good.Again with the physical aspect: exercising feels very good when one is not tired or exhausted, and of course when there is motivation. My physical exercise is mostly composed of taking long walks and lifting weights. Both aspects make me feel manly. Sometimes when I walk long enough I have a militant feeling, marching like the soldier I\u2019ll likely never be; when I done lifting weights I feel not only stronger but satisfied, like returning from a hunt.Although I was a vegetarian a few years, I am now a full-time carnivore. From my experience there is a difference between eating meat and eating anything that is not meat, in terms of masculinity. Sometimes when I eat a meal with meat in it, it feels like a male ancestor is calling from my genes, an ancestor that was a predator. Even though some may see it as unethical, eating meat brings not only satiation but a manly-like pleasure, like when (WARNING) ripping the part of the animal to pieces by mouth, especially parts in chicken organs, from parts of wings to parts of chest. It feels bolding and pride-filling from what I see as originated not only from gender but from evolution as well.I am confident with my physique, especially since I\u2019ve begun training seriously few years ago. My belly may slip a little (I am a very hungry individual), but overall I am tall and thick and I like it very much. When I was younger I walked with shirts that have long-sleeves because I disliked my arms, but nowadays they are wider and I prefer walking with short-sleeved shirts.My voice is very deep. Expressing myself through voice brings me satisfaction and self-assurance. Others may probably hear my voice in a more deep tone than I do, because of the auditory differences people have between those who hear and those who speak.Endurance, as I see it, is a very important part in masculinity, because endurance brings strength, and strength brings development and progression. Seeing horrors on television and computer (not necessarily fictional horrors), as well as reading such from books, usually makes me apathetic. When I see on T.V someone shooting themselves in the head, I feel nothing. When I watch videos of various Silent Hill games (my currently favorite horror franchise), I feel nothing. When I watch emotional and heart-touching moments, I feel nothing. When I see a dead bird or cat while walking across the city, I feel nothing. If I would experience said content as a child I would probably be horrified, but today I most of the time feels nothing. Feeling nothing feels good, feels manly.Anything sexually-related can make a male feels more manly, even with simply thinking sexual oriented-thoughts and nothing more.Full honesty right now - I am sometimes disgusted by femininity, which is, as I see it, a masculine feature. intensive sentimental expressions, feminine beautifications, specific tones of speech, music that is intense with romantic behavior, stereotypical gay behavior- they all disgust me and make me want to keep myself away from them. While I am sensitive myself, I had enough with sentimental behavior.Watching (and, rarely, playing) manly video games - racing games such as Destruction Derby and Need for Speed, fighting games like Tekken, shooting games like Doom and (the original) Battlefront II, RPG games like LISA: The Painful (basically where most if not all characters are male) - they can all potentially install a feeling of manliness. Simply watching them intensively could probably be sufficient to feel manly. To hell with every childish video games with childish video game characters. I was contemplating about this question when I seen it at work on my phone, and I would attempt to write, this time, a book about masculinity from a personal experience. Please, everyone, infer me to questions about masculinity if you\u2019d like to read more from me this following period. I shall probably answer for some time mostly male-related questions, if not entirely. Your help would be appreciated. Thanks to Vadim Abdrakhmanov for requesting my opinions. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: Thanks! I think I'll leave my personal opinion out of this, and instead leave you with list of what a very bright guy thought a human being, male or female, should be able to do. A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.-Robert A. Heinlein That statement doesn't fit with cultural stereotypes of \"manhood\" or \"maleness\" and that's precisely why I chose to answer the way I did. Each culture possesses it's own standard of conduct, appearance and mandated actions which are required by that culture to qualify as \"being a man.\" Since any answer can only reflect either my own opinion, or that of the culture I was raised in and of which I might have been unable to dis-indoctrinate myself in spite of my illusions of having done so, no answer I, or anyone, could give would be of universal value. What makes a man a man, in my view, is one that doesn't overly concern himself with what others might think of him, whether that's about his manhood or any other aspect of his being. Being true to one's self, being honest in his dealings, treating others as he would have them treat him and being a true and faithful friend are top factors in my book of manhood, but that's just me.
