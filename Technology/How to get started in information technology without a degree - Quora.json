            "answer_text": "There are a couple of options depending on what part of information technology interests you Computer programming. Start by learning to program. Pick an easy to use and popular language like python. Java, Go, Kotlin, or Swift are good to learn if you want to program for a mobile device but the learning curve is steeper for those languages. Look at Youtube videos for tutorials. Most languages have tutorial web sites available as well. Once you\u2019ve got the basics down and can do the sample programs without having to look at the answers, find some open source projects that seems interesting to you and start contributing. Keep your work and start building a portfolio that you can show to possible employers.System administration. Start by learning to administer your own computers. Add software, tweak settings to try and optimize performance, set up a user directory, apply and revert patches, set up a network. Once you\u2019re comfortable with system admin type of tasks, see if there is an organization that needs some free help with managing their computers. This might be a church or non-profit. As you get better known at helping people with system admin, you\u2019ll develop a bunch of references that you can show employers. If you can afford it, take (and pass) a couple of credential exams for either Windows Server or Linux or if you like networking, Cisco routers. Credentials will help you get past HR because it allows them to check a box.Expect to spend a fair amount of time learning and doing free projects as you improve your skills. If you\u2019re good with people as well, you might be able to start charging sooner rather than later. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently doing online course on Google IT Support Certification on Coursera. According to Coursera \"This program is designed to prepare you for an entry-level role in IT Support, whether that\u2019s doing in-person or remote work, at a small company or a large enterprise organization. Upon completion of the certificate, you will have the option to share your information with top employers hiring entry-level IT professionals, like Cognizant, GE Digital, H&R Block, Hulu, JM Smucker, Infosys, Intel, KForce, MCPc, PNC Bank, RICOH USA, Sprint, TEKSystems, UPMC, Veterans United Home Loans, Walmart and their companies: Allswell, Bonobos, Hayneedle, Jet, Modcloth, Moosejaw, Sam\u2019s Club, Shoes. com Store No. 8, Vudu and of course, Google.\" Also I am taking another course on Udemy by Mike Myers for the CompTIA A+ Exam. But with all that I feel like I needed more so I will be starting college in January to get a AS for IT Technician. Quick Note: If you are in the united states (I'm in California so I'm not sure about other states) you can check your local college, if you have never been to college some of them offer a two year free program provide that you meet the requirements at the end of your studies.
