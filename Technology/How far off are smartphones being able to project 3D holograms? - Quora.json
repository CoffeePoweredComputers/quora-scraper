            "answer_text": "Probably never As far off as it\u2019s possible to be; as depicted in popular movies this is an imaginary effect. You\u2019re looking at a prerendered special effect, \u201ccomposited\u201d in post processing, or a live effect using \u201cPepper\u2019s Ghost.\u201d  Basically, the hologram shows up on a wedge of glass between you and the stage. Pepper's ghost - Wikipedia Now, I know that\u2019s not what you mean. What you mean is a 3D image floating in space, that you can walk around and look at; something like this in real life:  How Star Wars: The Last Jedi Brought Back The Princess Leia Hologram There are some cell phone screens that come close to the above:  It\u2019s not the same thing as a glowing Leia however. I think it\u2019s cool too. However, the sad news is that it\u2019s almost unimaginably difficult. Real holograms are amazing, but they don\u2019t really float in air, nor do they project out from the surface much. They do look like a neat \u2018window\u2019 into something. They really have to be seen to be believed. 3D without glasses; real stereoscopic depth. The only way to project light in mid air from a hand held device, would be to somehow be able to transport energy from the hand held device to mid air, and have that energy spread in all directions. Like a laser, but capable of putting little light \u201cbombs\u201d in mid air. Beaming the energy invisibly, and then at the exact right spot (voxel or pixel) having it \u2018glow\u2019. In other words, a light bomb. A \u201cphoton torpedo\u201d although that\u2019s not what Star Trek meant. I can\u2019t think of a possible way to do that. Now - the good news is, it may not be necessary. You CAN hold up your phone, and on the phone surface, see something that absolutely looks 3D (Augmented Reality).  Virtual, augmented reality may hold key to future Air Force training There are glasses that you can wear, and when you look around, you see 3D images firmly rooted and seeming to \u2018exist\u2019 where you look.  HoloLens\uff08\u30db\u30ed\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\uff09\u958b\u767a\u306f\uff2f\uff2e\uff25\uff34\uff25\uff23\uff28 | \u30d9\u30c8\u30ca\u30e0\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30d5\u30b7\u30e7\u30a2\u958b\u767a (No idea what it says, but the picture is great, and it was marked for reuse; I believe in attribution!) THIS is the reality. Soon we\u2019ll have glasses like the Google Glass, but better, like the above, but not quite so large (which is really difficult to do, due to physics), and AR will be pretty common. You or I may not see the same \u2018hologram\u2019 at the same time, but we easily could. This will come, probably sooner than you\u2019d think. So in a way a phone can project 3D objects in the world. You just have to look into it, to see Wonderland. ",

            "answer_text": "A handheld device has the limitation that the optics of any image that appears in space requires a controlled image surface large enough to appear behind the apparent image. My answer to How long until our TV and computer monitors are creating three dimensional holograms that look real reports a technique that IMHO offers hope that live hologram projection is possible in the long term.  Today, the technique produces a limited range of pixels for a single still picture. Advancing computer technology could conceivably reach the levels of bandwidth and processing speed to match current TV picture quality and frame rates. Extrapolating Moore's Law the earliest time frame would be twenty years. Advancing the technology further to allow the controlled image source to be smaller than a wall sized screen would be impossible. The alternative, Sunglasses converted to a heads up display mode could readily be adapted to allow superimposed virtual reality where Princess Leia appears to be in the room talking to you could easily be developed within the next ten years.
