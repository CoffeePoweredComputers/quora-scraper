            "answer_text": "Though not milk, Pigeon's Milk is also known as Crop Milk, which is produced in the crop of birds like Pigeons, Doves and Flamingos. The interesting thing to note is that the milk is produced by both parents and the production starts a couple of days before the eggs hatch. It is a thick fluid rich in proteins and fat and like the colostrum of mammals, contains a  lot of antibodies. The parents usually feed them only this through the first week to 10 days after which they mix seeds and other stuff which is partially digested in the crop along with the milk for the next couple of weeks from where they graduate to regular food. edit: just read - penguins too produce crop milk. However in their case only the males lactate. ",
