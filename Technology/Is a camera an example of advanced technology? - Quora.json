            "answer_text": "Digital cameras are very high technology devices.  As an example, consider the ESP32-CAM shown above next to a quarter. I bought this particular one new for $6. This is a stand-alone camera module designed to be used in internet-of-things camera applications. The camera it contains is the OV2640, which uses a 2MP color CMOS sensor \u2014 and the first CMOS image sensor was created by Eric Fossum in 1995. Of course, digital cameras are computers, and the ESP32 includes a dual-core 32-bit processor, several MB of RAM, support for microSD mass storage, and other facilities that compete favorably with desktop PCs from 20\u201325 years ago and would have classed as a supercomputer in the 1980s. The camera also includes software that recognizes and identifies faces of individuals you tell it to learn, and that level of machine learning wasn\u2019t a robust technology until the last couple of decades. It also includes wifi and Bluetooth wireless networking, and the basic principles of spread spectrum communication used by both are less than a century old. Even the little high-brightness white LED (the yellow circle in the lower right corner) is technology that simply didn\u2019t exist until the last couple of decades. I know you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s all just about the electronics, and that is largely true. The last 100 years have been dominated by advances in electrical and computer engineering. However, even the tiny lens assembly is a marvel of precision manufacturing and the plastics used for the camera housing and connector shells, and the material used to make the circuit board, are things that didn\u2019t exist a century ago. So, although the basic concept of a camera is millennia old, and lenses and photochemical processes are not particularly recent inventions, a device like the ESP32-CAM would have been nearly unimaginable science fiction a century ago. In fact, the ESP32-CAM isn\u2019t normally used to take photographs, but as an intelligent controller that can make things happen based on what it sees\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "A camera is a good example of what is actually, a very simple technological concept that has become increasingly advanced. A camera is, at is it\u2019s simplest, a light-tight box. I have a friend who makes pinhole cameras. He using things like biscuit tins. I myself have made a couple of pinhole lenses. The bottom line is this. Yes, digital technology is very useful. However, it is not the only way in which to pursue photography. ",
