            "answer_text": "In the US and any country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention on copyright, a creator of a site has the copyright to materials they create. You can't use that stuff without their permission.  If they don't own the copyright, you need permission from the original copyright owner. Some things are in the public domain  For example the works of Shakespeare, simply because he's been dead so long and didn't have Sonny Bono as a US House Rep (see \"Micky Mouse Copyright\").   Other things are in the public domain because the creator said so.   Things are NOT in the public domain simply because they're on a public website.  You can NOT lose copyright (unlike a trademark which you can lose w/o protecting it.)  However, you can give it up.  Or grant limited licenses for others to use items. So, when in doubt, ask permission. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Unless the content is specifically provided under a free to use licence of some sort, the content legally belongs to the people who made it, or whoever they signed it over to. Just because it's available on the Internet does not mean that intellectual property legislation does not apply. Like - you could copy a personal photo off Facebook. That is not a difficult thing to do. But just because it is possible, it is not legally ok to put that photo on your own Web site without explicit consent. You might not get caught, and if caught you might not be sued, but it still would not be legal. ",
