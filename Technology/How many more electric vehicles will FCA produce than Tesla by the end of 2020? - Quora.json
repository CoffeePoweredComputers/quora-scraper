            "answer_text": "The question is asking whether Fiat/Chrysler will be producing more electric cars than Tesla by the end of 2020. Tesla claims they will be producing electric cars at a rate equating to half million per year by the end of 2019. I haven\u2019t seen their projection for the end of 2020, but I imagine they might well be doing many more than that by then. In part that would be because the gigafactory in China should have come on line by then. Fiat/Chrysler \u2026 the Chairman of Fiat has been complaining bitterly about being forced to produce electric cars, and begging the customers to not buy them because Fiat is unable to make money with EV\u2019s. Before Chrysler joined with Fiat, they had a credible plan for producing several electric cars. Those plans vaporized never to be seen again. Fiat 500e owners that I\u2019ve talked to love their cars, and I\u2019ve driven one briefly and thought it was a very fun little car. If it had had fast charging I might have gotten one but since it didn\u2019t I didn\u2019t. But in no possible universe will Fiat be producing any more than a drop in the bucket compared to Tesla\u2019s production. ",
