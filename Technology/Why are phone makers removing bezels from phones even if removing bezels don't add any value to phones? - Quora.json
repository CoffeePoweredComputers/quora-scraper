            "answer_text": "It does help a lot. For one, it gives the smartphone a pleasant appearance, improves aesthetics and makes the phone attractive. Second, it helps in cost cutting, so that phone companies can make an increased amount of profit. Third, they're able to stick a bigger screen onto a smaller body, which is a bit involved with the cost cutting part. However, I do feel that phone manufacturers are going a bit too far by removing all the bezels in the smartphone. Doing this makes gaming too hard, and moreover the OS must be adapted to the new screen ratio making the development process a bit harder. ",

            "answer_text": "I look forward to smartphones with no or minimum bezels. It's the future. Minimized bezels make the phone look more premium and amazing. It also has a few advantages, you can have a bigger screen without having to increase the dimensions of phone and since it would be without that big upper and lower chin, it looks sleeker and provides an immersive experience while watching videos. You don't have to scroll much because the webpages are taller. Gaming experience is improved. You don't have to worry about your phone with a 6 inch screen not fitting in your pocket because it has almost no bezels and is just as tall as your current smartphone with a bigger screen and no chin. Overall, it provides a new and fun user experience. ",
