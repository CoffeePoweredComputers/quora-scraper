            "answer_text": "No, not in the foreseeable future at least. This is PC gaming:  And this is console gaming:  Which is better, a PC or a console? A PC, no doubt. It has more power and versatility. Anything you can play on a console, you can play on a PC at least just as well (apart from some console-exclusive games), while many games and entire genres are very uncomfortable or downright impossible to play on a console. Besides, most people own a PC for serious, non-gaming purposes anyway, so why bother buying a separate machine just for gaming? Because that\u2019s not the point. The question here is not what you play. The question is where, when, why and how you play. A lot of people play mobile games. Why? Mobile games are simplistic to the point of boring. They\u2019re good for burning five minutes of your life, not much else. Why would you play Candy Crush, when you can play Civilization VI instead? Because you play mobile games when you can\u2019t play PC games. They\u2019re meant to help you pass the time when you\u2019re sitting away from home and waiting for something, like the bus, the class to start, or your spouse from a shoe store. And they do that perfectly. They\u2019re very good at filling their niche.  Ignoring the actual game, what happens, when you play on a computer? You might have a separate study/work room where the computer is, or at least it\u2019s placed in a quiet corner, so that you can concentrate on your work without anything or anyone breaking your flow. When you sit in front of the PC to play, it\u2019s time to play. You can sit there for several hours with your back turned to the center of the room and the rest of your family. You don\u2019t look over your shoulders or say a single word to anyone, except maybe your teammates on Discord. You further isolate yourself by putting on headphones and dimming the lights. When you sit at a computer, your mindset subconsciously switches to work mode. You\u2019re there to finish tasks and get jobs done, even if those tasks and jobs are to have fun and relax. Figuring out complex mechanics is not a chore, it\u2019s a part of the fun. Reading several pages\u2019 worth of text dialogue doesn\u2019t subtract from the fun, because you want to be immersed in the lore of the game universe. PC gaming has taken its place as a serious and goal-oriented pastime. Console gaming is the opposite of that. You go to the living room, turn on the TV and the console, get comfortable on the sofa, and start having some mindless and action-oriented fun. Your family is there talking with you and maybe even playing with you. They can even watch your play just like watching TV. Everyone can see and hear you. You don\u2019t shut anyone out, you bring them all in (whether they like it or not). Sitting quietly reading text or planning your next move doesn\u2019t mix well with this kind of gameplay, action is better. Console gaming is increasingly taking its place as a casual and socially oriented pastime. As you can see from the pictures I posted, goal-oriented activities and socially oriented activities have existed in human behavior for thousands of years without competing with each other. Original question: \u201cDo you think gaming consoles will disappear in the future?\u201c Eventually, certainly. But it won\u2019t happen because some other gaming platform is better. It will happen when people invent a new, even more entertaining and immersive way to have fun with their friends and family in their living rooms. I don\u2019t see that happening very soon. On the contrary, console gaming can only be expected to rise in popularity, as parents start accepting that games are not just for kids anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. Once technology catches up and makes it possible to stream video without noticeable lag, consoles will be a thing of the past. I\u2019m sure most of the major manufacturers are fearing this eventual day and probably doing anything they can to slow the process\u2026 Regardless, there will be a disruption on the horizon that will offer a service where you\u2019ll be able to play whatever you want, where ever you are with a cell phone connection and minimal lag and no hardware purchase needed. Hardware costs are a huge drain on console creators. You have to spend all that time designing a new(ish) console that is already outdated by the time it\u2019s actually produced. Then they have to wrangle game studios into making games for the platform. This all costs huge amounts of revenue, usually at a loss I might add. Sony PlayStation 2 comes to mind, where Sony was basically giving away the platform, hoping to recoup the money on software purchases. It worked for them for a while, but it goes to show how far they have to go to turn a profit on hardware. Noticeably, Hardware updates/re-imagines itself with a pretty steady timeline, meaning by the time a console is reaching it\u2019s prime, it\u2019s already 3 to 5 generations behind in GPU power. Unless console makes adopt a more PC geared platform, where you can update your GPU/Mobo/Memory whenever you\u2019d like, there will always be issues with sealed consoles. Once one of the big 3 buys up or agrees to work with the company with the disrupting tech, they might embrace it and it grow from there, but honestly, I don\u2019t see that happening. They all have vested interests in keeping this cycle going for as long as possible to bilk the public into buying into their specific eco-system. Nintendo (All that 1980\u2019s money) is about the only company that comes to mind that could keep a steady course with console\u2019s and last the longest, but even Nintendo would have to see the profit to be made if someone offers them a platform to sell their software where it\u2019s mutually beneficial.. Mario Run and Pokemon Go are perfect examples. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt that will happen. Being a PC gamer most of my life, I have never been too much a fan of consoles. However, with many PC games becoming more console-like in operation, and even one of the main bragging rights of the PC - the First Person Shooter - getting proper console versions, I do not see the console leaving us any time (soon, at least). The only bastion for PC gaming seems to be RTS - I\u2019ve tried it on console, and it sucked. However, with controllers getting more advanced (is there a multi-function programmable controller out already? If not, I believe there will be one soon\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s called the Steam controller)\u2026 well, I do not want it, but I could rather foresee PC gaming going the way of the Dodo and consoles taking over. I also foresee that in time, the GPU will be an add-on to the CPU itself, not the motherboard; and the sound card going completely external (much like the Creative Extigy started it). It might even be that there will be no more graphics CARDS sold, but graphics UNITS: and external unit connected to the computer, that does the graphics processing. Much like the external graphics card mount that Mac users have. In fact, I foresee the PC to, in time, become a modular console: instead of cards added to the inside on a singular motherboard, the mobo itself will be basically just the CPU and RAM connectors, and all else connect to it on the outside. Mac Mini, anyone? Raspberry Pi? You can already put an entire computer on a board roughly the size of a credit card - only the quest for more condensed pixels, keeps the motherboard alive. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you ever wonder how gaming consoles came into existence? Initially, when games were invented, they used to play on CPUs. But due to heating, the CPU was not able to process these games which are how gaming consoles were invented.  Image Source: COGConnected Gaming consoles provided better pixel computation and reduced heating. That was the birth of gaming consoles. However, nowadays gaming consoles is not a necessity to play good quality games. Most people would rather play games on their phones or laptops rather than invest in a separate console only for gaming. In the current age, smart phones are embedded with advanced features to support online gaming. Even though gaming consoles are also getting advanced and better with time, the factor of heating up still remains a problem. Gaming consoles heat up when continuously fed with a lot of data and eventually damages the console. However in the future, with advancing technology, the problem of heating up will be solved with AI technology. However, nowadays, many gaming enthusiasts are sticking to online games on their laptops and computers. There are laptops specialized only for gaming. Gaming console companies like Xbox are creating versions of their games that can be played on laptops and phones. Play Station has created its PlayStation Now that\u2019s allows players to stream PlayStation games on their phones and laptops. Personally, I do believe that gaming consoles are on their slow route to retirement. ",

PC gaming has come on in leaps and bounds since the PS2\u2019s heyday, and it\u2019s also much more accessible price-wise. Consoles can\u2019t just get by on the fact that they\u2019re powerful and game-orientated at a low price point nowadays, they need to offer more. The Wii went down a storm because despite not being at all powerful, the wireless interactive controller was innovative.  In my opinion, sales of the next generation consoles will decide their fate. It looks to me as if the overall sales trend is on the verge of tipping down into a slippery slope. If the PS5 and/or Series X come up with the goods, they might be able to buck this for a generation or two. We\u2019ll see. ",

The industry has already made great strides to normalize the platform to simplify work for developers. XBOX now has the XBOX One X, which is analogous to the high end gamer PC. Also no, people will prefer the simplicity of having a gaming system (at lower cost) and laptops (for light computer work). Gaming is also moving toward a remote access model. The game content is streamed to your screen. We can expect as technology improves, this will be possible over the internet, and then the industry will shift to cloud services for video gaming. Consoles would then be simple way to connect your controller to your TV and to the cloud. There will always be a need for this service. EDIT: I just had the thought that TV\u2019s already have internet. Perhaps we\u2019ll skip the console and go directly to cloud gaming via Smart TV. ",

I mean, I had a lot of fun online with the Xbox 360, but now I got a gaming PC I regret not having done it earlier for a bunch of reasons, mostly being able to play older games like Half-Life or GTA San Andreas on Steam whenever I want, without Microsucks' bullshit backwards compatibility policies. But on the other hand, I think consoles are still going to be a thing for a while, mostly because their existence stabilizes a common ground for hardware specs, giving developers a much easier time deciding how heavy can their game be hardware-wise to be accessible to the general public. Consoles even help PC hardware not to rise in power too fast, making building a gaming PC less of a bet on how long will your hardware last until you have to upgrade. ",

I don't think phones or tablets will ever give a gamer the gaming experience that a console can. I would never want to play games like Skyrim, CS:GO, Battlefield 1, or other games like those on a small screen. And although the Nintendo Switch is a tablet, it still has a dock for playing on your TV, because Nintendo knows that no one wants to play BF1 on that small screen. It also lacks the power to run some games to their full potential. Maybe one day phones and tablets will be able to run games in 4k, with no frame rate issues, and have good controllers, but I will still like to play on a larger TV. I will still like to look at my book case full of games. And I will still like to see my gaming setup, complete with consoles and a PC. ",

In the future I see everyone having a single device that performs the functions of gaming, work and communication wherever they want. Currently this is not very functional because to get the portability of a laptop or mobile phone you need to cut on computing power. But once you can have all the performance you need in the size of something like a phone, larger devices like gaming consoles and desktop PCs will no longer be required by the average consumer. ",

The second reason would be that most consoles are cheaper and have more exclusive games then a gaming PC has. And the third reason is: They are also gaming PC\u2019s as well! That means as computer hardware improves, so will consoles. So all in all console gaming will more and likely never die out and remain a staple in most homes ether as a DVD player or just a computer in genral. ",

Also, buying a PC is a mixed bag - Quite often you need to know about PC\u2019s or you will be sold a POS for \u00a31000 that has a shitty GPU/PSU inside and will barely run games. Building a PC is great fun and learning but again - people don\u2019t want to deal with that. Consoles are for most people, easy. Buy it, turn it on and it\u2019ll work for 5\u20136 years.

Secondly, home consoles are way easier to setup than PCs and much cheaper for the same quality of gameplay since console games are much more optimized than PC games are. No driver issues, No random crashes etc that you often find on the PC. Thirdly, Nintendo will never license their games to a different platform. It took them decades to make Super Mario Go appear for mobile phones. Good luck getting them to bring their games to PC. ",

So it is very difficult to tell if this is the end of console era or no , but while such giants of console gaming industry as Sony and Microsoft will be on the gaming field there will be a long lasting battle between them.
