            "answer_text": "I believe it truly depends upon the decision you are trying to make. But as a general rule: The heart makes decisions that the brain has to correct. The brain makes decisions the heart has to accept. In other words, your brain is far more qualified to make decisions than your heart. Emotions are overpowering for most people. Some emotions can persuade you in a direction that had you not had this emotion in the first place, you would not have made the same decision. Because of this, it is better to let your brain do the thinking. Let me give you an example and this one may be a bit difficult for some, but is a good illustration: Let\u2019s say you want a baby very badly and so you and your spouse set out to get pregnant. After many months of trying, you finally succeed. However, bad news soon follows your elation. There is something wrong with the birth and the doctor suggests you abort or either one or both may not live through it. Because you wanted the baby so badly and because you went through so much to get where you are, you decide to press forward despite the doctor's warnings. In the end, you have to choose between your life or the baby\u2019s and you both lose out leaving your partner to deal with two losses instead of one. Had you actually THOUGHT about it and weighed the options\u2014using critical thinking skills\u2014it is likely only one loss would have been suffered. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has given nice answers so far, but since no one has yet addressed the *scientific* aspects driving decision-making, I feel (yes, feel) the need to throw in some findings in neuroscience, which may surprise you!  First off, we're nowhere near as rational as we think are, like User pointed out mentioning 'cognitive biases.'  (I would recommend reading social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's book 'The Righteous Mind': Drawing on his twenty-five years of groundbreaking research on moral psychology, he shows how moral judgments arise not from reason but from gut feelings.[1]) While emotions overwhelmingly drive behavior, it is misguided to believe that thinking and feeling are somehow mutually exclusive. Emotion and logic are intertwined.  When our emotional desires begin to shift... we align our reasons to be consistent with that intention. Our critical mind is always looking for evidence to support our beliefs. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the belief, and the greater the tendency is to seek out supporting evidence. We are not rational. We are rationalizers.[2] And especially when there *is* no rational way to make a decision -- say, an arbitrary decision, when all else (such as cost) is equal -- like choosing turkey or chicken for dinner -- you actually *require* emotion (or irrationality/bias) to arrive at a conclusion.  Take famed neurologist Ant\u00f3nio Dam\u00e1sio's most well-known patient, for example -- Elliott, a man in the 97th percentile for IQ -- whose life began to fall apart after a tumor was excised from the part of his brain that generated emotions.  Formerly a successful businessman, model father and husband, Elliott suffered from ventromedial frontal lobe damage. After his operation, he lacked all motivation. \u201c[He] was unable to decide properly, especially when the decision involved personal or social matters.\u201d Even small decisions were fraught with endless deliberation: making an appointment took 30 minutes, choosing where to eat lunch took all afternoon, even deciding which color pen to use to fill out office forms was a chore.  Turns out Elliott\u2019s lack of emotion paralyzed his decision-making.[3] You might think that your emotions factor in little to your decisions, but nothing could be further from the truth!  \u201cThe human brain (the \u201crational\u201d brain) is like a computer operating systems rushed to market with only 200,000 years of field testing\u2026it has lots of design flaws and bugs. The emotional brain, however, has been exquisitely refined by evolution over the last several hundred million years. Its software code has been subjected to endless tests, so it can make fast decisions based on very little information.\u201d [3] Our brains evolved things like risk-aversion to help us survive, and similarly  memory consolidation developed so we could learn from our mistakes -- both examples that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a major role in: emotional attachments (such as fear, regret, guilt, loss) to those negative experiences influence our decisions and behavior when we assess options, so the typical neurotypical response to the threat of repeating a negative experience is one of 'playing it safe.' Participants with \u201cnormal emotion processing\u201d were engaged in a card-drawing task. When drawing from \u201cdangerous decks\" and consequently experiencing losses and the associated negative emotions, they subsequently made safer and more lucrative choices. Participants with brain damage that had left them unable to experience such emotional responses, did not change their behavior in this way. [Bechara, A.R., Damasio, H., Damasio, A., & Lee, G.P. (1999). Different contributions of the human amygdala ventromedial prefrontal cortex to decision-making. The Journal of Neuroscience, 19(13), 5473-5481.] Your emotional state is encoded into the memories you form, and stronger emotions create stronger memories: negative ones even stronger than positive ones.  The emotions felt in a particular situation will be recorded in the emotional memory and can be activated when the person faces a similar situation or has to make a difficult decision in a short period of time. Often the decision maker is unaware of previous experiences in similar situations.[4] Having that emotional attachment creates an instinctive and instant \"gut\" reaction that our brain developed as a safeguard when encountering something dangerous, for example, when you don't have the time to logically break down the scenario and need to move fast. Affect programs for fear and disgust trigger immediate avoidance responses. [5]  [img src = 5] \u201cToday this idea [that emotion assists the reasoning process] does not cause any raised eyebrows. However, while this idea may not raise any eyebrows today  among neuroscientists, I believe it\u2019s still a surprise to the general public.  We\u2019re trained to regard emotions as irrational impulses that are likely to lead us astray.  When we describe someone as 'emotional,' it\u2019s usually a criticism that suggests that they lack good judgment.\u201d -Ant\u00f3nio Dam\u00e1sio [3] But clearly, without some form of emotion, we wouldn't be able to make any judgments at all.
