            "answer_text": "There are a lot of great replies to this query already. I don't want to repeat much of the great advice already provided. But I would like to add one additional note of value that a modern HR software provider can offer a small business: an improved employee experience while increasing the productivity of your HR administrator. The reality in many small businesses is that the people (or person) responsible for important functions -- i.e. payroll, scheduling, managing PTO requests, employee training, investigating benefits, etc. -- are often overwhelmed so much by the daily tasks they can't focus on the strategic initiatives that lead to an improved employee experience. Consider this scenario: You're the owner/CEO of a small business serving other businesses. You are either still handling the majority of HR functions yourself, or you have one or two people managing that aspect of the business among other duties. You need to ensure all employees in the field complete required federal, state or industry standard training to ensure compliance. At your current growth and retention rates, you or your \"HR managers\" are struggling to ensure compliance because finding skilled labor is a priority and a difficult one, you're buried in PTO requests and enrolling the new employees in their benefits, time cards are still manual... The list can go on and on. This is a common scenario. And for small business, in particular, hiring and retention is a massive challenge. If you look at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics data on hiring and turnover, turnover nearly matches hiring. So it's no wonder that small business owners report that the top challenge they face is \"hiring qualified staff and retaining them.\" This is where HR software can actually play an important role. As many others have noted you, modern HR software simplifies many of the tasks that slow down small business owners or HR staff from investing in areas that improve the employee experience and meet growth goals -- functions such as training, rolling out competitive benefits or perks, speeding up the onboarding cycle, etc. The HR software should also directly improve the employee experience by making the functions not directly tied to their work (benefits enrollment, employee onboarding, PTO requests, etc.) faster, easier and less of a distraction. The best employees, the one that makes your company grow and add value daily, don't want to be pulled away from their core work any more than the business owner. But if your process for getting employee records involves dozens of paper records spread out in folders or emails, or asking for a day off involves a trip to a back office and the hopes that a paper slip will get properly filed, then it's easy for them to be unnecessarily pulled away from where the real work happens. From my experience working with hundreds of small business owners, these are the requirements for HR software you should expect: Remote access and mobility: The employee (and business owner) should be able to access core functions and documentation directly from an app. Many employees may rarely travel to the office, and those who do may still need to access functions from home or elsewhere. The HR software should support this mobility by making documentation such as an employee handbook, PTO balance and holidays, FSA balances, etc. available via a mobile app.Self-driven onboarding: The back and forth over small details between the business owner or HR staff and a new employee should be reduced through the use of HR software. Strong vendors in the space will empower the company to set-up a self-onboarding cycle where important employee records, documentation, and even benefit enrollment can be completed by the employee with minimal or no back-and-forth with the HR team. This not only saves time and manual work, but the employee is also able to more quickly contribute to the company's growth and services.Payroll and HR software are connected: Many businesses lose valuable time manually entering data from one system into another. Worse yet, mistakes can be costly from a compliance standard. The best HR software now includes both affordable core HR functions and payroll in one platform. This means from the employee records captured through self-onboarding will be fed directly into the payroll system.HR expertise and services: The truth is no HR software automate every aspect of understanding important trends or compliance issues. Ask any vendor you consider whether they provide services outside the software. For instance, if you're in New York and now need to comply with recently enacted sexual harassment training legislation, and you don't know to get started, you should be able to access services with experts who can walk you through the details and provide advice. At a minimum, they should offer compliance tools to keep you up-to-date. Nothing slows growth like a letter from a county commissioner or compliance officer.Bottom line: HR software can and should contribute to your growth goals by eliminating distractions that deter from the employee experience. In the current small business climate, the company's that are able to grow will be those who are able to find and keep the best talent. And those will be the employers who are as obsessed with the employee experience as they are with the customer experience. ",
