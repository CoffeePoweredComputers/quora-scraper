            "answer_text": "So... I've been building and helping to build Internet service providers since the early 1980s (I'm going to count CSNET, along with SesquiNet, SCCSI, InfoHighway, Genuity, Enron Broadband, and the various CVC portfolio companies and others where I was more of an advisor). They all had one thing in common: bandwidth costs money. These days, that can be modified to \"bandwidth costs real money, and lots of it\". Sure, you get more bits per dollar spent, but it's gotten more expensive for each incremental step. Lots more expensive. So, yeah, there HAS to be some sort of limit on how much bandwidth you can consume, OR there has to be some sort of metered usage put in place. Otherwise, being a carrier is not a sustainable business model. The problem with the wireless business model - something called \"broken bucket\" (or \"wasted coupon\" in some cases) is that it's unfair. Works like this. The plan says \"unlimited\" but there's a little disclaimer that says something like \"after X GB, your speeds will be throttled to the point that you either buy more or give up and don't use it\" (more or less). Why? You get sold bandwidth in buckets - say $20 for 2GB. It's built into your baseline service, that \"unlimited\" thing. For some people, they blow through that, and get to buy more bandwidth at say $10 per 1GB. Or they get throttled. For others, they never touch the limit - maybe a few MB of download. So the carrier makes serious bank off every user that doesn't fill their bucket (hence the \"broken bucket\" name), but still also makes money off every user that goes into \"extra bandwidth, please\" territory. That's much, much harder in wire-line business, like cable companies. Because bandwidth is sold in maximum instantaneous speeds, not in aggregate capacity, but the back-end costs for Internet transit are all priced in total GB sent, not the speed at which it happened. And from the money they make net on what they charge you for the bandwidth versus what they pay for Internet transit? They have to pay to operate the rest of the business. And that takes boatloads of money. Here's some additional reading on the subject. Do follow the links in the other articles, which will take you to source material.
