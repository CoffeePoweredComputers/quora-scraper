            "answer_text": "IT sector is one of the biggest industry in terms of revenue, professionals hired and technological advancement. You should also know the domains and job-roles which are going to be in demand in coming future. The overall IT and software industry is too big to summarize as one as what should one must know to get a job. So based on various job-roles available I would suggest to opt web development as most of the companies are shifting there focus on web in this internet age. A lot of startups and companies which have their platform on internet has thrived overall as business thus creating a huge demand. Mobile App Development is another field which you may try on as its another job-role which have have enormous demand in this decade and also the coming time. Android is the most used mobile technology and is supposed to require much more developers with advancement going on everyday. Data Science is another field which is supposed to thrive in coming future all over the world. So being a fresher you need to prepare yourself with regard to these technologies. Coding is one of the most sought after skill which is required by most of the companies. So you should learn it and also practice your skill by making portfolio which may showcase your skill to your prospect employers. There are so many options available online to start your learning. But if you are looking to start your career in this particular domain then I would say you can go for below mentioned platforms: e-books and books can be a good way to learn anything new but it would lack the interaction and learning experience.Youtube is also used by many to acquire new skills and learn new things. But the interaction is one-way and there would be no motivation to learn without any benefit.MOOCs like edWisor.com , Udacity , Udemy , etc but you should opt for one where you may learn new skills as well as practice as per industry standard and create something which may actually get one a job which is one thrive for.",

            "answer_text": "There are many entry points: Get a Bachelor (or Masters) in an IT related discipline and get entry level experience (or internship)Entry level experience as in Help Desk, but most will require you to have certifications. Those certifications will include at least one of the the following: CompTIA (A+, Network+, Security+). These are all entry level certs that anyone can earn with enough study time. Go to the CompTIA website for more information.If you can code, and have some type of portfolio to show, try to get a junior developer job. But you will need to show evidence that you can build applications using many of the main languages of today (JAVA, Python, PHP, etc).Without any IT experience, your point of entry will be through a degree and internship, or by getting an entry level Help Desk job which will require certifications (see above) and some of those jobs will require a degree in an IT related field. But either way, without experience, Help Desk is the way to go. Hope this gives a perspective :) ",
