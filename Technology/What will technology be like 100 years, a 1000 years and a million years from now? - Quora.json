            "answer_text": "We may walk many paths as a society, but I\u2019ll try to explain based on channeled information from more advanced societies, and with a bias towards us doing a decent job of evolving. 100 Years: Humans have integrated quantum mechanics into science, breaking the scientific method of truth-finding to be replaced by one that takes consciousness into account. With this information, we are starting to replace all branches of science, particularly chemical science with an understanding that chemical bonds form vibrational planes, and this vibration can also be replicated to create or break chemical bonds, using this tech to destroy cancer and other forms of healing. 1000 Years: Society has come together to realize consciousness is the future of technology. The majority of the planet is starting to share some conscious experiences by tapping into the electromagnetic field of the the Earth. This is the new \u201ctech\u201d of communication. We have cars and personal aircrafts that are integrated into our consciousness, so we can operate them simply by focusing on where we want to go. 1,000,000 Years: We are now a collective consciousness. Technology is completely driven by our consciousness. We are using crystals to focus and communicate, as we have (collectively) learned to vibrate the crystalline structures in a way that information can be better amplified and transferred through the principles of entanglement. If we are even more advanced, we will be able to shift our vibration to teleport to a new place by matching our vibration to that new place, meaning we have become the technology. ",

            "answer_text": "One of two things will happen. (1), we continue to grow exponentially in regards to technology or (2) technology leads to our downfall, thus resetting humanity, or ending it. I'm going to assume option 1. 100 Years: Society will contain many new technologies. If we were to sleep and wake up 100 years from now, there is likely little chance we'd be able to handle the new world as we would probably be technologically, cultural, and linguistically out of date. 1000 Years: Nothing about society would be recognizable after 1000 years. 1000000 Years: We have traveled beyond Earth as Earth has been exploited for all of it's energy and resources. We are now moving onwards to support our expansionist species. Earth will likely remain the home of many, and possibly still serve as an urbanized hub for many, though new world's might be colonized at this point that may be better than Earth. If not, those world's would just be exploited too to serve us back on Earth. ",

Our A.I. technology is nearly perfect and we will have robots that are strong enough to assist us, but not too strong to kill all human. We are on a good way to invent long way space shuttles to send human to Europa (the moon) and look for human. We found thousands of planets we could live on. We still don\u2019t know about intelligent life on those planets and have no possibilities to travel a lightyear long way. 95% of our cars will drive elctrical and life expectancy raised over a hundret years in the USA and Europe. Cancer is preventable and curable in many cases.  3017: At least we are still alive. I hope. Our weapon technology is and was insane and there were many world wars. Which did their best to execute so many people that nobody is afraid of overpopulation at the moment. We have found life in the universe, contacted it, but haven\u2019t had a conversation yet. Transportation is working with magnetic field streets, so our \u201ccars\u201d are kind of \u201cflying\u201d. A few thousand people live on other planets in our solar system like Mars and survive there since years. To travel there is only for rich people, but not a big problem.  1.002.017: *Beeb* The last human left earth in 14318 and I haven\u2019t heared of them since that year. *Beeb* ",
