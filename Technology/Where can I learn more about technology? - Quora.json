Even a genius couldn\u2019t be competent in all aspects of technology, so better to follow what part of technology interests you. In many cases, you might have to settle for knowing the basics of a computer and how to write a computer program in one or two languages, if you want to be equally adept in other technology fields. You might start with how the original phone system works, and the original radios and TVs were designed, but as you get into modern systems, things get complicated very quickly, drawing from fields such as advanced mathematics. You can still understand the basic concepts of the modern systems, so you should understand how IP packets work, how Bluetooth works, etc. ",
