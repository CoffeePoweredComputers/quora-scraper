            "answer_text": "There is no 100% efficient LM7805. It is inherently less than 100%. In your scenario the efficiency could never be better than 50%. The approximate equation for currents is Iin = Iout+Iq Where Iq is the quiescent current of the device at zero load. I haven\u2019t looked it up in years but I think it probably around 5\u201310 mA. There are a number of variants on 78xx series parts so it may different from one to another; I also expect some small differences based on load current. You will find it listed on the spec sheet. Why don\u2019t people ever read them? ",

            "answer_text": "You have two contradictory statements in the question. If you assume 100% efficiency, the incoming power and outgoing power are equal. If you have a linear regulator, the input current equals the output current (+ a quiescent current that is used to pet the device itself, and is directed to the ground pin). Do you, by \u201c100% efficiency\u201d, mean power efficiency (if so, not a linear regulator), or that the quiescent current is zero? (If the latter, you have the answer in the question) ",
