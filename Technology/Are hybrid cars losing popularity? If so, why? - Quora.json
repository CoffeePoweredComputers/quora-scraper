            "answer_text": "I believe hybrid cars are increasing in popularity, since the price differential between gasoline only and hybrid has come down very significantly. Just helped my friend buy a 2020 RAV4 Hybrid. We were shopping for a regular gasoline car, a sub-compact or compact SUV from Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Mazda and VW. Eventually we settled on the RAV4, and then onto the hybrid version\u2014we both thought the hybrid was a lot more expensive and were surprised that the differential was only $800\u2014which is offset by and to be recouped from the higher mileage of 41 versus 25 mpg city, and 38 versus 33 mpg highway. Plus the Hybrid had more HP and torque. It was a no brainer to go for the hybrid, but they were selling so well that we were only able to achieve $2,500 off of MSRP\u2014dealers can\u2019t keep them in stock, so were less willing to deal than with the gasoline versions (except for the higher trim Limited Hybrid at around $40K.) Honda CRV is also coming out in hybrid format in 2020, and so is Ford Escape, to compete with the RAV4 in this hot segment. Of course Toyota and others have other hybrid cars. Thus I would say that hybrid cars are not losing in popularity, but rather gaining in popularity. They offer the best of both worlds\u2014no range restrictions and self-charging. Honda and Ford would not be introducing more hybrids if they did not view the segment as increasing in popularity. Toyota is expanding production of the RAV4 hybrid and introducing a plug-in hybrid in 2021. If I were to be in the market for a car at present, I would go for a hybrid rather than a full electric, to have the most flexibility. The cost differential is compelling, and at least for the RAV4, the battery warranty is 10 years or 150,000 miles. This has come a long way from the initial Prius. ",

            "answer_text": "In Germany things are going to change at the moment. Some years ago, Hybrid was more or less a topic entirely covered by Toyota. The Prius was not very popular in Germany, because it was too strange, too ugly and too foreign for German buyers. Toyota Hybrid sales have been rising in the last years, when Toyota phased out the Diesel and offered most of their other car series with a Hybrid drive train. I drive a Yaris Hybrid, and although it is pretty expensive, more than 50% of all Yaris sold in Germany are Hybrids. The Prius is losing popularity within the Toyota product range, and rumour has it that Toyota will maybe stop selling the Prius in Germany at all. Meanwhile German manufacturers have started to launch Plugin Hybrids (PHEV), which are regarded as electric cars and enjoy tax benefits. These cars have become increasingly popoular amongst corporate car pool operators. A car like the Mercedes C300de is more favourable in terms of tax deductions than a C300D with Diesel engine alone. However, it seems to me that the populairity of these cars fall and rise with their tax status. People who used to buy a Hybrid for environmental reasons, now are looking for pure electric cars. I assume that cars like the VW id.3 or the Opel Corsa E may change something. ",

            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, and due mainly to the increased availability and practicality of electric cars \u2014 tempered by the purchase price of most electrics today. People that buy hybrids tended to be folks that bought sedans or hatchbacks, and are willing to pay a certain premium in exchange for better gas mileage and emissions (though there were a few hybrids designed to put out more power than their gas models with similar mileage). Today, those same people are seeing options for electric cars that have enough range to make them useful, while there are increasing numbers of charging options \u2014 making them a practical alternative. For the most part, the price of practical electric vehicles is still comparatively high, and they really aren\u2019t so practical when you stray too far from the US\u2019 metropolitan areas and a megalopolises (like the coastal northeast and parts of the west coast). I have family in Texas that would love an electric car, but it\u2019s simply not going to work for them as they drive very long distances and the recharge time would be prohibitive. If I were to buy a new car today (and I might be in the market in a year or two), I\u2019d very seriously consider an electric in place of my hybrid. There are some milestones in electric car development that haven\u2019t been hit yet that I\u2019d really like to see before I make the jump, though. I\u2019ll have to see what\u2019s available at the time, but I could go either way. I have no particular fetish for gas, no need for a truck, and live and work in the megalopolis. \u2014 I should add that my children are far less enthusiastic about driving and would prefer to take public transportation, if available. I think the US is seeing a declining interest in cars in general in some parts of the US. A good friend of mine that works in the same city as I do got rid of his car years ago; he comes into the city on commuter rail from about 25 miles away and walks and bikes in his own community. My oldest son has indicated that he\u2019d prefer to live somewhere that didn\u2019t require him to have a car for daily things. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, people who want a gasoline car and don\u2019t care about the environment are unimpressed by hybrid cars or electric cars. People who do care about the environment used to favor hybrids because they pollute far less than gasoline cars (they generally get about twice the MPG). But that was when electric cars were pretty much useless. Now we have electric cars that are not only pretty good - but better than hybrids and even better than gasoline cars (by most measures). So why have hybrids anymore? They still pollute far worse than electric - and have no real advantages for most drivers most of the time. They are obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "Possible. At least plug-in hybrids dropped out of the eligibility for subsidies in some countries, which naturally hampers sales. The reason for this was that too many people didn\u2019t charge them at all and simply drove them on fuel which becomes even less efficient than ordinary ICE cars for the added weight from the battery. Human behaviour is complicated and sometimes people are just too lazy to charge their PHEV for a meagre electric range of some 30 miles or so, this behaviour was also fueled by the fact that PHEVs were often purchased by companies for their sales force but this created a situation where the drivers did not have to pay for their charging/fueling behaviour themselves. Some of the classical hybrids also had the problem of using too much gas. There are cases where car manufacturers put them on the market to lower their fleet CO2 emissions just on paper. They sometimes tried that for big SUVs. What potentially affects both is that some countries/cities removed their special freedoms, like using bus lanes or similar. In a nutshell, hybrids had a tendency to fall short of expectations, at least from lawmakers, so they\u2019re putting the screws on by removing some of the EV grants from hybrids. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if they are losing popularity. Purpose built hybrids I think are. For example Toyota makes just about all their models in hybrid trim. So what\u2019s the purpose of the prius anymore? The costs are coming down in comparison to other models. And the old \u201cwhat happens when you need to change the battery\u201d stuff has been debunked as people are getting million mile hybrids. But it keeps looking like more and more like it is a stopgap technology. Think back to the blackberry. An amazing phone in it\u2019s prime. Instead of trying to send out a text using your numeric keypad on your flip phone you had a miniature physical keyboard. Then came touchscreen keyboards. I remember a story how a media member told Steve Jobs that it wasn\u2019t easy to type on when the first Iphone came out and he kept making typos. And Jobs told him something to the effect of \"Your thumbs will learn.\" And that physical keyboard that Blackberry made while a huge step forward in phone design was that stopgap measure between two different systems. With a hybrid you have all the parts for a gas engine\u2026 and all the parts for an electric one jammed in the same car. It\u2019s a LOT of technology, a lot of moving parts, a lot of wasted space.

The hybrid is a mix of bad [ice] and superb [glass half full/empty] tech, and if you love the environment you go full hog: electric. So having the tainting of the ICE these vehicles will loose out. I always was very charmed by the 2012 FISKER KARMA hybrid. Electric but with range extender. Like a beautiful BMW. I fell in love but then FISKER closed up shop.

            "answer_text": "If they are, it is certainly not because of negative online reviews. High profile auto critics encourage the purchase of the hybrid versions of the Toyota Corolla, Camry and RAV4, as well as the Lexus es300h and the RX450h. Yesterday I was surfing the used auto outlets, looking for another Lexus hybrid. There are virtually no used es300h cars in Canada for sale except in Edmonton. Used RX450s are abundant, but extremely scarce at sensible prices. The only available used Lexus hybrid is the CT series of Prius-powered hatchbacks. They are quite cheap. When I checked the inventory of Lexus dealers I found no new es hybrids on the lots nor any in the used inventory, though a Honda dealer in Quebec had one at an attractive price. Why would there be so few es300h units and comparatively more RX450h SUVs? Maybe it\u2019s because the RX is built locally, in Cambridge, Ontario. Since mid 2019, the es300h is a product of the massive Toyota factory in Georgetown, Kentucky, assembled alongside the Camry and Avalon hybrids, but the older 300h\u2019s were built in Japan.

            "answer_text": "Definitely not in Australia, hybrids are more popular than ever. Here in Oz hybrid sales went up by 114% in year, so more than double, over all categories, private hatch, sedan and SUV as well as non-private, so fleet buyers and so on, all bought more hybrids than ever. As Australia still has a bit of an issue with the electric charging network, as we're a huge country with a small population, EVs are growing very slowly, while hybrids are soaring. And this trend will continue for a while here. It's also a price issue, since all Teslas here are considered luxury vehicles and therefore get the luxury vehicle tax added to the price of the car, making them even more expensive than they already are, and other EVs are just not as good. A Tesla 3 for example costs $15k more in Australia compared to the US. So for now hybrids will see a huge growth, and the biggest loser will be diesels by the looks of it, as well as V8 and big V6 sedans. ",
