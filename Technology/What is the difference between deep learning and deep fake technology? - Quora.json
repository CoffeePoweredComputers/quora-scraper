            "answer_text": "Deep-Learning is a way of Machine Learning. That means that when we have an ML problem we can use a traditional Machine Learning algorithm to solve it like logistic regression classifier for a classification problem but you can solve the same problem using a Neural Network and if you have more than 2 layers than its deep neural network. And in the deep learning set up we always try to estimate the relation between the features and output using a family of functions that includes : DNN(x1,x2,x3,\u2026.)CNN(x1,x2,x3,\u2026.)RNN(x1,x2,x3,\u2026..)And on the other hand the Deep fake is an output of one category of the Deep Learning Models called the Generative Models and in that category the most famous is GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Now It has become so famous that people have started using it as a packaged software. You have tasks like identifying whether the doc/image/video is fake or real. ",
