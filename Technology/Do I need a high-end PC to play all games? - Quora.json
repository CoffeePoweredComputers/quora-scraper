            "answer_text": "Hi. The answer to this is undoubtedly yes. If by \u201call games\u201d you mean \u201cevery game ever made for PC\u201d, then we only have to look up the most resource demanding game and have powerful enough hardware to run that game well. Then, everything else will run all that much better. So, what is the most resource-intensive game today? Definitely Battlefield 1. Here are the minimum system requirements for it, according to systemrequirementslab.com: DirectX 11.0 Compatible video card with 2 GB VRAM (AMD Radeon HD 7850 / nVidia GeForce GTX 660)Core i5 6600K / AMD FX-6350 processor8 GB RAMWhile there will come games in the future which will need more powerful hardware, at present, this is the most powerful hardware necessary to run all current and past games. Please note that some PC games will only work properly on certain operating systems. For example, all newer titles will work great on Windows 7 or higher. However, older games from 2009 and older will probably require Windows XP to run properly. Otherwise, they may not boot or just not run right, be it low frame rates or graphic glitches. Anything from the 90\u2019s is almost guaranteed to have issues. So my suggestion is you either get Windows XP compatible parts, and dual boot between Windows XP and Windows 7 or 10, or you have two computers, one for XP and one for 7 or 10. (This is what I did, because when I built my gaming PC, I used parts incompatible with Windows XP, so I bought an older computer and added a video card and more powerful PSU to it.)   Edit: You might hear that you can create a virtual machine on your gaming PC to run old Windows XP games on. Please don\u2019t do that. It might work for some, but most will continue to have compatibility issues, just as they would on Windows 10 Edit #2: One of my favorite gaming PC builds was done by psychoticgiraffe. It can run just about any PC game from the Windows 3.1 era all the way up to Battlefield 1, if you dual-boot it between Windows XP and Windows 7 or 10. If I was gonna do everything all over again, this is definitely the route I\u2019d take.  I hope this helps! Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is no. The long answer is that it depends what settings you want to play on. Some people are happy with 1080p while others prefer 2K & 4K. There is also the refresh rate of your monitor which you need to consider. Do you need 100+ fps for a higher refresh rate monitor. Some games will be harder to run than others and it all comes down to how you want to play it. What resolution, refresh rate & quality preset for the game. The one benefit of a high end system is that it will last longer providing you are happy to reduce graphics settings as the computer ages but if you just want 1080p medium settings then you could get a fairly reasonably priced PC that would play all games. You may have the odd exception of a poorly optimised game (Ubisoft) but a higher end machine doesn't normally benefit too much. Of course if you want to run games at higher resolutions or refresh rates then you may want a higher end PC but that again is only to play every game which in most cases you wont and I wouldn\u2019t advise building a PC based on that idea. Benchmarks are the best source of information. Find a group of games you will most likely play and check which graphics cards will be able to play them all at your preferred settings. Pick up an i5 (i7 if you go high end)or something similar and you are on to a winner. ",

It only had 1 stick of 4 GB ram, and a 1.3 GHz CPU. I have since put in a stick of 2 GB ram, but the CPU is non removable so this thing is almost completely unusable for any large games. It was around $300. I did have a great gaming computer, but I had started to build another one and have yet to get all the proper parts. MY computer looked something like this:  (Not my picture, or my computer, they just look alike) With 32 GB of ram, a GeForce GTX 2gb graphics card, and a AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Processor at 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Processor it ran most games at 60 fps, 1280 HD no problem, but I wanted a better video card and CPU so I could start VR gaming. It certainly wasn\u2019t \u201chigh-end\u201d but it wasn\u2019t cheap, about $750\u2013$800 went into making this beauty! So, yes, to play good games, or just VR games, you need a powerful computer, but only if your a graphic and frame rate fanatic! (OR IF YOU WANT TO PLAY VR GAMES) ",

It probably won't even be able to read the disc. It's for PS4 and nothing else. There are lots of great games that don't need a high end PC, either because they were released a few years ago or more, or because they just don't. There are tons of great indie games out there that run fine in low spec PCs. There are some PC games that require a newer high end PC, but comparatively it's not that many. Lots of those will actually run ok on mid or even low spec PCs, just not on the higher graphics levels. So really, that's what you are paying for when you buy your high end PC, some mostly new AAA games will have more graphic polish. You have to decide for yourself if that's what you want to spend your money on. There's plenty of great game play experiences out there that don't require expensive hardware. ",

But if you wanted to play comfortably at 50\u201370 fps at 1080p and high settings, maybe 500\u2013600 dollars would be more realistic. And I could keep going, maybe you want 4K resolution or ultra settings, or maybe you want to play at 1440p on a 144Hz monitor and you need to get 150fps. Or maybe you just want to play CS:GO at 720p, low settings and 40fps. So\u2026 it depends on the resolution, frame rate, graphical settings you want to play at and the actual games you are going to be playing. I would say a 500 dollar-ish desktop would be able to run any game if you are willing to sacrifice the visual experience. ",

Now if you meant you only wanna play pc games then get medium to low speced pc , it can run all games (if it has a cpu ,GPU) but it will run all the at lowest possible settings and insanely low frame rates . So conclusion - No you don't need high end pc to play all games ",

            "answer_text": "To play all games? Yes. To play most games? No. if you don't play VR or first person shooters, a mid level computer will be fine. Even if you just play FPS games, most of those are designed to look great on consoles. Building a computer with more horsepower than a PS4 is not especially expensive. VR is one thing that might merit a meatier machine. They take more horsepower to run, and bad frame rate in VR can make you want to hurl your cookies. But even then, unless you're actually a VR developer, you probably don't need to build specifically for that concern. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer simply lies on how you want to play the game. If you are a gamer and want to play triple A titles like Battlefield 1 or Forza Motorsports 7 well above 60 frames per second at maximum settings on a 4K monitor, then the answer is \u201cYES\u201d. If you are not an enthusiast and just want to experience the top end games and you don't care about the quality, then you can pretty much run it on any budget gaming pc with a lower resolution display. However a decent graphics card is a must in both cases, a GTX 1050ti would suffice for casual gaming and a GTX 1080ti or AMD RX580 for high end gaming. ",

It's basically like a Netflix for games. The technological aspect is still under development for further improvements, but I suspect it's completely possible to make it viable and an amazing idea we\u2019ll see to be incredibly popular in the coming years. In fact, companies are already doing it and are getting feedback from users about it. Check it out. ",

You need at least these specs to play modern titles: A quad core CPU 8GB of RAM 100-ish GB of hard drive space internet access windows 7 or higher (windows 10 is ideal) Depending on the monitor you would need a different graphics card:For 1080p: Get a DX11 supported GPU with at least 2GB of VRAM (ideally 4GB)for 1440p: DX11 4GB GPU4k: DX11 6\u20138 GB GPU Of course you could use the game streaming service as mentioned in the other answers which allows you to play games with a PC below the minimum spec.
