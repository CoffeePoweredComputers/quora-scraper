            "answer_text": "15 Top Vipassana Meditation Centers in India Although the ancient technique of Vipassana meditation was practiced by Lord Buddha in India, it isn't only popular with Indians. Many travelers take time out to study Vipassana in India. This style of meditation is derived from Theravada Buddhism, although the course is free of religious teachings. Vipassana was reintroduced into India in the 1970s by S.N.Goenka, a retired industrialist who was born in Myanmar but had Indian heritage. The Vipassana meditation course is a 10-day silent residential program that focuses on observing the breath and bodily sensations. Days begin at 4.30 a.m., so it's not for the faint of heart. However, the course, food and accommodations are all free of charge. The top centers for Vipassana meditation in India are listed below. Do note that the course structure is identical at all centers, as the same instructional audio and video is used. There's no variation in routine. It's only the environment and facilities, such as hot water and shared rooms, that differ. The bigger centers also have pagodas with individual meditation cells, in addition to a mediation hall for everyone. The 10-day courses are generally conducted twice a month throughout the year. 1.Dhamma Giri, Igatpu The world's largest Vipassana meditation center, known as Dhamma Giri, is located at the Vipassana Research Institute at Igatpuri in Maharashtra. It's around three hours from Mumbai and is accessible by train. The center offered its first course to the public in 1976, and now tens of thousands study there every year. The 10-day courses are always in high demand. Despite the center's substantial size, there's a pervasive feeling of peace all around. Over 400 cells are available for individual meditation, which is appealing for those who want to undertake intensive practice in solitude away from other people. The accommodations range from dormitory rooms to single occupancy rooms. 2. Dhamma Pattana, Mumbai The Dhamma Pattana Vipassana meditation center is part of the magnificent Global Pagoda complexthat opened in 2009 near the beach town of Gorai, in the outer norther suburbs of Mumbai. The building is modern, and all rooms are equipped with western facilities and air conditioning. The distinctive feature about the 10-day course taught here is that it's specifically geared towards business executives and professionals. The technique is the same but the course contains additional talks related to using Vipassana principles for dealing with stresses of the business world. The courses fill up very fast and must be booked well in advance. 3. Dhamma Bodhi, Bodh Gaya If you fancy meditating at the place where Lord Buddha became enlightened, head to Dhamma Bodhi Vipassana meditation center in Bodh Gaya, Bihar.
