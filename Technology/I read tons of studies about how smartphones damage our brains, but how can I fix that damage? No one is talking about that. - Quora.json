            "answer_text": "\u201cI read tons of studies about how smartphones damage our brains, but how can I fix that damage? No one is talking about that.\u201d Relax. Take a look at the dates on the studies and where they came from. I suspect you will find first of all that almost none of them are studies, but rather popular press articles about the subject, perhaps mentioning a (perhaps) debunked study. Second, you will find that most are at least five years old. There have only been a few credible studies of how smartphones damage the brain, they aren\u2019t compelling, and they don\u2019t agree. So we really don\u2019t whether or how cell phones affect us. The risks I\u2019m familiar with are: Radiation. There is no clear evidence of brain damage from cell phone radiation. Somebody found brain cancer on the side a patient used for the phone. It was widely reported, but somebody did the math. Most people don\u2019t get brain cancer. Of those who get it on a side of the brain, about 50% get it on the side they use for a cell phone. No surprise. Actually, a small anomaly, but nothing significant.Blue light at night. Possible. Great reason to stop using the cell phone at night in bed. Or get an app that fixes it. Worst case: difficulty sleeping.Inability to concentrate. Possible. This is more a problem with social media addiction than cell phones in particular, thought cell phones exacerbate the problem.I\u2019m sure there are others. The problem with the radiation argument is that cell phones don\u2019t create ionizing radiation, which is the only form that has a link to cancer. It\u2019s possible that there are problems with non-ionizing radiation, but there are no real studies, so it\u2019s hard to talk about. I recommend people use an abundance of caution and avoid long periods of time with a cell phone next to the head, for lots of reasons. But I don\u2019t see anything that isn\u2019t being talked about. OTOH, I\u2019d like to see more studies, but who would pay for them? ",
