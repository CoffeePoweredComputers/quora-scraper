HOW they \u201cknew\u201d what \u2018rays\u2019 reach \u2018here\u2019 at what times, will likely never be published since those \u2018secrets\u2019 were among the millions of things burnt by each successive \u201cEmpire\u201d in their \u201ceradication\u201d of \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201csuperstitious\u201d and \u201cforbidden\u201d and \u201ctreasonous\u201d materials throughout time. I DOUBT Confucius may have any insight to \u2018Astrology\u2019, but he was NEVER any FAVORITE Author of HIS OWN Contemporary Government NOR Any great hero to any of the successors for Thousands of years; his stuff was burnt in PUBLIC Bonfires continuously, the results being a grand total of about a dozen ANNOTATED \u201c8 and a half by eleven pages\u201d THAT REMAIN Of his works, along with hundreds of other such doomed contributors.

            "answer_text": "Better is of course highly subjective, but I can think of a couple: If I told you I\u2019d made a digital camera which didn\u2019t need batteries, and rather than worry about \u201cfull frame\u201d or \u201cAPS-C\u201d or whatever, you just cut out a sensor at the size you wanted, you probably wouldn\u2019t believe me, but that\u2019s what photographic film is. Obviously digital is cheaper and easier, but I\u2019m not really convinced it\u2019s actually a better technology than photographic film.Books. If I have a book, I can lend it out, it never runs out of battery, it\u2019s incredibly resistant to damage, and it can have full colour photos in it. I\u2019ve had a Kindle and a Kobo, eBook readers are pretty awful compared to regular books. I think the screens would be amazing in a smartphone, easily visible in bright sunlight, and very low power consumption, I\u2019d buy that in an instant, but for me, eBook readers are a very poor alternative to the paper book, except maybe for people who need the ability to increase font size or something.I think in lots of cases, the Internal Combustion Engine is better technology than an electric car. Charge times are far too long, and with an ICE, I can just carry charge with me, I can have a canister of petrol or diesel strapped to the back of a 4x4.",
