            "answer_text": "Creating an Augmented Reality experience is a multi-stage process, from the development of the 3D models to the technology that powers the image tracking and depth sensing. I talk about the first step, 3D modeling and processing, on my blog on Augment. Each step is an intuitive process, and there are different methods and practices for distinct uses. Whether you are looking to develop in Augmented Reality or you are creating content for AR headsets, understanding the technical process will help you broaden your perspective. At this point, we will walk you through the concept of 3D models and their deployment in AR. 3D content still needs an engine to bring AR to fruition, and this software can be adopted through an augmented reality SDK. This AR SDK includes a rendering engine for the 3D model, as well as tracking detection and depth sensing to orient it in the 'real world'. Each software solution has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is helpful to understand the different types of tracking used in Augmented Reality.Tango has joined forces with Lenovo for their first Tango-enabled device, called the Phab 2 Pro. In brief, the Google software has a few capabilities that will power huge leaps for Augmented Reality, especially through mobile devices. Tracking When a movie needs to use 3D elements mixed with live action, the CGI supervisor will place tracking markers around the set in order to give the computer a sense of what the environment looks like. It uses these specific points to generate a rough idea of the space so that the computer-generated element can move around in it and still look realistic. Think of Augmented Reality as the real version \u2014not the work around\u2014 for this kind of technology. How does it work?An AR SDK must learn and track the environment in real-time, creating and updating its view of the environment many times per second. The most common ways of accomplishing this tricky feat are Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) tracking, Depth tracking, and Pattern tracking Depth Perception Depth sensors can detect how far or close objects are in relation to your device. Understanding depth helps you interact with virtual elements in the real world. Virtual objects will fuse with the true environment, because their depth is anchored to an object with true scale. On a more practical basis, understanding the real world becomes much easier. For example, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro can use Tango\u2019s software to measure how tall an object is or how much space you have. Rendering\tThe most common uses of 3D models today are either in the world of entertainment or product design. However, most 3D models are stuck in a 2D world. Even the best 3D element will still likely only be displayed on the flat canvas of a monitor, and interaction with it will be limited to a mouse or a remote control. But as we have seen, developers are rushing to change that; soon, 3D is going to explode from the screen and begin inhabiting the real world. AR is the end result but there are many software programs and technologies used to prepare the 3D content for such a process. I go into more depth about the entire process and the softwares involved when rendering a model, AR SDKs, exporting 3D models and more in Augment\u2019s eBook on AR. As for the hardware, we dive into that as well. But the most accessible and trustworthy medium right now would be a mobile experience. The hololens is out to early parties and the Meta 2 is on the way, as well as other alternatives. But most AR experiences have been seen through mobile at the moment. ",

            "answer_text": " Those who have played the Pok\u00e9mon Go would already have an experience of what AR, better known as Augmented Reality could be. One of the most in-things these days, it is being used round about anywhere. From planning weddings to making games to some of the more serious sectors like the pharmaceutical industry, AR has proved that it is one of the biggest technological advents of the century. How does AR work? AR lets us see the real-life environment right in front of us, but with a digital augmentation overlaid on it. For instance, one could see the imaginary mingling with the real world. A pterodactyl could be seen landing on the trees or a dog can be seen playing with its cartoon counterpart. Yes, it\u2019s that fun! But on a serious note, the technology also helps in eliminating the counterfeit medicine from a given drug supply chain. Here\u2019s how? The drug supply chain is a complex maze of data-sharing, which need to be secured in a master database. Conventional drug supply chains would not have accessibility to this database because they use single scanners or manual labors to serialize or tally the sources of the medicines. Now, that turns out to be an incredibly slow process, notwithstanding the possibility of human error accompanied with it. AR-driven scanners are fast and efficient, scanning thousands of consignments in just a few minutes that too with half the labor force. The moment multiscanners are placed in front of serialized boxes of drugs, everything pertaining to the consignment, such as date of manufacturing, the manufacturing company and the date of expiry is provided to the handler without even handling them manually. This enables fast confirmation of the origins of the drugs, striking out any chances of duplication or drug manipulation. Apart from that, rapid screening also helps in maintaining a rich database that can be referred to at any stage of the drug supply chain, reducing the time consumed in back and forth information exchange.
