            "answer_text": "One of the primary considerations of Planet Mars Development, the process of building the economy on Mars, is the payload efficiency. Payload efficiency is related to self-sustainability. If the payload efficiency of a load is 10, it means that for each kilogram of supply shipped from Earth, 10kg of product or commodity is made available on Mars. The greater the payload efficiency, the closer to self-sustainable Mars is. Sustainability The process of developing Mars I see is to commit to a predictable supply expeditions from Earth to Mars. In the 26-month cycle, there is a window opportunity to send ships. Perhaps 100 ships could be sent over 100 days every 26 months. The items put aboard those ships would be chosen that maximize the useful development on Mars. Payload efficiency would be a major consideration for selecting what technologies, supplies, and machines are sent to Mars. Survivability Immediate survivability is measured in a few ways that are useful for different purposes. The immediate survivability index is how far into the future the current supplies will allow survival to occur. For example, everything stops and you\u2019re left to consume remaining food and breathe remaining air. How far into the future will that get you? Leveraged survivability is how far into the future the current supplies and equipment as expected to operate will bring you into the future. Logistical survivability is how much payload from Earth is needed to produce a Mars that can provide leveraged survivability for 100 years longer than leveraged survivability. This would be supplies, warehouses of replacement parts. Logistical survivability allows the reintroduction of payload efficiency as a means to measure that form of success. When the payload required to extend survivability for 100 years beyond logical survivability, then the economic activity (colony) is self-sustainable. Summary Payload Efficiency provides a means to manage the development of Mars and also provides a means measure how close to self-sustainable a Mars colony is. ",

            "answer_text": "Most probably none, there would be enough problems to survive on your own. Science is not one scientist alone using improvised tools to create something new in his kitchen. We are speaking about teams, about sharing resources and experiment results. Furthermore, a stranded colony would spend 0 time on fundamental research. They would try to avoid dying first. Even a self sustaining colony would have difficulties as it would be temporary state. You need to replace or repair equipments as they would age and a small colony wouldn\u2019t be likely to manufacture all the output needed to replace failing equipments. Best case scenario would be a large colony located beneath the surface and having already closed all access to avoid atmosphere loss. If enough water was available, they could survive with growing food but they would need energy sources and basic things like uv lamps. As such, it would need a rather large colony to survive. Everything would depend on what could be manufactured locally to maintain life. Anyhow, research would only be applied ie how to replace computer memories or cpu\u2019s rather than fundamental physics. As such, scenario simply doesn\u2019t work. ",

            "answer_text": "The rate would be negative. They would try to survive as machines failed and they had to improvise repairs. But you can\u2019t live long on Mars without at least 21st century technology. They could try and survive but at best would only die more slowly. On Earth we could survive by reverting to stone age \u201ctechnology of animal skin clothing and stone tools but that is not an option on Mars. People on mars would need things like nuclear fusion power plants and robotic semiconductor plants and a chemical industry to extract nitrogen from minerals to make fertilizer so they can grow food. Without access to very advanced tech (that does not even exist today) all they can do is die later rather than sooner. ",
