            "answer_text": "It is really helpful and important for many B2B sales-led organizations, the technology a prospect uses can be a strong qualifying factor. Technographics is the profiling of target accounts based on their technology stack. Such profiling allows you to answer questions like: What hardware or software do our target audience use?Do they have remarketing technology installed on their website?Do they use a marketing stack or all-in-one marketing automation?Historically, the collection of technographic data was conducted through two mediums: surveys and scraping. You can use such technology data thru lead databases. For example, Uplead allows you to build such targeted lists of prospects based on the technology stack that companies and contacts use.It tracks over 16,000 technologies like analytics, CRM, marketing automation toolsSo, for example, If you want to find organizations that use WordPress or Salesforce, for example, you can build a list of those companies.

            "answer_text": "There are dozens of amazing software products that serve as an illustrative example of how technology can facilitate your sales process. It will just suffice to mention Salesforce! This piece of software alone has changed the way we do sales forever. And it\u2019s hard to think of any sales task which wouldn\u2019t benefit from using technology automation.  Take sales prospecting for example. It is one of the sales tasks that is definitely better with technology (and I\u2019ve done manual email prospecting for several months, I know what I\u2019m talking about!) And here\u2019s why. Automation saves your time. Prospecting is by far the most time-consuming sales task. Reaching out to prospects one by one could take days! With email automation tools like Reply, you can set up and launch a campaign in under an hour (or even faster if you have a ready-made template and list of prospects).Technology helps you better allocate your resources. In business, time is money. Considering how time-consuming manual prospecting is, this task might cost you a pretty penny. Technology, on the other hand, can help you make the most out of your available resources (both, monetary and human) by offering a smarter way to allocate those resources.It takes care of the routine processes so you can focus on more important tasks. Following up with each prospect who doesn\u2019t reply after the first email might become a challenge, especially if you are doing this at scale. Technology makes SDRs\u2019 life a lot easier by taking care of the routine, labor-intensive tasks and also allows you to easily scale your email prospecting efforts.Plus, automation software can collect tons of data so you can draw actionable insights from your metrics and tailor your strategy accordingly for better performance.  On the downside, there are also certain drawbacks of automation as well as some tasks you can\u2019t possibly automate. For example, if a prospect responds to your cold email, you will need to jump in and take it from there. A machine, no matter how intelligent, simply can\u2019t handle the specifics of human communication, especially in sales.  P.S. I\u2019ve talked about the benefits of sales automation in more detail in one of my previous replies - What are the most common ways that sales automation can benefit your business? If you fancy a read, there\u2019s also a great article about the impact automation has on sales communications - Automation, AI and the Future of Communications Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It can be extremely helpful! For starters, powerful software can automate otherwise time-consuming tasks: help you generate leads, give you access to relevant data about your prospects & customers, and, essentially, increase the productivity of your sales team.  Take CloudTalk, as an example. It doesn\u2019t only make it possible to make and receive any sales-related calls from any place in the world, but also lets sales agents talk longer and \u201cmore effectively\u201d thanks to post-call automation, and keeping customer data consistent & up-to-date between all systems. Harmonizely, on the other hand, allows your prospects and customers to easily schedule meetings with the members of your sales team. The only thing you have to do is to share a dedicated link with others and stop wasting time on exchanging unnecessary emails back and forth. There are plenty of useful tools that can help your sales team immensely, which is why I highly recommend doing your research and test out at least a few solutions to see what works best for you. There\u2019s often a free trial available, so you don\u2019t need to make any investments at this point. ",

Everything I do work wise has to be the structured (and automated) the possible. In our company, we automated everything we possibly can. This Allows us absolute complete structure, with little overhead, making our whole sales process to the predictable it can be. For example, we have a totally robust outbound sales strategy. This begins with: Stage # 1: Prospecting - We use a great tool called Found.ly, Which allows us to prospect using LinkedIn's search functionality, And Then pull in our prospects to the Found dashboard, hit the refresh button and Then all of their business email addresses are found for me. This really is a brilliant tool, the Especially it is currently in beta (we got a great deal!). Stage # 2 is our outreach. Currently we use MailChimp, Which is of course a great tool. This Allows us to keep track of everything, open rates etc etc and automate our drip feed campaigns. That's just two examples, there are thousands of good tools in the market like HubSpot and SalesForce. ",
