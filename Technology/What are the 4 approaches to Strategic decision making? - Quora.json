            "answer_text": "Making great decisions is a key leadership responsibility. If you choose the wrong decision-making style, you could face a disaster. Choose the right style and you\u2019ll make decisions faster and more effectively. When you make decisions, there are four decision-making styles that you can use. There\u2019s an Autocratic style, a Participatory one, a Democratic style, and a Consensus-based decision-making style. Your choice of which of those four styles to use is driven by two things. First, the urgency of making the decision \u2013 from low urgency where you\u2019ve got plenty of time to make the call, to high urgency where you need a decision right now. The second dimension to consider is the size or impact of the decision, from small decisions that won\u2019t have a large impact, to big decisions that are going to have a huge impact. As you look at which style of decision making to use, you need to consider both of these dimensions. Autocratic Decision-Making For situations where you have low impact and they\u2019re reasonably small decisions, but they get larger as urgency goes up, an Autocratic decision-making style is the most appropriate. In Autocratic decision-making, decisions are made at the top. Buy-in is not seen as an important aspect of making this decision. And actually, it may be counterproductive to involve a lot of people in making the call. Typically, in an environment where you\u2019re making Autocratic decisions, work activities and roles are very tightly structured, they\u2019re monitored and well controlled. Command and control is very important in these situations. Participatory Decision-Making For larger decisions where there\u2019s higher urgency and you need to make a call soon, but the impact is going to be big, you\u2019re looking at a situation where you need to use a Participatory decision-making style. This is where you\u2019re going to make a decision with input from the people who are going to be impacted in that final call. Remember, Participatory decisions are made when the decision is much bigger and there\u2019s a lot more risk involved. Getting that additional information from more people is going to reduce that decision making risk. Also by getting that buy-in, you\u2019re reducing execution risk because people have had an opportunity to give their input and have a say in the final call that\u2019s made. Consensus-Based Decision-Making For situations where it\u2019s a large decision but there\u2019s no urgency around it and you\u2019ve got plenty of time, you can be using a Consensus-based decision-making style. This is where decisions are reached with a cross-functional team. People from different departments have input, and buy-in is essential. You should reserve this style of decision-making for the biggest decisions you\u2019re trying to make. However, recognize this can take a lot of time. You have to get everybody saying \u201cyes\u201d before that decision is made. You\u2019re going to have individuals from multiple groups, multiple functions, all working together, coming up with that final perspective for the final decision. Democratic Decision-Making And last, for mid-sized decisions where there\u2019s not a lot of urgency but you do need to make a decision and move on, a Democratic style is the most appropriate. This is where a decision is reached by a majority vote. Buy-in is desirable but it\u2019s not essential. These are the decisions we just have to make and move on with life. Individuals are going to interact in this style. You may have a committee where people are going to come together, form an opinion, but ultimately we set a deadline, we vote and we move on. As you select a decision-making style, remember to consider the urgency of making the call, and the size or impact of that decision. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only give my approach rather than an academically researched process and while it may not be very useful on its own, it might offer a different perspective when analysing the other approaches. My starting point for strategic decision making is always focused on timing. Over the years clients have found this counter-intuitive but then useful. If I give you two opposite examples, it might explain its importance. Much of my consulting life was driven by companies that had got into difficulties for all sorts of reasons, including: the products and services had been outmoded by the market; the pricing was out of step; the go-to-market model, changing from direct to distributors, for example, had proved ineffectual; regulatory change had caught the company unawares. In such a situation, you don\u2019t make strategic decisions - although they may be called that - but a series of decisions that initially hold the situation and then work through into a resolution which may lead to strategic decisions. The second case - and the more unlikely one for me to be involved - is where a company is doing well, it is market leader, has had a record sales year, its profitability has never been higher. That for me is the time for strategic decisions. Even a simple tool, like a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), can help identify where improvements, changes, different understandings and different market conditions are likely to come from - and then strategic decisions are well based. (I\u2019ve seen occasions when the company concluded that it wasn\u2019t time to make any decisions - but it sets the agenda.) My second element is part of this, and it is a combination of competitive analysis and market analysis - which although linked are different. There are plenty of other drivers for decisions, for example technical innovation is often a very important and key driver as you will see below, but I think they are less important than understanding the market and where your competitors are going - and that includes market disrupters, so you have to look beyond the existing competition. If, for example, digital money does become a normal part of our interactions, cash will become outmoded - so card terminals, ATMs, coin-operated parking machines will become obsolete. The technical innovation is significant, but it is within the context of how quickly the market will develop and change that is really important. From that timing issue and the competitive analysis and market analysis, everything else flows and has its place, including demographics, pricing, macro-economics, regulation, employee attrition, all the other HR issues such as succession planning. In my experience, however, getting the fundamentals in place means that a company can make informed strategic decisions. ",
