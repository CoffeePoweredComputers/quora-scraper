            "answer_text": "Nobody knows precisely who invented the magnetic compass. First mention of it in the West was by Alexander Neckam, an English Augustinian monk, in an 1187 treatise in which he describes sailors using a magnet to find North in weather when the stars were obscured. There's no further description of the device itself. Now, Beckam travelled and studied on the Continent so we don't know just how or where he came to this knowledge. Nevertheless, the compass was already a well- established device by his time. Some sources suggest the Italians were the first to employ a magnetic compass. That would make sense given their widespread seagoing experience. Beckam could well have been referring to the Italians in his article. ",
