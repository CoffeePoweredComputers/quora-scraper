            "answer_text": "If civilisation survives intact enough to rebuild technology using non-electrical means, then I'd say it's going to look a bit like this:  Much of the industrial revolution happened pre-electrification, so we know that this would be the minimum level of technology that we would fall back upon.  We'd be relying on a lot of steam power to power industrial machines and transport.  We might also end up with some cool Stirling-engine technology too. External combustion engines are actually reasonably capable, and can be designed to work without electricity.  Today we have good understanding of steam technology because in actual fact much of our larger engines are still steam-powered.  Even nuclear power plants rely on steam-power.   Agriculture, our most important industry, could probably get by relatively unscathed with pre-electrification technology, such as steam tractors.  After all, humanity has been farming from the dawn of civilisation.  Though agriculture would probably not be able to sustain the population as it is today due to the loss of the chemicals industry, and issues with transport and refrigeration.   Natural resource extraction could still continue, it would be slow at first, relying on muscle power, but pick up again when the steam engine industry gets up o speed.  This is important for supplying the increasing demand for combustible fuels such as coal, and for extracting substances that can be used for fertiliser, such as potash. Industrial-revolution-era technology gives an idea of what the state of the manufacturing industry would be in - we'd still be able to manufacture steel, textiles, and glass. But plastics and some composites would be difficult.  Wood would become very popular again. The loss of computing is probably one of the biggest losses to our ability to develop technology.  Fortunately, I can tell you from first hand experience that at least some universities today still educate engineers on the use of archaic technology such as steam tables, Mohr circles, and slide rules.  Pretty much the ONLY situation we would use such things is in a scenario where all technology breaks down.  Nevertheless, calculations will be slow, and we'll need to begin tapping individuals with excellent mathematical ability to act as computers (the original meaning of the word \"computer\" is literally \"someone who computes/calculates\").  Fortunately there are a lot of information such as printed data tables that would help. This is what part of a steam table looks like:  Land and sea transportation will be set back, but we can return to animal carts, steam locomotives, and steam ships, which means that international trade can still continue, though lack of aircraft and means that perishable goods would be difficult to transport.  Airships would provide air transport, but their speed and low payload capacity would limit their use. Refrigeration might well end up being steam powered.  Assuming we can still manufacture the refrigerant, the actual electrical power used in today's refrigerators is actually just to drive an electric motor that powers a compression pump.  The motor could be replaced by a small steam engine, though due to the efficiencies involved, that might not be worthwhile.  Einstein refrigerators may also be an option. Loss of long distance communication would be difficult to replace.  Electricity was what allowed long distance communication, without it, we'd be relying on stuff like semaphore relays (any readers of Terry Pratchett will instantly tell you about clacks towers).  But that would not be able to service across oceans, so some of the continents would be cut-off from fast communication, and would rely on ships.   Weapons production could be re-tooled.  Guns don't need electricity, and the processes to manufacture modern rifles could be retooled to avoid it.  I don't know enough about the chemistry behind modern gunpowder and explosives to be able to tell you whether it can survive without electricity, but it is somewhat likely. Society would be hugely different, but not imaginably so.  We'd have gone through tough periods of starvation and chaos while groups fought it out to control dwindling \"modern resources\", items that were made back in the electricity-driven halcyon days that we would not be able to make again for many generations. The future would be one that is driven by mechanical systems, and micro-mechanics.  But ultimately the rate of development of technology that we see today may well never be reached again without large-scale computing; something that is just impossible with mechanical computing. Throughout all of this, we would have to resist the temptation of sticking cogs to everything and calling it steampunk. ",

            "answer_text": "Population.The population of other countries shall see a rapid decline due to the unavailability of technology for better healthcare.India,however, shall see a rapid increment in it's population since power outages are the cornerstone of fornication in our country.Secondly and most importantly, safety shall be compromised due to the unavailability of street lights, CCTV footage, and other such devices. This would lead to a global feminist movement of a grand scale which shall see the first United Nations female General Secretary, in addition to middle aged women being unanimously appointed as heads to several important organizations,including the Academy Of Motion Pictures and Sciences and the International Olympic Committee. This shall further lead to the first Pink themed Oscars and boybands may close the Opening Ceremony of the Venice Olympics in which Celebrity Bake Off shall be the most watched event and Beach Volleyball shall no longer exist on the Charter. Additionally India would see the passing of a legislature mandating the re runs of all Television serials for a minimum of 4 times a week, with punishment for disobeying the above rule being the act of being subjected to the same Television serials.None of the following are undermining to the economy. The few amoral bastards shall be shot down, which is again good news.Sports shall see a more profound change.With women in power, there shall be no question of a John Terry-esque player in any sport(Thank you,ladies).The Wayne Rooney types would be released into wilderness after their contracts to facilitate economic affluence. Sadly enough, Counter Strike shall not survive this phase of change, because computers shall be too expensive to manufacture.( Read: Apple shall be the only survivor)On a more serious note.To a large extent society shall be rebuilt. Considering Earth to be a large functioning economy, it would mean that the classical approach of What To Produce, How To Produce and For Whom To Produce shall predominate. This would necessitate the development of resources which are constructive,rather than destructive,for the fear of going back into the previous state,which in economic terms would be, Great Depression, or Greatest Depression,for the sake of novelty and historical accuracy.A graphical representation for Economy vs Time Period shall be an upward sloping curve.PS: I apologize to any women, John Terry, Wayne Rooney and Barbie fans if my views caused hurt.The John Terry part is intentional,the others, not so much.
