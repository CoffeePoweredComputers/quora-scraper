Scammers will usually try to push you into a quick decision. Don\u2019t let anyone trick or threaten you into giving them private information including banking information, Social Security number or other personally identifiable information over the phone. If they try to push you to take action right now, it might be a scam.

Scammers use these methods to get you to pick up a call or respond to a text. To protect yourself from falling victim to these scams, be wary of answering phone calls from numbers you do not recognize.
