In reality, this is not going to happen, thus you cannot say with scientific certainty\u2026 anything. It is the reoccurring problem in education: the few studies done with appropriate rigor are less than likely to be repeated in your classroom. Those pesky students just refuse to be uniform. And the rest of the \u201cstudies\u201d are even less useful. Technology is, for the most part, a way to store and retrieve information. If you master that system that provides you information at the instant you need it, that\u2019s a great thing. Which system is that? It\u2019s the one that assist you the best\u2026 and is available. Technology in general just shifts things. I like the example of the vacuum cleaner. It meant that you didn\u2019t have to take your rugs out and beat them with a paddle to get them clean. Carpets could stay in the house and so could you. And we do, but that permanent carpet never does get as clean as when you could take it outside and pound it, or send it out for professional level cleaning. So you either have to bring that service in, create and execute the deep cleaning situation yourself in you own home or, like most of us, live in a home that\u2019s only partially clean. I\u2019ve done enough removal of carpet to tell you the stuff is filthy, deeply, embarrassingly, filthy. There is a trade off with that new gizmo, the vacuum cleaner, there always is. Once adopted you\u2019re stuck with it or you pay a price for going around it. Wall to wall carpet is the norm and the cheapest way to have anything over your subfloor. These two concepts are intrinsically linked in an industrial world, common and cheap. You now must own a Vacuum cleaner\u2026 and a computer. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re better off at all but there is no stopping it. Technology IS effective, just not exactly as one might calculate. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is a tool. To a teacher Much like a wrench is a tool to a mechanic. A good mechanic can fix a car with a minimum of tools in a short time. A poor mechanic can take a month with all sorts of shiny tools and never get your car working just right. Same with teachers. Many of them have had careers with paper and chalk as their tools. And now we have a large set of tools which can help provide a better learning experience for the kiddos. But its the skills of the teacher vs the technology that makes anything effective. Personally i use CodeCombat - Coding games to learn Python and JavaScript to teach my kiddos js coding. Much like a math teacher would use khan academy. Lots of drilling and content exposure. This allows 2 things, 1 it gives me time to work with the slower kids and the ability to circulate the entire room at least once in a period to assess whether they are getting the concepts well enough to finish the allocated challenges. It also drives engagement because the kiddos see themselves playing video games more than learning. But they are learning. They are learning a lot more than without this approach. I could use a different piece of technology to teach intro js, but I doubt that I'd have nearly 100% engagement with it. As my job as a teacher is to teach ALL the kids i have. ",
