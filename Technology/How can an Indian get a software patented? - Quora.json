            "answer_text": "Invention need to be evaluated on case to case basis to determine patentability. As per Section 3 (k)  of Indian Patent Act a mathematical or business method or a computer programme per se or algorithms is not patentable. Thus, the act itself bars the software (computer programme per se or algorithm) from patenting.  Indian Patent office has recently issued guidelines for examination of computer-related inventions. The guidelines put more light on the subject of computer-related inventions.   The guideline specifies tests/indicators to determine Patentability of computer-related inventions which are as follows. (1) Identify the actual contribution of the invention; (2) If the contribution lies only in mathematical method, business method or algorithm, the invention is not patentable; (3) If the contribution lies in the field of computer programme, check whether invention lies in conjunction with a novel hardware. If yes and if the invention satisfies other criterias of patentability, invention may be patentable.  The computer programme in itself is never patentable. If the contribution lies solely in the computer programme, . If the contribution lies in both the computer programme as well as hardware, invention may be patentable. The above tests may help you decide if you can get a patent for your computer-related invention in India ",

            "answer_text": "I also don't know the exact thing... But now i want to quote some passages that I read in some websites which include: 1. Indian Patent Act offers patent protection to product or process (if they satisfy various requirements of patent-ability) as long as they do not fall under non-patent-able subject matter. Section 3 and 4 of the Indian Patent Act specify a list of subject matter that is not patentable. Section 3(k) of the Indian Patent Act, which is provided below, is of specific importance to software innovation. 2. Recently the Indian Patent Office has published a New Draft Manual Of Patent Practice And Procedure - Patent Office, India (2008) relating to the Patent Practice to be followed by the Indian Patent office and as per manual shall allow method claims In software related inventions. Earlier the Patent office used to object of method claims only and used to allow only the device claims that too with hardware components.

Also there are certain conditions(see the book by Dr Sheetal Thakur called Patenting in india). according to it there is a provision under copyright act 1957. not all combination of software and hardware are patentable. If the software is new and the hardware is already known and the combination is useful technically to the industry then also the combination will not be awared patent. if both software and hardware are known but the combination is new and useful to the industry then the combination may be a subject matter for patent .read the book ",

            "answer_text": "You have to carefully evaluate the merits of filing patents outside India when your main business activities relating to the software are based in India. Although, we do suggest many of our clients to file patents in US for variety of reasons. Having said that, the US laws and examination standards with respect to software subject matter is in itself undergoing transition because of US Supreme court rulings in Alice and Prometheus cases. Therefore, I will suggest you to be cautious and aware of the developments in foreign countries when thinking of software protection. Software patents are very expensive to obtain and maintain. It's like testing and retesting the quality of soil before you errect a skyscraper on it. ",
