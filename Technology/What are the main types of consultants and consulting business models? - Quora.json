            "answer_text": "Darren addresses the first half of the question ('types of consulting'), so I will concentrate on the second half ('business models').  Happy to oblige with sarcasm as well :)  There are broadly four business models that I have come across - happy to learn and update my understanding if there are any more. They are: 1) Fixed price - I will do this job for $10. 2) Time and materials - My rate is $1/hr, this job will take 8 hours, and my equipment costs $2, so this is $10. 3) Risk reward - I will do this job for $5 and take a 10% cut of improvements that directly result from my service. 4) Retainer - I will be on call for you to give me work one day a week for 5 weeks, at $2 a day. <sarcasm starts here> These models work hand in hand with 3 strategies once you approach the end of a piece of consulting work. Look out for these three characters. 1) The Scope-creep Creep - oh you wanted that (thing that I knew you would want but left out of the contract) too? That is a 'change request', please sign here (oh and here is my rate card...) 2) The Extension Engineer - oh its great that you like our recommendations - the logical next step is to help you implement that first juicy project (oh and here is my rate card...) 3) The Fries-with-that Friend - oh based on my expertise I think you will benefit a lot from also having this extra software and support from my team (oh and here is my rate card...) </end sarcasm>  Consulting is a business model essentially built on one party (consultants) having information and expertise, and the other party (customers) often being ill-equipped to make informed decisions. So there are opportunities for the unscrupulous to take advantage of that information asymmetry to profit.  For the most part though, we understand that consulting is a repeated game with limited players. Our primary drivers are probably wanting to apply our knowledge into your situation and having the opportunity to spend our time solving your (interesting) problems more than anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "I would think per hour fees or package billing are two of the most common. There are also public speaking gigs/seminars/workshops and information products as additional sources of revenue or in some cases perhaps the most predominant sources We're trying to build an online monthly subscription business model for coaches and consultants over at www.koachable.com, but we figure it could very well be used as a hybrid model for follow-up sessions post seminars/workshops or in combination with other packages and types of billing, it would really be up to the consultant and how creative they can get.  We're just trying to help them scale better. Here is a rundown of types off the top of my head. Considering that I think consulting and coaching are pretty much the same thing (or at least really similar):  FitnessWellnessNutritionBusiness (and Business Strategy)ExecutiveLife/Career/PersonalMarketingSalesRelationship/DatingFinancial/Accounting/BudgetingCommunicationsSocial MediaPublic RelationsHuman ResourcesMusicalMotivational/Inspirational/Self-HelpOperationsA lot of them could be categorized as niche markets within others, or very similar in structure. There are probably a lot of niche areas I missed too. ",
