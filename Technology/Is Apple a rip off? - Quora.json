            "answer_text": "It depends on your view point to be honest. If you are just looking for a machine with the best specs and aren\u2019t really thinking about the long term, or other aspects. Then yes. Because you\u2019ll pick up a higher spec PC or smartphone for less money. However, over the long term, Apple devices are supported for much longer. They receive updates for years. They give you the ability to chat to Apple support directly from the device if you need help. They do tend tend to hold a resale value for a bit longer, but this is rather negligible. Apple devices are also designed specifically for how it\u2019s used. It\u2019s simple things, like on a Mac for example, nothing comes as close to how a mouse or trackpad works as on a Mac. The gesture control etc is second to none. But all Apple software is designed to work specifically with the hardware it\u2019s on. Unlike Android or Windows which has to cover a large range of different hardware options. If you own other Apple devices, the connectivity and ease of sharing files etc and handing off from one device to the other is also second to none. Now Apple has by no means, not had its issues. The MacBook keyboard issue persisted for years and Apple took far too long to admit fault and redesign it again. But generally, all their products are very well built and they do last. The initial price tag is always an eye watering thing. But I can say from experience, that years down the line, you will likely come to admit to yourself that it was an initial expense that was well spent. ",

            "answer_text": "Only if you think it is, but as literally more than a billion people owning the items it is clear that many do not think so. No one forced or could force these people to buy these items, and then report the highest levels of satisfaction for smartphones compared to all others. If they were truly a rip-off as posed, then why do all other smartphone makers try to match or exceed them, and compare their items to them? If they were simply overpriced baubles, why bother? With sales as they are, if they were then they have fooled a lot of people, and the fact is that you cannot. When you see these large levels of sales there is a reason. It may not be a good reason for you. There is a tendency in human nature to tear things down. Everyone roots for an underdog, but if they get on top then they often change the view. Yes, Apple products are expensive. They have a clear customer target and it is not \u201ceveryone\u201d which by the way is one of the core reasons for their success. You cannot please everyone. Many do not have the money, or the need for Apple technology and can be totally satisfied with lower priced and less featured items. None of that denies the value of the items. Value is always in the eye of the beholder. If someone likes something, then they do. Denying it does not change that and of course everyone has their own taste and opinion. However, sales of more than a billion items is not fraud. It does not happen by foolery and slick marketing. People perceive value for themselves. Many may resent that. In our divided society and social media many want to \u201cimpose\u201d their view on others as if it were fact, but then reality comes in. Again, no one \u201cforces\u201d anyone to buy Apple products or any other product. It is a choice and clearly many make it. If you do not like Apple products, that is fine. If you think they are too expensive, that is you view. If others think differently, they are also correct, for themselves. ",
