            "answer_text": "Become a software engineer, increase shareholder value, and move to the San Francisco Bay Area. Although software engineering is often lumped together with other IT positions, it\u2019s different. Software engineers build products that can be licensed or resold at negligible incremental cost for billions of users. Traditional IT roles are being replaced by software running in the cloud, managed service providers, and off-shore back offices. Testers moved offshore and almost disappeared in the 2000s as those duties were assumed by software engineers, and the same thing is happening now with web operations. Impact on cash flow and market capitalization determine your value to companies. Advancing requires doing more of that, multiplying other peoples\u2019 output so you can achieve more than you could as an individual. Progressing requires opportunities for that, which are most abundant in the San Francisco Bay Area producing about 70% of billion dollar startups in spite of receiving just 40% of the funding. You need to be here to have a top career in technology as Gayle Laakmann McDowell's answer to Is it true that if you want an A+ career in technology, you should move to the Bay Area? and my comment on that answer discuss.

These days most of us have very short attention spans and do not like to read anything that is lengthy \u2014 we want Twitter-like reads or videos.
