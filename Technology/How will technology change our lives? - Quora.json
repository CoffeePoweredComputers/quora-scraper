            "answer_text": " The speed of Innovation is extremely fast new amazing things being discovered daily. These new innovations help to hold a great deal of value and can digitally transform the business and its strategies completely. New innovations only play a 30 % role in business but 70% role is the business idea that is created with the help of new innovations that bring you up in the market. These innovations help you to gain excellent functionality where you can target particular segments that are interested, Ignoring the other segments. We have 9 amazing disruptive innovations that are already changing the future. Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasises the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. It is also called \u201cthe study and design of intelligent agents\u201d where intelligent agents is a system that analyses the environment and takes actions which increases the chance of success. They include activities like speech recognition, learning and planning, and problem-solving skills. Artificial Intelligence is being used in HealthCare, Banking and many other sectors where AI applications provide personal health care assistants and analyze the data to provide faster and better customer experience. One thing about AI is prone to many errors or can be hacked easily to get the confidential data and stores our personal data which can be used in illegal ways.  Internet of Things The internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interconnected computer systems that are accessible through the internet with the help of IP addresses. It is an ability to transfer the data from one network to another without the help of human Intervention. IoT devices can analyse the data with the help of sensors and take decisions to rectify or enhance the results. Internet of Things can help to monitor overall business processes, improve customer experience, save time and money, enhance employee productivity and many more. But there are risks involved in it too because IoT devices are closely connected, the hacker needs to hack or damage only one part, to make the entire system faulty. Privacy is also one of the biggest threats in IoT, can steal personal data if security is not updated. Besides, there is a lot of infrastructures involved in IoT.  3D Printing The 3 D printing stands for 3-dimensional printing where it involves the process of an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object. It all starts with a 3D model. The 3D printing industry will exceed 18 billion in revenue by 2022. 3D printing can be used in a variety of industries such as creating dental products, architectural scale model, movie props, reproducing bones for patients and many other things, 3 D printing is new to the world but growing at an exponential rate. There are some disadvantages in using 3D printing like it consumes a high amount of energy, it is very expensive, and not user-friendly, It has a very high reliance on plastic and is very slow.  Robotics Robotics is a branch of engineering that deals with the manufacture, design, and operation of robots. This field is a combination of electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology, and bioengineering. They are mainly developed to survive in extreme conditions which humans find it difficult to survive. Robots can take many forms but they are more tend to be made a humanoid, to work in the human population. There are many applications for robots varying according to their industry like medical robots, Service robots, military robots, space robots, etc. With numerous advantages there are also disadvantages of using robots like it cannot handle unexpected situations, Robots need maintenance and there is a heavy cost attached to it. Robots do not have emotions and tend to have an emotionless workplace, Robots operate on chips and memory and if it goes wrong entire company has to face the losses.  Blockchain It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\u201d Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority. Blockchain is a decentralised network and does not have any server or database requirement and can be used in a variety of applications. Blockchain's main fundamental step is to carry out transactions between two parties eliminating the factor of trust. Hence it opens whole new dimensions of possibility Blockchain can be used in Cryptocurrency, can also be used as smart property. Voting can also be done through Blockchain, With the help of Blockchain, we need to create only one identity for ourselves, no more carrying multiple cards. There are few Disadvantages like the data is extremely volatile, also we have heard about the bitcoin fraud and people who are not Tech-savvy are having a lot of difficulty in understanding Blockchain Technology.  There will be advantages and disadvantages of each and every innovation, but it is up to us as to how can we use it for the overall wellbeing of Humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "Just as it did in the past. The society creates technologies that change the human relationships and further on, the society that created them - and the cycle starts anew. Steam engine, electricity, computer, internet, Artificial Intelligence\u2026 the end will be a World Commonwealth in which the robots will do the hard and repetitive work, while men will do research, art, health care, education and any other creative or human involving activities\u2026 The resources dedicated to scientific research will be a thousand times more, and the mankind will develop at a tremendous pace. But the transition from actual society to the Post-Industrial society will be at least as difficult as the transition from Middle Age society to Industrial one (see French and Russian revolutions, Napoleonic wars, WWI&II\u2026) mainly because the actual ruling class is not willing to give up the power, and the source of its power is the framework of Industrial society. Add to that the climate change problem and the explosive social cocktail will become clear\u2026. ",
