            "answer_text": "CD quality is good but there are other audio formats that are more resolving and sound better. Much depends on the other components you have in the audio chain. Specifically, a good quality outboard DAC (digital to analogue converter) is needed to get the best sound out of your audio files. Good modern DAC s have the capability to effectively upsample CD and other digital audio files to higher resolution word and sampling rates. Beyond this, the speakers, amplifier and the digital source CD player, digital streamer, computer digital playback software has to of high quality to hear the difference in the various audio formats. The most resolving or high resolution audio files are called DSD 64 and DSD 128. Yes, providing you have a high quality audio playback system, you can hear increased clarity, definition, dynamic range and three dimensional positioning of the recoded instruments and vocals. My digital playback system: MacBook Air computer i7 / 512G SSD / 8 MB RAM with BitPerfect digital interface software ( a bargain at $10.00). I\u2019m using an I pad with direct as a remote control. Benchmark Media System DAC HGC This is a Swiss Army knife front end combining DAC, preamplifier, headphone amp, and a variety of analogue and digital inputs.  The Benchmark drives a mini DSP digital sound processor required for the amazing DIY Linkwitz LX Mini speaker system. You can build these for around $900 including Mini DSP. Madisound and others sell the entire kit and prebuilt speaker system. For more information refer to the Linkwitz lab web site.  I use inexpensive Crown XLS drivecore amps but there are many low cost amps that are recommend on the Linkwitz lab website. 4 channels of amplification is needed. This leading edge system can be fully assembled under $3,700USD less computer. With a system similar to this you can easily tell the difference between standard and high resolution digital audio files. ",

            "answer_text": "There IS better and it can be heard, but its not really a big enough difference to justify format switch unless your hearing is better, which is possible. Hearing varies greatly, unlike eyesight which falls into spatial, color, and color blindness. And spatial and color generally can be learned over a life time. Hearing is generally what you have is what you get. The Linux/open source formats tend to be better, partially cause they came later after someone asked themselves your very question. CD is promoted by the music industry MP3 is smartly marketed by the guy who privately owns it. DVD is owned by big computer companies and Hollywood Blu-Ray is Sony and Toshiba. So that's why you have the mediums and formats we use today. Not because any of that is superior, but because it's widely available. Personally Flac is a good compromise between best sound and useability. And of course Windows Media Audio. No, thier high end is good stuff. It just took up too much space for the early music players. Shouldn't be as much a problem now with 2TB SD cards. Edit about WMA full spec. Hell it would easily fill whole hard drives. Yeah, even now. I have a few 8TB drives. I could have done it, but that still doesn't allow the file size to transfer my collection into my 32GB limited phone. Even FLAC takes a 256GB, and that was only a third of my collection. Of course the average person owns less music I'm told, but I don't see how as all my friends have larger collections than I do. So the trade off is fantastic sound but hardly portable. \u2026 ",
