            "answer_text": "Apple products work really well together and having more Apple products mean you get more value out of them then owning them alone. However, most people who own Apple products own only one Apple product, the iPhone, and no others. So there is definitely value to getting an iPhone for those people.  Ultimately, it's worth it if it does what you need it to do. If an iPhone appears to meet those needs, then it definitely is worth it. ",
