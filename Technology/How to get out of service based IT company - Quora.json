            "answer_text": "I think you are already out of a service based IT company if you have already started thinking about it. Firstly let me make it absolutely clear that there are not as many IT product companies as IT service companies specifically in India and hence the vacancies in IT product companies are far less as compared to IT service companies. You need to think of a role say a Business Analyst which can fit well both in Product and service companies to get into. Also if you are fairly technical you need to look at roles like a Technical Architect, Solution architect which get you into Product Design and Architecture. If you are a developer then you need to see how your skills can get you into Product company. Besides all the above the most important thing you need to think of and do is - How do you sell your work which you have done at a service company to a product company. This would mean that the product company shall feel the need for you for the work you have done earlier. If you can do this, you are guaranteed a job in a IT product company. Thanks for the A2A. Hope this helps. ",
