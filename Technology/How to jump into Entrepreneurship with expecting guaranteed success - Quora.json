            "answer_text": "Success IS guaranteed. it is just forming a business. But the path is circuitous. Remember the school graduation - it is called commencement. Commencement means \u201cstart\u201d. What do you start after graduation? start learning. Not from books, but from failures.   Entrepreneurship is learning everything, most things no one bothers to teach you. Even when the success is guaranteed, \u201cafter a while\u201d, you still need to learn. The learning is through making mistakes. To succeed in starting a business is easy. You need to have experience and insider information, and some capital. As long as you have experience (typically earned from one failure), insider information (typically from knowing a field or a market really well), your guaranteed is guaranteed. That is why people with money always buy business instead of building it.  Failure is part of success. It is unavoidable. Experience it as soon as possible. Never spent all the time \u201csuccessfully\u201d avoiding them.  There are at least five types of entrepreneurship. Everyone is hard and epic. Make sure if you know what kind you want to start. Nothing is easy, because it is human nature to compete.  Each person must mature and get experience. Running a business is everyone\u2019s right, but you must pay the tuition.  To make sure you have a successful plunge and success, you must prepare before hand, and spend time afterwards. Then it is guaranteed. ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest you first to find a job. Acquire marketable skills so you can be useful for a company. Success is more guaranteed here. Entrepreneurship is very unstable and you will likely fail. Sorry to disappoint you but many businesses happen to not get as successful as you may want them to be. After the job, when you will get into entrepreneurial stuff you will need to have marketable products or services. So you can sell them to customers. Job gives you a good practical understanding of business. Entrepreneurship is business as well with exceedingly more risk. When you start with entrepreneurship first - your first venture - it\u2019s unlikely to expect it to be good. Because you get into something you never been before so you will make mistakes. Which will either be costly or frustrating. Good luck though I hope this helps you out. If you like this answer - upvote so others can see it.
