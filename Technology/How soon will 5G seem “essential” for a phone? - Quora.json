            "answer_text": "The current 5G baseband modems are still standalone chips. They have not been integrated into the system-on-a-chip (SoC). This means they will use significantly more power. In addition, they are 1st generation so that means performance and optimization are still being improved upon. 2nd generation 5G chips will appear this year. However, we will need to see 3rd generation for the first integrated 5G modems. These designs will start sampling in 3\u20134 months so that means the earliest SoC with 5G will be in 2020. These first SoC will be flagship chips on high-end phones. 5G won\u2019t trickle down to lower tier phones until probably late 2020. In addition, 5G deployment by US carriers should be steady by that point. Due to customer hardware refresh cycles, 5G will probably become a standard feature on most phones sold in 2021. Once 5G phones and the networks are common, we will then start to see applications that can utilize the higher throughput and lower latency. This will probably be 2021\u20132022 as developers need to account for the lowest common denominator. So\u2026. I\u2019m estimating: 2\u20133 years for 5G infrastructure to be common3\u20135 years for 5G applications to be common5\u20138 years before 5G becomes essentialThe thing that would accelerate making 5G essential is applications. What are the use cases that would benefit from the technology? Some historical reference to gauge my estimate: 4G devices and infrastructure first appeared in 2010\u20132011 so the technology has been available for 9 years. For many application, you would still be fine with 3G data rates (7\u201321Mbps) today. 4G is still not absolutely essential. Disclaimer: 3G, 4G, and 5G are actually a bunch of different technologies and marketing terms. To go into detail would take too long and be an exercise in frustration. ",
