            "answer_text": "27 years ago, my mom fell in love with my dad and they both eloped. 2 years later I was born and then a year later they welcomed my brother to this world. Few years later, my dad cheated on her. Left her emotionally heart broken. He did the bare minimum of paying fees for our education every year. And a bit for household support. For three people, that was never sufficient. She never finished her education so finding a job was difficult for her. She is an amazing cook. She knew that. She started cooking meals for people who are too busy to cook. She cooked, did the dishes. We were not allowed to help. We were asked to focus on our studies only. She made sure that my brother and I received proper nutrition. She had no one for emotional support as she eloped and married my dad against her parents\u2019 wishes. Therefore, she thought that she cannot tell them about it. And bore all the pain alone. She never bought any new clothes for herself unless she needed them. Her children\u2019s needs were always her priority. My brother and I were kids but we were sensitive enough to understand. We never went on school trips because we did not want to spend her hard earned money on school trips. We never went on a vacation. Couldn\u2019t afford. We hardly ate out. Well she is an amazing cook we really didn\u2019t need to do that. But whenever we did, it was mostly once or twice a year when we went to visit our maternal uncle and aunt. We did not go to movie theatres. We did not ask for games or toys. We always asked for books. We read all the time. We knew how important our success was and is to her. We did not go outside and play much. Few years ago, my brother and I started earning. We buy clothes only when we need them. When we buy them it is usually from local stores. We still read. A lot. We cook most of our meals at home. But also enjoy eating in restaurants and take our cousins with us. We watch movies in theatre once or twice a year. We relied on television initially and now we are able to afford Netflix. Things are bought only on need basis. We usually think about our cousins\u2019 education and prioritise helping them financially. We had it better than them, because of my mother\u2019s hard work and her focus on leading us to success, and want to look out for them. All our personal lifestyle choices are influenced by all the experiences that we had in the initial years of our life. ",
