            "answer_text": "The process of replacing Mainframes(or any old tech stack) with a new platform is called as Legacy Modernization. We have three approaches InvasiveHere the whole Software Suite/System is rewritten in an another tech stack. thereby replacing the Mainframe systems.Non-InvasiveHere the Tech stack is replaced by appropriate tools sets that has doesn\u2019t require full rewrite of the Software suite/System.Semi-InvasiveHere some parts are rewritten from Ground-Up, while others are Migrated to suitable tool sets that doesn\u2019t require rewriting/require minimal rewriting.I worked on a Semi-Invasive Project where the Mainframe Tech stack was being moved into a .NET based stack. We had a set of tools from Company Called Alchemy Solutions which had the following tools what allowed migration from Mainframes. 1. Mainframe COBOL -> Fujutsu NET COBOL(http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/software/developer-tool/netcobol/) 2. Mainframe Batch JCL -> Neobatch (Alchemy Solutions Announces Concurrent Releases of NeoBatch V3, NeoKicks V3 and NeoServices V4.2) 3. Mainframe CICS -> NeoKICKS/NeoServices. 4. Mainframes DB2 -> MS SQL Server 5. Mainframe CA Easytrive -> CA Easytrive for Windows. There were components in Languages such as Rexx, Natural-Adabas combinations that required to be rewritten. But, this may not be possible in all cases, specially if critical applications are written in Assembly Language or some other old platform. More than tech, people who can read and understand such programs are rarity these days, hence it is difficult to be rewritten into other Platform. In addition to this it can be Time Consuming and slow process, So unless necessary companies don\u2019t usually undertake such Migrations. ",

            "answer_text": "None. Companies stuck on the mainframe are unable to migrate to other custom software build solution. Most of the time it's worthless, too risky for operations and too effort consuming. They need mainframe specialist workforce to maintain and enhance these systems. For entirely new applications they do have choice to go for other technologies. To my mind the only practical option to replace mainframe is to move to some COTS I.e package solution. ",
