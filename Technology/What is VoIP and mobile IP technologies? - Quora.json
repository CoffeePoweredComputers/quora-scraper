            "answer_text": "VoIP is Voice over Internet protocol. It's bridge between traditional telco and Internet. More than 55% international communication are now using IP. Mobile IP is nothing but upgraded end user device to replace computer or PSTN network connected device to new generation device called Mobile, which uses last mile connectivity on spectrum. For example, when you call your friend or family in London from India using your mobile device. It uses your mobile provider's network to reach their local exchange, then local exchange uses VoIP switching to find routing table to reach UK. This connection from local exchange in India to UK user\u2019s operator's exchange is on Internet, (over ip). So this call is made using voip technology, from Indian operator to UK operator. Another example is when you call same friend or family in London from India but this time you both are on WhatsApp or Skype call. So here, end to end connection is over Internet (over ip). Hense you are using VoIP technology on your mobile. ",
