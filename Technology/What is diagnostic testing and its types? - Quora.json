            "answer_text": "In this lesson, we will cover the purpose and methods of certain diagnostic testing. Following basic screening tests, further diagnostic testing is often needed to monitor or understand diseases or dysfunctions. Diagnostic Testing Diagnostic techniques are used to figure out what disease, dysfunction, condition, or ailment is affecting an individual. These techniques are used to narrow down the possible options to come up with a final diagnosis. Often times, after initial screening tests are performed, a conclusive diagnosis has not been reached. It is in these times that further diagnostic testing procedures will be performed. Diagnostic Imaging Diagnostic imaging tests are the most common types of procedures used after screening tests. The following will explain the types of tests that are used to aid in the diagnosis of a patient's condition. X-rays: X-rays are used to detect issues pertaining to the musculoskeletal system of a person, meaning that x-rays are used to identify issues having to do with our bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. For example, if a person fell off their bike and hurt their arm, an x-ray would be taken to confirm whether or not a bone has been broken. In some instances, x-rays can be used with contrast. The patient will ingest a liquid or pill, or be injected with a substance that will highlight a specific area when the x-ray is taken.MRI: MRI stands for magnetic resonance imaging. In this procedure, a high powered magnet is spinning around the patient that delivers information through a scanner and creates an image that doctors can look at. An MRI is also used to detect issues within the musculoskeletal system. However, the MRI is a bit more specific than an x-ray and is able to pick up a lot more information. With an MRI we can view the organs and soft tissues of a person. You can even take an MRI of someone's brain. The MRI is very useful in detecting and monitoring disease processes such as cancer or organ issues.Ultrasound: Ultrasound is a very common procedure that can be used to detect the functions of certain organs. It is best to know for testing and monitoring during pregnancy. The ultrasound tool sends tiny vibrations through the area being tested. When those vibrations hit the affected area, they travel back to the ultrasound tool which then creates an image. This image outlines the area being looked at. If a pregnant lady goes for an ultrasound, the tool will show the outline of the baby. In addition, it will show the heartbeat and other functions of the baby to make sure it is healthy. The image created by ultrasound is like a live video feed.CT/PET: CT stands for computed tomography and PET stands for positron emission tomography. A CT scan is comparable to an x-ray, except that a CT scan takes many x-ray images from multiple angles. All these images are then combined using a computer to make a very detailed image of the area being tested. With a PET scan, a radioactive substance is put into the body. This substance is picked up by the PET scan to show how certain organs are working inside the body. The PET scan not only shows images but also a live video feed of the radioactive substance traveling through the areas being tested.Radionuclide Scanning: This type of scanning is similar to a PET scan. A small amount of radioactive substance is put into the body and picked up by the scan. The radioactive substance can be direct to a specific organ to show how well the organ is functioning, or if there is something wrong with it. This type of scan is often used to detect tumors or cancerous processes. It is also known as nuclear medicine imaging.If you want to know more about this then I will suggest to you this link Mobile Diagnostic Testing.

            "answer_text": "The doctor starts his exam with a complete medical history \u2026 what\u2019s happened to you through the years and may include your family history. He then moves to a physical assessment poking and prodding, checking for range of movement, eyes, ears, and oral cavity, lungs and heart. Based on this, he looks internal to blood tests that will evaluate the organs he can barely palpate externally. For maximum efficiency for him and you, the LAB TESTS are drawn BEFORE he see\u2019s you for your convenience as well as the doctors. With the TRIAD (History, physical and organ assessment) he can give you a \u201cYour healthy \u2026 keep it up\u201d or prescribe drugs to make you better with just one day of your time. If problems were found that may require further workup, those can be scheduled by his office (X-Ray or Specialist or additional lab work). The CBC tube (lavender) looks at bone marrow production (anemia), infection if white cells are elevated, The Chemistry tube (Red or Green) measures enzymes produced from different organs and electrolytes that balance the blood, glucose level to measure diabetic potential and waste products BUN and Creatinine that measure Kidney function. The urine tube catches asymptomatic bladder infections and overall health. ",
