            "answer_text": "Ah, this question again! Well let\u2019s ask Richard Feynman. I have to say physicists can be arrogant, and we shouldn\u2019t blame them. There is a certain culture that physics undergrads are brought up to believe, by people and their professors, that magnifies this belief. Among them I\u2019ve heard physics professors making jokes about engineers having trouble with PDE\u2019s and that mathematicians just solve things and never apply them. I mean who doesn\u2019t think Einstein was a genius? However Newton was a mathematical genius too. I\u2019ve also taken graduate level math and engineering courses in several fields, and they have the most respect for physicists. It was Cauchy who first looked at momentum transfer way before the Navier-Stokes equation was written in modern form (~1920\u2019s), and he was a mathematician! In the end, I could list things that are easier or harder for an undergrad physics or math or engineering student, but let\u2019s just say everyone\u2019s equal. I\u2019m not going to say either is smarter because they are both hard fields, just different. It\u2019s arrogant to call people from a field smarter than another just because of the field. You won\u2019t get very far doing that and you should look at the person to make that judgment. In terms of difficulty, I think the undergrad physics/engineering curriculums are loaded down while the math curriculum is lighter, and if you are smart you can get by without much studying until the senior/grad proof based courses, which will tear you up if you don\u2019t study. A senior physicist/engineer would not have made it that far without already knowing how to study. But in grad school it\u2019s equally tough. The few students I\u2019ve known who doubled in physics/math were always good, but I chose physics over math later on because I cannot stand proofs, especially in real or functional analysis. That\u2019s because I\u2019d rather solve a physical problem than do a proof. I know people who are the opposite of me and chose math for graduate studies. It really just comes down to different ways a physicist/mathematician/engineer looks at things. And I had to include engineers in my answer because this is asked about engineers too. I hope that helps!  ",
