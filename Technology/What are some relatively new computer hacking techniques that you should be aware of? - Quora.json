            "answer_text": "While the phishing method itself is decades old, these phishing attacks use new approach which I found effective and relatively unknown, hence should be taken seriously. Most of us use push notification - that small message window which appears on the right bottom corner of your screen, when you get notified about news or updates from websites or apps. Almost every website offers push notification subscription:  Once you subscribe to one of those, your browser stores the website notification and eventually sends notifications even if the browser is closed. Today, I experienced new attack vector which will continue to grow along with the popularity of push notifications. While working on my computer, I received quite odd notification:  So what\u2019s odd about it? I don\u2019t have McAfee antivirusLow-resolution imageWrong grammar - it should be McAfee, not Mcafee.Since I never interacted with McAfee products on that computer nor I subscribed for his website notifications, I started to wonder about this message. There were too many red flags, so I was 100% confident that it was some sort of attack. I tried to play with it in my safe lab environment and see what happens next. Well, you probably wouldn't be surprised if I tell you that any attempt to close this message would lead you to a phishing link:  So, I wondered how did I end up received phishing notifications? Apparently, hackers simply hacked the website and sent push notifications with infected link to all users. I immediately removed the website from my Notification list. I was unpleasantly surprised when I discovered too many websites with weak security which could eventually lead to their downfall and series of attacks on subscribers. My recommendation is to go ahead and leave only few essential push notifications in your browser. If you are wondering how to do it, here is a brief instruction on how to remove Notifications from Chrome Browser: Go to \u201cSettings\u201dScroll to the bottom and click on \u201cAdvanced\u201d Find \u201cSite Settings\u201d and click on them Find \u201cNotifications\u201d and click on them Remove all unnecessary websites from notifications. You might be surprised to find websites which you never followed or even don\u2019t remember visiting. In my case it was cbssports. which was funny enough because I never watch sports nor I dare to spend my time on watching games. Click on icon to the right and select \u201cRemove\u201d.Since previous attacks were mostly done through annoying phishing emails that ended up in spam folder or were blocked by browser extensions as AD pop-up messages, this is relatively new attack vector which allows hackers to attack unsuspecting users. And remember - if you see any odd push notification, even if your browser is closed - don\u2019t click on it! ",
