            "answer_text": "That depends on your skill level, what makes and models of cars you want to diagnose, if you want to program modules and of course, how much you can afford to spend. If your skill level is low (maybe a single year of training) you would likely be able to get by with a basic unit that costs less than $1,000. But, if you\u2019re a master tech with awesome diagnostic skills working on all makes and models you will likely need more than one unit and will probably spend $10,000 or more plus several thousand every year to keep your units updated and functional. As far as brands go, there are many and which brand you choose will depend on what testing and programming features you need and what makes and models you want to diagnose. Also don\u2019t forget that some services you may want to perform might require you to buy a license to get the information and pay a fee for each service you provide. And finally, some brands can not be purchased, only leased. ",

He still needs to understand all the terminology and devices on all cars. Not something I can do, and I\u2019ve done most of my own work for 60 years. Example, all of Fords EcoBoost components. Parts for those can cost up to $2,000! ",
