            "answer_text": " If you love science and entrepreneurship, I highly recommend focusing on the field of science that you find most interesting. Don\u2019t pick a science \u201cbecause it equips you best\u201d. There is no such thing. Accountancy is great for book-keeping, law - for drafting agreements, finance - for keeping your cashflow healthy. If you study the field that you find truly fascinating, you will see what problems it faces. You will notice that certain tasks take forever to complete and that could be optimised. And that is where your entrepreneurial character will come in handy! After all all businesses solve some problem that the client faces. Do you think someone grows up thinking they will be supplying motherboards? Or deep cleaning car seats? Or perhaps you have always wanted to open a vegan restaurant in Antarctica? Of course not. And that\u2019s the key - you find opportunities on your way, as you explore a field - or multiple fields - in-depth. Become an expert in whatever you love, and you will see business opportunities where others will fail to see it. \u2014\u2014 Hope this helps!
