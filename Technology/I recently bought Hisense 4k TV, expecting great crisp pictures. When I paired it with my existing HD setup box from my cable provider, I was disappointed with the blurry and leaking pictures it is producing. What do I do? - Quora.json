            "answer_text": "There are several issues or potential issues here. As others have pointed out, Hisense is a budget electronics company with a poor reputation for quality. They\u2019re not all junk but even their top-of-the-line models are usually equivalent or inferior to midrange sets from more reputable brands.Your settings, on your cable box and/or your TV, could be less than ideal. Try to make sure your cable box is outputting a 1080i or 1080p signal, as opposed to 720p or (heaven forbid) standard definition. Turn off things like motion smoothing on the TV. Try turning down the sharpness setting - it sounds silly but usually this results in a better picture, as what that setting does is make artificial \u201chalos\u201d around edges to create the illusion of sharpness from a distance, actually reducing detail.There is no such thing as 4K cable yet. Some cable boxes can output 4K for apps like Netflix, but anything you watch on cable itself is still in 1080i or 720p, or, sometimes, 1080p for \u201cOn Demand\u201d movies. Additionally, broadcasts over digital cable are very heavily compressed, further reducing image quality. So what happens is you wind up taking a low-quality signal with a resolution as low as 1280x720, having your cable box blow that up to 1920x1080, passing it to the TV, with the TV then blowing it up further to 3840x2160. That means you\u2019re using multiple pieces of equipment to essentially zoom in on a low-quality source to 9x magnification.So just watching cable is never going to get you an especially good picture on your new 4K TV. If you have Netflix, see if your cable box has an app for it, or your TV could have an app as well, and then see if you can watch it in 4K. Alternatively, for the best-quality source, buy a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player and some discs. Obviously though that\u2019s quite an additional expense.",

            "answer_text": "Assuming there is no defect with the TV, you\u2019re probably supplying your 4K TV with 720p or 480p input from your cable box. Thats a fraction of the resolution that your TV can display and it will by default upscale all inputs to ITS OWN native resolution which is 4K. So naturally your images look blurry and shabby. You need to upgrade your input quality by buying 4K BDs or get Netflix 4K or atleast get a FHD BDP. Then try and look at those images - they should be much better. This is why I always caution folks (pls see my other answers) who want the latest greatest 4K TV because of the fancy ads and the awesome pictures they see in the showroom. If you then connect such a TV to a signal which is much lower resolution then the results are disappointing. Much better to buy an FHD TV and wait for more daily 4K content to become available. ",
