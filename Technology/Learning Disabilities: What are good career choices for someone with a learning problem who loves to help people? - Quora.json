            "answer_text": "It really depends on the learning disabilities, and what kind of compensatory skills or coping strategies a person has learned to apply. Having LD's does not mean you cannot complete college.  I would suggest going to college and studying social work.  This will help you learn about all the ways people need help, and you can choose from among them, because you will have a college degree. If you absolutely cannot imagine going to college at this point in your life, there are positiions for assistants in group homes, or hospitals, that do not require a degree.  The pay is low, but it is good experience. Another option is to try to get a position being a helper to an elderly couple.  In that case, you would do many different things for them, and they might pay better. ",

I know of a couple of people who compensated for dyslexia and did very well in college, one graduating in agriculture and the other with a MS in Mechanical Engineering (magna cum laude), but neither can read very fast and they have to watch numbers closely. I would recommend you subject yourself to some testing and see what your options are. Good luck, Jim ",
