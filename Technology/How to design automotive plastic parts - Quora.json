            "answer_text": "Plastic Part design could become tricky and compromises and trade-offs usually lead to failures. Automotive OEM\u2019s will mainly use plastic material in cosmetic components and some other non-load carrying components. Main features of plastic part design would include: Good Knowledge of Material Database - There are many sources of data available for 100\u2019s of plastic material types and grades in the market. But very few would provide complete understanding of material properties. When select the plastic materials, temperature and time variation of strength should be considered, as it could significantly lead to development of creep & fatigue.Type of Loading & Application - Short term cyclic loading or long term constant load. In both cases, the maximum allowable stresses are going to be significantly lesser than the tensile strength of material. The environmental exposure of the part can also decide the life of the part as it degrades on coming in contact with chemicals, UV rays, sunlight and temperature.Part Design Features - Many factors like ribs, notches, wall thickness, holes can contribute to stress concentration & residual stresses in the part. Thus careful consideration of part features should be done in order to optimize the stress lines within the part. For example, any abrupt change in wall thickness may lead to high stress concentration and thus reduce strength of the part.Process Induced issues - process control parameters like cooling time, heating temperature, poor material mixing, poor part design leading to improper material flow can significantly affect the structural characteristics & quality of the part.Basically, the manufacturer try to cut costs by compromising on either of these factors which should be taken care by the product engineering team of the automotive company.

Consider you are manufacturing a pen cap, this means it will be injection moulded. This means you need to consider the part drafts depending on the tooling. If your part is extrusion moulded, then your part will be more simple, with no drafts. Have a look at this site for more information on plastic design and plastic manufacturing processes.
