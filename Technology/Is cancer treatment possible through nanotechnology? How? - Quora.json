            "answer_text": "Nano-enabled immunotherapy and number of approaches, including checkpoint inhibition and cellular therapies. The results for some patients have been spectacular. the benefits of immunotherapy requires a greater understanding of tumor-host immune system interactions. New technologies for molecular and functional analysis of single cells are being used to interrogate tumor and immune cells and elucidate molecular indicators and functional immune responses to therapy. Delivering Chemotherapy The traditional use of nanotechnology in cancer therapeutics has been to improve the pharmacokinetics and reduce the systemic toxicities of chemotherapies through the selective targeting and delivery of these anticancer drugs to tumor tissues. The advantage of nanosized carriers is that they can increase the delivered drug\u2019s overall therapeutic index through nanoformulations in with chemotherapeutics are either encapsulated or conjugated to the surfaces of nanoparticles. This capability is largely due to their tunable size and surface properties. Size is a major factor in the delivery of nanotechnology-based therapeutics to tumor tissues. Selective delivery of nanotherapeutic platforms depends primarily on the passive targeting of tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon relies on defects specific to tumor microenvironment such as defects in lymphatic drainage, along with increased tumor vasculature permeability, to allow nanoparticles (<200 nm) to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the timing or site of drug release can be controlled by triggered events, such as ultrasound, pH, heat, or by material composition. Several members of the Alliance are working towards developing nanomaterial-based delivery platforms that will reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutics and increase their overall effectiveness. Developing a strategy for photodynamic therapy, which would bypass the toxicity that currently limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma patients. This strategy is designed for use in bone marrow, which is normally inaccessible to external radiation sources. Delivering Gene Therapy The value of nanomaterial-based delivery has become apparent for new types of therapeutics such as those using nucleic acids, which are highly unstable in systemic circulation and sensitive to degradation. These include DNA and RNA-based genetic therapeutics such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs). Gene silencing therapeutics, siRNAs, have been reported to have significantly extended half-lives when delivered either encapsulated or conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles. These therapeutics are used in many cases to target \u2018undruggable\u2019 cancer proteins. Additionally, the increased stability of genetic therapies delivered by nanocarriers, and often combined with controlled release, has been shown to prolong their effects. ",

            "answer_text": "There are multiple ideas and some some treatments already in practice. Larger Cancer cells feed at 100 nano meters(nm) smaller regular healthy cells feed at 10 nm. 50 nm gold nano particle spheres made to fit in the 100 (nm) cancer cells and which cannot fit in healthy cells are filled with chemotherapy like drugs in their hollow spheres .Invivo (able to be in body) binding agents hold the chemo drugs in the spheres releasing only when it makes contact with a chemical only found inside the cancer cells.When the cancer eats the gold spheres it dies without hurting normal cells.2) Magnetically attracted nano particles are moved into areas containing cancer cells with powerful magnets. The large cancer cells absorb the nano particles and the healthy cells do not because the nano particles are too big . Low dosages of radiation are specifically beamed into that area with the nano particles .The gold spheres in the particles absorb the thermal heat from the radiation and burn up the cancer cells saving the healthy cells with a lot less harm to the body.
