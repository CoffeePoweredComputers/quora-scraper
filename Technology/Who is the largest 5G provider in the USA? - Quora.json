            "answer_text": "Q: Who is the largest 5G provider in the USA? A: Today, at this moment in time, T-Mobile has the latest 5G network. I just spoke to T-Mobile and here is the truth of what is going on:That is completely misleading because all that T-Mobile did was a tiny update to the 4G system so it can offer 5G in the Low Band only.Low Band 5G is barely above the 4G band so in practical use you will not see and significant difference between themThat means that T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network will feel to you like its 4G network feels to you, thee is no practical use for it other than to show 5H on your phone\u2019s displayYou will not see a useful improvement until (IF) T-Mobile deploys High Band 5GHigh Band 5G is what the media is making all the noise aboutit will deliver very high speed connectionsYou only get those connections if you are standing outside, in direct view of the 5G High Band tower and are no more than 2 blocks away from that tower (or in a sports stadium)In other words High Band 5G will be used by very few people, very little of the time, its mostly marketing hypeSoon Verizon and AT&T will finish deploying their Low Band 5G and one of them will be the biggest 5G cell network in the US of A.It seems obvious that the only usefulness of 5G will occur:Inside sports stadiums where high speed signals can be beamed to a small group of seats at a time, they will receive the High Band mmWave signal so they can get texts and social media out very quicklyThe same could be said for usefulness at Convention Centers where the attendees often overload the local cell towers, High Band nnWave 5G could alleviate all that congestion and because everyone is close to the antenna they should get high speed all the timeMid Band 5G could deliver a bit more speed than Low Band 5G and far more range than High Band 5G (not as much range as Low Band 5G) but hopefully this will help us with getting maps to our cars quickly, when traveling. This could be especially helpful when traveling cross country and you need new maps constantlyOther than that 5G will not be much more useful than 4G for most people, most of the time",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve watched in the recent tech videos of MKBHD that there is no largest 5G provide in the USA. This new technology is still on the process of being implemented to the whole country. Although some networks such as T-Mobile and Verizon had already announced their implementation of it, the real deal is when they finished the infrastructures needed. The current system they\u2019re offering is not reliable. Therefore, you can\u2019t measure yet on which companies offer the largest coverage in USA. Here\u2019s what you need to know: T-Mobile\u2019s 5G implementation is based on the highest frequency level. Yes, you get the fastest internet connection. But, you lag with the signal when you\u2019re covered by big physical objects like trees and tall buildings. Verizon\u2019s 5G implementation is based on the lowest frequency level. This ensures you get a mobile data connection even if you\u2019re covered by a tree or a tall building. They do this so that everyone on the ground level will get a fast mobile data connection like 5G. They\u2019re still rolling out to cover the entire country with this new technology. ",
