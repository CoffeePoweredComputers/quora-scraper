            "answer_text": "My answer is to the advantages and disadvantages of current and future manufacturing technology in the USA. Two advantages of technology to the USA are the following: Modern manufacturing technology lets high-wage earners in the USA compete with low-wage earners using older and simpler technology elsewhere on price, functionality and quality now and in the future since it multiplies the amount of work each person does by factors of ten to a thousand times depending on the technology employed.An example is the use of modern CAD/CAM systems to design a product or a single part in a CAD system and automatically program an automated two-spindle mill-turn machining center to produce the part in a single step compared to a machine shop full of single function machines in a developing nation. The product produced on the mill-turn could not be matchedModern manufacturing technology lets high-wage earners in the USA produce parts that could not be matched by low-wage earners using older and simpler technology elsewhere. An example of this is an automobile engine that could not be matched in a low-wage country with older technology due to the fact that the engine would last longer, require less fuel, need less maintenance and have far better performance thanks to closer machining tolerances.Two disadvantages of manufacturing technology to the USA are: Technology is very costly; the investment in technology occurs a year or more before the return on investment starts to occur; and it may well take several years for a business to break even on its investment in technology.The business tax system in the USA which taxes profits and disallows deducting the full cost of capital equipment at the time the equipment is purchased from after-tax profits. The only source of funds for the acquisition of new technology is after-tax-profits; even when the acquisition cost is financed it must eventually be paid from that portion of profits that remain after governments take their bite out of the profits a business earns making it harder for manufacturers in the USA to exploit technology.",

            "answer_text": "HELLO, Manufacturing Technology provides the tools that enable production of all manufactured goods. These master tools of industry magnify the effort of individual workers and give an industrial nation the power to turn raw materials into the affordable, quality goods essential to today\u2019s society. In short, we make modern life possible.  Advantages of Manufacturing Technology :- Increase in Quality / Decrease in Human Error :- Quality enhancement is one of the main benefits of manufacturing technology. With production software, humans are needed less and robotics begin to play a substantial role.Cost Reduction :- Cost reduction is one of the key goals within manufacturing technology. This is because of the correction of inefficiencies and waste being reduced within the production process, which saves a drastic amount of money in the long run.Reduction in Overall Production Time :- The longer the production process is - the more it is going to cost. Manufacturing technologies drive the production process and get products out in a much more efficient manner.Disadvantages of Manufacturing Technology :- Limited Creativity :- Manufacturing technology completely limits creativity due to the abundance of automation/machinery and lack of employees within the production facility.Contribution to Environmental Issues :- Global warming is a large concern for many individuals around the globe - with manufacturing being a substantial contributor to it.Unemployment Increase :- Unemployment has been a major concern for manufacturing since automation began to play a role.Buy B2B Email Lists ",
