            "answer_text": "There are Chinese companies that will do the work for you. Google \u201cchina make PCBs\u201d. I\u2019ve made simple ones with copper clad board, resist pens and etchant solution. Clean the copper surface, paint resist where you want copper, then immerse in etchant. Clean etchant with solvent, drill holes where needed. Photo sensitive etchant boards are available - you print your circuit onto a transparency sheet, place it on the board, and expose to UV light. Develop the image and etch. I worked for a research company, we made prototypes and small production runs before farming the work out to manufacturers. We mostly used Wire Wrap - it can make exceedingly complex layouts, though it takes time! Wire wrap - Wikipedia I still use it when making Arduino based electronics. Most of the processor boards and peripherals are supplied with wire wrap compatible connectors. Even the Uno can be used with long pin header strips plugged into the wire socket rails. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok\u2026well I\u2019m going to assume you have the schematics and that you have your layout and the circuit connectors all designed as I don\u2019t know where you are in the process. With the technology available you can get a PCB printer (not cheap), but if you are going to create PCB\u2019s as part of a business, well worth the investment. If this is a one off (or three off) then you can send the design files to companies like JLCPCB, PCBGOGO or any other company that can make the one off/mass produce as needed without the need to invest in the capital (equipment). This makes most of these companies are actually affordable with low volume work. ",
