            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026 if you have a YouTube channel I think following along with this project might be \u201centertaining\u201d to watch. So\u2026 I've been engineering things for longer than I can remember and I've seen questions of this form thousands of times. I'm about to lay some harsh reality on you, and you're not going to like it\u2026 someone told me this maybe 30 years ago and it took many years for me to accept how right they were. \u201cIt sounds like you're in over your head, go get an education\" We see questions like yours all the time on maker groups, and I've answered a few like this on Quora as well. I think it boils down to: how do I determine [trivial aspect] when designing [thing I know nothing about]? See, if you were ready to design and build your own 3D printer, there's no way you could need to ask anyone this question. You would know that the build volume is essentially just \u201ceverywhere the tool can reach\" and since you would have the measurements of your machine, you would know exactly what that is. It is very simple really\u2026 the build volume is simply the extent of travel that your extruder head can cover. So, if it's capable of 10 centimeters in the X and Y direction, and 7 centimeters vertically\u2026 your build volume is quite obviously 10x10x7=700 cubic cm. Right? How is that not obvious to a 3D printer designer? I know you're probably not going to accept this, but the fact that you can ask this question means your project is likely going to fail because you lack the knowledge to complete it. If you are very persistent, you might be able to learn as you go, but success stories using that method are rare, and again, usually involve people who would never ask a question like this. Sorry to be harsh but I'm trying to save you a lot of frustration and money. It sounds like you're headed into a very common trap. ",

            "answer_text": "Model it in CAD. I designed and built several printers and modelled them in CAD beforehand. This was very successful. I wanted acrylic panels for the sides. Modelled those and got them laser cut. Took them home and just screwed them on. You don\u2019t need incredible skills for this I used Tinkercad, its free and takes only a modest effort to learn. Another way is to just build it and then see how far the nozzle can move around without hitting anything in X and Y. You might then adjust how the hotend is mounted or how the X or Y axes are mounted to get a bit more print area. ",
