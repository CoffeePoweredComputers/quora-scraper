            "answer_text": "Yes. iPhones have several temperature sensors, but\u2026 iPhones have internal device temperature sensors. They do not measure air temperature. They measure specific device temperatures, such as the internal temperatures of the iPhone\u2019s processor and battery. I found no specifications published to indicate their accuracy or responsiveness. One would assume they are reasonably accurate, but that depends upon what you intend to measure, and the levels of precision and accuracy required. To check battery temperatures, I tried an app called Battery and Charger test. (Lirum and several other apps are available which claim to to do the same). Battery temperatures are reported in C. System Status Pro, and other apps purport to report internal sensor temperatures as well; I have not tried or tested any of them. If you are a developer, Swift would allow you to access such information. Aside from diagnostic purposes, reporting battery or processor temperatures may be interesting, but of minimal value. There are many options for external add-on sensors with wireless communications (bluetooth, Wifi, etc). They would allow you to measure ambient air temperature, such as the room in which you are in, or another location in your home, office, or data center for example. For portable readings that can measure the ambient air temperature where you and wherever you are, 2 options I found are Thermodo or iCelsius. They plug into the lightning port, and provide precision temperature readings (single decimal point precision). Thermodo is a small button that attaches to the iPhone. iCelsius produces handheld type probes sensors. Each would allow you to measure the ambient air temperature of an indoor room, or, for example, the interior air temperature of a car, or outdoor air temperature in your exact location. It seems like a simple function that should be easily available, but isn\u2019t. I hope that helps. If you discover (or develop!) something better, please let me know. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Yes, it has an internal temperature sensor - probably more than one. iOS uses these sensors to decide when it\u2019s necessary to shut the phone down in order to protect its circuitry from damage due to overheating. If you ever leave an iPhone sitting in the hot sun, particularly if it\u2019s on a dark surface, you\u2019ll likely see this kind of shutdown. No, it has no external temperature sensor. It\u2019s actually difficult to get a reliable reading of the temperature in an area - you\u2019re more likely to find the temperature of the phone or the surface it\u2019s resting on than the temperature of the air around the phone\u2019s user, which is almost certainly what the user is looking for.
