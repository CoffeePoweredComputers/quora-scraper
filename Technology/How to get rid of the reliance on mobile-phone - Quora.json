            "answer_text": "I keep my data & WiFi turned off and only turn it one when I specifically want to check something. From the time I get home in the evening to when I leave the house next, my phone is in my bedroom - it's doesn't come out, unless I'm listening to a podcast while cooking or cleaning, and again, even then, WiFi is turned off. I find being removed from the phone helps my reliance upon it. I do catch myself at times, when my attention drifts during a TV program, or something, and I think, I should check Facebook, or my emails or whatever. It's in those moments I have to remind myself, 'I don't need it. Remain present.' Waiting for my morning and afternoon training, I keep my phone in my pocket. Instead I observe everyone else around me on their phone. The same at bars and restaurants or in a waiting room. Anywhere in our lives where the phone becomes the tool for eliminating boredom. I'm learning to reclaim these moments and say, it's ok to be bored, to be UNSTIMULATED.  I've discovered over time my brain need to be jacked out from time to time. Helps it rest and refresh. Good luck to you. I hope you find some solutions that suit your life and help you achieve what you want to. ",

What u can do to start developing a rage is to set ur cell phone display brightness to the lowest in day time and highest in the night.. In this way, u ll start to develop an irritation to watch it n ll avoid it's unnecessary usage sooner and with the time u ll start to use it only as much as its needed.. ",
