            "answer_text": "Put the blue pair of your wires that you are holding into the purple port. Make sure BOTH sides of the blue pair bottom out in their respective hole in the purple port. Then, holding them in the port bottomed-out in their holes, push the purple port upward until it won't go any farther. To make sure it's right, tug on each side of the blue pair separately. They should not come loose. If they do, redo it, and make sure they bottom out this time. Detach the little \u201cdoor\u201d that closes over those ports at the hinge, and use scissors to cut off the bottom bar (top bar since it\u2019s upside down in your picture). Then put the door back on, and close it. This is assuming the red/green pair of wires that comes out of the side/back of that splitter are already attached to the green surge protector on the other side of your picture. If not, do that too. Strip back about 3/4 inch of wire on each of the red/green pair and screw them down to the green surge protector, 1 wire to a side. You will need a 5/8 socket tool for this, or at least some pliers. Terminate the jack in the house using the blue pair. If you have home phone along with DSL, use the green or orange pair to carry your dial tone to the jack. Dial tone will come out of the other 3 ports in the splitter. ",
