            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t try to learn guitar with technology alone but I do use it a great deal in my studies. My phone is one of my most important teachers. I use YouTube to learn a particular skill I\u2019m focusing on (be careful there are a lot of bad teachers and rarely do guitar teachers agree on anything in my experience!), I utilise social media to push myself and to find encouragement and support that helps me. Most importantly I have folders & folders of apps I use in creative ways. I have the Guitar Techniques app that\u2019s fantastic but it\u2019s not for beginners in my opinion. I use a wide range of metronomes & rhythm trainers, I use writing tools like chord progression builders, apps with backing tracks, music theory apps, music discovery apps, apps that teach licks, songs, techniques. I subscribe to JamPlay & buy courses from Udemy. There\u2019s an abundance of different websites that give great free lessons, Scribd has all the books you\u2019ll ever need, Ultimate Guitar & Songsterr have all the tabs you\u2019ll ever need. I use technology to help me learn every day but I do it creatively. Use technology to problem solve, inspire you & help develop your creativity and it\u2019ll be your best musical friend! ",

            "answer_text": "The fastest and most fun way to learn guitar is The Rhythm Method. I created it if for those who get frustrated trying to learn guitar. It focuses on training the strumming hand until it is second nature, then learning chords and scales after your rhythm is solid and second nature. The Three Essential Guitar Chords According to my bud, Andy B, the three most common guitar chords every man should know are G Major, C Major and D Major. From our experience beginner guitarists are more likely to be successful if they start on acoustic guitar. They are quick and easy to use. However you can of course learn on an electric guitar as both types of instruments share similar layouts. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Guitar Learning material there... ",
