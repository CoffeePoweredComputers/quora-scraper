There is some evidence that higher minimum wages cause employment problems in low rent areas but may raise employment in higher cost of living areas.Major infrastructure improvements could act as a significant stimulus.The internet and expanded credit by examination can provide mass education at very low overall cost and no net charges to students. Open source projects like MIT open courseware can be readily expanded and aid for credit by examination can be made very easy to get. I would pay for that by a tax on inreases in investments that exceed historical rates upon the upper 1%.I would switch away from broad payroll taxes and consumption taxes to taxes on asset concentration to couner the trickle up effects we have seen in recent years but be careful to avoid taxing investors likely to have asset appreciation below that we have seen among the upper 1%.

            "answer_text": "First of all, let\u2019s note that we should never expect unemployment, as currently measured, to go away completely. Economists agree that a certain percentage of workers will always be transitioning between jobs at a given time. In the US, it is generally agreed that this so-called \u201cnatural rate of unemployment\u201d is around 5%. It is possible for the rate to go below this number temporarily, but it isn\u2019t generally sustainable outside of a war mobilization situation. Now, unemployment above the natural rate is a problem. If it exists, then by definition there must be a detectable number of workers who want jobs but can\u2019t find them. This means that at the currently existing wages, there are more workers that want jobs than open jobs available. How can we fix this? Many ways: Kill the unemployed. Not really on the table but it works; the Black Death caused a massive increase in wages for the survivors and there sure wasn\u2019t an unemployment problem anymore.Wait. Eventually employers will notice that they can pay workers less, so wages will drop, which will do two things. First, it will cause some employers to want to hire. Second, some workers will stop looking for jobs, or maybe cut back on their hours, second jobs, etc. Eventually we hit the point where supply equals demand and we\u2019re back to no structural unemployment. Also, over time, workers will retrain so that they are more desirable to employers, which will cause them to get hired.Do stuff that will cause wages to decrease. Remove regulations like minimum wage laws that drive up wages. Make it harder for unions to do the stuff they do.Do stuff that will get workers to accept lower wages. Cut unemployment and welfare benefits.Cause inflation, and make it hard for businesses to raise wages to match. For bonus points, make it possible for some sectors of the economy to raise wages, and impossible for others, based on politics. (Or even more fun reasons like racism).Do stuff that will get workers to leave the labor force entirely (stop looking for jobs). This is kind of an abuse of the fact that the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t count people who aren\u2019t looking for jobs.Do stuff that encourages hiring at the current wages. This is what most people actually want the government to do. Cut payroll taxes. Hand out subsidies to employers who hire the unemployed.Have the government create jobs. Increase spending on public projects. For a more extreme version, pay people to do useless stuff like digging holes and them filling them in again. Some New Deal programs in the 1930s US were not too far removed from that.Now, the stuff that tends to work reliably and without causing other problems (at least what economists view as problems) are the first 4. Note that these are all unpopular to varying degrees. It is a reasonable point of view that unemployment means that workers either lack skills that actually produce value for employers, or are asking for too much money for the skills they actually have. The more popular stuff either tends to make utter chaos out of the economy (inflation, regulations aimed at forcing businesses not to fire peope), or require increased levels of taxation, which eventually harms economic growth. So popular policies tend to have a flavor of solving short-term problems by creating long-term ones. If we want to help people who are unemployed, (which I think is a good idea, as do most people), it\u2019s probably better to simply help out those who are poor for whatever reason, and let the labor market take care of itself. Mix in programs intended to help the low-skilled workers acquire more skills (and free/cheap college is a very inefficient way to do this) to taste. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you solve unemployment? The problem with employment, and having people being productive, is a question impossible to answer, as few comprehend what the word employment means. The world, even America who should know better, has adapted the worldwide fallacy of identifying who is, and who is not employed. In the world of commerce, where goods and services are created, and in the free choice of demand, bought and sold within society\u2026those involved\u2026are employed. As this is fact, as was identified by Adam Smith, in the 17th century, in his attempt to understand how, or why this exchange of goods and services works, make his postulates of why it works. Even he made some major mistakes being blind at not comprehending how it works, or why it is so successful. Obvious in his conclusion of the invisible hand, when the why it works is so obvious. There is great confusion among society, to what, or how, employment and the commerce\u2026the economy\u2026of the nation works. Commerce, and the economy, requires that there are producers, and purchasers. All of those who are\u2026what we identify as employed\u2026which do not meet these requirements are by some means of obtaining wealth, without producing, called employed, when they do not provide anything to the real foundations of an economy. The examples, are many that provide services required in a nation, the military, police, and the civil protections of fire safety. Yet in this corrupt concept of what or so called economy consists of all who are employed by government, the politician, and the bureaucracy or providing social servicing through taxation\u2026the theft or the debt\u2026of the productive for their support. Where is the product and where is the service. Is taking from some to give to others employment? What has been the placebo of make believe government policy for far too long, as in the insanity of the adaptation of the central planning communist concepts of Keynesian, steal from all of society, to make\u2026the pyramids of work projects\u2026to employ people and call them infrastructure. When in reality, it is nothing but how the political parties through government spending\u2026by selective government assistance\u2026for political reward. The communist concept of central planning\u2026or as those who lived in the communist utopias of such, as Russia would say\u2026we pretend we are working, and they pretend they are paying us. The why, without the choice, the free will of the buyer, and the responsibility of earning\u2026by producing in order to have wealth to purchase\u2026then the system does not work, the magic of the invisible hand identified by Adam Smith disappears. If there ever was a society, that wasn\u2019t artificial, is hard to know. History has some identification, but the whole story is not known. Was the Pharaoh\u2019s Dynasty of ancient Egypt full employment? We don\u2019t know, just know that the Pharaoh was god on earth little (g) and his word was law, similar to the politburos of communist nations. Hitler with weapon expansion, based on government debt, employed many. Was it full employment, we don\u2019t know. America with the insanity of Keynesian central planning, and the current stimulus bills of monetary insanity, in the name of employment, resulted in the catastrophe of today, and many generations in the future. As long as the entity of government is influential in corrupting the commerce, the manufacturing, and most importantly the monetary markets, there will never be enough data to know if a commercial based economy can ever employ all.

            "answer_text": "Although there can be several different approaches to reducing unemployment, there really is only one real danger currently to people having jobs and it's not what most people would believe. The story of the unemployment rate in America right now is true that it is at all-time lows. It is also true that wages are up for most workers. However, these are not the full story and it is important to look at the big picture for most of middle America. Workers are employed, but they are many times working for less and working more hours to earn that larger paycheck. You might be asking yourself how people that are employed are earning less when wages are reported as being up. This does, after all, seem to contradict the national news of low unemployment and higher wages. The issue today in America is the costs of living. Wages are up, but so are expenses for healthcare, education, and housing. This is in addition to just the daily increasing living expenses most people experience. Think about the last time something as simple as your cable bill or garbage pickup increased in price. I know for me, these expenses go up a little each and every year. When it comes to the costs of education, housing, and healthcare, these expenses are most often outpacing inflation and those increased wages reported that so many people are earning. The gain in pay reported in the current economy is most often a net and sometimes even a negative gain. While people are earning more the costs are also more. An increase in wages is also the result of Americans working more. For hourly workers that receive overtime, they are indeed making more. They are just working more hours for it. It is also not uncommon for numerous workers to have a second job or what is commonly referred to as a side hustle to make some extra money. Again, not actually making more money, but working more for an increase in income. An increasing number of American companies and businesses are moving to a leaner working environment. What this means is they are many times reducing their headcount and having fewer employees do the work of more with an increase in responsibilities. This is nothing new and the trend is only likely to continue as businesses keep trying to compete globally and increase their bottom line along with shareholder profits. The real problem that is lingering when it comes to unemployment in America is not helping individuals or businesses with taxes, but outsourcing jobs in favor of cheaper labor and moving everything made in America overseas. This is the real employment killer. The issue today is there are a lot fewer manufacturing jobs in America than there were decades ago. America has moved to more of a service and entertainment industry. While the entertainment industry in America still brings in quite a lot of money, the service industry as a whole does not. This is particularly the case when you compare many service jobs to manufacturing positions that have been eliminated. Dollar for dollar most manufacturing jobs make more money compared to service positions. Sure, doctors and lawyers are a service business. However, there are a lot more Walmart and Target workers in America. Outsourcing jobs in favor of less expensive labor has also been an issue with employment. Take a real long look at the work visa programs that many larger companies use still. These were originally put in place to fill a shortage of highly educated American workers. If you really research the issue, you will find this has been anything but the truth in many instances. To this day many older workers in the technology industry are still being phased out and replaced by less expensive foreign employees. Although writing code and being in the software industry seem to be in high demand and it probably still is, if you are an older worker in this industry you need to be concerned. The real job killer in America today and for quite a while now have been Americans. The need for cheaper goods in combination with outsourcing and chasing increasingly larger shareholder profits is the problem. China is a big issue when it comes to jobs in America. The US has moved so many manufacturing jobs to China with the need for larger profits and to compete around the world. A race for the lowest price is a problem and it hasn\u2019t only hurt American\u2019s and their jobs. It also has hurt their wallets and life. Unlike quality goods made in America decades ago, today\u2019s US consumer is built on low quality low priced goods. Yes, a lot of the prices are cheap. However, many times people are spending much more money, in the long run, having to constantly buy the same things repeatedly. Not knowing Americans are being trained to be poor. We are being trained by the large corporations who figured out how to maximize their profits. Think about everything in America that now predominantly comes from China and other overseas suppliers. When you buy something do you commonly see \u201cAmerican Made?\u201d The answer is no. The reason is not much is made in America any longer. Although employment issues in America can be tied to the loss of manufacturing jobs and also outsourcing many of them, the real danger is looming for Americans. What is this real danger? It is national security.  Think about this for a minute. During World War II American manufacturing was big. We were able to build our own ships and other supplies for the war efforts. Now think about not having all of this manufacturing infrastructure in place and there is a conflict with the same country that makes everything we buy. They certainly aren\u2019t going to sell things to a country they have an issue with. The real way to probably decrease unemployment in America is to try and start purchasing more things made in the USA. Don\u2019t make weekly trips to Walmart. Invest in quality over quantity and a cheap price.

            "answer_text": "There has to be two fold effort to solve unemployment problem: Infividual effort and Governmental effort. Individual effort: it is the responsibility of every citizen to make himself qualified and skilled for employment through education and skill development.Those who can afford education expenses, have to bear the expenses themselves.Government has to provide free education to the poor people.After education is complete, educated persons can seek jobs or employ themselves through self-employment. Through self-employment, they will not only employ themselves, but also create jobs for others.We have to be ready to do all types of works if good jobs are not available or if we are not competitive.Our education has to empower our students to create their own employment and not just rely on Govt jobs.We have many problems in our country. Every problem means that there is scope of employment by solving those problems. This attitude will create employment or self-employment.There will be Govt jobs which will be filled up through competition. But it can fulfil only a part of our total job requirement. Most jobs has to be created in private sector which requires entrepreneurship. Management schools should teach entrepreneurship to students so that they can create business.For those who are totally unemployed, unemployment allowance has to be given or there can be employment guarantee schemes.No one should be allowed to starve but no one should be idle also. Unemployment allowance should not be a substitute for employment but a temporary arrangement.Govt should reduce income disparity between the rich and the poor.There should be dignity of labour.Excess labour in agricultural sector should shift to non-agricultural sectors.Economic planning and budget must facilitate employment generation without compromising on competitiveness. Because if we become uncompetitive, we will lose in international market.Govt can give easy loans for new business to unemployed youth.",

            "answer_text": "Destruction of Jobs \u2026 In almost every case, government programs are the cause of joblessness. Minimum Wage. The minimum wage mandates that wages be set at a government-determined level. To explain why this is harmful, we can use an analogy from biology: there are certain animals that are weak compared to others. For example, the porcupine is defenseless except for its quills, the deer vulnerable except for its speed.In economics there are also people who are relatively weak. The disabled, the young, minorities, the untrained\u2014all are weak economic actors. But like the weak animals in biology, they have a compensating advantage: the ability to work for lower wages. When the government takes this ability away from them by forcing up pay scales, it is as if the porcupine were shorn of its quills. The result is unemployment, which creates desperate loneliness, isolation, and dependency.Consider a young, uneducated, unskilled person, whose productivity is $2.50 an hour in the marketplace. What if the legislature passes a law requiring that he be paid $5 per hour? The employer hiring him would lose $2.50 an hour.Consider a man and a woman each with a productivity of $10 per hour, and suppose, because of discrimination or whatever, that the man is paid $ 10 per hour and the woman is paid $8 per hour. It is as if the woman had a little sign on her forehead saying, \"Hire me and earn an extra $2 an hour.\"This makes her a desirable employee even for a sexist boss. But when an equal-pay law stipulates that she must be paid the same as the man, the employer can indulge his discriminatory tendencies and not hire her at all, at no cost to himself.Comparable Worth. What if government gets the bright idea that nurses and truck drivers ought to be paid the same wage because their occupations are of \"intrinsically\" equal value? It orders that nurses' wages be raised to the same level, which creates unemployment for women.Working Conditions. Laws which force employers to provide certain types of working conditions also create unemployment. For example, migrant fruit and vegetables pickers must have hot and cold running water and modern toilets in the temporary cabins provided for them. This is economically equivalent to wage laws because, from the point of view of the employer, working conditions are almost indistinguishable from money wages. And if the government forces him to pay more, he will have to hire fewer people.Unions. When the government forces businesses to hire only union workers, it discriminates against non-union workers, causing them to be at a severe disadvantage or permanently unemployed. Unions exist primarily to keep out competition. They are a state-protected cartel like any other.Employment Protection. Employment protection laws, which mandate that no one can be fired without due process, are supposed to protect employees. However, if the government tells the employer that he must keep the employee no matter what, he will tend not to hire him in the first place. This law, which appears to help workers, instead keeps them from employment. And so do employment taxes and payroll taxes, which increase costs to businesses and discourage them from hiring more workers.Payroll Taxes. Payroll taxes like Social Security impose heavy monetary and administrative costs on businesses, drastically increasing the marginal cost of hiring new employees.Unemployment Insurance. Government unemployment insurance and welfare cause unemployment by subsidizing idleness. When a certain behavior is subsidized\u2014in this case not working\u2014we get more of it.Licensing. Regulations and licensing also cause unemployment. Most people know that doctors and lawyers must have licenses. But few know that ferret breeders, falconers, and strawberry growers must also have them. In fact, government regulates over 1,000 occupations in all 50 states. A woman in Florida who ran a soup kitchen for the poor out of her home was recently shut down as an unlicensed restaurant, and many poor people now go hungry as a result.When the government passes a law saying certain jobs cannot be undertaken without a license, it erects a legal barrier to entry. Why should it be illegal for anyone to try their hand at hair-cutting? The market will supply all the information consumers need.When the government bestows legal status on a profession and passes a law against competitors, it creates unemployment. For example, who lobbies for the laws which prevent just anyone from giving a haircut? The hair-cutting industry\u2014not to protect the consumer from bad haircuts, but to protect themselves against competition.Peddling. Laws against street peddlers prevent people from selling food and products to people who want them. In cities like New York and Washington, D.C., the most vociferous supporters of anti-peddling laws are established restaurants and department stores.Child Labor. There are many jobs that require little training\u2014such as mowing lawns\u2014which are perfect for young people who want to earn some money. In addition to the earnings, working also teaches young people what a job is, how to handle money, and how to save and maybe even invest. But in most places, the government discriminates against teenagers and prevents them from participating in the free enterprise system. Kids can't even have a street-corner lemonade stand.The Federal Reserve. By bringing about the business cycle, Federal Reserve money creation causes unemployment. Inflation not only raises prices, it also misallocates labor. During the boom phase of the trade cycle, businesses hire new workers, many of whom are pulled from other lines of work by the higher wages. The Fed subsidy to these capital industries lasts only until the bust. Workers are then laid off and displaced.The Free Market. The free market, of course, does not mean Utopia. We live in a world of differing intelligence and skills, of changing market preferences, and of imperfect information, which can lead to temporary, market-generated unemployment, which Mises called \"catallactic.\" And some people choose unemployment by holding out for a higher paying job.But as a society, we can insure that everyone who wants to work has a chance to do so by repealing minimum wage law, comparable worth rules, working condition laws, compulsory union membership, employment protection, employment taxes, payroll taxes, government unemployment insurance, welfare, regulations, licensing, anti-peddling laws, child-labor laws, and government money creation. The path to jobs that matter is the free market.Source: How the Market Creates Jobs and How the Government Destroys Them (Full Edition) I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Job is the human activity to do work to exchange for income to make a living. This income is the use value (often represented by money), which is converted from real value (resources and environment). This conversion process is irreversible due to the second law of thermodynamics, but the real value is intrinsically limited in any local space and time. Jobs depend on real value conditions. Human cannot create jobs, when government give jobs to a group of people, it is the government using its political and administrative power to assign an amount of real value for this group of people to work on with or do the extended activities in the economy, it is a change of distribution but not creating anything. That taken away the real value from others or from future generations --- real value is intrinsically limited. People help themselves to public owned, government owned resources such as forest, sea, land, river, can get themselves a job to convert the real value into use value to make a living or get rich. Their jobs depend on the resources --- the consumption of these resources. They did not create jobs for themselves --- they just took from nature\u2019s limited real value reserve. Create jobs in microeconomic competition doesn\u2019t solve the macroeconomic unemployment issue, because the fundamental cause for unemployment is the real value \u2013 population ratio deterioration, due to real value is capped by nature, while human economic activities convert more and more real value into use value and consumes it irreversibly, plus the naturally increasing population --- all these factors contribute the deterioration of the real value \u2013 population ratio that make people\u2019s life harder and employment fewer. In contrary to the popular view, the methods to solve unemployment is not to grow the economy and make more people work on the real value \u2013 use value conversion or its extended economic activities to further reduce the limited real value (resources and environment) but shrink the present economic size by ban and trim the harmful and unnecessary products and services that waste and lock up more real value than they are converted from. And of course, shrinking population by the rational and humane one-child policy. The present way of solving unemployment is drinking sea water to quench thirst --- drive more people to destroy more limited resources and environment that further deteriorate the real value - population ratio that intensifies the unemployment. Natural process caused problem cannot be solved by natural process. Be rational, man. ",

            "answer_text": "It has become increasingly hard to get a job as the level of unemployment in the country continues to rise daily. Many states particularly, ones with the most African-American backgrounds experience high unemployment among young men compared with the rest of the nation. Key findings and research conducted show that young black males in the States have lower well-being compared to the rest of the citizens. So, what causes high unemployment rates among African \u2013 American Men? Are there solutions to mitigate these types of issues? Many states that experience these issues often have structural barriers which affect full employment in the country. African \u2013 American men have been most affected by some of the issues that hinder their growth and advancements in both the public and the private sector. Racism is an issue that concerns many US citizens and is seen to affect many of the people working in some of the industries operating around the country. Many of the African \u2013 American face job losses due to some of the discrimination they face in the labor market. It has often led to most of them becoming retrenched or becoming excluded from high paying jobs that are often reserved for others. Some of the states such as Chicago and Illinois are the ones experiencing high unemployment rates for people between the ages of 20 to 24. Out of school rate is a factor that also elevates the level of unemployment among these youths. Research shows that young African \u2013 American youth have higher unemployment rates compared with the older generation even after putting education into consideration. It is evident that the younger African \u2013 American generation face greater challenges in the market which results to many not having jobs compared to their white counterparts. Young black Americans are vulnerable to economic recess since many of them get fired by their workers whenever the business cycle falls into a depression. Many of the manufacturing industries to which most are found often get layoffs. The above, however, not only occurs to manufacturing companies but other business firms and companies in the industry. What are some of the ways to mitigate this issue? Many businesses should seek to offer more job opportunities as well as raise the number of African \u2013 Americans that are learned. Doing this helps increase a country\u2019s prosperity which often helps build trust between members of the public and the social communities. Equally funding to many community projects that exist in their states will reduce the number of over-reliance on a person\u2019s property taxes to fund which will help fund an adequate and equitable public education. Unequal education and funding contributes to a lower majority of people enrolling in schools and later finishing their studies. Improving the funding made and the equality among the schools helps a student earn minimum requirements required by the African \u2013 American students in entering the job market. Racial discrimination is a major factor that affects many businesses in the world and so, prohibiting the vice in employment systems will help achieve a more transparent working environment free of racial discrimination towards African \u2013 American youth which will go a long way in helping reduce unemployment witnessed by them.

            "answer_text": "\"Crisis\"? Perhaps the best way to handle the \"unemployment crisis\" is stop listening to politicians. Unemployment is at one of its lowest points in the past 10 years, so clearly if there were a \"crisis\" then, congratulations, we have ended it. Woo hoo, break out the champagne. Now, if you are asking \"how do we solve the employment skills problem\" then we have a different discussion. 30+ years ago there was a lot of manufacturing being done in the US than there is today.  It used to be that a manufacturing job allowed a for a wage that could support a family. But then all of the manufacturing went offshore.  Now you can blame it on greedy manufacturers trying to make a quick buck, but if you want the real culprit, look in the mirror. American consumers now get more for their dollar than ever before. Technology has provided some innovation but much of that increase in value is because we as a people have pushed down the price of labor.  Basically you can't afford to pay people to manufacture things in this country much anymore.  The problem is not unemployment, the problem is a wage gap. Here are two ways to handle the problem:  Cost and education. The first is ugly.  If you want to \"bring manufacturing back to the US\" as some presidential hopefuls have bragged, get ready to pay more.  There are clearly documented cases where companies have brought manufacturing back to the US and saved money (or seen negligible cost differences), but those are a minority, not a majority. If the compnay was able to charge more for the products then they could make them here.  Wages go up. Unemployment (while already low) gets \"better\" as people shift away from lower paying jobs to less lower paying jobs. Oh, and this hoses everything in the economy, not just those products because those new manufacturing jobs compete for all labor, pushing that up across the board.  But, congratulations, you have \"ended our unemployment problem.\" Or you could just raise wages across the board. Starting with the minimum wage. The second thing is education. A better educated workforce will earn more money.  There will be more innovation. There will be a greater chance of an entrepreneur coming out of the woodwork and creating a new business. But education costs money. So dig deep in your pocket. Job training. Vocational schools. Taxes.   So, to sum it up, first, you must learn how to phrase the problem. We do not have an \"unemployment crisis\" because unemployment is at historic lows. Instead we have a wage crisis where the wages are not keeping pace with the cost of living. The answer to how to fix that is not popular, nor is it cheap.  How do you fix it? With costs to you and me and unpopular decisions by politicians.  Which is why you should not expect to fix the problem any time soon. ",

            "answer_text": "Unemployment is very big problem, but we can overcome it with patience. We have to build industries where more people are required even with gaining profit. We have to reduce the cost of the products and keep on doing some innovations so that when new product is launched people should purchase it again and the process of selling and buying keeps on going. If the person is not educated upto the level that he can get good job then there should be some opportunity to learn skills by which he can do some self-employment. Agriculture should be given high priority in the country where agricultural climate is good, because of good productivity of food, the cost of livelihood will be reduced. Farmers should be given facilities and knowledge as an when required at very low cost. There should be good medical systems at low fees so that people should not hesitate to visit hospitals, this way jobs in medical field will also be increased. Everybody should be taught internet skills so that he can learn some easy skills without paying for trainings. If good transport facilities are provided at low cost options like we have some good cab services, this inspire people to hire cabs instead of driving his own vehicle because he has to pay less, this gives employment in driving sector. There are many such kinds of innovation required which will surely reduce employment. And yes honesty, loyalty, perseverance, inspirations, motivations and faith in God is always required. ",

However, I have 3 tips that can help close the gap of unemployed folks degrees. Earn degrees you are 100% interested in. For example, I could have studied psychology or philosophy as a major, however, I chose business because I wanted to learn how money works and learn better management skills for myself. Studying business helped me manage my money better. I did not study the major to line up a job or think I was bound for wall street. I studied it to have a better understanding of myself in today\u2019s economy.Stay in school as long as you can.A lot of folks feel pressure to finish school as fast as they can because they want to graduate young or someone else is paying for their school. Regardless, a lot of us don\u2019t truly know what want to do in life. My advice for the majority is to stay in school until you hit something on the nose. take all the GE courses, play around with ideas of different degrees, search for internships and odd job while you\u2019re in school. Allow yourself to make mistakes along the way and build real work experience while in school.Be humble and stay hungryToo many of us have gaudy expectations and are real stern when it comes to our career and income. We want to get paid like gods and work like we are on government housing. We have a specific major and we like to stick to that kind of work. Unless you have put that work with internships or networked like crazy, most often times those jobs are not accessible to you because of your lack of real work experience. Humble yourself, build your career up, keep working jobs that can help you get to where you want to be. Stay hungry and keep your eye on the ultimate goal. Don\u2019t get discouraged because you exited college and start a $17.00/hr job. Focus on your career goal and not the dollar amount and you\u2019ll save yourself from a long line of unemployment office.",

Universities must be mandated to do something that they ignored when once recommended by the Department of Education under President Obama; they must be required to provide detailed data on the job market. Many new students, going into massive debt for tuition due to government disinterest in education, are picking majors that have very few job opportunities. This is unacceptable; putting them in debt for many years with a false promises. Universities must tell them where the opportunities are or will be. Able bodied people on welfare must be mandated to enter gov\u2019t funded job programs and/or find work or lose their benefits.

            "answer_text": "First and the foremost thing one can do to reduce unemployment in the country is to provide people with the Low-Cost Education facilities, many of the people are remaining uneducated due to over expensive nature of the education. And education is the only way to become capable enough to earn by the way of employment. The Kalgidhar Society is helping people by making them capable of getting employed by making education facilities available to all. The people who do not get chance to come ahead due to lack of money, the Akal Academies established by the Kalgidhar Society provides them the opportunity. The Akal Academies is rendering Low-Cost education facilities to the people and also education for free to many poor and unprivileged. They are educating 70000 students per year out of which 28052 are free/aided. The Kalgidhar Society by its advanced education facilities are making the youth capable to get themselves employed. Tgey are providing well-equipped laboratories and advanced e-classrooms which are total 2036 in number, highest in the country. The Akal Academies won many awards in 2018 for- Quality in Education, Best Hygienic School of the year, School with most advanced Medical Facilities, School promoting Cultural Heritage. The Akal Academies had produced many toppers to the society and and made them available with the employment opportunities. The Kalgidhar Society also makes the people available with the employment opportunities in their own schools, colleges and hospitals. Many of the students of the Akal Academies became IPS and ISS officers. Many are employed as doctors, nurses. The Kalgidhar Society is also making the rural girls available with the special courses which is another thing one can do to reduce unemployment. Under AIRWE that is Akal Institute of Rural Women Empowerment Project, they are providing rural girls with the free teacher training course, affiliated to University of Cambridge. This had helped many girls and women in getting employed as teachers in reputed schools and colleges. The Kalgidhar Society even helped many of these girls with the opportunities in the schools and colleges of itself. This can significantly reduce unemployment in the country and are the most simple ways. ",

We can vote for representation to extract wealth from workers to pay other workers to dig holes and yet other workers to fill them. Immediately, we employ representation and their staff, tax collectors, enforcement agencies, and eventually the workers themselves and achieve low unemployment. Meanwhile, everything else that could be done with the labor has been usurped by the power of force. Low unemployment isn\u2019t needed. It is simply the result of economy or policy. People, in general, can understand their own individual/family situation: whether working makes sense or if the benefits of a social safety net supersede the need to be employed. When automation arrives, there will be a shift in the things to purchase that will be offset by the people who will or are able to purchase them. The automation may take away jobs, increase productivity, and potentially reduce the cost of goods. When automation arrives, the next question will be who is left to buy what the robots produce, and if raising the cost to hire people at the time of being replaced by automation is actually the best idea. These two things in conjunction don\u2019t appear to be conducive to low unemployment. ",

What one produces is relevant to a) whether the job will exist in the long term or not and b) whether other people will support you .in your productive activity. Basics like food, water, shelter and clothing are not easy to produce in a sustainable fashion. Anyone who thinks they are ( and a lot of people do) is a fool. Out of those four categories probably water and housing are the easiest to provide sustain-ably, but all of them need to be improved in order to make it more possible for the planet to sustain around 10 billion people by 2050 without major avoidable losses of human and other natural life. There are always jobs needing to be created in the \u201csofter\u201d care, welfare and and education areas, but I would note that the basics need to be covered first, although we can argue there is a chicken and egg process whereby people need education in order to tackle more basic tasks effectively. We use money primarily to move goods and services around the economy. The process of \u201cusing money to make money\u201d is a subsidiary function to most people, though for others it dominates their thinking to the extent that they are unable to think outside the particular box they have built for themselves. I mention this because I\u2019m regularly attacked as a socialist/communist who wants to kill another 100 million people. I\u2019m none of those, and the motives and even the heads of people who say that kind of thing need to be examined. So the inevitable question is \u201cwhere does the money come from to fund all these new jobs which are aimed at establishing a logically sustainable relationship between people and their host planet?\u201d. I don\u2019t really have an answer to that, except that money can be created in many different ways. There are too many t list here, but if you read a very easy little book/ pamphlet called \u201cInterest-and-Inflation-Free-Money. it outlines a dozen or so alternatives to the \u201ctraditional\u201d route of banks simply writing it into existence more or less according to their estimation of market conditions. Rather than finish on that note, It is easier and more optimistic to note that full employment is often achieved and there are many historical examples. In some case there are \u201coverheated\u201d economies which have local levels of employment higher normally expected 98% or so, they are not unusual. . ",

First, recognize some people are OK being seen as unemployed.Next fully and permanently end all regulations. This is not exclusive but extremely inclusive. Cut all of them, from every minimum wage statute to all education requirements for licensure to any OSHA admin laws.Then, fully and permanently end all taxation. This means destroying all tax codes in their entirety and not just specific taxes or partially cutting taxes. End all of them for always.Lastly, revoke all laws governing non-violent crimes. For this to work, if it\u2019s not explicitly violent or aggressive, the law shouldn\u2019t exist.This would mean anyone who wanted a job could get one or start a business to self employ themselves. The best way to enjoy the perfect unemployment long term is by getting out of the way of the market\u2019s natural proclivity for creating opportunities. Government isn\u2019t needed for prosperity, safety, or any combination of the two.  ",

            "answer_text": "Problem:  For the last forty years, the liberal elites in BOTH parties have offshored every job they possibly could while admitting countless millions of legal and illegal aliens to bid down wages on the jobs that remain. Solution:  Adopt comparative advantage trade policies, which is trade that allows each country to do what it does best.  For instance, it makes more sense for Germany to export cars and import bananas than it does for Germany to try to grow its own bananas.  And it makes more sense for Guatemala to export bananas and import automobiles. What needs to be done away with is trade based upon absolute advantage, which is where transnational corporations are free to go wherever labor, safety, and the environment are most easily exploited. The other solution would be an immigration moratorium that recognizes that Americans have the same right to our own country as Nigerians, Norwegians, Cambodians, or any other nation.  America is a republic, which comes from two Latin words, res (thing) and publica (people or citizens) or thing of its citizens.  In other words, America belongs to the American people.  As such, we have the same right to decide who comes into our country as we do to decide who comes into our own homes.  And just as it is perfectly moral to decide who comes into your own home according to what is best for you, it is just as moral for citizens to decide who comes into their country according to what is best for them. At a time when America is admitting almost a hundred thousand LEGAL immigrants every month when there aren't enough jobs to go around for Americans, any immigration is tantamount to a crime against us.

The vast bulk of our social and economic problems would begin to resolve \u2013 racism, child hunger, crime, gangs, drug abuse and political radicals (which all feed on poverty). Some will say that my projected outcome is too optimistic. I say it is realistic, and I invite government level computer models to test my projected outcome. I don\u2019t advocate all people becoming small businesspersons. I advocate all children knowing how business works, to make them better employees, and to know how to survive during lean times. All Big Businesses started as Small Businesses, so the principles transfer easily. (It\u2019s no good to teach Trades in Public School, because nobody can guarantee in ten years which Trades will be glutted with workers, or even exist. Yet Small Business principles have lasted for centuries with only minor changes.) This will work. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of ways to answer this question and none of them are easy - plus you may want to define \u201cour country\u201d and the best way to reduce unemployment is to give unemployed people paid employment. Your government could create a zero unemployment policy with zero tax on healthy food products such as fruit and vegetables & staple food such as rice. And give CASH directly to the most impoverished people. Yes, it's a real thing that charity organizations do - they are called \u201cconditional cash transfers\u201d (CCTs) and unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) Ref. Pennies from heaven. What I mean by \u201ccreate zero unemployment\u201d it may not be politically possible but you can make it humanly possible - by affirming the will of the people and the humanity for every single adult to be given paid employment. For as long as your countries natural resources and products are being traded and exported overseas. By saying the distribution of the countries natural resources must not only be given to foreign businesses but they must also be divided among the lest able people, the poorest and the oldest. Not in a communist way but in a way that can sustain peoples lives to survive & to find a fair way any person can have that opportunity to be paid to work.If government can not afford to run training or work schemes its probably a good indication that not even the government want to take any liability or responsibility for the status of unemployed job-seekers even though governance determines or basis its economic development policies on, which legislates labor & employment relations laws as they apply to all employers and legislates state-owned enterprises in a countries economy. Therefore out of necessity, a single unemployed person on his or her own does not have as much leverage as an organized group of unemployed with the government support to merge unemployed people with employers looking for suitable paid employment. This includes making your own government accountable for the budget it delivers every year - voters have to scrutinize all the choices the government makes to spend the tax budget and ALL the public expenses that are not being taxed by user pays means. New Zealand is a very good example of the most efficient user pays & tax paying - 34 OECD member countries. (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Unemployed initiated company business models - unemployed have to take advantage of becoming self-employed contractors, and that includes becoming a limited liability company and supporting other unemployed people to find the most cost-effective ways of taking advantage of a limited liability company (LLC) entity can help unemployed to gain more employment or opportunities to create a living and a way to work to survive and learn to be involved in MYOB rather than put your energy behind a limited waged income. But all low production/service companies have to put there collective ideas and trust in creative leadership. So people have to work together using an LLC model to create employment and a labor market of your own. This may include the government bridging the gap of attaining the acquisition of capital land or work-space and assets to a highly organized & motivated group of trained entrepreneurs. They could also be mentor supported and trained. The idea is that the sovereignty of a countries resource management politics including all natural resources that are managed by the state: can also equally be given the same exact access to the people of the land and depend on its natural resources for the benefit of all people of the land where the poorest people have the same opportunity as any other corporate entity to have access to such resources. If you can\u2019t beat companies or governments that prefer to import foreign made products, then you may have to become your own company of people of a nation - this may be the only way your unemployed & underutilized labor is the only way that government & companies will acknowledge that your human resource exists as equal partners and indigenous people of the land.Manual labor should be measurable or quantifiable - I don\u2019t care how much employers think each labor-intensive job should be worth per hour or how many bins of fruit should be worth to fruit growers as a piece rate or what the cost per sheep, lamb, merino ram should cost per unit to share its wool off - ALL labor should be measured in measurable units such as Kilo-joules(and additional data such as heart rate and calories, age weight etc). Not just for the reason of being underpaid but for the reason that ALL physical labor CAN and should be measurable. This will dismiss the myths that labor-intensive work is low skilled, but is more scientifically skilled work. Kilo-joules is a direct measure of energy performed and hence can be comparable to the amount of physical work of the various individual occupations that ACC accident compensation levy\u2019s or personal insurance premiums are based on. In other words, it can provide an accurate measure of the true amount of physical work performed by an employee - and give value to the scientific skill of many physically demanding manual occupations and how physical work affects the health of the employee. Once physical labor is measured for each occupation the employers will have to recognize the scientific skill involved between the variety of labor-intensive medium to highly skilled occupations. The information is also directly relevant to the health and therefore exploitation of employees or various occupations. Once labor is measurable & quantifiable - labor in primary and manufacturing industry can be production line workable as a much more efficient use of a countries underutilisation rate, as once labor is quantifiable it can be used to provide leverage and information and knowledge not for just one unemployed person but for multiple who could successfully perform a particular low skill manual job for unemployed people - for example voluntary unemployed could provide the labor: required to make furniture for poor families/ bricks for poor families/ pots for poor families/clothes for poor families etc. or with the right research the labor required to make a Solar Power Plant could be measured & quantifiable - including manufacturing the solar panels with the right materials and supplies. Plus the size of solar projects can be scaleable accordingly with higher or lower levels of skill and technical abilities to be acquired and passed on. Human resources have been underutilised for centuries but the underutilised & the unemployed have not always understood the untapped potential and how to market themselves as a underutilized collective. The International Labour Organization has a lot of valuable information about Underutilisation & 8,382 results when you search India. Here are 2 pdf links to 1. Beyond Unemployment: Measurement of Other Forms of Labour Underutilization which also published an important pdf link 2015 case study of India here: 2. http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_334063.pdfHow you accomplish these options are up to you - It\u2019s not enough to ask others for the answers to unemployment, you have to try and find your own solutions. I\u2019m just writing from intuition, as I don\u2019t know your country or your circumstances as these 2 things would give context to your question. If you were talking about India in particular then much of my answer may not apply. However I hope you find the 2 pdf links will give you a more factual source to get relative information from.",

            "answer_text": "Entrepreneurship is the only way to reduce unemployment only it can eradicate the problem of unemployment. In India unemployment is the major problem that we are facing in the modern era,. India is the country of Doctors, Engineers and scientist , these profession have huge respect in the country, almost every student who pass his 12th exam dreams of becoming doctor, engineer and scientist and in case he has opted commerce then CA is the only option, rest of students dreams of getting a government job for their secure future. So basically the mind set of an Indian student is of a job seeker very few students want to become job creaters or job producers and mostly students who opt to become a businessman are those who belong to a family of businessman. The problem lies in the upbringing, remember Naveen\u2019s Speech in TVF Pitcher \u201cpeople in India ask an aspiring entrepreneur WHY instead of WHAT? No doubt we need both in our society but we are in an urgent need of Entrepreneurs who can produce jobs at large scale, people should start taking risk and should be more encouraged to start their own business rather than seeking jobs and cursing government policies for unemployment. No economy is capable enough to employ such huge population. And no government can probably produce enough jobs to eradicate unemployment, infact government is doing a tremendous job in creating job by promoting entrepreneurship but that is just a drop in the ocean. I don\u2019t understand why many people hate a businessman who is also a yog guru in India who is a phenomenon businessman and providing employment to thousands of people in India his life is a perfect example of \u201crags to riches\u201d. Many of us have watched Guru movie which was based on the life of a passionate businessman of India, see how he found himself in nowhere when a newspaper reporter started writing against him, if you find that imaginary then we have several example nowadays where some of businessman have fled from India to escape law trials. If a common man is a defaulter in bank then he is poor and should be given a chance to pay his debt without interest but a businessman should be kept behind the bars, he shouldn't be given any chance. If a common man applies for a bank loan and produces fake previous year ITRs then it is okay but business man should apply for a bank loan with every single formality and eligibility. India needs a new race of entrepreneurs along with political and social support so that they can groom themselves, more and more policies should be made to promote establishment and growth of start-ups in every field, the problems of exploitation in any field be it agriculture or cheap labour or overcrowding of cities or education or of any kinds can be resolved by promoting entrepreneurship.

            "answer_text": "Many things to write on the topic and will do so in continuity in due course of time. But, need of the hour seems like having some sort of instant solution of the problem for immediate relief. And, I will attempt to do just that to start with.In the year 2015, I was trying to figure out exact / approx. numbers of all political posts in India, starting from Mukhia / councillor to topmost political post. The figures weren't readily available and for many states not available. So, I extrapolated available figures of states proportionately to unavailable figures of other states based on population of states which figures were readily available. I came up with an startling number for all political posts in India, 3017081 ( Thirty lakh seventeen thousand and eighty one) approx. Anybody having more exact figure may like to rectify me.I would suggest a mukhia / councillor level political post can absorb 2 unemployed youths, and higher political levels proportionately higher unemployed youths, in proportion of population they represent. This absorption of unemployed youths can be done from within funds coming to these political posts and therefore, will not cause any additional burden on public exchequer. Crores unemployed youths can easily be absorbed at these political posts in this way. Let us name this employment as a different category of employment for which our political leaders should be given free hand in employment, never questioned about these employments but efficiency of jobs should not suffer and the names of those employed under this category should not be kept underground.Let's see.  01.07.19 Have already given a starting instant solution to the problem of unemployment. To solve this problem as well any other social , political, religious problems on long term basis eternally, we have to find some out of the box solution. To get to that solution a little bit of background preparation. Problems exist in religious, political, social and other fields as well. We have devised many systems, one after another, to tackle them but still problems exist. The reason being: we haven\u2019t sorted out the problem associated with Religion, the first system, with GODs / Goddesses mentioned therein. If Gods / Goddesses existed to this day as mentioned in Religions, we could have found instant solution of the problems. After all what is earthly problem for a GOD / Goddess? Nothing. But, in spite of search over so many years, we haven\u2019t be able to find any GOD/ GODDESS. So, in a separate answer to a question ( quora link Sudhir Kumar's answer to The scientific community has, in its evolutionary process, once tried to find an omnipresent all-pervasive yet illusive ether. What was the result? What was the way forward? If God is so illusive, what could be the way forward? ), I have written about the some concepts of creator / creation / GODs. To mention that in nutshell : (1) GODS / GODDESSES shown in temples are that who evolved on some other planets or if evolved on earth then in totally different built up of earth. (2) Do we want yet another Religion or do we want to recreate PANTHEON or at least make our efforts in the direction of recreating the PANTHEON? And, my choice would be to make our best efforts in the direction of recreating the PANTHEON of GODs on lines of Sanatan Dharm, now that we have sufficient weapons and technology in human hands. To further buttress the choice I will cite an example. Assume that some of your, mine grandfather was a great man who died some 50 yrs back. Will our grandfather be back if we erect a statue in his name and beat drums, cymbols etc. in front of that statue? No. What about great great grandfather who was also a great man who died some 150 yrs back? No. Then do you think that our great\u2026\u2026..great grandfather who was a great man who died some 10,000 yrs back will be back if we erect a statue in his name and beat drums, cymbols etc. in front of that statue? No. To achieve the greatness of that great grandfather, present generation has to be that great. We should carry the point to PANTHEON of sanatan dharm or its pattern. That\u2019s for Theory part. Practically, to be that great what is to be done? The present generation will have to inculcate that great character in whatever small measure, to start with, in terms of some visible deeds which can be compared with the deed of a GOD. And, the first visible deed to be compared with the deed of a GOD may be taken as \u201c removal of unemployment\u201d and the first group of capable persons who could take up the challenge are persons in political posts, numbering 30,17,081. Will they take up the challenge? If yes, we have found 30,17,081 of GODs/ GODDesses. Next, we have to take this number to 3 crore to match the number in PANTHEON. The time to catch one person to solve all problems of society is over. Everyone needs to contribute at individual levels to solve problems of society, in whatever small measure one can. ",

            "answer_text": "You probably cannot eliminate unemployment. In fact, economists have always believed that due to frictions some amount of unemployment is required to have a base a labor to be hired and due to businesses failing and people losing their jobs. The economy reflects change and change means that businesses that are less efficient or poorly managed must be allowed to fail and people that are misemployed or not productive must be let go from time-to-time. If that does not happen innovation and efficiency/productivity gains will not occur as much as is possible and our material standard of living will not progress. We see in Europe, France particularly, how efforts to discourage letting go of employees actually inhibits full employment and acts as a disincentive to new business and expanding business operations where there is s risk of failure. Even if we all were saints, viewed work as worship, and sought diligently to be productive some amount of unemployment due to the search, matching, and creative-destructive processes would exist and be required. That does not mean that I would advocate no assistance for the newly unemployed or unemployable. I would also prefer to see workfare where people are required to perform work of some kind in order to obtain benefits as an ideal solution. But all solutions also require a level of morals, ethics, and diligence sadly lacking today in even the most developed economies in order to be efficient and beneficial. And all solutions are expensive and involve taxes if some form in order to provide such social insurance and we must be willing to pay such taxes. ",

Most economic policies are band-aids that treat the symptoms rather than address the deep divisive and corrupt structures that divide as humans. We need to reach a post-scarcity society ASAP. We do not live in a post-scarcity society yet, though we do have capacity to do so. The resources are being hogged-up by corrupt institutions. No one really needs to work more than 5 hours a day, yet we have people working 14 hours a day. We need a fundamental basis for agreement; a basis for cooperation. In a sentence, humanity needs to fundamentally change at a ethical level. This has to change:World's eight richest people have same wealth as poorest 50% Practical solutions: 1) Fundamentally realize wealth beyond ~120K USD/year has literally no increase on the quality of life. Really, it does not. As in zero. Nilch, zil, null. You don\u2019t need more 70k USD to have a comfortable life. Anything after 70K will increase has diminishing returns on your quality of life up to 120k USD/Year. Adjust the numbers for the standard of living where you live, but the point still stands. We need hard scientific proof that this is true. It is not very hard to prove this. 2) Dismantle the various defense systems on the planet. This has been written about so extensively I don\u2019t need to go into it. 3) Come up with an ethical structure that everyone can agree on. Right now, ethics for most people is extraordinarily shallow. How many people have read Kant? How many people know what utilitarianism is? Most people\u2019s ethics amounts to:A) God says X and Y are sins. B) The universe has no moral significance whatsoever. The self is only thing that matters. This has to change. Most people have near no conception of ethical practice or theory. 4) Adopt social-democratic policies and drastic reform ala Scandinavia. This has been written about so extensively I don\u2019t need to go into it. 5) A massive system for reducing population through education; I am talking about a Manhattan project for birth-control. The people who should be reproducing (extremely educated people) tend not to, while the disadvantaged and less fortunate are reproducing (though through no fault of their own) at massive rates. This isn\u2019t eugenics. It simply educating everyone to have common-sense about sex. ",

            "answer_text": "You want to stop unemployment? You want to ensure full employment? I\u2019ve got just the solution for you!  Throw out those pesky capitalists and stop the wage slavery! Grab your hammer and your sickle, and join your brothers and sisters in creating the perfect motherland. If you wish to create an economy without unemployment, you must implement a planned economy and isolate it. This way, the global market will have no impact on your economy, and everybody will be working in the public sector. No private sector. No globalisation. No trade. No unemployment. Because the fact of the matter is that you can\u2019t stop unemployment in a capitalist economy. As long as there is competition, there will always be winners and losers - this means that there must be unemployment for the competitive labour market to work. Though of course, if you\u2019re not satisfied with that answer, here\u2019s a bit more technical answer for you. In economics, we have this thing called the phillips curve  This basically explains that the lower the unemployment is, the higher the inflation will be, meaning that higher employment also means higher prices. High employment is a good thing. The higher the employment, the higher the productivity and the higher tax income - though if the employment gets too high, it ends up doing more harm than good. I believe that unemployment is an acceptable price to pay for innovation, growth, freedom and competition. If you disagree, communism is the way for you to go - though that\u2019s not a path that I am willing to join. ",

            "answer_text": "It may sound a bit obvious but creating jobs is the best way. The problem comes in how you create the jobs and what the jobs are. If you look at demographics and birth rates then you can see how many jobs are going to be needed each year quite easily. This can be planned out some 16 years in advance. The question is then how do you create those jobs. There are two obvious ways for a state to do this. Either the state employs those people or encourages business growth so that private companies can employ the people. Issues start arising if you try to do one or the other of these quickly. The first one is limited by the funds of the state. Eventually the state exists to create jobs for people to gather money to the state (from those very peoples pay) to create more jobs for people in the state\u2019s employ whose job it is to create jobs for the state. A focus on such a system has glaring weaknesses. If everyone is employed by the state then you have to tax everyone enough to pay those people. While this can be passed out through various different sectors you end up with a relatively stagnant system. There is a lack of competition and opportunities for advancement can easily be stifled. If you go the other way then you have to rely on those private businesses paying people enough to be able to live. One of the biggest issues in the UK at the moment is rising costs while the wages aren\u2019t rising or in many cases are dropping in real terms. To counteract this the state needs to step in with regulation. Businesses with a lot of power then try to avoid these regulations and can get away with unethical practices. What you need is a way of creating jobs at the rate of population increase. If you have a set retirement age then you recoup jobs at that point but there are plenty of jobs people do after they retire, this kind of semi-retirement can be quite common in industries with a strong consultancy arm. The skills and experience are valuable while the hours can be picked up as and when people want them. Let\u2019s get a little deeper. The job market is just that a market. Labour has a price. When there are less jobs than people the strength is on the side of the employer. The employer can then set low wage rates. This then means that people may need two or more jobs. That further reduces the job opportunities. People need work to pay for things therefore they have to take the badly paid jobs, at least until they can find better paid ones. To tackle this issue you need to tackle saturation in the employee market place. Immigration is often touted as a contributory factor. Low and unskilled labour can be done by anyone from anywhere with a basic command of the host country\u2019s language. If you reduce immigration or cap it and regulate who can enter then you can put more power into the hands of the employees and therefore drive wages up. Companies not paying well will quickly find themselves struggling for staff. They then need to up their pay or go out of business. How does the pay angle fit into this? Decent pay means that the employee can spend more. It also means the government gets more tax revenue. If you can\u2019t tax the people as they don\u2019t have enough money then you have to tax corporations, those corporations can then up and leave the country for tax reasons. See amazon and the tax revenue issues with that across Europe and in particular with relation to the UK. So in essence to create jobs you need to raise the demand for services and goods from companies. The more orders a company has (or work in general) the more staff they need. To get that revenue you need people spending that money. To give people disposable cash you need decent wages. What can be seen is there is the carrot and the stick. You need to make working attractive and not working unattractive. The carrot being decent pay to buy a house and lots of nice things. The stick being stuck with no money in a bad area. The issues here are that if people have nothing then they have nothing to lose which increases crime. If you don\u2019t give decent wages then there is no incentive to work. The best way therefore to keep enough jobs around is to have a country that is business friendly but with a strong safety net for those who find themselves out of work. That safety net should allow time for the individual to retrain if needed and for them to be able to live until they can find another job. Even so far as to be able to offer them employment. This can be done with infrastructure projects. A nice simple one here is roads. Roads always need repairing and updating. The same with rail systems. If you use that money from welfare support to pay contractors to fix those things you create jobs for all of those people on welfare who need the jobs. There is another way though. Universal basic income. Scrap all state benefits and state pensions. Replace this with a flat rate of money for everyone. In one swoop you have simplified the whole welfare system making the process streamlined and at the same time giving all of those low earners a bump in income. Sound good? it does but what effect will it have and where will the money come from? If you scrap benefits you have that whole budget to use. So that is sorted. The system is simplified meaning the running costs save you an absolute ton of money. Cap the payment so those earning say \u00a3150,000 or more lose the money. This is slightly higher than the rate you lose the tax free personal allowance currently. You also scrap the tax free personal allowance as that is your new universal income. That ups revenue significantly. Businesses don\u2019t have to worry about losing any money and lots of people have way more money to spend. You destroy poverty rapidly making society on the whole wealthier. There are some other implications though. If everyone has more money then money becomes worth less in real terms leading to inflation. This could make the whole concept moot. The way to tackle this would be a series of cost caps and fixing prices for a few years to iron out the system. This gets around the opportunists who would suddenly charge more. There is a further effect socially. There is a potential issue that people will go \u2018sod this I\u2019m not working if I get free money\u2019. That means less tax revenue leading to system collapse. This is a tricky subject though. What it may well do is put the power back in the hands of the employee. They get treated badly they walk without worrying. Companies therefore have to step up their game. It also means people will be more content when earning less. Some people don\u2019t want to climb the corporate ladder but have to to get the income. If you remove that from the equation then you will only get people who want to be working places working there. The knock on effect is better service. It would also tackle one of the major issues in the UK and that is housing. Housing is one of the biggest outgoings that we have. Rent is so high people can\u2019t save for deposits. If they could then they would. That means more people buy their houses. By the time inflation reduces the universal incomes impact enough people own houses that they are better off as mortgages only get smaller while rent only gets higher. This alleviates the pressure on social housing. It also creates demand in the housing industry leading to more jobs. I could go on about this for a while but it is starting to stray from the core point. I\u2019ll leave this section here with this article Is Finland\u2019s basic universal income a solution to automation, fewer jobs and lower wages? This is one of many on the subject. What we have looked at so far are some of the very basic reasons for higher unemployment. There is the big clanking metal elephant in the room though. Automation. Is automation a good thing? Yes, for humanity as a whole it is good. The problem is it is bad for jobs. One thing that we are seeing is the increase in automation due to companies not wanting to pay the higher wages that living now demands. Take the arguments in the US against the $15 minimum. Companies simply won\u2019t take that hit in their profit margins or their bonuses. They will look for more efficient ways to get around the issue. One way is automation. Take McDonalds as an example. You used to walk in, queue up order and wait for your food. You then get your food pay and go and eat it. Now several places have a slightly different system. You order the food on a screen, get a ticket and wait for the food to be handed to you. It is only a subtle difference but it is very interesting for one reason. The amount of tills (and therefore staff) has been reduced by half in these places. This has caused very few issues and actually in my opinion slightly better overall service. That is just one example. Simply put the only reason companies haven\u2019t automated is that they were able to get cheap labour. There is then the other big issue. We live in a global economy now. For better or worse it exists. Manufacturing in western countries or the more advanced nations is just not cost effective. Why pay someone \u00a310 an hour in the UK when you can pay \u00a31 a day in China. (Actual figures will vary). Relying on traditional jobs from 50 years ago is utterly nonsensical. One of the reasons why newer generations aren\u2019t being taught, or bothering to learn, physical manual skills and manufacturing skills is because they are just not worth having in the current climate. The world has been digitised for years and people need to just accept that. How do we keep unemployment down in such an environment? We need to stop viewing work as pay by the hour, at least as the main focus. The best example here is a book. When you write a book you may put 200 hours of work into it (often significantly more but go with me here). Let\u2019s say you want the equivalent hourly rate of the average salary. Sounds reasonable. That\u2019s somewhere around \u00a312 an hour (if you live where I do this isn\u2019t particularly good as a wage to live on but that is another discussion). That would mean your book cost \u00a32400 in man hours. Let\u2019s say it was an eBook to keep additional costs down. You would likely have it edited and a cover drawn up. Possibly a bit of market and a website. That will take it up to \u00a33000. So you sell the book for that much right? Now you sell it for \u00a33 and sell 1000 copies. While you are doing that you write the next one and so on. The point here is that the time that you put into writing a book has no impact on the price that you can charge for it. If we apply this principle to other jobs you can see where it goes. Say you do projects. You would work freelance as a person on that project. The project would pay a set amount and you make what you don\u2019t spend on the product. The majority of work can be done on this basis. We already use this when we have commission rates. What you do here is that you create pay linked to the quality of the product and the skills and experience of the creator. By focusing on this kind of freelance model for work rather than careers which were apt for factories and manual skills we create a more adaptive society. Rather than losing your job at 40 because the company closed and not being able to do anything else because your qualifications are out of date (you now end up increasing the unskilled labour pool) you would just move to working on a different project. With universal basic income as a safety net for this way of working society could progress much faster. recovery times for those out of work would drop massively. Supply and demand would regulate prices to stop inflation and education would be another strong focus. Well this answer is getting quite long so I shall stop there. What it boils down to is having a way of manipulating the job market in such a way as to get people back into work by decreasing the areas of saturation such as that in unskilled labour. It also hinges on accepting changes in the way we work and how society is progressing. ",

In my personal opinion, startups are not such a great idea as they require an initial investment and a lot of research in that field. There is a risk involved. Well, if you can afford this risk, then go for it. However, these follwing 5 ideas might help you gain financial independence ASAP. You have not mentioned your educational qualifications or gender or areas of interest here, so the below listed points are very generic and can be implemented by any:  1. You can be tutor. In India, education never runs out of business. You can set up your own coaching centre and begin teaching students of any age group. You can grow in leaps and bounds and earn as much as 1 lac pm if you execute this plan wisely. As they say, teaching is a noble profession too.   2. Yoy can join a BPO. If you have good communication skills, then this can be an option too.  3. You can prepare for bank PO exam. This exam occurs biannually i guess, so you can prepare and try to clear it. Again, i am assuning that you have atleast one bachelors degree. Keep in touch with websites such as freshers.com and others similar sites as they continuously show various opportunities in various fields on a day to day basis.  4. You can be a driver. They say this is not the most reputed job but drivers that tie up with #Ola and #uber earn as much as 50k (minimum) per month.  5. You can do content writing or data entry. The former is different than the latter as in the former, you have to develop your own content and in latter, you have to just convert one form of data to another, like from pdf to word format. So you can get yourself registered on naukri.com and they will keep you posted about such content writing opportunities.  Just keep trying. Never give up. You will definitely find something. I can promise you that.  All the best. ",

Using 2015 stats if you took all the personal and corp income and divided it up evenly. A family of 4 would get about $180,000 a year. Now of course that's not going to happen.

Education, which results in skills, which Creates economic value, which Incentivizes a business to hire you, which Creates a pay check for you, and thereby Profits the business and the employee. This happens when the employer is free to hire the workers needed at the wage concomitant to the skill sets available in a market. Employees benefit by being able to choose their work, self-determine the amount of effort they are willing to put in the economic system and reap the rewards they've earned. Enter the government with every good intention and exogenously sets the wage. Results are going to be additional unemployment. Concurrently, if the government allows for mass immigration (suppose legally for this example) of lower skilled workers. The surplus of workers seeking a wage is thus created, which drives down income at the low end of the market. A chart will help here:  See: Tom Byron's answer to Should fast food workers in the U.S. get $15.00/hr? Allow workers to enter the market place with the skills they work for (or don't work for) and supply of their labor will equal the wage necessary for businesses to hire and stay open\u2014and profitable.

When felons come out of prison, they need housing, food, clothing, shelter and medical care the same as anyone else. They are human just like anyone else. They\u2019ve done unacceptable things, but they\u2019ve done their time. They\u2019ve served out their punishment. The staunch refusal of most businesses, especially in the professional/white collar realm, makes a felony conviction a life sentence in its own rite. It\u2019s not right or even ethical to limit an ex felon\u2019s employment only to those jobs that don\u2019t pay squat and yet work their employees harder than rented mules for 12+ hours per day 6 and sometimes 7 days per week. No one else would settle for such a job given the choice, so why should ex-felons (the few that do get hired) always be relegated to the most arduous and low-paying manual labor jobs? If you don\u2019t want that for yourselves, don\u2019t push it off on others. ",

You can thank idiotic inflation hawks for apparently influencing laws that have forbidden central banks from indirectly injecting money into the economy. Public money creation is exactly what was done in Canada from 1944 to 1975 in what has become one of the more robust economies in the world. Even the United States did public money creation from 1917 to 1981, and more importantly in 1942 to help fund military expenses without which it would have not been possible to free Europe. No hyperinflation whatsoever and you can thank the kitchen table economists for peddling propaganda when only Zimbabwe is an example of public money creation gone wrong because of political struggles.

If a nation goes into true NPG, to survive it must automate. Kim Jong-un has said his goal is to eliminate manual work, to let machines do it all.

            "answer_text": "Unemployment is a Federal Government responsibility. The private sector need have little interest in unemployment except as a secondary issue. Since the federal government creates unemployment by virtue of forcing people to earn money to pay tax, it has the duty to solve it. After WW2 the governments had policies of full employment as part of the new Welfare States being formed. Neo-liberalism has changed the picture by not prioritising employment and in fact deliberately fostering unemployment to make workers fearful about job losses so that they would be less troublesome. This is an abnegation of the government\u2019s duty to all its people. So it is duty bound to solve the unemployment problem. It can do so quite simply by reestablishment of the full employment regime of the past. They create the money supply. They can create the work needed to fill up the jobs. There are actually plenty of job opportunities around, but the jobs are not ready to go, There is no pay offered since the private sector has no interest, it is the government that has to make the jobs real, so people can apply for them.It\u2019s not an expense. It will put money into the economy, which will pay for itself. ",

Unemployment is best felt with by a healthy economy that is expanding. Nationally unemployment in the US is low, but there are pockets where it is high. Solutions in those areas will have to be specific. Replacing jobs when the mines closed is different than getting jobs to high school graduates in the inner city.

Thinking about creating a new network just for people who were declined employment so they could join forces and create their own business' together. This new network would help declined job seekers get the skills to better represent themselves on the internet regardless of past problems they faced and connect them with rouge networks that are legitimate but don't like bureaucracy. Though you may not have the perfect lifestyle your skills are awesome and those skills should be accepted regardless of your background. No one is perfect and these big companies should realize that a person with garage skills can put them out of business. I have a huge list of people that have been declined Job offers that could eliminate the unemployment rate if those people got together and created one huge network. Imagine the things we could do if together, every problem would get solved through alternative practice, we would also get funding because of the amount of people using this network. ",

Encourage students to work towards upliftment of lower sections of society. This will create jobs and a consequent market too as we have more people with purchasing power. Advise students to take up jobs available without being hung up about being overqualified. Reduce stress in government jobs. ",

Unemployment actually means, not having enough job as per the no. of people looking for job in the country. We ofter hear that the unemployment is x%, y% or z%. But what reality is there is no unemployment in our country, it was once upon a time but now it's not. Underemployment, lack of awareness and rat race is the major reason of having a big no. of people unemployed in the market. Lack of awareness.Just imagine, you opens a college and it have programmes like, Engineering, Mass communication, Business Management, Fashion Designing, Hotel Management and Agriculture. And all the departments have 10 vacancies for faculty. But the applicants were\u2026 Agriculture- 2 Fashion Designing-3 Business Management- 8 Hotel management-5 Mass Communication - 8 Engeneering- 30 Now the other 20 applicants for engineering will be counted as unemployed. I hope you all are smart enough to know the meaning. If you understood the meaning please UPVOTE. Thank you. Luvkush ",

Just like you won\u2019t solve the homeless problem because some people simply prefer to live on the streets. Also, recognize that not everyone is going to be able to get a $100k a year job as a programmer. One, there simply aren\u2019t enough of that caliber of job available. Two, you wouldn\u2019t want everyone to have the same job, because someone has to pump the sewage. Three, some people will only be qualified for the lowest caliber work, whether through education, genetics, physical ability, etc. In my city, I can go to nearly any fast food place and see signs asking for workers; most of the entry-level positions are paying $12 an hour. That\u2019s actually more than my daughter made while working in retail. Another problem is people getting college degrees in fields where there are simply no jobs. For example, I know of three people with English degrees, one of which is a Master\u2019s degree. One person is retraining to be a dental hygienist, one person became an elementary school teacher, and the third (the Master\u2019s degree holder), was working at Starbucks, last I heard. Unemployment has a lot of layers and tentacles into other issues. It\u2019s not going to be solved simply by creating more jobs. There are plenty of unfilled jobs right now. ",

You fix it by have a monetary policy that stabilizes the value of money.  For example, NGDPLT: Nominal income target  The supply side can change the NAIRU by small amounts.  Minimum wages, an extensive safety net, unemployment benefits, etc. can all slightly -- and slowly -- increase the natural rate of unemployment.

But the company has hired only 1500 and it make those 1500 workers do extra work. So the 500 people which should have been appointed there remain unemployed. That's why we face the problem of unemployment. We should hire people as many as we need. So that everyone gets the opportunity. Some people doesn't get the work according to their will. So we try togive varieties of occupations. We should give exciting packages. This problem will take time to get reduced as in every country every type of occupation is not available.

As said there are many well educated/degree holders are job-less.There must be two reasons..1) If they don't want to do job or 2) they are not well technical or non technically strong to get job!.. . So here is a solution.. let's assume ( yeah I'm a maths student) there are 1000 people are jobless in a particular city, let's say some of them are Science background,some of them are engineering/technical background and any other fields. . So what we need to do is gather them all ( who want to work) and make opportunity for them ! Like if there are 10 engineers and some commerce background students so make expansion of that field that they are graduated. . Like if i own a software company,so i will give franchises or hire or something that if they do work they earn some percentage of it! So they are gonna run that business! ( I know it's not that simple but we can try it) . So in this way we can also provide some towards our economy and remove the employment. . Thanks! For upvote ",

            "answer_text": "Why should any country borrow money from any financial institutions because you are mentioning at a country level I am raising this doubt doesnt that get you in debt trap and or recession or inflation obviously is economic crisis.Its ok some private ventures borrowing and it is considered private external debt and if they default on the loan obviously govt has to pay to avoid bilateral conflict between nations. The following text explains about debt inflation and recession of the economy. Though initially it makes the private sector responsible but provides effective solutions to overcome these problems. What you should understand is the politics behind the need for crisis or recession\u2026..crisis doesnt happen it is created by private sector for the need of higher profits lesser taxes higher inflation and definitely not higher wages and weeding out or laying off politically targetted victims or exchanging between companies. Lets understand debt and recession then you can conclude that minimum govt companies or jobs and maximum private companies or jobs is a failure. The economic policy or the monetary policy which has been followed since independence is a failure because you get into debt and then into recession and then the political leaders come into picture and then some compromises and then the loop. Recession is a threat from private sector to get something out of govt and masses nothing personal about it. Its kind of blackmail now what is impacted Job losses and layoffs -done finding out goodonesServices where govt is depending on private sectorMay be oil pricesOthers etc..So effectively we have to findout what does the private sector want to avoid recession-higher profits lesser taxes higher prices(inflation) and definitely not favouring higher wages. Global financial crisis -understand the following and then you can conclude what kind of situation the economy is in. Cashflow or clearing debt Recession Valuation of currency Debt Budget or fiscal deficit Inflation This is the private sector gimmick to rotate the funds they have and get the interest rate as per the demand and putting the others including govt in debt trap.Ideally they should deposit the funds with govt and get the interest rates decided by govt instead of asking customers to borrow at a higher interest rate.Govt should provide a exponentially increasing interest rates to the bank deposits and lenders to tackle inflation and lend at at a lesser rate.Now it should print sufficient currency to clear debt and also infuse adequate liquidity into the market otherwise those who have funds -as per the requirement or urgency they tend to demand higher interest rates.Now probably you understand why they say cashflow is important than clearing debt because if you clear debt he has to find someone else to borrow and may get or maynot get required intetest rates. Understand the economy properly this could be a private sector gimmick they want to achieve some milestone or demand something from masses and govt so they threaten about recession which means job loss otherwise it could be business failing to generate enough revenue otherwise it could be of the available human resources they have found out who is good and who are not politically viable so start laying off or exchange between companies. If we have adequate govt companies or govt jobs we dont have to worry about recession or profit/loss to a company because its a expenditure to the livelihood of people which is genuine and legitimate. What you should understand is no currency is greater than other they are all same including US dollar\u2026as there is no world currency as reserve currency currently its the US dollar and countries instead of maintaining their currencies equal to US dollar devalue the currency for selfish needs like exports they get a lot of profits locally internationally it is the same dollar but domestically the export fetches them more money has it has been devalued and the competition due to imports is reduced because they are expensive because of devaluation the sad part is petrol has a cascading effect on other goods and services if you depend on imports. Lets understand the basics of economy debt,budget and inflation. Debt -is it private or govt.  When you can print then ideally govt shouldn't have any debt it gets cleared yearly.  Regarding private companies taking loans and debt then if it is external private debt and there is bilateral issue between nations then the govt pays the external private debt and recovers locally from the company  The formula is very simple in this way you get into no or zero debt. It is as follows  On a yearly basis findout previous years debt and current years requirement of funds or fiscal deficit and the total should be minused from the revenue earned and the remaining balance of requirement of funds should be printed .This is the budget for current year.  Now here there is a trick you can borrow a lot of funds but that is not advisable because you would get into debt trap so instead what happens to the deposits in banks and private lenders interested in lending,the govt provides reasonable interests to these funds as expenditure to it but does not use the funds because it has to payback.  As mentioned by the above formula without getting into debt trap you have print currency as per the requirement.  Now some of them say this may lead to inflation.which is wrong .Inflation is the increase in the price of a goods or services on a year on year basis.This can be controlled.The govt has to provide subsidy or inflationary allowance to businesses on a year on year basis to stabilise prices and this increases the value of rupee in terms of purchasing power .  Now there is a private companies gimmick if more cash is circulating in the market then the lending rates would go down but the govt ensures reasonable interest rates to the private lenders and people can borrow at a lesser rate from the govt.  So as per the above formula printing of currency has nothing to do with inflation or prices or quantity of goods and services produced.  In common world scenario whether it is private business or personal finance multiplying wealth is thought as a very intelligent or clever thing and it is a challenging task.This individualistic perception comparing or equating to government is wrong.  Remember my friend dont get into business mindset it is tricky and deceiting because it always looks for profits which is not wrong but remember Government is not a business, it is responsible for the careers and lifes of the people so it owns and has money and need not worry about profit /loss because its an expenditure to the public which is genuine and legitimate  So ideally at the start of the year the country has no debt\u2026if there is it could be private debt otherwise number game played by politicians to coverup under development blaming the debt and remember if we clear the debt early then you dont have to pay interest hence cause of worry for private lenders. Lets understand the basic fundamentals of inflation.  Devaluation of currency causes inflation so countries should appreciate currencies against reserve currency.This is one kind of inflation.  The other kind of inflation which is where the actual problem lies is the prices how to tackle YoY rise ,any business guy would want to increase profits so that he can pay better salaries or meet rising expenditure.Now this is where the consenses has to be reached otherwise as you know today 1 rupee equals 10 rupee going further it may become 100 rupees,how to tackle this rise and higher denomination, the currency has to stabilise and normalised or consolidated.The only solution to this is govt needs to provide MSP (minimum support price)for the businesses and sell it for less to consumers so that purchasing power of rupee is retained.We tend to hear that for one sterling pound or one dollar you can buy a lot -how did they achieve it.  Devaluation explained.  And to answer your doubt ideally there should be a world currency as a reserve currency but as of now it is US dollar.any currency can associate itself with any other currency in multiple permutations and combinations not necessarly any one currency.  Lets understand the basic fundamental doubt on this -who is responsible for this and what is responsible for weakening of any currency  Now who its the politicians and businessmen responsible and not the world market or any other country. It is totally country\u2019s internal monetary policy responsible and why do they do this for that understand what is responsible for this.  The exports the more you devalue the more profits you get benefitting the private businessmen and govt gets only the tariff and normally they provide export subsidies.This rises inflation and imports become expensive like petrol and that has cascading effect on other goods and services.If imports become expensive then would the exporting country allow imports to its country\u2026so ideally the currency should be normalised.  China Europe US and many other countries have appreciated there currency and avoided inflation.  Its high time that a country finds its level and consolidates and normalises to a optimistic exchange rate.  An example about should a country devalue its currency?  \"  This question has been asked a lot. I do not really know how to pick the words to answer this. So I'll borrow as all great artists do.  In the words of Mac Tan,  \"The help you get from a currency depreciation is temporary. There is a dark side to depreciation: everything you import now costs you more. Over time this pushes inflation up; eventually wages catch up, so your products cost more, and the competitive advantage you had gained from the depreciation is gone. Italy went through this cycle several times before adopting the euro. The only way to gain a lasting improvement in competitiveness is to become more productive\u2014or to accept lower wages, that is accept becoming relatively poorer.\"  So please don't support devaluation. Unless you are willing to take a salary cut.  If we devalue the currency, it will only last a short while, we will still be left with a default and a greater reliance on oil. Note: oil income is in *dollars, internal tax income in *currency. Devaluation increases the percentage of the budget sourced from oil by the percentage we devalue, while decreasing internally generated revenue the same.  This is just digging the pit deeper.  P.s. one can devalue if you are sure you can double the amount of work you do everyday, maybe repair 20 cars instead of 10 cars, until oil prices come up.  \" So its not the US for weakening of any currency and as the consolidation and optimisation of world currencies completes the excess trading volumes in dollars in world trade because of reserve currency would move to other currencies anyway the actual US business is very stable. If you are saying ideal then it should be 1 INR =1$.Then there would be no inflation because devaluation causes inflation. Now what is the impact of this exchange rate on Indian economy. Lets list out this. Someone says govt makes money out of devaluation-rebuttal-Govt has and owns money so if there is a deficit it can print currency. Private exporters make a lot of profit by devaluing and govt also gets tariffs if there are no export subsidies-rebuttal-This makes imports expensive specifically petrol and the inflation due to this on other goods and services.And also if imports are expensive then the exporting country would it allow imports from our country so there should be an optimistic exchange rate. MNC companies profits and salaries would get squeezed-rebuttal is it not inflation how can a local job be paid lesser wages compared to intl jobs -are you not creating conflict with labour laws.Supposing in year one the 1 dollar = 50 rs and then rice is exported/sold at 2 dollars so you get 100 rs and MNC job salary is 15000 rs Now in year two how much increase in dollar rupee exchange rate and how much increase in rice export and how much increase in MNC job salary and similarly in year 10 how much increase....how do you tackle inflation w.r.t local jobs or local products prices or petrol import bill  Ideally local products should be lower prices and wages higher compared to foreign products prices and foreign jobs ",

The same thing happened to graphic designers and it will continue to happen across the spectrum of jobs that are lost to innovation, automation and soon, to artificial intelligence. Add some bad economic indicators and you will always have unemployment. ",
