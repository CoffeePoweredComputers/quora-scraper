            "answer_text": "Yes, you can edit build.prop without root. In fact, you can change any system files without rootI have edited build.prop on my android one this way when there was no root for marshmallow Why can't you do it normally?Because you don't have permissions to or your system is read only. Root provides you with root permissions, which lets you modify those system files and/or make system read write system  How toHere's how to do it. You need permissions. But you don't want root.Alright so move to somewhere where you won't need those permissions or you have enough permissions to do so. I'd recommend recovery mode. You have full access to system files in recovery mode, but only if it is mounted. Many stock recoveries don't have option to mount system partition or don't have adb access for commands. You might want a custom recovery for this. And no, you don't need root for custom recovery. I'll talk about this in next partSo now all you need to do is, boot into recovery (custom preferred), mount system and then using adb, pull the build.prop file  adb pull /system/build.prop <path to save file> Now edit the file you just extracted and save it Push it back to your phone via adb  adb push <path to your file> /system/build.prop You're not done yet. You need to set permissions too So open she'll via terminal adb shell Now from shell, set the right permissions  chmod 644 /system/build.prop And you're doneReboot your phone and see the changes Using custom recovery without rootWell, there are two ways to do so1. Install custom recoverySimply install custom recovery via fastboot and boot into it.P.S this requires unlocking bootloader 2. Temporarily boot into recoverySo you need recovery image for this Boot into recovery via fastboot fastboot boot recovery.img Where revocery.img is path to img file of recoveryP.S some phones might require unlocked bootloader even for this ",
