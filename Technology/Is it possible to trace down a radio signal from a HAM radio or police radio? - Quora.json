            "answer_text": "It is very possible, but it takes a lot of dedicated resources to do it within a short time or in a large area.The procedure is to first find the transmitter of interest in spectrum, using radio surveillance. After this, a network of fixed or mobile direction-finding (DF) stations take bearings to the transmitters, and make a smaller search area, to which mobile DF units are dispatched to directly locate the transmitter.Only very powerful organisations have the resources to do this on a regular scale. In years past, many civilian and military agencies kept a routine watch over the radio spectrum and had, sometimes extensive, DF resources at their immediate disposal, and could locate interfering or illegal transmitters quite rapidly. Now, only transmissions causing security concerns or interference to safety-critical radio systems raise the interest of modern-day spectrum monitors. Other have to wait. ",

            "answer_text": "Many modern radios have built in GPS units and also can beacon home. Say someone steals a police radio and that department is proactive, even if you don\u2019t transmit it may be doing it for you reporting the gps info and etc. Some systems can even allow the police to listen to what is being said by that radio. In government. Employees have zero expectation for privacy so this practice is perfectly legit. Do have amateur or ham radios have that same capability? Best I can tell you is that it look less than 4 hours of some kid using a baofeng for a group here to find him, take him to daddy and warm dad about the fines he might get. YMMV If you interested in radio get a license. If you cannot get a CB or FRS radio or even a MURS license. ",
