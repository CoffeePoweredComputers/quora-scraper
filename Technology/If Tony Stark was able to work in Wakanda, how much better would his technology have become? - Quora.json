            "answer_text": "To answer you my dear enquirer, his tech would have become a lot better and I'm stating this based on the fact that I think you're asking about the MCU because he does have some bit of control in the wakanda design group in black panther after killmonger ruined wakanda's economy. At his current pace I'd say yes it would because we've only seen a small portion of the tech that runs in wakanda from the MCU and we have heard mentions of other forms of tech. We have hover bikes and sophisticated high tech aircrafts and weapons and shuri's gauntlets. I actually have experimented with the idea and written down the improvements that can be made by using wakanda tech in the iron man suit ( cuz I'm a nerd like that). A) using the energy gauntlet tech that Shuri developed, the suit would be able to use that same kind of weaponry and even incorporate into the suit's weapons systems. B) making use of the vibranium microweave mesh or even vibranium coating would make Tony's suit capable of withstanding a lot of fire power. C) incorporating the force Push tech that is within the black panther suit and through some slight modifications. You could combine the stored kinetic energy and the Ironman suit's plasma blasts to make a wicked energy beam. The force Push would also have been very useful in his fight with Thanos because every hit thanos gave Tony would have allowed him to store kinetic energy to redistribute in the form of a force push and gain some distance and even an upper hand against Thanos. D) wakanda also has a form of energy shield tech that is woven into the king\u2019s guards' uniforms. These energy shields can also be incorporated into the ironman suit to allow for better defense. E) remember those kimoyo beads that can hack vehicles and other machines? Remote access kimoyo beads I think? Tell me if I got the name wrong but that would be Hella useful in the suit, especially you connect Friday to it. Now even though arguably Tony stark was able to create a suit that materialises itself onto its wearer in the same fashion as the black panther's, Shuri created before he did and she's 16, arguably also , Shuri could have collaborated with stark to help improve his suit using her Vibranium Nano Tech. To simplify, yes. ",

            "answer_text": "Tony might have been able to make his nano-tech armor from Vibranium, but that\u2019d be the only advantage. His nano-tech itself was on a much higher level than Black Panther\u2019s. Tony\u2019s suit could mould weapons, shields and repair itself (to an extent). The Vibranium would give him a stronger shell and kinetic abilities but that is sadly it. It would not have saved Tony\u2019s life from the snap. We saw Thanos destroy Captain America\u2019s shield which was made of the same material with a few blows. It would have just taken a more prolonged battle for Thanos to destroy it. ",
