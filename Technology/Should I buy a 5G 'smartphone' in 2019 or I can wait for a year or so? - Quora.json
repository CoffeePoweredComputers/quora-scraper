            "answer_text": "If you study 5G for about five minutes, you will figure out, it is mostly for super high bandwidth, plus very low latency, and it requires the 5G base station within very short range (not more than 1000 feet), so the chance for you to enjoy that 5G benefit is very slim, despite all the marketing hype about 5G, it is mostly for IOT and real time entertainment, and 4G will be your friend for a long while (at least another 5 to 7 years) before you see the good coverage of 5G. So my shoot is NO, you simply waste your money to buy some thought of illustration, it gives you no benefit in short time, and you may just pay extra money for the non existing service in for couple of years. I will wait for at leat one year, see price drop, then make the decision, the good news is that most of the new 5G phone will support all the 4G even 3G signal. ",

            "answer_text": "With just about every major US cellphone service provider prepping their 5G network rollouts, you\u2019ve probably seen 2019 hyped as the beginning of the \u201c5G revolution,\u201d or something similar. While 5G will be a major step forward for cellular networks and smartphones alike, the technology is still in its nascent stages. We know pretty well where 5G stands at the beginning of 2019, and from our perspective, some healthy skepticism is warranted (at least for now). This quick guide should help you understand what 5G even is in the first place; how it will affect smartphones; and whether or not you should buy a 5G phone this year. ",
