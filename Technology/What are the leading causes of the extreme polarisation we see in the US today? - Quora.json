            "answer_text": "Start with the fact that campaigning for political office is so expensive today, wealthy donors have a role in government that\u2019s far more than just one-man, one-vote. They don't write six-figure checks on behalf of wishy-washy moderates; they know exactly what they want and tell the candidates what that is. DurIng the campaign Trump harped on the border wall as if it was his #1 priority, but once he was president, what was the first bill he and the Republican-majority Congress passed? The tax cut, which the thriving economy didn\u2019t need; tax cuts are most effective in a recession, as an incentive to spur spending. But several members of Congress candidly said they\u2019d been told by donors, \u201cCut my taxes or never call me for a donation again.\u201d Also, the civil-rights movement occurred. Previously, evangelical churches had shunned political involvement, both because they didn\u2019t want to jeopardize their tax-exempt status and because they believed that Christians should bring about social change by modeling Christian behavior instead of by passing laws. That changed when the 1964 Civil Rights Act threatened the existence of their segregated schools. The Real Origins of the Religious Right Then Barry Goldwater foresaw the future: Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them. Not so long ago, one house of Congress would pass a bill, which would go to conference with the other side. From out of the conference came a bill which both sides could live with, even if neither side got 100% of what it wanted. Since January 2019, the Democratic House has passed hundreds of bills. But because being obstructionist pays well, and he thinks it benefits his party of obstructionists to accuse the Democrats of refusing to \u201cmeet us halfway,\u201d Mitch McConnell simply lets those bills gather dust on his desk. He never refers them to the appropriate Senate committees, no conferences take place, and no bill ever gets sent to the president to sign unless both houses of Congress and the presidency are controlled by the same party. Once there were conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans. But as flexibility vanished, conservative Democrats became Republicans, while liberal Republicans retired or were defeated by hardliners. In self-defense, the remaining Democrats have moved farther to the left. Whatever their constituents want, that\u2019s what each side supports, or else the incumbents risk being primaried. Barack Obama had learned as a community organizer that bringing two sides together could achieve results, and he came to the presidency determined to replicate this cooperation. He underestimated the fanaticism of Moscow Mitch who, thanks to the campaign war chest he controls, has become the most powerful Senate Majority Leader ever and has molded Senate Republicans into clones of himself.

            "answer_text": "Today? Polarization in the US today? Let\u2019s go back to the end of the 1990\u2019s \u2014 the Go-go decade of President Bill Clinton, when the USSR (1917\u20131991) had just fallen, and the US had a sweetheart trading deal with China, so that the US was the number 1, 2 and 3 world power in the world. All good, right? Well, until the Monica Lewinsky scandal hit the news for three solid years (January 1998 until November 2000). By Election time 2000, political perception was that the US had swung too far to the Left \u2014 too Liberal \u2014 as demonstrated by the Monica Lewinsky trials. So \u2014 the US swung back to the Right \u2014 the Conservative \u2014 and elected the son of former US President GHW Bush, namely, GW Bush, as President, whose only government experience was Governor of Texas for four years. Despite his lack of experience, Bush was elected because, I argue, the US was ready to swing back to the Right. I remember those days as extremely polarized. Fast forward four years, and as a result of 9/11/2001 the US was now occupying Afghanistan as well as Iraq, despite wide protest of the Left in the US. Then, by Election 2004, with Saddam Hussein conquered, and Iraq now also occupied, the US chose to re-elect President Bush by a narrow margin. I remember those days as extremely polarized. Fast forward four years, and Election 2008. As a result of eight years of a War footing, in the Middle East, we saw a US political perception that America had swung too far to the Right. We elected our first Black American President, Barack Obama, whose Middle Eastern surname reflected a desire in the US to reach out to heal wounds in the Middle East. America had swung back to the Left. I remember those days as extremely polarized. Fast forward another four years, and Election 2012. With tensions calmed in the Middle East, and despite enormous resistance from a Republican controlled Senate and Congress, President Obama was re-elected partly because of his Peace efforts in the Middle East. Yet his Domestic policy was under heavy suppression by the RIght. Nothing Obama could do received support in that Congress. I remember those days as extremely polarized. Fast forward another four years, and Election 2016. Obamacare had passed and was under heavy rightist attack. In a surprise move, the US Supreme court had also legalized Gay Marriage. Also, for two years the US had been plagued by ISIS attacks worldwide. There was a widespread perception that the US had swung too far to the Left. Finally, the Democrats, sure of a victory, supported the first female candidate for US President. I remember those days as extremely polarized. So, here we are at Election 2020. Two decades into the 21st century. My memory is that the US century began polarized, and has remained very polarized for all 20 years. Some citizens express a widespread sentiment that the US has swung too far to the Right too quickly \u2014 but I guess we\u2019ll know for sure in 15 weeks, come Election Day. Given a review of 21st century US politics, I don\u2019t regard today as significantly more polarized than we\u2019ve been for 20 years. ",

            "answer_text": "Ultimately, the Enlightenment. More recently, World War Two had several effects: i) Black men in the army gained a wider experience of the world, and had a temporary experience of relatively high status. ii) Women had a similar experience of temporary responsibility working in factories. iii) Anti-semitism ceased to be respectable. iv) The Allies were forced to define themselves in opposition to the Axis, that is in opposition to at least an extreme form of racial hierarchy. This all led to the civil rights movement, and analogous movements. Even more recently, the Soviet Union collapsed. During the Cold War, it was possible to say that policies such as government healthcare were socialist, which associated them with communism, the Soviet Union, and tyranny. A generation has now grown up for whom the Soviet Union is something in history. When you say to them \u201cgovernment healthcare is socialist\u201d, they take it literally, as just meaning \u201ca socialist is a person who wants things like government healthcare\u201d. \u2018Socialist\u2019 does not mean \u201call that is the enemy of America\u201d to them. In short, policies such as government healthcare are no longer beyond the pale to them. The internet has meant that they have a wider knowledge of life in other countries than their parents did, and it is more clear to them that all other developed countries have government healthcare, without gulags and purges. Finally, the United States is approaching the point where white people will no longer be a majority of the population. This coming change was illustrated by the election of Barack Obama. After McCain lost to Obama, the Republican Party leadership wanted the party to abandon the role, which it had held since the 1960s, of the party of opposition to civil rights. https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RNCreport03182013.pdf The Republican base rejected this idea and nominated Donald Trump. Thus we have a situation of profound disagreement: disagreement about where to go, not about how to get there. Party A is no longer worried that party B is incompetent, or that party B\u2019s strategies are going to fail. They are worried that party B might be competent and their strategies might work, taking us to a place which party B wants and party A finds repulsive. How do you have bipartisanship and mutual respect when you fundamentally don\u2019t want the same things?  Or maybe, as per another answer to this question, it\u2019s all a plot by Saul Alinsky. The Right\u2019s view of the world does have the virtue of simplicity. ",

            "answer_text": "This man:  Saul Alinsky was a left-wing rabble-rouser. Mostly a unionist, sometimes a communist, always a colossal pain in the ass, Alinsky developed and codified methods for other rabble-rousers to use for fun and profit. Mostly profit. Alinsky made no bones about the best part of community organizing being the organizer, the one who gives the orders, who holds the power. He admitted that it wasn\u2019t really that important to actually change people\u2019s lives for the better, as long as you could keep them angry and riled up and blaming others for your failure, you could hold on to the benefits of whatever political power you had. Solving the problems actually reduced political power because you would need to find a new disaffected population to organize. In any case, Alinsky really came into his own in the 1960\u2019s, when American universities began growing a fresh crop of pinkos dedicated to changing the world. He turned his program and techniques into a book called Rules for Radicals. The Cliff Notes version of the rules goes something like this: Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have. Power is derived from 2 main sources \u2013 money and people. 'Have-Nots' must build power from flesh and blood.\"\"Never go outside the expertise of your people.\"\"Whenever possible go outside the expertise of the enemy.\"\"Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.\"\"Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. There is no defense. It\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.\"\"A good tactic is one your people enjoy.\"\"A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.\"\"Keep the pressure on.\"\"The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself. Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.\"\"The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.\"\"If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counterside. Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.\"\"The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.\"\"Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.Note the ones that say \u201cpick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it\u201d and \u201cmaintain constant pressure,\u201d which is important enough to get mentioned twice. Alinsky\u2019s rules don\u2019t work unless you have an angry population that\u2019s angry all the time. In order to maintain that power, Alinskyists have to stoke that anger constantly. They have to demonize their opposition. Once they have done so, they can\u2019t turn around and compromise with people who might only have been competitors but were branded enemies. Cutting a deal with a competitor might be less than victory, but making a deal with Evil cannot be contemplated. Following the Alinsky Rules is like riding a tiger. Once you jump on, you can\u2019t stop or the tiger will eat you. So Alinsky\u2019s successors have been working since the 60\u2019s on polarizing, personalizing, and keeping the pressure on, and it will keep on this way until the last one dies. (Alinskyists don\u2019t retire. They can\u2019t let go.) So, Saul Alinsky is to blame for the polarization of our politics, because he popularized a method for self appointed \u201ccommunity organizers\u201d to spend their lives making a comfortable living for themselves while pushing political buttons.

            "answer_text": "This answer of mine to another question is relevant here. The polarization in economic ideas may exist in all countries. There could be people who think that there should be no taxes, and there are others who are for taxing a major part of personal incomes as taxes and using these for a variety of public services. This polarization does not affect the governance, since even if the two political parties take two extreme positions, these would finally come down to a moderate position through competitive democracy. Let us the take the following example. There are 11 voters in a country (it can be any number but we take 11 for the convenience). We may arrange these voters in the decreasing order of income. 1 is the Richest and 11th is the poorest. Let us take that there are two parties - one is Poor Person\u2019s Party (PPP) and the other is Rich Person\u2019s Party (RPP). When RPP competes with PPP, voters 1, 2, 3.. may vote for RPP and voters 11, 10, 9,.. may vote for PPP. However for RPP or PPP to win they should get not only the votes of their loyal supporters but also people at the middle, that is 5, 6, 7 or 6 specifically. That would mean that the competition would make both RPP and PPP to focus on 6 in shaping their agenda. However the polarization on some social issues is worrisome. My sense is that the life situation of many US citizens (living in rural areas as farmers, influence of specific churches, and so on) do not enable them to acquire certain liberal values. This is making the US somewhat different from a typical developed country like those in the Western Europe. ",
