            "answer_text": "So, here\u2019s the thing: in terms of characteristically new features in an Apple smartphone, there\u2019s nothing sort of that in the new iPhone SE. All the features, whether it\u2019s design or feature-wise, are taken from previous devices that we\u2019ve already seen before. However, that certainly doesn\u2019t mean that the iPhone SE 2020 is a bad phone or a bad purchase. In fact, if we consider a $399\u2013$599 price range for the device, it may very well be the most rational purchase out of the whole iPhone line-up. Let\u2019s see all the features to get more clarity behind this rationality. The design First things first, let\u2019s take a look at the design. It won\u2019t take long after you\u2019ve seen the actual phone to guess that there\u2019s virtually nothing new about its design and it looks exactly like the iPhone 8. On the front, it has the traditional massive chin and forehead that we thought we\u2019d never see in an Apple smartphone. On top of that, the new iPhone SE has a good-old Home Button - also a feature we\u2019ve already forgotten. On the back, we\u2019ve got a simplistic layout with a single-lens camera and an Apple logo in the center (probably the only visual change in the device). As for the screen, the smartphone has the same 750p display that the iPhone 8 and older devices rocked. Now, while it certainly isn\u2019t a more high-end OLED display with richer blacks and high contrast ratios, this Retina LCD display is still the best in its league. Overall, the new iPhone SE is a small, compact smartphone that brings back the old vibes, which is not necessarily a bad idea. You see, lots of people loved the original iPhone SE because it retained the stock form-factor of the iPhone 5: small and accessible body which is can easily be used with one hand. Besides, not everyone wants to have a giant 6-inch device in their pocket - it\u2019s just uncomfortable. And reviving one of its legendary lineups certainly speaks highly of Apple. The internals Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to what\u2019s inside of the second-gen iPhone SE. Just like before, when the first-gen iPhone SE had the same internals as its contemporary iPhone 6S, the new iPhone SE has the same power as the iPhone 11/Pro/Pro max. This means that the device has the most powerful A13 Bionic chip that drives the current flagships. The CPU is specked-up to the Hexa-core 2x2.65 GHz Lightning and 4x1.8 GHz Thunder that delivers an incredible performance that is on-par with the most powerful devices in the industry right now. As for the memory, the new iPhone SE rocks the fastest NVMe flash storage with three different configurations: 64, 128, and 256GB packages. For all three models, RAM is locked at 3GB, which may seem very low in this 8\u201310\u201312GB RAM world but hey, it\u2019s Apple that we\u2019re talking about and Apple is no joke when it comes to the hardware-software optimization. The same can be said about the battery. On the paper, the iPhone SE has an underwhelming 1821 mAh battery. However, we know that the recent devices have significantly improved in terms of battery life and there\u2019s no doubt the new SE will do the same. The camera Finally, let\u2019s talk about the camera. The iPhone SE 2020 has a single-lens camera set-up that has the same hardware capabilities as the standard 26mm lens in the iPhone 11: 12 MP, f/1.8, Optical Image Stabilization, etc. What\u2019s more, the phone uses the same software as the flagship iPhone, meaning the photos taken with the iPhone SE will be as magnificent as they are on the iPhone 11. The same goes for the video: the sensor is capable of recording 4K 60fps with Optical Image Stabilization, HDR, and stereo sound recording. One difference here is that the front-facing camera is 7 MP instead of 12 MP, which is definitely not a big deal for the majority of users. So, is the new iPhone SE worth it? It most definitely is. With its price range from $399 to $599, the device is probably the most rational Apple-related purchase you can make these days. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my thoughts as someone who switched from iPhone 11 to iPhone SE (2020): I love the new iPhone SE. If you love iPhone but want something a little smaller, this is 100% the phone for you. Quick history.. I had the 5S way back, upgraded to the 6 and didn\u2019t like the size jump and eventually fell into the original SE which I loved. I had it through multiple generations until I finally felt like the OG SE was getting a bit slow, I jumped to the 11. I really liked it. What a great phone. However, my one qualm is that I just don\u2019t like how big it is. I have no need for such a big phone. I\u2019m not watching blockbuster movies on this and I get the same enjoyment in watching puppy videos on a small or large iPhone. So once the new SE was announced, I pondered it for a few weeks and then went for it. This phone is great. It\u2019s actually just an iPhone 11 with a way smaller body. It\u2019s lighter and it fits in my hand (and pocket) far better than the 11. The screen and camera are slight downgrades but honestly, I don\u2019t need my phone\u2019s screen to be 8K OLED HDR as I\u2019m a pretty casual phone user. The phone still functions great and does everything you would need it to do. Bonus: Touch ID is super fast on this phone. Way faster than previous Touch ID devices and probably faster than Face ID. And now if you want to unlock your phone in the middle of the pandemic, it\u2019s quite simple to do again :) The only real negative is the battery. The battery is noticeably subpar. Now, this is compared to the 11\u2019s battery which is really great and could easily get from waking up to bed time without a charge and still have 20\u201330% left. With the SE, I can\u2019t make it the whole day unless it\u2019s locked and I\u2019m not using it at all. Without any mid-day charges, the SE\u2019s battery would probably die at maybe 6\u20138 pm. I do find plenty of opportunities to normally charge it throughout the day, so it\u2019s not a deal breaker. Conclusion: If you like iPhone 11 but want a smaller phone, the SE is the iPhone for you, as it\u2019s essentially an iPhone 11 in an iPhone 8\u2019s body. ",
