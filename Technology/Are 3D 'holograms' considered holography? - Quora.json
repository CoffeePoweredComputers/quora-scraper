            "answer_text": "Thnaks for the A2A. Short answer to \u201cAre 3D \"holograms\" considered holography?\u201d: NO. Holography is real, but not exactly what the general public expects, thanks to movies. This is an example of real, laser-projection holography. Looking a the glass plate from different angles will reveal different perspectives of the objects, in a very three-dimensional image. Making it requires a complex arrangement of lasers and mirrors. The results can be quite spectacular (an image of a lens can still function as a lens!)\u2026but its not Princess Leia\u2019s holo message.  If your project looks like that, then great\u2026 yours is a legitimate 3D holography project. Now, the flip side: What are more commonly called \u201cHolograms\u201d are special effects/illusions, pretending to be something which doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m glad you put that in quotations, so it seems you do know there is a difference. So here are some examples of, well, everything else that gets called a hologram, but is not:  Someone had the nerve to call every one of those things \u201cholograms.\u201d There are numerous variations on these. You\u2019ll notice that each of these is actually two-dimensional, and is really just a simple special effect. The onstage Tupac, Michael Jackson, et al is a bit of stage-magic used since the 1860s. Pepper's ghost - Wikipedia So now the more specific answer to your question: if you have an instructor who is, ahem, reluctant to allow your 3D holographic project, I imagine it\u2019s because he is anticipating yet another standard 2D image being projected on a layer of steam. I\u2019m not saying that what you are doing\u2026 I presume that yours is a true example of holography (you didn\u2019t give many details), in which case you may need to convince the instructor that its not one of those naive effects. I can understand the instructor\u2019s perspective: illusions belong in magic stores, not science fairs. So if yours is the real deal, you may need to educate him on that first. The problem stems from the overuse of the term \u201c3D holograms\u201d - its essentially become a marketing fad, banking on the ignorance of the public. Its misleading, whether purposefully or by assumption. Some are trying to sell them to the public for obscene amounts of money. People see \u201chologram\u201d projections on TV\u2019s \u201cNCIS,\u201d CNN or the \u201cIronman\u201d movies - often shown in the most casual way - and now most people sincerely believe those empty special effects are real. A search for \u201chologram\u201d on Youtube will get you results that are over 95% reflections, greenscreens, Persistence Of Vision devices, transparent monitor screens, etc. Quora is filled with questions along the lines of \u201cwhere can I buy my 3D projector?\u201d I can only imagine what the poor salesmen at Best Buy have to put up with on a daily basis. Hope this helps!  ",
