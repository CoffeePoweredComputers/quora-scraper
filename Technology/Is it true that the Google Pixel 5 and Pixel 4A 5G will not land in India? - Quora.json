And with google pixel 4a , google\u2019s main motive was to provide better option than the Oneplus Nord , anyways this is what i think! I hope this answers you! thanks ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is true Google will not bring the pixel 4a 5G and pixel 5 in india. I think the reason in behind of the sales performance of the previous pixels. They are not so popular in India. So, Google will test the sale by launching the pixel 4a in India in October.
