            "answer_text": "Leaving all practically aside for a moment, I\u2019d like to focus on the key problem with a \u2018space tether\u2019, tensile strength. I did a quick Google for \u2018Strongest Rope\u2019 and came up with Purple Plasma Rope | Rope Inc The strongest one has a tensile strength of 110,000lb and weighed 23.4lb/100ft. If you dangle 100 ft of it from a helicopter the very top of the rope will be under a load of 23.4lb, 200ft it\u2019s 46.8lb\u2026 at 89 miles the tension would be 110,000lb, that is without having any sort of working load on it and it\u2019s also 10 miles short of the very lowest Earth orbit (99 miles) so the rope is liable to break before you can do anything useful with it (bad weather could easily increase the load) . There is no easy way round this, you can\u2019t make a thicker rope because if you double the size the strength is doubled, but so is the weight. What is needed are materials that are far stronger than anything we currently have, Carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes and diamond nanothreads are all experimental candidates but far from such an application.

            "answer_text": "I asked this question many years ago and never got a suitable answer. So, I set about figuring it out for myself. This is what I came up with; No, it would not be possible. Look at the large scale picture of the earth's surface and a rope extending all the way out to a point in space, outside of our atmosphere and suitable for the natural orbit of a satellite. There is a point between the earth\u2019s surface and the satellite where gravity stops or ceases to exist. After that there is weightlessness. The rope has no weight. The rope has no ability to resist a pull from below. Do you see the answer coming? The part of the rope that is below the atmosphere/space line will be subject to gravity and will therefor have weight. Any weight at all would be more than enough to pull the weightless part down into the atmosphere. That part would then have weight to add to the downward pull already in effect. Soon the entire rope, with satellite in tow, would come crashing down to earth. You may attempt to counter this conclusion with the fact that the satellite would have centrifugal force on it's side to help resist the downward pull. Consider the weight of more than a mile of rope. Then consider the added weight of every foot of rope that subsequently joins the lower part of it. I believe my theory will stand up under scrutiny. Do you agree? Jack ",
