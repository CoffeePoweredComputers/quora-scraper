            "answer_text": "This is tough, there are plenty of very valid answers here. However, if I had to pick all around effectiveness I would say\u2026 the bayonet. Now hold on a minute, hear me out. So, basically its a knife (or spike) alone, but when attached to a firearm becomes a short spear. Especially in the early age of gunpowder (muskets and the like) these things were incredibly effective. I find it somewhat funny how people believe the bayonet charge to be woefully ineffective. It is in terms of modern warfare 99.9% of the time, there are a still few instances where the age old tactic has been used to great effect. However, think of it during the early age of gunpowder. So, you have two armies, doing the stupid thing and actually getting into a fight. Common soldiers on both sides shitting themselves because there they are lined up, trading volleys, men falling over to canon and musket ball. But then, one side just decides screw it, they have to reload between shots, 50 yards to cross? Our men can close distance, fix bayonets\u2026 charge! Many historical accounts verify that the men being charged at by the other side with sharp pointy objects broke, then fled, and either escaped or got stabbed in the back. I mean who would blame them? One moment trading volleys in semi-ordered warfare, the next the crazy bastards on the other side are trying to ram a metal spike on the end of a heavy musket through you? Yeah, i\u2019d try running too, cause A) I either have to try and reload, or B) try and fix my bayonet, or swing my musket like a club. Not to mention there\u2019s no telling if all my comrades will stay behind with me to fight in melee (probably not). As another individual put it, melee sucks, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019re going to get hurt fighting back. Distance is your friend, early gunpowder army commanders learned this, and sometimes battles were won without too many casualties cause one side ran away, literally ran away! When they saw the other side was batshit enough to fix sharp spikes to perfectly good firearms and charge them. After all, getting shot? Okay he might miss with a musket at this distance. Getting stabbed? I can\u2019t believe their charging oh god they\u2019re getting close holy hell he\u2019s not gonna miss BLARGH, my spleen! No really this happened, and back then it was more the rule than the exception. It certainly helped that it took a lot longer to reload a muzzle loader. Also consider that it was a melee weapon which caused the other side to flee in terror, sometimes without putting up a fight. Now that is interesting, not many hand-to-hand weapons can claim that boast. That said what\u2019s the melee weapon that\u2019s stuck around all the way up until now? The bayonet, which also nowadays doubles as a combat knife in most cases. Cheers and charge! ",

            "answer_text": "While I love swords and axes, and all the strange weapons the world has thought up to slay our fellow man, I must honestly say that the spear would be the most effective melee weapon in history. Why? Well, the spear was used more than any other weapon, ever. It could be used effectively against enemies by men with fairly little training. It also acted to make well trained soldiers exceptional. They were used by all great armies throughout the world\u2019s history. When paired with shields it was the single most effective war winner in history. That said, I think swords were always the ideal weapon. I use the world \u2018ideal\u2019 in the sense that everyone wanted them. It was the status symbol of a warrior. History tells us that swords have always been the \u201cbest\u201d, most sought after weapon type. But the requirements in training was much higher and the costs equally so. Generally speaking through the broad span of time of known history, swords have been the weapon of the elite; \u2018special forces\u2019 to use modern terminology. But like modern special forces, required extensive training and skill and huge monetary investment. Also, I would argue that there is not any \u2018best\u2019 sword; seeing as there are so many styles and each devised for various reasons. A second weapon that is extremely effective in well trained hands is the ax. The ax saw many variations as well but all left their mark on history with the effectiveness of a weapon that can cut and bludgeon at the same time. An ax could be described as a combination of sword and hammer. Somehow retaining a good piece of both \u2018parents\u2019 and becoming a highly effective weapon. Particularly in the age of plate armor. But alas, the spear survived the ages with little change. A long pole with a sharp tip. Many variations but always the design is similar. An honorable mention is the halberd; a grand weapon combining spear and ax. And one of the last of the edged weapons to fall out of use in favor of the rifle. (possibly the last since it was used by royal guards for many years) ",
