            "answer_text": " Vantablack. When it was first invented it absorbed 99.96% of all light. Most recently however they have created a new Vantablack that is almost invisible and apparently there is no current way to measure how much light it really absorbs.  Good luck getting to use it though. Currently there is only one artist that has been granted access to use it. Anish Kapoor angered several artists when he was the only person allowed to paint with Vantablack. \u201cAnish Kapoor provoked the fury of fellow artists by acquiring the exclusive rights to the blackest black in the world. - The Indian-born British artist has been working and experimenting with the \u201csuper black\u201d paint since 2014 and has recently acquired exclusive rights to the pigment according to reports by the Daily Mail.\u201d Currently the blackest black for the average artist can be achieved with charcoal. It\u2019s not a paint per se, but it can be mixed to resemble paint with some experimentation, I\u2019m sure. It seems that\u2019s the closest we are going to get any time soon. ",

            "answer_text": "David Cuthbert\u2019s answer is correct. Vantablack is, to date, the most light-absorbing substance available, with a few serious caveats I would hasten to point out here: It is incredibly expensive to manufacture and cannot be applied the way one might a paint, with brush and palette and solvents, as it must be \u201cgrown\u201d in a laboratory on the surface where it is to remain. It might not even be possible to create it atop conventional painting supports in an archival fashion, although this remains to be seen.Currently, blue chip artist Anish Kapoor holds exclusive license to use it, as far as art-making is concerned. (On principle I count myself among the many outraged artists referenced in the Vantablack Wkipedia article.) I\u2019m unsure as to what Kapoor intends to do with Vantablack but hopefully the work will be sufficiently impressive that we artists will be able to forgive his privilege.",

            "answer_text": "Ivory black, a deep velvet black made from burnt ivory it is not used much anymore for obvious reasons. It has been replaced with burnt bone which along with ivory black can be toxic if particles are inhaled. A modern invention (20th century) Mars black is often substituted. It has an iron oxide base and is not considered toxic. Unlike ivory and bone black Mars black has a quicker drying time and can be used for under paint Ivory and bone are not a common acrylic color but Mars is good in both medium. Rembrandt used alot of ivory black for its rich texture and illuminating quality. ",
