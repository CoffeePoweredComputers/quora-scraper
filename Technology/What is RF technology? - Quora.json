            "answer_text": "RF Wireless Technology: A radio frequency (RF) signal refers to a wireless electromagnetic signal used as a type of communication if one is talking wireless electronics. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with distinguished radio frequencies that range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz.  Frequency refers to the rate of oscillation (of the radio waves.) RF propagation happens at the speed of light and needn't bother with a medium like air to travel. RF waves occur normally from sun flares, lightning, and from stars in space that radiate RF waves as they age. Mankind communicates with artificially made radio waves that oscillate at different chosen frequencies. RF communication is used in numerous industries including TV broadcasting, radar systems, PC and mobile platform networks, remote control, remote metering/monitoring, and some more. RF in Smartphones and Tablets: Advances in wireless technology have prompted the development of new RF features in smartphones and tablets. This is urging RF device makers to develop high-performance RF components to meet the growing prerequisites from smartphone and tablet producers. In addition, the worldwide rise in the shipment of smartphones and tablets and the proliferation of 4G/LTE networks have made a solid demand for RF front-end modules owing to their compatibility with higher bandwidth frequencies. These components are powering the development of the global radio frequency front-end module market. In addition, the use of the 3700-3800 MHz band for the technology of international mobile communication IMT (and other radio technologies) is allowed from February 1, 2020, subject to the receipt of a license to use RF in this band on a competitive basis.

            "answer_text": "When it comes to RF - Radio Frequency technology, it is nothing but a wireless electromagnetic signal that is used as a form of communication in wireless electronics. Radio waves are also referred to as electromagnetic radiation with radiofrequency ranging from 3kHz to 300GHz. On the other hand, frequency is the rate of oscillation of the radio waves. Radio frequency propagation occurs at the same speed of light and can travel in the absence of any medium like air. Today, we use RF technology in a number of industries, such as radar systems, remote control, television broadcasting, remote monitoring, computer and mobile platform networks, and many more. ",
