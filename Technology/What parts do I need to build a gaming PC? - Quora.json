            "answer_text": "From most important to least: GPU: Easily the most important piece of the rig this is responsible for generating the stuff you see on the screen. if you want to game at higher resolutions getting a GPU with lots of VRAM is important. CPU: This is important since the GPU is dependent on how many frames the CPU can handle. You may have a the strongest GPU in the world, but if you don\u2019t have an appropriate CPU you might as well be running a GT710. Monitor: In FPS this is almost as important as the other two. High refresh rate monitors like 144hz and above feels completely. It allows you track easier , hit your shots more, and it feels just better overall. I play Destiny 2 a lot, and movement in that game is insane. I used to game on a 60hz monitor and ever since I got my 144hz my aim has gotten worlds better. However if you don\u2019t really play FPS\u2019s then the resolution of monitor you wanna play at and features like G-sync, HDR, IPS, TN, VA and Low latency such as 1 ms is still important and in many of these cases (HDR or higher resolution like 1;40p or 4K) will determine what type of CPU or GPU you want to get. Mouse (Mouse space) + Keyboard: I\u2019m putting these two together because having a MnK that you\u2019re comfortable using is pretty important. The more comfortable you are the better for your overall performance In game. I can\u2019t stress enough how important mouse space is. In FPS playing at low DPI and low sensitivity is a must, since arm aiming is not just healthier for your body but is more accurate. Having that space is also important Ram: Depends on your CPU, for RYZEN you want to have fast memory. (3200mhz+} but typically as long as you have enough it\u2019s fine. Storage drive: I recommend putting the games you play the most on an SSD. It doesn\u2019t improve performance at all but makes loading much easier Motherboard: Doesn\u2019t really improve performance, but is important to the overall system PSU: I mean\u2026 you need power to turn your computer on. Case: Naturally you don\u2019t want to just leave your computer parts out in the open. So a case is handy. and of course RGB: Every gamer knows how important this is. Easily the most important part of a rig. RGB is not just responsible for giving you 10+ more FPS, it can also increase your overall sex appeal, and automatically win you games. /s ",

            "answer_text": "Since you\u2019re looking to build a gaming PC, and not just a PC for basic, everyday use, my answer will include gaming hardware. Case. I recommend getting a mid-sized tower, if not a full-sized tower. Do your research. Make sure it has enough USB ports for your needs, and an extra HDMI if you plan to do Virtual Reality. If you do want to do Virtual Reality, then make sure your CPU/Video Card are up to speed. Most VR headsets recommend at least an Nvidia 1070 for decent results.Motherboard. Make sure your motherboard is compatible with your CPU, RAM and video card. Many CPUs fit in a 1151 slot, but that doesn\u2019t mean the CPU and motherboard are a match. 7th generation i-series intel processors require a \u201c200\u201d class motherboard. 8th generation i-series intel processors require a \u201c300\u201d class motherboard. Before the 200 and 300 there will be a letter such as \u201cB\u201d, \u201cD\u201d, and \u201cZ\u201d which indicates the level of features on the board and whether or not you can over-clock the CPU. If you want multiple video cards, then make sure the board supports Crossfire (AMD video card) or SLI (Nvidia video card). In short: Research your motherboard just like every other component. I\u2019ve built a lot of systems with Gigabyte boards, currently I use a computer with an MSI board, and almost everyone can agree that ASUS makes excellent motherboards.CPU. For most gaming PCs you want a Core i5 or i7 processor, or an equivalent AMD processor (I apologize - I am not versed on AMD chips, so I can\u2019t give good advice on CPU models). I have heard that the 8th generation i3 is better for gaming than all past generations of the i3, but I\u2019d still try to sport for an i5 at least. Get an i7 if you plan on doing heavy streaming and/or video editing.CPU fan. A lot of gamers like to get liquid cooling, but this takes extra planning to install. I still enjoy air-cooled systems, and will build my computers with air-cooling for the foreseeable future. Many CPUs come with stock coolers, which usually aren\u2019t bad, but they aren\u2019t incredible either. I have the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO in my rig, and this CPU cooler is considered one of the best options for air cooling by many gamers. I certainly am not disappointed with mine.Video Card. Most CPUs have video built in, but this will be mediocre video power, and not suitable for a gaming PC. For instance, I have a Nvidia 1060 3GB in my PC, and an 8th generation i5. Looking at benchmarks online, my video card gives a general 607% increase in speed over onboard-video for my CPU, which is a intel\u00ae uhd graphics 630 (website used for benchmark: Intel UHD Graphics 630 (Desktop Coffee Lake i5 i7) vs Nvidia GTX 1060-3GB). That is a hilarious difference in power. Just get a video card. Please. Video cards are criminally overpriced lately, so good luck on that. Be patient, and keep checking prices until you find something reasonable. Lower end video cards can still be bought for normal prices, but keep in mind that these are often not much better than the onboard video a lot of modern CPUs offer. Check benchmarks!RAM. You\u2019ll want a minimum of 8 GB of RAM, and get 16 GB if you can afford it. I have 16 in my machine, and I never use it up. A few games do use more than 8, though. For gaming purposes try to get well rated RAM with built in heat-sinks.Power Supply. Pay close attention to how much power your entire system will need. There are a lot of websites that will help you determine this. Don\u2019t go cheap on the power supply. Things are not pretty if/when a power supply fails. I speak from experience on this. I once had to replace an inferior power supply that had failed, and the video card it took with it.Storage. There is little to no reason to not get an SSD (Solid State Drive) as the main drive for your operating system. You can get a respectable 128GB SSD for under a hundred dollars these days, and they are worth it. I can\u2019t say enough how wonderful life is with an SSD. You will also want a 1\u20132TB mechanical hard drive for your games, unless you\u2019re rich and can afford 1\u20132TB of SSD storage. In short - SSD storage is fast, and may not last as long as a mechanical hard drive. Mechanical hard drives are slower, but tend to last longer. You pay more per GB for an SSD, which is why most people don\u2019t have a 512GB or 1TB for their main SSD. I will add that SSDs are becoming more and more reliable and last much longer than they used to. I have 3 drives in my personal system. 1 SSD, 1 1TB hard drive, and 1 2TB hard drive. I keep my OS on the SSD, my games on the 1TB hard drive, and everything else on my 2TB hard drive.The items I listed above pretty much cover it for the construction of the PC itself. You\u2019ll also need, obviously, an operating system. For gaming there is really no reason to go with anything besides Windows 10, as more and more games require it. Just do your best to turn off all the spying that Windows 10 likes to do. Your copy of Windows 10 *must* be 64-bit. Very few newer games work on a 32-bit OS. If you are against Windows, and you know your way around Linux, then you could also go with Ubuntu or another well maintained Linux distribution. Steam and GoG have fair support for Linux these days. After that is just odds and ends to make your life better. You\u2019ll need a monitor, of course, and gaming is amazing these days with a two monitor setup. There are lots of options for monitors, so don\u2019t just buy the first one you see. You will need a keyboard and mouse. Gaming keyboards and mice are pretty amazing. I bought my first gaming keyboard with my most recent PC, and I wasn\u2019t sure how much I was going to enjoy LED backlit keys. I love them. It\u2019s not necessary for gaming, or any computer use whatsoever, but the glowing keys sure are pretty. I enjoy my gaming mouse for its weight and shape, if nothing else. Another thing you\u2019ll want is a gaming headset. Most games these days support voice chat, and if not then most gamers will make Discord or Teamspeak servers for that game. Lastly, you may or may not want a controller for playing some games. Some purists do everything with mouse and keyboard, but I often like to slum it and use a controller. There\u2019s only four really good options for controllers, as far as I\u2019m concerned: PS4 Dual-Shock controller, Steam controller, XBox 360 wired controller, and XBox One wireless controller. I personally prefer the XBox 360 wired controller over the XBox One wireless, as I own both. The Xbox 360 controller has stiffer buttons and sticks than the XBox One controller. If I can give any advice I would tell you to learn from my mistake and do thorough research on your PC case. I got a great case, but I quickly learned that it did not have enough USB ports on the front for my needs. I would have spent an extra $20 to get the deluxe version of this case if I had done better research. Good luck, and happy gaming! Edit: Many gamers still swear by Windows 7, which is an amazing OS, but we will see more and more AAA games that simply will not work on Windows 7. More specifically, more games are requiring DirectX 12, which is not compatable with Windows 7 and below. Windows 7 official support is also slotted to end soon-ish, whereas Windows 10 has a much longer planned official lifespan. ",
