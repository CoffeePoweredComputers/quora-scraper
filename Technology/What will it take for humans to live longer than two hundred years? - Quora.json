            "answer_text": "Andrew, I suspect that living in good health to 100 years is much more attainable than exceeding 200.  People ask me why are cancers so much more prevalent than they used to be.  Certainly there are environmental reasons for certain cancers, but the overarching reason we see so much cancer is because our life spans have nearly doubled since the end of the 19th century.  In my view, if something else doesn't kill you first, say, accidental trauma, myocardial infarction, or stroke, you will eventually get cancer, and it will sooner or later, kill you.  This is simply because the longer you live the more that genetic mutations accumulate among regularly dividing cells, mostly epithelium and blood cells, which need constant replacement. And it's not just environmental mutagens causing this.  Every time a cell replicates its DNA in order to divide (mitosis) a few copying errors are made (like typos), which are passed to successive cell generations and, importantly, add up over time.  Most of these small single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have no effect on the cell's function, but every now and then, a SNP occurs within a gene or gene regulatory sequence, which does change something about the cell and its function.  When a cell accumulates several of these, it may become \"transformed\"; it is now the \"seed\" from which a tumor grows.  It may take over a decade until this growing tumor is detectable, but from there, exponential cell division makes it appear to grow quite rapidly.  Tumor cells also break loose and seed new tumors elsewhere in the body; they metastasize.  At his point, it's just a matter of time until the end.  New therapies, especially immunologically-based treatments, are beginning to show that cancers may someday be a well-controled chronic disease like diabetes can be controlled by insulin and careful diet.  That said, we have no way of preventing this kind of cancer, i.e. those not caused by environmental mutagens, but that occur spontaneously.  Another hope is the emergence of technologies to detect cancer cells' DNA in the bloodstream, enabling much earlier and thus more effective treatment. But the body undergoes wear and tear in many other ways as well.  I would not want to be healthy and cancer free, but crippled by joints decayed by time and use.  And yes, I know about joint replacement, I have a prosthetic hip and knee, but an artificial spine is nowhere on the horizon.   Lastly is the cost factor.  Healthcare money and medical resources are finite, and we must choose how to allocate them wisely.  Is it more important to have good prenatal and pediatric care, and good emergency departments, or should these resources be expended on artificially keeping people alive for 150 years?   My goal is to live and be healthy right up to the day I die, and to die in my sleep.  I know this is somewhat of a fantasy, but it's something to aim for.   ",

            "answer_text": "Its an interesting question because if we assume we are around 20 years away from the first effective rejuvenative therapies then the first person to receive them in around 2036 is currently in all likelihood around 65 so he would not reach 200 for 115 years after the first treatment, taking his 200th birthday to mid 22nd century by which time I think we will have had aging under complete medical control for around 50 years. Of course these dates are speculative but the first therapies could be as close as 5 or 6 years or as far as 35 but I think 20 years or less based on the speed of progress is around 60% probable.   I think its important to point out that personally, I don't think we will find an actual CURE for aging in the foreseeable future as I will explain in depth, but to live to 200 or more we don't need to. Whilst it would be ideal to cure aging we must be realistic and work on the basis that it will probably not happen. In my opinion, we must work from where our knowledge is currently at. Our strongest area of knowledge lies in that, although we understand the reasons why the body deteriorates with age, we do not have the requisite knowledge to intervene in a way that influences the actual ongoing metabolic processes because what we currently know when it comes to metabolism is a fraction compared to what we don\u2019t know putting us in a very weak position The area in which we are fairly strong is that we know the types of damage which occur through the aging process and therefore if we could repair the damage we would not have to understand the bodies metabolic processes in order to wind back the clock. Whilst this will not be a cure it would effectively be a shortcut to radical life extension as I will explain in detail shortly. I am often asked \"How long before we can actually cure aging?\" to understand let\u2019s keep in mind that we are already adding two months to life expectancy every year (or 5 hours per day) and this has been consistent for the last 30 years or so. If we then consider that many people including myself see better than a  50% chance of controlling aging within 25 years and the whole issue starts to become very interesting. As far as the time span for an actual cure, I would hazard a guess that it is at least 100 years away. The alternative approach is to aim at controlling aging and repairing the accumulated damage and this should be our primary goal because we understand how the damage is laid down even though we understand very little about actually slowing aging or influencing metabolism as I mentioned in the opening paragraph. This is the essence of Aubrey De Grey's SENS see SRF Home | SENS Research Foundation theory regarding the engineering approach and it holds the best prospect of success in the first half of this century. Having said that two other well-funded organizations are waging war on aging so when you factor those two into the equation things are looking very positive, the first company is Calico, which is an independent R&D biotech company established in 2013 by Google Inc. and Arthur D. Levinson and the other is Human Longevity, Inc.  these two indicate that the field is attracting serious funding and these will be followed by numerous others big and small so we are at the beginning of a serious push being made to tackle the problem which aging poses to everyone currently alive. Current breakthroughs in the area of telomere research relating to the lengthening of telomeres are of great interest to me at the moment because the research is moving extremely fast and clearly it is technically possible and highly probable it will translate into humans. The primary concern with the lengthening of telomeres used to lie in the theoretically elevated risk of cancer but this problem does not apply based on the current research which you can see on the Stanford University website at this URL - Telomere extension turns back aging clock in cultured human cells, study finds - as a researcher in aging I consider this research and some supporting and complementary research which has taken place at Harvard coupled with an additional research relating to a compound that is related to Rapamycin tends to indicate that we are finally making significant progress in addressing the diseases of aging. Interestingly shortening of Telomeres was until recently perceived by many as being a result of aging and not causal but the research at Stanford clearly repudiates this and suggests that Dr Bill Andrews Cure Aging or Die Trying was correct all the way along. There are already products on the market which claim that they can provide \"Healthy Telomere support\", A typical example is this one here :  Product B - Telomeres and Aging - The Official Site of Isagenix International I'm uncertain as to the benefits of these products but I know that the future potential is enormous and product B is particular interest to me because it is supported by Dr Bill Andrews himself who is a leading authority on telomeres. As far as the mechanism of delivery which has been developed so far the scientists at Stamford used modified messenger RNA to extend the telomeres so the whole process if it translates effectively into humans - and the evidence is suggesting it will - would be pretty straightforward especially when you consider the degree of extension which is 1000 nucleotides and the fact that the telomeres which lengthens the telomeres is only active in the body for 48 hours which means there is no significant risk of cancer due to the limited time during which proliferation of the cells could take place. Personally I am pretty confident that with SENS and other routes being explored such as the Telomere research above show that we do not have to find a cure for aging itself, therefore, we bypass the problems that our lack of knowledge in the area of metabolism and the aging process creates because what Aubrey de Grey terms \u201cengineered negligible senescence\". Can potentially extend life indefinitely while not actually curing the underlying aging process which is allowed to continue as normal. This means that even if we failed to develop a cure for aging we would still be able to enable people to live well beyond 200 years even using the repair and maintenance approach. The key to all this lies in the fact that we have a sufficient understanding of genetic and biochemical processes that lead to metabolic damage that we can already envision what is termed the engineering approach. Aubrey frequently uses the question \"How long will a house last?\"  Of course, the answer is that, if you look after it, it can last forever! The key here is that Aubrey proposes that we find a method to undo the damage that has accumulated over the first 50 or 60 years of a person\u2019s life. Repairing the damage means we do not need to understand all the processes of aging, only that we need to know enough to extend healthy lifespan by let us say 30 years.   So you are probably asking \"how would it work in practice?\" It\u2019s actually quite easy to follow and what this means in essence is this,  Let\u2019s say you are 60 years old at the time of the first intervention and that this early and fundamentally imperfect treatment repairs 75% of the accumulated damage.  Then 10 years later you would reach the chronological age of 70 but would be biologically only 45 years old and look and feel like a 45 year old. We now come to the vital key to the whole theory which is this, let's say 20 years after the first treatment, when you are chronologically 80 but biologically 55 years old, clearly both your doctor and yourself will realize that the damage that was not repaired in the first treatment combined with further damage accumulated over the 20 years since is again posing a health risk.  At this point it is time for another intervention. It is now that the progress in medicine comes into play because, by the time 20 years has gone by, anti-aging medicine will have moved on significantly and, whilst the first treatment bought you an extra 20 or 30 years by repairing a fair amount of the damage accumulated over 60 years of living, it did not repair it all. 20 years later progress will mean that the latest treatment will not only repair all of the damage corrected by the first intervention but also some of the damage that was not able to be repaired 20 years earlier so in essence you are now chronologically 80 (but biologically in your 50s) and having intervention number 2  means that, whilst you will have aged 20 years, chronologically you will be biologically younger after the second intervention than you were after the first.  This is the essence of Aubrey de Grey's theory and pretty much any other theory based on rejuvenation and damage repair, essentially, it's a short cut to radical life extension. It is not a cure but it acknowledges that it does not need to be because it simply buys time and leads to a situation where regular interventions at say 15/20 years intervals with increasing effective treatments could extend life virtually indefinitely. Will it happen? My opinion is that we are well on the way in a number of areas such as gene therapy, stem cell therapy, tissue engineering and numerous other types regenerative medicine such as work with Telomeres. Progress depends on funding although a number of factors will drive things forward and interest is increasing among both Scientists and the general population as well as wealthy philanthropists. The greatest driving force of all is that the baby boomers are aging and this will place increasing demands on healthcare systems. Keep in mind that the average person costs more in medical expenditure in the last year of their life than all the other years put together.  Also the number of workers is declining in most developed countries which means that we need to keep the existing population working and productive as long as possible.  These are just two reasons but jointly they pose a serious economic problem to many governments worldwide. So what time-frame do I put on it? I made a projection some time back and, based on current research, I feel we will be pretty much able to treat and manage aging within 20/25 years given sufficient motivation, appropriate research and robust funding which is starting to flow with Google Calico and PayPal founder Peter Thiel on board with SENS plus other wealthy individuals who are waking up to the fact this is something which is possible and no longer in the realms of Sci-Fi. Many of the therapies are progressing quite well already such as stem cell therapy, Gene therapy and tissue engineering but without a comprehensive intervention targeting all of the types of damage that arise due to aging the treatments individually will most likely just allow a person to grind on for 5 or 6 years. Of course there are other routes other than engineering approaches such as SENS and I think even Aubrey de Grey knows SENS is only a means to  get a foot on the ladder but clearly once SENS strategies are perfected they will certainly save millions of lives and prevent a great deal of suffering. As I see it, There are five technologies which will ultimately lead to radical life extension during the course of this century, These are advanced Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Advanced Robotics, Genetics and Robust Artificial Intelligence often just referred to just as AI, The effect these technologies will have on life extension differs greatly but my guess is that there are two potential approaches which are likely to come to fruition first, one is SENS which is biotechnology the other is a combination of robust artificial intelligence combined with whole brain emulation. Whole brain emulation is where the brain is uploaded to a digital medium and increasingly enhanced and replaced with non-biological components until it reaches a stage where the non-biological components can model the biological part so accurately the original brains loss would be irrelevant from a functional perspective.  Personally, I feel the outcome long term will ultimately be a combination of the five technologies above, the crucial point is that each of these technologies individually has the potential to get us to where we need to go. What this means is that for the development of radical life extension to fail all of these technologies must also fail and that simply won\u2019t happen although maybe not all of the technologies I describe would be sufficiently developed in 20 years the road ahead for those that aren't will already be very clear. We must also factor in that there is also a possibility that we could find a faster route and that treatments to lengthen telomeres might have a greater benefit than assumed and current research as mentioned above confirms that it does. Clearly lengthening the telomeres through temporary activation of telomerase is massively beneficial now it looks like increased risk of cancer is no longer a major factor. The implications for tissue engineering are interesting too. It was thought until recently by some that the shortening of Telomeres was a consequence of aging and not a cause but all evidence tends to indicate otherwise based on ongoing research as mentioned above. Nevertheless the implications of combined stem cell and lengthened telomeres could mean we can greatly improve our abilities regarding biomedical repairs. If you are unsure whether this is a war worth fighting consider this, When the war on aging is won (and it's a case of when not if) 100,000 people per day would be saved!  This is because, of the 150,000 people who die each day, two thirds die from aging.  This is a staggering figure and what this means is that, of nearly 60 million people who die each year, 40 million die from age related issues.  I believe we will achieve significant positive results within the next decade in research on mice and that the knowledge acquired will then be transferred to humans and, hopefully, end the horrific descent into senility and old age of the millions of people who linger in retirement homes and suffer the indignities that come with the passing years. Conquering aging is pretty much the same as beating any other disease, albeit aging is a complex issue involving many different processes but that does not mean that it is not a realistic goal to render it a chronic albeit manageable condition within a 25 year timeframe.
