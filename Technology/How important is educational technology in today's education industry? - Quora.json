            "answer_text": "The educational technology of today is helping teachers to enhance their teaching methods beyond traditional book-based learning and engage students with new ways of studying and retaining information. This technology allows us to switch from the classical model of education which is becoming too obsolete to the contemporary model. The contemporary model suggests that learning experiences aren\u2019t limited to the classroom environment anymore, but happen within a range of physical and virtual environments. Knowledge doesn\u2019t have to be delivered linearly. With the help of technology, learning is becoming nonlinear. Scheduling structures are becoming fluid and flexible. Now, it\u2019s not just students, but also teachers that are becoming self-navigated learners. Why is this switch necessary? The classical model isn\u2019t capable of educating students according to the requirements of tomorrow. Modern students are digital natives. They are increasingly advanced users of technology and schools have to offer an adequate level of education and thanks to that empower students with the skills they need to succeed in the upcoming future - Creativity, Critical Thinking, Communication, and Collaboration. E-learning requires using advanced educational platforms like Khan Academy or LearnCube, learning management systems (LMS) like Tovuti, collaboration platforms like Popplet, and comprehensive digital learning tools like those by Kdan Mobile. Implementing this powerful software would allow teachers to make the much-needed step forward and embrace technological changes while creating a new and stimulating learning environment for their students. The coronavirus outbreak has created an unprecedented situation giving thousands and thousands of schools worldwide the only one possible way to provide their students with the ongoing educational process. Back in spring, it was implemented mainly through video conferencing software like Zoom or Cisco, which saved the day somehow at the beginning of the pandemic crisis, but recreating a virtual classroom is not enough for initiating custom teaching and learning methodologies and - therefore - unleashing contemporary learning that is here to stay.  Disclaimer: I am a part of the Kdan team, so my answer might be a little biased. ",
