            "answer_text": "The correct quest should be does whatsapp still support iPhone 4s. In iPhone 4s perspective, the hardware itself still capable for just whatsapp application to run. The problem is the os which apple already stopped the software update for this phone. So it\u2019s now depend on WhatsApp whether they still want to support older iOS version. And maybe because the active user of iPhone 4s still massive, they probably think it\u2019s worth to keep whatsapp compatible with iPhone 4s ",
