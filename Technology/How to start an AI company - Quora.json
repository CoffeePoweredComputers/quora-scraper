            "answer_text": "By exploiting hype, overpromising and outright lying. Let\u2019s do a little market analysis. How many companies are working on teleportation? Death star construction? Building cities on the Moon? AI is a scientific endeavor. It\u2019s going to be solved, but to become a commercially viable thing it will take a very long time. Worry not, you don\u2019t need to create an actual AI to start an \u201cAI company\u201d, you can just download the last ImageNet solution, deploy it on your Amazon server, write a crappy chatbot and do a shitload of PR - everyone will be thrilled. The most important thing is PR. Everyone must know that what you do is the next big thing. That it will transform the reality as we know it. Journalists will write literally any bullshit you feed them because AI is like a scandal in Kardashians family, but for geeks - it provides enough excitement, nobody really understands what is really going on, and nobody has a way to find out the truth unless you let them to. Which brings us to the next stage: don\u2019t show them the actual prototype. Build a carefully crafted closed-beta prototype for the most inquisitive of investors which will show them some interesting tricks, but no more. Don\u2019t make it publicly available - people will break it in minutes and everyone will see the truth. Inflate the price. What you are aiming for is the acquisition. A very good thing to do is to solve some problem that will look cool, but won\u2019t be that hard in reality. It will create even more hype and you will be able to eventually sell the company for a hundred million and it will be a big win. This is a pathway to create a company that makes money. If your goal is to monetize AI research, you need to be either a brilliant and experienced scientist or a brilliant and experienced businessman first, whatever appeals to you more. If you start with it, things will look much clearer from that point. ",

            "answer_text": "You can start an AI company by focusing on a sustainable business model with low cost. AI as of 2018 has actually a great such model which is licensing of data sold to businesses. This what the big guys are doing with their AI cloud offerings. And their offerings are not particularly diverse nor advanced and therein lies big opportunity. Let me give you an example. I do not mind giving it away as I have always been a car fan. Suppose you take an easily available and retrainable image recognition model such as Google Inception and you train it for recognitions of car makes and models. Blippar actually offers such a service. But how hard would it be to pull this off? For a persistent and determined entrepreneur the answer is not as difficult as one might think. There are around 10K makes and models in the US market and assuming around 100 images each we get roughly 1M images. Note that these are very approximate numbers, just to give you an idea. It is not a rocket science to get lots of images of all kinds of cars, from all angles. You can get them by crawling, scraping and even by a determined manual effort where you can get hundreds of such images by saving webpages complete with images manually.  Or you can do simple crawling. Just for fun I crawled the Internet for a week and got many millions of image urls with all kinds of easily available meta-data that can be used to automatically pre-classify them for training. Or you can just grab lots of them from Common Crawl (I tried that too, it is not that hard as they are an excellent resource). It would take several weeks of determined effort for a dedicated individual or a small team to create an interesting dataset that can be offered to customers. Your business model would be selling licenses for 1000 queries to your system for $1, which is typical these days. The key is to control your cost which are very low since you are doing it yourself and not paying any hardware not software licenses. Contrary to popular myths and misconceptions one does not need millions from VCs to do startups. Experienced entrepreneurs know that such monies greatly raise the bar for success, not to mention loss of control. The above car example is one of many, there are all kinds of things you can focus on to create a dataset nobody has tried before. I leave that to your imagination. ",
