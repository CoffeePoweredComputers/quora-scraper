            "answer_text": "Humans are currently better than robots: Humans are smarter than robots in the sense that they are far easier to program to do repetitive tasks of the kind that we currently think of automating.Humans are more reliable than robots in the sense that they break down less frequently, and repair themselves.Humans are more dexterous than robots. They can pick up small machine parts, handle soft and deformable loads effectively, and lift objects up to 35lbs without much risk of damage. Robots exist which are stronger, and robots exist that are more dexterous, but it\u2019s a rare combination.Humans have better visual systems than robots, able to recognize target objects even when they are mixed into a visual field full of irrelevant things.Humans have a self-contained power supply that is good for a whole day\u2019s picking and carrying, and which degrades only slowly without food. Robots need either to be tethered to a power source, or they must run on batteries that are only good for an hour or two, or have noisy, dirty liquid-fuel motors.The human sensorium is replete with sensors, many of which provide feedback to human effectors (arms and legs) so that humans respond more smoothly to exceptional circumstances like dropped work, obstructions, damage, etc.That\u2019s just the top of the list, and in no particular order. All of it is subject to improvement in robot design. ",

Humans do work better than robots for certain things like talking and communicating about what another human wants or needs, right now robots are not good at that and when they will be it will be incredible to witness.

            "answer_text": "You cannot replace the versatility of a human being with a machine, no matter how complex it is. Simply because we have judgment and therefore can adapt to everything (or almost). But the only advantage of machines is that they can work in place we cannot (like high radiation). But in normal conditions we will always be able to turn on a dime when it comes to work compared with a machine that needs reprograming and other adjustments. It\u2019s no wonder why Elon Musk himself revealed that he underestimated the quality of his workforce. Because his machines couldn\u2019t change the way they were doing things. Because when you work with new designs, you often need new tools\u2026 And it\u2019s not easy for machines\u2026 As it takes much more engineering to make a tool to serve a machine. Besides, we can do things that machines will never be able to do. Like having inspiration for an invention or art piece. It\u2019s why the day humans will stop to work for themselves, will also be the day they work against themselves (as machines can serve us, but cannot rule us). ",

            "answer_text": "Humans are much, much smarter with broad based knowledge, can be taught new things by a child, and in many respects only cost a minimum wage to use. Whereas a robot is specific to a single purpose; it requires a team of expensive specialists to train a robot a new narrowly defined task; robots are very, very expensive. I think all this \u201crobots taking over\u201d stuff is exactly like the 4-day work week we were told about in the 80\u2019s: pure bullshit, whose only purpose is selling the ads in the articles talking this nonsense.

We stopped at an assembly station where a woman was putting a spring onto a subassembly. On the third subassembly, the woman instead put the spring into a box and got another spring in its place. \u201cWhy did you put that spring into the box?\u201d asked my manager. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a little dirty, let me show you,\u201d she responded, reaching into the box to retrieve the spring. That\u2019s when we knew just how hard our task was going to be. Q.E.D. ",

            "answer_text": "Some things robots do better than humans, but the cost is consequential. Example: a CNC router is a milling machine that cuts plastic, wood, etc. It keeps tolerances that the human hand can\u2019t manage. It can run without much supervision. It still requires a human to man it: to pull the completed components off, stock and adjust the new stuff, clean, dust, repair, and program the unit. Great machine. But a skilled person can get almost the same results with jigs and a bit of setup time. And they don\u2019t need programming. ",
