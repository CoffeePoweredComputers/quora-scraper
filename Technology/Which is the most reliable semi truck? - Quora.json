            "answer_text": "Well according to someone high up at TR Group who have a very large fleet of trucks both in the rental pool and on lease , Isuzu was their best performing truck and the worst was Scania. We get good results out of our older model K104 Kenworths. Generally the Euro stuff is good when new but when high in miles are costly to keep on the road as they are very complex. In my own experience of Isuzu\u2019s , they tend to be a bit bland and lack power. They are also heavy and not particularly fuel efficient. But they do tend to be reliable. I would also not buy those Chinese trucks that are starting to show up over here. I can\u2019t see one of those being any good at high mileages. Also high mileage automatic transmissions can be problematic. We had a high mileage Iveco and it was a piece of shit. My boss will never buy another. A mechanic warned me about high mileage MANs too. I drove one once and it was quite nice. 3 or 4 years later I drove it again and all the nice stuff like the heated seats had stopped working but it was a fleet truck that everyone drove. I have also found Freightliners to fall to bits especially cab trim etc. Same with Iveco. The old Stirlings tend to be basically reliable but same deal. It has steering wheel mounted cruise control buttons that seldom keep working and same with the gauges. Also the cab trim and fittings were a poor fit but a mechanic told me if it broke down on the side of the road they could usually get them going again. I personally found them comfortable but they were noisy ",

            "answer_text": "Kw and Pete-- the owners tend to care more for the trucks than others. im not a fan of paccar engines, or cummins for that matter, wish CAT still built engines for trucks. they hold better resale values however ask a trucker and you will get 20 different answers it all depends on who you ask. i only buy International Eagles if im buying International. Freightliner - decent trucks but most are treated like starter trucks-- it is hard finding a decent used truck that hasnt been abused somewhere. Mack- is the best damn work truck- daycab utility truck-- ie dumptruck, daycab truck, ect. it takes a beating and keeps on lickin' ",
