            "answer_text": "ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) was the first general purpose computer. It was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. It was primarily designed, and used, to calculate artillery tables for the Army, it was also used to study the feasibility of thermonuclear bombs. It was programmed with with hard-wired function tables that each had 1200 10-way switches. It could also receive input from IBM punch cards, and used an IBM card punch for output, which could then be sent to an IBM accounting machine to be printed. It was octal based, rather than binary. I actually have seen part of ENIAC at the Computer Museum in Mountain View, CA. I held up my iPhone and said, \u201cThis was your great, great, great, great\u2026granddaddy. EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) was the successor to ENIAC, was binary based, and used stored programs, and was also designed by Eckert and Mauchly, UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic Computer I) was the first commercial computer. It was designed by the same two men who designed ENIAC and EDVAC. Their company, Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation was acquired by Remington Rand before the design was complete. Remington Rand became part of Sperry, which is now known as Unisys. The first UNIVAC I went to the Census Department, and the fifth machine, built for the Atomic Energy Commission was used by CBS to predict the 1952 election, correctly predicting that Eisenhower would win based on only 1% of the vote, even though Stevenson was heavily favored. The UNIVAC name would be used on a number of computers and peripherals, including the UNIVAC 1110, which was the first computer that I used. I truly wish I could have another session programming on that behemoth. I\u2019ll never forget that mainframe ozone smell. ",
