            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s break this into pieces Aerodynamics: The exterior body of the vehicle (shape of the vehicle) is designed such that the friction coefficient is always low as far as possible the try to attain \u201czero\u201d friction factor which is impossible so they try to maintain it close to zero so that they will decrease the drag coefficient too. CFD plays a crucial role analyzing the flow over the vehicle.  image source: History of the Drag Coefficients in Cars (Refer this for more information on Drag coefficient) Fuel air mixture: CFD is also use to analyze the fuel air mixture phenomena to optimize the fuel for the same required conditions Flue gases: CFD allows to visualize the flow of flue gasses through the exhaust gasses and helps us to control the heat release rates to the atmosphere.

            "answer_text": "Computational Fluid dynamics playa vital role in Automotive Engineering. First amd foremost the shape of car is made aerodynamic to reduce thedragas much as possible. For which CFD analysis is done. Even it is an integral part of design process. Apart from theair flow outside amd underbody of the vehicle. CFD is also used to find the air flow inside the intake manifold, flow of air fuel mixture after combustion, air flow aroud the radiator ,etc. Apart from these there are many other applications where ever there is interaction of fluid (air water etc) in or with the vehicle ",
