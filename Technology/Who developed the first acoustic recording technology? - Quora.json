            "answer_text": "NPR \u201cEdouard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville invented sound recording 20 years before Thomas Edison invented the phonograph. Sound had been invisible and transient since the beginning of time. Scott\u2019s phonautographrecorded it and made it both visible and perm\u00adanent. It was a technological breakthrough, ahead of its time. He did not intend for his phon\u00adautograms to be played back; that concept was another 20 years away  Thomas Edison built the first playback of sound device in 1877, but after proof of concept with short life tin tubes, 5\u20137 playbacks only. He pivoted and worked on electric lights. He got back to the phonographs in late the 1880\u2019s with wax cylinders. Cylinders were not easily copied. And later still in 1887 Emile Berliner Invented flat wax / lampblack disks were invented, eventually disks were used for recording, and inverse Mirror image mothers made by applying successive layers of Liquid metals and finally a support backing. Berliner created Deutsche Gramaphone company. This allowed stamping of a series of wax records identical to the original recording.between 1,000 and 5,000 could be made at various periods before the master wore out. If an artist was expecting many sales tgey would record the same material several times. 25,000 pressings meant 5 different performances relatively the same. ",
