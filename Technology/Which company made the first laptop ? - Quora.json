            "answer_text": "The very first time it was proposed was as  a \"personal, portable information manipulator\" and was imagined by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968,[2] and described in his 1972 paper as the \"Dynabook\".[3] IBM was the first to produce such a device, with the IBM 5100, the first commercially available portable computer, appeared in September 1975, and was based on the SCAMP prototype. In 1981 the first laptop sized device was produced by Epson in the form of the Epson HX-20, although Osborne Corp produced the first successful portable microcomputer in the same year, the Osborne 1, which was the first successful, mass produced and most likely most recognizable early portable computer.  Portable computers began to look more like what we use today in 1981-82 with the GRiD Compass 1100, in the Us nad Britain, although this was mostly only used by NASA and military in 1983 the  Gavilan SC became the first portable computer to ever be called a laptop by its manufacturer. By 1988 VGA resolution became common, and by 1991 color screens became common. cite- Wikipedia Laptop ",
