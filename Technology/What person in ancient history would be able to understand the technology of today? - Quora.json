            "answer_text": "People in ancient times were every bit as intelligent as people today. The human brain has not changed significantly in the past 10,000 years. The problem is that no one from ancient times ever saw anything even remotely resembling a modern laptop computer, a modern cell phone, or any other modern digital device, so these kinds of devices would be utterly foreign to them in every way. Devices like the Antikythera mechanism were advanced for their time, but they are still a far cry away from the sheer complexity of a modern computer. Furthermore, most ordinary people in the ancient world never even handled those kinds of devices first hand and many of them probably did not even know such devices existed. Imagine trying to figure out how to use some bizarre, extremely complex, futuristic device totally unlike anything you have ever seen that uses a form of energy you did not even know existed. It would be a very difficult thing to do to say the least. That is what it would be like for a person from the first century BC examining a modern electronic device. Most people would probably eventually be able to figure out how to use a computer or cell phone on their own if they kept trying, but it would be difficult.  ABOVE: Fragment A of the Antikythera mechanism I reckon that most people from ancient times would eventually be able to figure out how to use a modern device, albeit only after much frustration and trial-and-error. Being able to use a device, however, is not the same thing as truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d it. It is important to point out that even most people today do not really \u201cunderstand\u201d modern technology. I honestly have no idea how a computer actually works; I just know how to use one. Only a relatively small percentage of the population knows enough about computers that they could actually explain in detail how one works. I would say that no one from ancient times would be able to understand modern technology immediately without anyone to explain it to them. A few exceptionally brilliant people who had lots of experience working with mechanical devices\u2014such as Archimedes of Syracuse, Ktesiboulos of Alexandria, or Heron of Alexandria\u2014might be able to figure out how modern technologies work on their own, but only if they were given a lot of time to examine said devices, take them apart, and study them. Probably the vast majority of people from ancient times would eventually be able to understand modern technology if they had someone to explain it to them\u2014in the same way that most people today would eventually be able to understand modern technology given someone to explain to them how devices work.  ABOVE: Bust of a man from the Villa of the Papyri in the Roman city of Pompeii identified (probably spuriously) as a bust of the Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes of Syracuse. Archimedes could probably figure out how modern devices work on his own, but only if he was given plenty of time to examine them, take them apart, and study them. ",

            "answer_text": "Any reasonably intelligent person who would be prepared to understand the rudiments of physics, mechanics and chemistry could. Humans are educable with one caveat\u2026 that pertains to all people in all ages. So some rather intense remedial study would be required. You WOULD have to be prepared to understand and accept the scientific method. But then we are speaking about a minority in all ages and cultures aren\u2019t we. It takes a certain courage to abandon superstition and cant but the long legion of the superstitious, lazy and gullible are prevalent in every age and culture. But can I see Archimedes after a semester or two at MIT discussing the finer points of 11 Dimensional String Theory with Brian Green? Why yes I can. And he\u2019d LOVE the Special and General Theory of Relativity. Would a Roman Engineer maybe have some insightful contributions to make concerning constructing habitats on Mars for future colonists? Doubtless they would. Would a Roman Medicus, after a little remedial study, understand the dynamics of Pandemics? No doubt. So some of our ancient forebears could, no doubt, readily understand modern technology and science. Why some of we moderns actually do! ",
