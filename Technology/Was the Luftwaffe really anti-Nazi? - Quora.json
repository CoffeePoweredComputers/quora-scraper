            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. The Luftwaffe was definitely one ofnrhe most pro Nazi military organixations there was. Perhaps only superseded by the Waffen SS. Remember Goering ran the Luftwaffe and he was Hitlers #2 the entire war until literally the last couple of weeks. The Kriegsmarine actually was much more anti Nazi and had more of a history thereof; but to be clear its TOTALLY disingenous to say ANY of them were ANTI Nazi really at all. How anti nazi were any of them when France fell? Sure criticisms abound when Germany was a smoldering ruin. Not high on the hog though. And even the most non political German military units still served the same cause as the fanatics. That bottom line cannot and should not be forgotten. Nor should the myth of the Wehrmacht being non complicit in the holocaust and war crimes be perpetuated. Between the infamous generals tapes (where an english manor of captured German officers was bugged); having to order men in AG Center and South to STOP going off and participating in \u201cactions\u201d against the jews because it was slowing the advance; the treatment of Soviet pows; it goes on and on. The entire regime, military, and country was rotten to its core. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it was entirely a construct of the Nazi regime. There was never any serious resistance to the Nazi regime from the Luftwaffe. Werner Molders is said to have protested anti-Catholic discrimination, being himself a staunch Catholic, but the bravery of a few individual officers does not make an entire armed service anti-Nazi. The Luftwaffe was also part of the Wermacht and from 21st May 1935 an active member of the Wehrmacht was not officially allowed to be a member of the NSDAP. This restriction only ended on 24th September 1944. However, like any service, the Luftwaffe reflected the wider society and there would have been plenty of members who sympathised with and supported the NSDAP. There would have been others who joined the Party to further their careers and who would not necessarily share the National Socialist regime\u2019s ideals. There were many reasons during the Nazi era for joining the Party. Some Luftwaffe officers were members (I have seen at least one photograph of a Luftwaffe pilot wearing an NSDAP pin) and the list might be a long one. ",
