            "answer_text": "You might not have noticed, but the way we consume shows and movies is changing. Today cable TV providers have to work extra hard to retain their customers. Because of alternatives like Satellite TV, people have started to leave their cable services behind. Add to that the option of Netflix and you can see a trend forming. There are more entertainment platforms today than there were a decade ago. The golden age of television is coming to an end. Or is it? The advantages of cable TV are unique to the service. None of the alternatives can compete. The two major advantages of cable TV over others are Service Quality and Price. Cable TV has the advantage of providing quality service to all customers equally. Because cable companies have built the infrastructure for it. Yes, satellite TV and internet TV also have high-quality services. But lack, in comparison to cable. The weather can affect satellite transmissions. And similarly, internet connection problems or data caps can render internet TVs useless. Because of the infrastructure created, cable TV can usually be bundled with internet and phone services. Together, the package prices are very reasonable. As opposed to satellite TV that is usually more expensive, if you add the cost of installation. Now to the second part of your question. There are two major disadvantages to cable TV. First, packages can get confusing, second is the service restraints. Because of package bundles that make the service cheap, we may get confused. Triple Play packages that bundle all three services (internet, cable, and voice) can be confusing. Cable TV advertisements usually say things like you can get so and so channel add-ons for a small premium. But those add-on prices can rack up. And sometimes you have to buy entire channel packages for just a few channels that you like. The second disadvantage is the service restrictions of cable TV. Yes, it is available in the majority of the country. But what about the underdeveloped areas. Did you know that there are still areas in the US which can\u2019t receive all the services of cable TV? The infrastructure to get those services in those areas doesn\u2019t exist yet. To know more about the service areas it would save time to directly contact Cox customer service on 1-478-784-8000. They will be able to tell you which services they offer in your area. ",

            "answer_text": "Cable TV has been facing increasing competition from other communications types like satellite television and even such computer sites as Netflix. With all of these options now available, it is a good opportunity to look at the pros and cons of cable television. Cable television is especially stable in its service. Both traditional air-wave broadcasts and modern satellite television can and will cut out on you during any serious storm (and often during some not-so-serious storms). Cable, on the other hand, will only go out if there is some flaw in the overall system, like a broken cable or router. This will happen far less often than rainstorms, so cable television will provide far more consistent service. Often specials are available by bundling your cable television with other services in a single package, usually internet and phone, but sometimes services like cellular phones. These bundles can actually save you quite a bit of money, especially if you bundle all three typical services together. It also provides the convenience of having a single bill. Cable TV can actually be fairly inexpensive, if you don\u2019t add too many options. The initial hardware costs are fairly inexpensive when compared to satellite, and the FCC requires that all cable companies provide the basic Spectrum TV packages consisting of broadcast channels. And a few local channels. As a result, cable television can be the cheapest form of television aside from buying an antenna. ",
