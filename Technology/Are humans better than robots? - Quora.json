            "answer_text": "robots so far because humans arent very efficient, have many weakness and emotion, and frequently procrastinate at task. humans are also prone to playing psychological mind games and compete wih each other in office politics, which robots will not do when given a mission or goal. the only thing quality humans are better than robots are able to empathsize with other\u2019s suffering and helping each other out in altruism.
