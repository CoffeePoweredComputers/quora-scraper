            "answer_text": "Globalization has been changing the world in every aspects, so much that it\u2019s come knocking on our doors whether we want or not. The impacts are vividly visible in households from rich neighborhood to poor neighborhood, in developed countries, developing countries as well as in poor countries. One can easily find something with reference to foreign influences anywhere without trying too hard. The stuffs we use, clothes we wear, the food we eat, stories we talk about or even our personality and capability are more or less have the mark of globalism. I\u2019m actually a big fan btw. I\u2019m not saying there isnt any drawback but the world wouldnt have been so prosperous and peaceful without globalization. Yes climate change, global economic uncertainty and the widespread of extreme ideologies\u2026 are the real threats and yes they\u2019re the dark side of globalization but if one thinks isolation, nationalism and protectionism is the answer to world\u2019s problems, one\u2019s sadly mistaken! Slightly off topic. Back to your question, generally speaking, globalization is good for business, which means good for consumers as well as employees hence good outcomes overall for society. So on top of my head\u2026 Upside: Globalization\u2019s commonly translated into freer movement of goods, services, technologies, capital, enterprises as well as people between countries on a global scale. All of which can be greatly enjoyed by companies should they be sufficiently prepared and open-minded to embrace them. Companies have access to a bigger pool of talents coming from all over the places, or in many cases, just lots of people willing to do the works for a lot cheaper. Together with the people looking for jobs are those looking for opportunities to invest their capital. Imagine all that free money in the world can now be moved around, invested in businesses, supporting the global economy. FDI has been a rather crucial factor for the development of almost every countries on earth. This\u2019s a win-win process for both receiving companies and investing companies. Besides capital and human resources, businesses now also have access to a much larger market, be it the regional or global market. More and more companies are reaching out, expanding or outsourcing their operation overseas, creating more opportunities for other businesses. Downside: Having said all that, such development doesnt come without a cost. One big consequence of globalization (affecting enterprises, individuals as well as governments) is that the level of competition is getting higher than ever. The market\u2019s always been like a battlefield now filled with players armed with laser guns and atomic bombs. Small and medium enterprises find it increasingly hard to compete and inevitably many will have to shut down. While competition is not particularly a bad thing, it\u2019s crucial to have a fair competition which sadly is not always the case. Deep pocketed, multinational corporations have clear advantages when compared to local businesses of any countries, if they\u2019re willing to engage in anti-competition activities, they can easily eliminate their small competitors. That would destroy development and employment opportunities of local communities, discouraging new companies to enter the market\u2026 Another problem is that as companies do business in multiple jurisdictions, it\u2019s harder for them to keep up with all the rules and regulations, in other words, companies have become much more vulnerable to foreign elements. Meaning, more and more things to watch out for, to comply with, and it\u2019s obviously not cheap to do that. The market and consumers have become more volatile and sensitive to global events, which are highly unpredictable and out of control of most of businesses. One terrorist attack or the slow down of one economy may very well trigger a panic across the globe politically, socially and economically. So all of this are obviously huge challenges for companies. But with great challenges come great opportunities as they usually go hand in hand. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to Link this question with some historical and Economic forces. The extreme nationalism which was prevailing in the developed countries before the Second World War was replaced after the War by internationalism(globalization). Multi national corporations cut through national borders after the War in search of markets, raw materials and cheap labour, to increase profits. This process included hiring workers from other countries, particularly from underdeveloped countries, who were available at lower wages/salaries. It also included export of capital and outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries. Cost of labour is a big chunk of the total cost of production, and by getting foreign labour at lower wages/salaries the corporations could cut down their cost of production drastically, thus enhancing profits. In Europe and America there are millions of foreign workers working at lower pay than local European or American employees. Also, many of the jobs in America and Europe have been outsourced to underdeveloped countries where employees are obtained at much lower pay. This process has no doubt increased the profits of these multi national corporations, but has also led to great unemployment among the local people in Europe and America, resulting in massive discontent there. Europeans and Americans feel that the jobs in their own countries which should have gone to them have been taken away by foreigners. This is further exacerbated by the world wide economic recession which has been going on for quite some time. Unemployed people, especially the youth, are feeling that the jobs which should have gone to them have gone to foreigners. Britain's decision to exit the EU,rise of Trump should be understood in this light. It is not just exiting the EU. It is drastically reversing the process of internationalism, and is the first step towards going back to virulent nationalism and Protectionist policies. There are 1.4 million people of Indian origin living in England, and many from other parts of Asia and Africa. Soon attacks on them by right wing goons will start, and the same is likely to happen in Germany, France ( which has a large Muslim population, mainly from North African countries which were earlier French colonies ), etc. Businesses of Indians in England ( Mittals, Tatas, Hindujas, etc ), and their Indian employees, may also be attacked, and so also of other Asians and Africans. They will all be told to get out and go home. The step taken by England will sooner or later be followed by Germany, France, Italy, etc So we are going back to the era of virulent nationalism, which was resolved in Europe by wars ( the First World War, Second World War, etc ). But after the development of nuclear and other such destructive weapons, such wars are unlikely to be repeated. So how then will the crisis be resolved ? Moreover, Europe and America are heavily dependant on foreign labour, both inside these countries and abroad. If these are driven off or laid off, much more expensive European and American labour will have to be employed. This will drastically reduce the profits the multi national corporations are earning, leading to further recession, and so more lay offs and discontent. Impact Of Globalization on Business-  There is a lot of talk in some Western countries of getting back the outsourced jobs to local people. Outsourcing these jobs to underdeveloped countries no doubt increased unemployment in the developed countries. But the multinational corporations outsourced these jobs because they could get their work done at a much cheaper price, because labour is much cheaper in the underdeveloped countries. Getting the jobs back to America or Europe means that much higher salaries will have to be paid, as American and European labour is expensive, and consequently the profits of the multinational corporations will decline. Will the multinational corporations, who are the real rulers of Western countries, accept this ? It is all very well to speak of getting back outsourced jobs in an election campaign, but implementing it is an altogether different proposition. That will be fiercely resisted by the multi national corporations. References- Globalisation, Democracy and TerrorismTales of Marx and Marxism eBook: Eric Hobsbawm: Amazon.in: Kindle StoreMR.
