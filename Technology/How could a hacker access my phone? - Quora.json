            "answer_text": "This depends on the phone that you have. I will let you know of how they can access it while having your phone in their hands, as well as how to access it without needing it in their hands. Hands only - Here\u2019s a simple trick for iPhones (works only on certain update modules) : Activate SiriSay \u201cRemind me\u201dWhen Siri asks you what you want to be reminded say \u201cRemind me to walk\u201d (just need remind me to and then any word or phrase)There should be a reminder set, with you in the reminder appNow press the main menu button and you should be in the home screen, with an unlocked iPhoneAndroids are rather different. For Androids you\u2019d need to have access to one of two things. Either the phone it self and manually reset it to factory settings/reset, or have access to the person\u2019s google account. Google account (works only on certain update modules) : Enter the wrong lock-screen pattern 5 times (easy if you don\u2019t know the pattern)You will find a forgot pattern button on the lower right of your screen. Select \u201cForgot pattern\u201dYou will now be able to enter in your backup pin or log in with your google account to unlock your phone.Select \u201cGoogle Account\u201d and input the details, click log in when completed. The phone should now be unlocked.Manual Reset (Factory Settings/Reset) : Turn off your device.Press the volume down AND power button and keep pressing them. Your device will start up and boot into the boot-loader (you should see \u201cStart\u201d and an Android lying on its back).Press the volume down button to go through the different options until you see \u201cRecovery Mode\u201d (pressing volume down twice). Now press the power button to enter recovery mode.You should see an Android on its back and a red exclamation mark.Press and hold the power button, then press and release the volume up button. Now you should see \u201cAndroid Recovery\u201d written on the top together with some options.By pressing the volume down button, go down the options until \u201cWipe data/factory reset\u201d is selected. Press the power button to select this option.Using the volume down button again, go down until \u201cYes \u2013 erase all user data\u201d is selected. Make sure you read through the notes above and then, finally, press the power button to start the reset process.Once the process is done, press the power button to select the reboot option. Your device will now reboot and start the initial setup process of your device. That\u2019s it! All you need to do now is to set up everything and restore your data.WARNING: Using this method can prove to be a terrible mistake. Nexus mobiles when factory reset need to have the google account associated with the mobile phone to be inputted, as a safety measure. Certain Android phones other than Nexus may need this to be done also. Only \u201cFactory Reset\u201d a phone at your own risk. For Windows Phones there is not much you can do, even if you have the phone in hand. Funnily enough you cannot bypass the password straight up without a hacking system, and to factory settings/reset the phone you need to unlock it in the first place. However if you can get a hold of the person\u2019s Microsoft account details you can do this : Log into http://www.windowsphone.com and use the Find My Phone feature to set a new lock code Go to http://www.windowsphone.com and sign to the Microsoft account associated with your phone.Select \"Find My Phone\" from the drop down menu that appears when you click on your name. Or just go to https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/my/findClick the \"Lock\" linkEnter a new 4 digit PIN code and press the Lock button.Other ways to gain access to phones - There are a number of ways to gain access into phones other than the ones mentioned above. A hacker can do either one of these to gain access to your phone : Set up a fake application that installs a virus or Trojan Horse onto your phone, allowing them to see what you are doing and (or) take control of your phone. Most of the time with this method a key-logger is installed onto your device.Plug in your phone into a data transfer terminal. A lot of people forget but USB charging ports can be really unsafe. A USB has connections that allow power transfer and data transfer. What certain hackers will do is mask a data transfer terminal (something that will transfer all of your data to a storage device by copying all your files) by making it look like a charging terminal.There are many more ways but these are the two main ways I know hackers tend to use to gain access to mobile phones. These of course are the easy ones that I believe anyone can do. [Disclaimer: I do not condone hacking and data theft. This is for educational purposes only.] ",
