            "answer_text": "You might have heard that there is a link between phone radiation and the level of your phone\u2019s battery. As our phones run out of battery, they tend to change their functions to stay alive for longer. In that sense, it\u2019d really make no sense if your phone produced even more radiation. However, because efforts may be redirected to your phone\u2019s antennae in order to maintain a strong signal, there is some logic to this. So, does the phone\u2019s charge affect the radiation? We\u2019re going to find out is phone radiation higher when the battery is low. What Can Affect Phone Radiation? There are lots of factors that affect the level of phone radiation. But is the battery one of them? Phone radiation is the electromagnetic field that the phone uses to communicate with your mobile phone network. It also produces a small amount of EMF itself, as all electrical devices do. But the difference between a phone and other electrical appliances is that the phone uses much larger amounts of radiation to stay in touch with the network \u2013 constantly. The more your phone is trying to connect to the network, the more radiation it pumps out. Sometimes, you may even feel your phone heat up in your hand if you\u2019re trying to make a call in an area with poor signal. This is evidence of your phone routing all available power to the antennae. It is really going all out to try and locate the network and connect you. Even when you aren\u2019t actively using your phone it is always checking in with the network ready to receive calls or messages, using data in the background and more. Airplane mode can help with this but it\u2019s no good if you still want to receive calls and messages. So because radiation is essentially how the phone connects to the network, it is a big factor in the amount of radiation your phone gives off. When network coverage is low and there is a poor signal the phone works much harder to connect, putting out much higher amounts of radiation. Low signal has one of the biggest effects on phone radiation. Each make and model of phone is designed and manufactured differently so each will have a different amount of radiation it emits. Manufacturers have limits they must adhere to, called the Specific Absorption Rating, or SAR, which is what cell phone radiation is measured in. These are set by governments and the phones must be tested against them. There is an upper limit but different phones will have different amounts of SAR, with some being lower than others. You can check your phone\u2019s SAR in the manufacturer handbook that came with your phone, and sometimes on their website. Is Phone Radiation Higher when the Battery is Low? Radiation is higher when there is low signal, but what about low battery? There\u2019s little evidence that phone radiation is higher when the battery is low \u2013 but then there is little evidence about mobile phone radiation in general. It wouldn\u2019t really make sense for phone radiation to increase with low battery. When the battery depletes, your phone will simply do what it needs to do to stay powered on for that little bit longer. Most phones enter \u2018low battery\u2019 or \u2018power saver\u2019 modes to try and compensate. If anything, radiation could be reduced when phone batteries deplete as your phone\u2019s screen dims, etc, but this would be negligible. The thing is, when a phone tries to get a signal, it will do so with the greatest efficiency possible. So, if a signal is readily available, e.g. you\u2019re in a major city, then your phone\u2019s antennae won\u2019t need to work so hard. Then, if you enter a subway or ride the tube, your phone will sense its signal deplete and try and ramp up its efforts to recapture it. This will vastly increase phone radiation. This process would be the same regardless of whether your phone is fully charged or very low on charge. It is always working for a signal, no matter where you are, provided airplane mode isn\u2019t turned on. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's think like Engineer here. What is radiation first?for what the radiation comes in phone? Radiation or radio waves are in phone because we all have a sim card in it which will obviously require radio waves or radiation to contact to your loved ones or any. So when do radiation comes? While your phone needs signal. so radiation or radio waves will be high when the phone is searching for network due to week signal strength. What's up with battery? What happens while it charge? As we all learned in our 9th grade or higher. Batteries will have some sort of chemical reaction and that will deliver a heat or other energy during that reaction. So battery will get heated definitely while your phone is on charge. So when this low signal and battery charging reaction occurs\u2026 what happens when two bad things meet ? It would probably a mess. To answer your question.. I don't think mobile phones will radiate more while your phones on charge. I hope you get the point / might answer your question.
