            "answer_text": "Data driven web application are the applications where application flow is governed by data it processes. Input data set can change the behaviour of your application. Programming logic will remain same but it will be coded in such a way that input changes the way application behaves. These applications requires lots of testing as it produces error when data issues are encountered. You need to make sure that data driven applications are tested under variety of data samples. ",

What buttons they push, and the time spent, and what they are trying to accomplish. Now imagine a console that, based on this information collected, shuffles its layout to better assist in workflow for users. Customized user consoles. That would be a data driven application. ",
