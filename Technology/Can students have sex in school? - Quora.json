            "answer_text": "I mean, the rules of pretty much every school in the country probably prohibits students from engaging in any sexual behavior while on school premises. That being said, I have had so many hookups in in school buildings and I have seen other students doing things as well. I only ever got busted once but it was by a janitor that was cool as fuck with all the students. I was getting fucked by an older eighth grade boy in the boys locker room when the janitor walked in with his clipboard to make sure the other custodians had cleaned the bathroom properly, and he spotted us immediately. We started to panic but he just laughed like it was the funniest thing he had ever seen and apologised for interrupting us. The older guy with me was too rattled to keep going so we ended up masturbating together and blasting the floor and a couple lockers with our semen. ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect that most schools (Primary and secondary) have rules against that sort of behavior. What students do on their free time and off campus (non-boarding schools) should be their own business, but that is changing. My nephew had a classmate who was thrown out of school for going to a wild party over Spring Break and posting pictures from it on Facebook). Some colleges have the remnants of \u2018anti-sex\u2019 rules still on books (visiting hours, etc.). In a boarding high school (for example), you will probably not be allowed to have girls in your room (or you can under certain conditions: door open, fully dressed, three feet on the floor, etc.). doing it in the classrooms would certainly be right out \u2014 and perhaps illegal. At school age? Well, whether they should or not is one thing. They are doing it. ",

There are thousands of lectures about sexual relationships and what not but students still do it because they think it\u2019s cool. NEWSFLASH, it\u2019s not. Deal with it, your not cool for having sex at school people. ",
