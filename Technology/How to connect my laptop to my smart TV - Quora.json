            "answer_text": "YYes you can connect your laptop through HDMI port. Also, you can use VGA port on the laptop but in that case you need to connect another wire for sound which runs from laptop to TV/amplifier. It also pertinent to mention here that the display you will get on the TV depends upon display adapter (resolution). Once you connect your laptop then you can use display option viz extended display, duplicate screen, second screen only and so on. ",
