            "answer_text": "We live in a rapidly changing world. This offers unprecedented opportunities, but it also presents us with complex problems, such as the need for energy-efficient transport and new sources of clean energy. In the Advanced Technology programme, you will learn to combine various disciplines to create multidisciplinary solutions to these problems. If you want to know more about advanced technology, visit this article . Its broad approach brings together a range of engineering and natural science disciplines, giving you the scope to come up with innovative and unexpected solutions to new problems without being confined to a single area of science. You will learn how to combine knowledge from electrical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, mathematics, and mechanical engineering in a context that is both commercial and society-conscious.  A technology that is still immature but promises to deliver significant value, or that has some technical maturity but still has relatively few users. Among current examples: artificial intelligence, agents, speech and handwriting recognition, virtual reality and 3D visualization, smart cards, real-time collaboration, enhanced user authentication, data mining, and knowledge management. The increasing demand for high quality scientific information to meet our mandate to provide conservation and management measures for the sustainability of our nation\u2019s living marine resources requires improvements in the efficiencies of survey data collection and processing operations using innovative technologies. The mission of this program is to improve survey capabilities with wise investments in the evaluation, development and implementation of advanced technologies in support of stock and habitat assessment requirements. National work groups comprised of experts in technologies and survey operations, such as the Advanced Sampling Technology Work Group (ASTWG), provide the necessary technical guidance and oversight of an annual RFP process to ensure the wise investments in technologies are aligned with regional and national priorities based on assessment priorities and need to resolve uncertainties associated with survey data gaps.

So 20,000 years ago pressure flaking stone arrow heads was \u201cadvanced technology\u201d if previously people in your group where using a striking tool to make the stone sharp. There was a time when agriculture was an \u201cadvanced technology\u201d. Today we think of any new kind of electronics as \u201cadvanced\u201d. but it never lasts long and is no longer advanced when the next thing comes along. ",
