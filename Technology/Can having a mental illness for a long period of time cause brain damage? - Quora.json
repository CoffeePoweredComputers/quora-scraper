            "answer_text": "This is a complex question to answer, as there are multiple levels with which mental illness can lead to \u201cbrain damage\u201d, as well as difficulty in defining \u201cbrain damage\u201d. For example, it is difficult to prove that a structural change is necessarily maladaptive, or that structural change is a result of a mental disorder, and not caused by some shared etiological factor(e.g. genes, abuse, birth complications). Furthermore, whether or not the underlying thought process results in \u201cbrain damage\u201d or whether these changes are a result of lifestyle changes associated with the mental illness is almost impossible to determine. Mental illness are usually associated with things such as insomnia, little exercise, drug use, alcohol use, and in severe cases, even poor hygiene and self care. All that said, a theory related to the Kindling model of epilepsy suggest that mental illness begets mental illness.[1] [2] [3] [4] While not necessarily \u201cbrain damage\u201d, the demonstrably better outcomes schizophrenics,[5][6] and bipolar patients[7] treated earlier rather than later suggests that long term uncontrolled mental illness can be self-amplifying. While a number of proposed mechanisms exist, including HPA axis driven alterations in neurogenesis in MDD,[8] [9] and oxidative damage schizophrenia.[10] Footnotes[1] Sensitization and kindling perspectives for the course of affective illness: toward a new treatment with the anticonvulsant carbamazepine.[2] Sensitization Phenomena in Psychiatric Illness[3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3072804/[4] Kindling and sensitization as models for affective episode recurrence, cyclicity, and tolerance phenomena.[5] Does duration of untreated psychosis predict very long term outcome of schizophrenic disorders? results of a retrospective study[6] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4308051/[7] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836252/[8] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733566/[9] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC60045/[10] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4197784/",

            "answer_text": "In many studies related to your question YES mental illness can cause brain damage. In a study looking at individuals who suffer depression and anxiety experience brain damage. The medicine used could also exacerbate the damage. According to Science Daily, increased stress can and most likely will cause damage to the brain. Here is a quick excerpt from the article. \"Pathological anxiety and chronic stress are associated with structural degeneration and impaired functioning of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may account for the increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and dementia,\" said Dr. Linda Mah, clinician scientist with Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute and lead author of the review. So yes, stress can damage the brain and most mental illnesses cause stress. All people who suffer mental illness experience a great deal of stress dealing with there sickness Hopefully this sums it up for you :) ",

            "answer_text": "Brain damage is typically structural damage. This can happen due to injury, stroke, and birth defects. While mental health does involve brain chemistry it's unlikely to jump from that to structural damage. Now the opposite can happen. Structural issues can cause mental impairment. ",
