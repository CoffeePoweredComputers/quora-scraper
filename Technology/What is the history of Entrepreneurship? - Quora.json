            "answer_text": "Entrepreneurship arguably predates written history, however, we can give a practical overview of the history of entrepreneurship starting with entrepreneurs such as Marco Polo and others from the 12th and 14th century. Entrepreneurs like Marco Polo were what we refer to as Merchant-travelers and were what we can consider some of the first entrepreneurs. Capitalists transform this model by assuming more passive risks than the entrepreneurial merchant traveler. In The Middle Ages, we saw entrepreneurs who were often priests or religious figures such as Giovanni de\u2019 Medici who was the banker to the Vatican, among other things. Additionally, many Vikings during this time also pursued initiatives that expanded and opened markets and trade enable economic growth and innovation. Industrialization in the 18th century shaped the landscape of entrepreneurship forever allowing for business models that enabled entrepreneurs to get funding from those who had it when they didn't. Thomas Edison, Eli Whitney, and other entrepreneurs fueled innovation and took advantage of the new markets technology and industrialization was offering. The 19th and 20th century continued to see entrepreneurial growth due to the continued industrial revolution. During the 20th century, the term entrepreneur began to affiliate with the term innovator. Competitiveness fueled the efforts of such entrepreneurs as Andrew Carnegie. Fast forward to the 21st century and we are freeing up the markets unlike ever before. The advent of the internet has increased the potential growth for business ventures in an unprecedented way. Entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have shown us just how far we have come since the alleged advent of the entrepreneur. ",

            "answer_text": "The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883 -1950) stated that the role of the entrepreneur in any economy is \u201ccreative destruction\u201d \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches. For Schumpeter, the changes and \u201cdynamic disequilibrium brought on by the innovating entrepreneur are the \u2018norm\u2019 in a healthy economy.\u201d The word entrepreneur is a loan word from the French. Credit for coining this term generally goes to the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say. However, the Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon defined the term first his essay on the Nature of Trade in General, a book William Stanley Jevons considered the \u201ccradle of political economy\u201d. Cantillon saw the entrepreneur as a risk-taker while Say considered the entrepreneur a \u201cplanner\u201d. Cantillon defined the term as a person who pays a certain price for a product and resells it at an uncertain price: \u201cmaking decisions about obtaining and using resources while consequently admitting the risk of the enterprise.\u201d First used in 1723, today the term entrepreneur implies qualities of leadership, initiative, and innovation in new venture design. Economist Robert Reich has called team-building, leadership, and management ability essential qualities for entrepreneurship. The term \u201centrepreneurship\u201d was coined around the 1920\u2019s. C. Sunny Martin has published 65-books. The above excerpt is from his latest book \u201cThe Ultimate Urban Entrepreneur Handbook\u201d that is only available for purchase at C.

            "answer_text": " To know from where the mindset of entrepreneurship arose or is derived; the source and follow a stream to its origin\u2026or the first stage of its existence; in the beginning. Entrepreneurship probably began with a barter transaction, many thousands of years ago as a means for people to negotiate and prosper. Those who developed it as a skill realized its advantages to help them rise above their current status of survival. This was combined with a person\u2019s imagination, energy, and shrewdness gained from the intuitive study of their neighbor. The talent for entrepreneurship has inspired transformation, invention, and significant changes that go beyond the boundaries of any industry. It springs from motivations that can be radical, thirsty, have life-altering purposes, and solve many historical infallibilities. In my opinion, entrepreneurship knows no bounds\u2026 That\u2019s my take on it anyway! ;-) ",

Startup founder, business owner, inventor, executive\u2026 those are titles and roles someone can become. And they\u2019re distinctly different things someone can become.[1] There is a history and origination in humanity to things like business ownership, what distinguishes startups from new businesses, executives and management, and the like. Entrepreneur means you constantly see gaps in the market and move your own resources to create new opportunities. It\u2019s a tendency you have, or don\u2019t. The earliest homo sapiens were frustrated by something in the work they were doing, and some just decided to do something about it. The word was coined by Jean Baptiste-Say to distinguish the type of people different from business owners and capitalists. People who just can\u2019t help but always take on the risks of addressing inefficiencies in the market. It was an observation of his, noting that Adam Smith\u2019s pivotal work on Economics, The Wealth of Nations, neglected such people. Calling back to my reference to humor, we can ask about the history of Comedy or the stories of early comedians, but we can\u2019t really not that funny (or entrepreneurial) comes from somewhere.

The ant or the entrepreneur explores, in the case of the business man to find an opportunity and the ant to find food. This is a trial and error, iterative process which should take a measured approach to ensure survival. Once the opportunity is found and validated,, there is a transition to the exploitation phase. The exploitation phase represents the scaling of the business or the invitation of all the ants to come eat at that day\u2019s food source. What this model helps to make clear is that exploration in determining the opportunity also sets the theoretical limit for the company revenues. Small local businesses probably just saw small opportunities. Google-like opportunities are what the entrepreneur sees. ",

The first known instance of humans trading comes from New Guinea around 17,000 BCE, where locals exchanged obsidian, a black volcanic glass used to make hunting arrowheads for other needed goods. These early entrepreneurs exchanged one set of goods for another. Around 15,000 BCE, the first animal domestication began taking place, and around 10,000 BCE, the first domestication of plants. This step toward agriculture was critical for the advancement of the human species. Now, instead of having to continually move around as nomadic tribes, seeking new places to hunt and to gather, we could stay in one place. Agriculture allowed us to start to form larger stationary communities and cities (the basis for civilizations), which set the stage for the development and spread of human knowledge. Agriculture changed everything for humans, enabling the formation of stable rather than migratory populations and laying the foundation for human populations to grow from 15 million to over 7 billion in the millennia ahead.
