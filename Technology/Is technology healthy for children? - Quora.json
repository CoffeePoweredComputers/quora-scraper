            "answer_text": "none of it as long as its used in the right way. Tablets and smart phones are not going to go away, schools are now using electronic boards, tablets etc and as such children need to learn how to use them safely. Whereas we had to use books for research, they now use the internet and its much quicker and more upto date. The dangers are obviously predators and such. but then dont let young children use the internet in their bedrooms and if you do then set parental controls, out granddaughter who is 7 has a kindle fire and for 1.99 a month we pay for kindle kids, so she can read books, go on youtube and play games but she can only use the ages we lock in, at the moment we use 6\u201310 as she is fairly advanced, we can aslo set a time when it turns off and she cannot turn it back on. Technology is here to stay, these conversations probably happened when the ball point pen was invented and people complained about the dangers of not using a quill. Its the parents and Grandparents that need to make sure they are safe, you leave your child in their room with the internet and no parental filters on then your just asking for trouble. ",

            "answer_text": "for young children, websites and apps that have a place to converse through text should me monitored, this is not because children are irresponsible but rather child predators are common especially in children\u2019s games. this is not to say all games or apps are bad but it\u2019s something to be aware of when a kid is traversing the deep dark web. youtube or any sort of content thats creator made should also be watched due to there being tons of weird videos. such as disturbing \u201cchildren\u2019s\u201d videos of feet or surgery\u2019s or if that\u2019s not your cup of tea maybe reactionary nazi indoctrination is what you wanna watch. regardless, just watch what your child does with technology, most of its very good and can give your children something you can\u2019t give such as an outside opinion or a creative outlet for them to explore, but there\u2019s always someone who will ruin it lol ",
