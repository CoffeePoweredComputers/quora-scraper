            "answer_text": "Yes. In 2005, I spoke with Mark Cuban who owns the Landmark theater chain, the HD TV channel AXS TV and Magnolia Pictures. They had just released the Steven Soderbergh film BUBBLE. They released the movie simultaneously on HD, in theaters and on DVD using one marketing campaign. This kept their costs down and their return high - especially for a low budget experimental picture. He indicated at that time that he was pleased with the results of their efforts and were already in profit. Since that time, Netflix has introduced binge releasing - another means to give audiences what they want, when and how they want it. The idea of \u201cwindows\u201d of release is slowly collapsing further. Amazon has now released several movies simultaneously in theaters and online - though I am given to understand that they have backed off a bit as has Netflix. But consumer demand drives distribution, and consumers like having choice in where and when they watch media. It\u2019s the next step in an evolutionary process. ",
