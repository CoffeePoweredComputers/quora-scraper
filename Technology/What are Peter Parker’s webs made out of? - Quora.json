            "answer_text": "Actual spider silk comes in several types, usually a type of substance called \u201cblock co-polymer\u201d in which some simple chemical formulas are repeated to form a long thread. Spider-Man originally invented a \u201cweb fluid\u201d and spray devices on his wrists to release it as threads with various useful characteristics. But for a while, he was mutated and grew web glands inside his wrists. Not coincidentally, one film version of Spider-Man has that. Oh, and his black costume is actually an alien called a Klyntar which also produced the thread from its body. ",
