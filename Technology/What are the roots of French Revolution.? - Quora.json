            "answer_text": "The French Revolution has many origins and they are very complex so I will only present the major causes of it. Mainly, the French Revolution is caused by different factors in different aspects of life: socially, economically and politically. Each of these aspects affected the lowest order, the \u2018\u2019Tiers \u00c9tat\u2019\u2019 or Third order in english. This order was composed mostly of farmers (85%), craftsmen (7%) and the bourgeoisie (5%). Politically, the nobles have many privileges and they are rivals to the king. The noble order, the second one, is slowly declining and losing power against the bourgeois who are getting very rich through trade and commerce. The nobles, trying to maintain their positions, oppose the king and succeed to turn down the possibilities of the bourgeois. Even if the society was split between 3 orders, you could move from one to another, mostly going up. This was the case of the bourgeois who could pay a small fortune to acquire a noble rank. However, following the nobles reaction, these possibilities were stopped. Add the fact that the nobles had a lot of privileges like not paying any taxes or being the only ones to be able to be officers in the army and you get angry bourgeois. You need to know that the bourgeois are the most important actors during the Revolution because they belong to the Third order, but they are powerful because of the money made from their occupations. Bankers, rich merchants and other liberal professions belong to this order. Economically, the finances of the kingdom are not in a good shape: during all the XVIIIth century, France has a lot of debt. The situation get even worse with the American Revolution which cost a lot for the king. Additionally, the administration is poorly managed and nobles take advantage of it. They sell back to the administration their offcial charges after having worked for the king. With the \u2018\u2019Convocation des \u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\u2019\u2019, king Louis XVI create an assembly of all 3 orders to discuss a new tax to cover the debts and it turns out differently... Socially, other things affect the population such as the corporations. The corporations are an organization of a type of professions which decide the production and the distribution of the goods made by the said profession. They possess a juridical status and are thus protected by royal laws. The bourgeois and the craftsmen, being restricted by those institutions of the past, want to free themselves from them. Finally, famine is another element of the social unrest. Until the XIXth century with the Industruial Revolution , famines were still haunting modern States. Bad weather caused bad harvest prior to 1789 and it sparkled a rise of the price of bread. The Enlightment and the newly Liberalism of the XVIIIth century are also important for the cause of the Revolution. Even if a big proportion of the population doesn\u2019t know how to read, the liberal ideas still manage to spread among the people, from the intellectual bourgeois down to the rest of the population. Ideas of liberty, truth and knowledge are motivating some people, but the way I see it, the bourgeois really wanted to expand their power\u2026 Mix all those elements together and get a pretty important social unrest. Obviously, the bourgeois are leading the Revolution because they are the most hungry for power, but they are still supported by a majority of the popualtion. The \u2018\u2019Tiers \u00c9tat\u2019\u2019, at first, are mostly against the nobles and their privileges. It\u2019s only later that they turn against the king and that the Revolution becomes more radical. ",
