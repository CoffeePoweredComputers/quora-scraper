            "answer_text": "Most definitely. However please note that the phones you get from the telcos like Du and Etisalat or from reputed stores like Jumbo, ECity etc do not have FaceTime on them. You get FaceTime activated on Inelternational models available also but at a slightly higher price. Sites like Souq (now Amazon) offer both models. Since I'm running a mobile business in India as well.. let me be clear, we usually done buy back phones or iWatches from Dubai since some of them are country locked as well and can give issues in the long run. But if you are going to use the phone in Dubai, don't even think twice about buying it from Dubai! Miss the electronics shopping there\u2026 ;( ",
