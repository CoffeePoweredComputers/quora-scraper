They set up at least one 5G cell site in large metropolitan areas to be legally able to advertise they have nationwide coverage and in some cases claim they can cover a large percentage of the population. To experience 5G you need a 5G capable device, be in range of the cell site and have a subscription with the service provider transmitting 5G. ",

            "answer_text": "This varies very much by provider. Some cities that \u201chave\u201d 5G only have it in a form that works outdoors in a small neighborhood. Only expect your phone to work if you get a model of a phone specifically approved by a provider, for a band available in the cities you care about, and a matching service plan.
