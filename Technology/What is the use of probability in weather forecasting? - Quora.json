            "answer_text": "Probability is a statistically based expression that combines forecaster confidence and areal coverage. The formula is: Probability of Precipitation (POP)=Forecaster Confidence (FC) x Areal Coverage (AC). Since much of the public has a very difficult time grasping probabilities (see lottery ticket sales), it is, in my opinion, an unnecessary confusion added to an already complex message. There was actually quite a debate about whether to use probabilities in forecasts in the 1970s and those that argued for it won. Thus, we have the following possible scenarios for a 20% chance of rain: 20% POP=100%FC x 20%AC (high confidence of small coverage) 20%POP=20%FC x 100%AC (low confidence of widespread coverage) 20%POP=50%FC x 40%AC (moderate confidence of medium coverage) 20%POP=40%FC x 50%AC (Slightly less confidence of slightly more coverage) etc. A large portion of meteorologists don\u2019t even understand this, much less the general public. That is why I was always more for forecasting in \u201cplain english\u201d: Isolated Slight chance Chance Scattered Good Chance Likely Widespread etc. Then there is the \u201cpsychological\u201d and \u201crule\u201d portion of the forecast, which most forecasters probably actually use. If a forecaster feels that there is at least a small chance of rain, but they don\u2019t want the wording to show up in their forecast, they will forecast a 19% chance of rain, so it doesn\u2019t trigger any automatic wording or graphics. A 20% chance is often used as a \u201cCYA\u201d (Cover Your Butt) forecast. Low enough so that if it doesn\u2019t happen, nobody gets too mad, but if it DOES happen you can always say you had it in your forecast. I had a wise professor in school that cautioned, \u201cNever forecast a 0% or 100% chance of anything beyond a few hours.\u201d The atmosphere and our prediction of it is still filled with many unknowns.

            "answer_text": "  A probability forecast includes a numerical expression of uncertainty about the quantity or event being forecast. Ideally, all elements (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.) of a weather forecast would include information that accurately quantifies the inherent uncertainty. Using probabilities in weather forecasting. In these situations, uncertainty, or risk, becomes increasingly important in weather forecasting. To forecast the weather we first gather observations from around the world to measure what the atmosphere is doing ",
