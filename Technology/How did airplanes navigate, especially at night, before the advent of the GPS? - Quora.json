            "answer_text": "Not much is remembered about the A and N routes, which were predecessors to VOR routes. Even after VORs dominated the airways, A and N was required to be taught into the mid-1970s. The last route was decommissioned in about 1983. Like the VOR, the transmitting stations used highly directional antennas, which broadcast routes. Unlike VORs, the pilot could not select his inbound, or outbound radial. Typically, there were up to four routes available, but stations having only two or three were also common.  My crude diagram shows a typical A & N Airway. When inbound, the pilot would hear the mores code letter A (Alpha dit-dah) if left of course. If Right of course the mores code letter N (November (dah-dit) would be heard. Just as with the more modern VOR, the signal narrows as the airplane gets closer to the station. When the airplane\u2019s antenna is centered on course, the dit-dahs, and the dah-dits merge and form one single tone (back then it was a 1kc tone. Hertz was not used until 1969 - 1970). Station passage was signified by silence. The higher the airplane was, the longer would be the silence, as the null got wider with increased altitude. On the out bound leg, left of course and right of course switched. One disadvantage of this was that the pilot had to wear uncomfortable head phones, or have his radio turned up to hear the sound. During thunder storms and such, it would be difficult to hear the tones, and the signal was not always clear. Headphones used in modern aviation are super comfortable. But, those old ones were pure hell, and that is why most GA pilots did not wear them, and as a result lost some of their hearing. As VORs began coming on the scene, the pilot now had a visual aid that could be used for either VOR or A&N navigation. If you ever come across a very old VOR gauge, you may notice that one side has a blue arc and the other a yellow arc which represented right and left of course. Old IFR charts indicated A&N airways similarly to the depiction above. NDBs were available for use prior to WWII. These were not automatic, as the navigator would have to manually turn the antenna, usually by twisting a knob on the overhead of the cabin. The knob had an arrow attached which would point to a bearing on the outer ring of the dial. By tuning in two or more stations, the navigator could get a cross-fix of his position. After getting a cross-fix you could use your mag compass to determine if you were headed to the station or from the station. This method was also used on the ground to find spy radio transmitters. Two or more monitoring vans (trucks) would tune in a station, then orient their antennas to get a cross-fix in order to find the station. I forget the exact procedure, but by turning the airplane ninety-degrees to the station, and flying while the navigator turns his knob, then calculating the time, the navigator could determine the distance to the station. The advancement of the ADF made everything a lot easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Believe it or not, airliners do it the same way they used to do it before GPS. In addition to the systems that Tim Morgan mentions there is also the inertial reference system on bigger airplanes.  That system senses acceleration and uses it to derive velocity and in turn compute a position relative to an initial known position.  This used to be done with mechanical gyros requiring the aircraft to sit parked completely still at the gate while they spun up and initialized.  Now they are implemented with ring laser gyros.   IRS is extremely precise but has no accuracy in the sense that it does not have any absolute position awareness -- it only measures position relative to where it was.  So combining highly accurate GPS-derived positioning with highly precise IRS positioning gives modern jets an unbelievably accurate picture of their position. Having said all that, only VHF radios and certain installations of GPS are approved for primary means of navigation on bigger aircraft.  The GPS units installed in most airliners were not built to the same standard that so-called panel-mount IFR GPS receivers found in light airplanes were (TSO-C129A).   That is, the ones aboard airliners do not require augmentation from ground-based systems.  In the US, in order to use GPS as primary means, the system must use other systems (WAAS or GBAS), have certain buttons, and certain displays, all of which are incompatible with airline cockpits and implementations.  See GNSS Frequently Asked Questions - NAS Implementation for more information about GPS as primary means in the US. So technically speaking, airliners in the US cannot use GPS as a primary means of navigation -- they still have to use the VORs and NDBs.  Practically speaking, it doesn't matter, as the area navigation systems provided by the flight management system don't care where the positional information is sourced.  The fact remains that absent a special operational approval, the positional information must be sourced primarily from ground-based navigational aids, not GPS. ",
