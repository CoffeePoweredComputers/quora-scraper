            "answer_text": "As of now, I don\u2019t think there is anything which you could call as the most common 3D printing materials but yes, plastics are still the most common products used even today and right from the beginning. You can get PVC 3D printing materials which are not only cheap to get but also form the desired object in desired size without any issue. In fact, you can print the most complicated designs with plastics in utter ease and even the post processing of these objects is the easiest thing to do. Just rub the flaws off on a sandpaper and you are good to paint the 3D printed object or apply the desired decorative. Next, I think even metals are much in use as a 3D printing material, though metals involve a high amount of safety while 3D printing and they also need much more of a sophisticated 3D printer. Using metals, you can print jewelry in gold, silver or platinum etc. precious metals and the advantage of 3D printers here is the ease with which the designs get printed, even the most intricate ones. Plus, there is hardly any waste of precious metals.  Metal 3D printing has an application in the automobile and airplane industry as well. Nowadays, where big automobile parts manufacturing industries use 3D printers to print a lot of parts and the airplane parts manufacturing industries can use them to print a lot of lightweight airplane parts as well. No doubt, 3D printers have a wide application using metals and you can say that metals are one of the most common products used for 3D printing. But here\u2019s a thing that concerns people the most and it\u2019s the food. Various restaurants around the world now use food 3D printers which can print various kinds of consumable objects. However, these food 3D printers are still not as sophisticated to bring out a completely cooked product and it just uses the raw materials to prepare the designs, which are then post-processed before serving. However, it\u2019s not long that we may get such quality 3D printers which can cook completely cooked food products as well. ",

            "answer_text": "A large part of the 3D printers that are presently available in the global market are based on powders not filaments. Technologies such as laser sintering are used to create 3D prints in materials such as polyamide, alumide, rubber, and titanium. Digitally controlled layering of 3D printing powder is used to make a three-dimensional object from the powder fed to 3D printers. Some of the key materials used in making 3D printing powder include tool steel, stainless steel, copper alloys, aluminum alloys, diamond catalyst alloys, titanium alloys, super alloys of chromium and nickel. Get Full Brochure of 3D Printing Powder : http://bit.ly/2OEfmt9 Some pure metals such as platinum, gold, silver, and palladium are also used in making of 3D printing powder of different types. 3D printing powders have a characteristic packing density and specific morphology that ensure uniformity and good flow in 3D printing of different objects. Shape and particle size of 3D printing powders widely differs based on the end requirement and processing technology. Majority of the 3D printing materials available are spherical in shape with particle sizes vary between 50 \u03bcm and 150 \u03bcm.  With the massive expansion of the 3D printed products industry in the past few years, the market for 3D printed products has also swelled. Numerous industries such as medical, aerospace and defense, architecture, and automotive have significantly upped their intake of 3D-printed products and printing powders are being extensively used, courtesy the rising demand across these industries. Another key application of 3D printing powder is used in making orthopedic implants in the medical industry, which can be customized according to the requirements. Implants made by using 3D printing powder are also cost-effective when compared with other types of orthopedic implants available in the market. Automotive components manufactured by using 3D printing powders exhibits excellent mechanical strength and other amended functionalities as compared with components made from ordinary materials.  Some of the leading players operating in the global 3D printing powder are Advanced Powders and Coatings Inc., Arcam AB, Arkema, Carpenter Technology Corporation, ERASTEEL, GKN plc, Hoganas AB, Sandvik AB, Ltd., LPW Technology Ltd., and Metalysis.
