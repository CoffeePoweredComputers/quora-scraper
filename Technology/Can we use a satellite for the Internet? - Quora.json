            "answer_text": "It\u2019s going to work in some places, but not in city centres. As the other answer says, you need a view of an equatorial geosynchronous satellite, and the towers in the cities get in the way. Out in the country with no large hills/mountains, then yup, it will work. Won\u2019t be cheap, but if there\u2019s nothing else available it\u2019s worth considering. The near future satellite Internet from Elon Musk and so on, well, not yet. 60 satellites (57 active and usable) isn\u2019t nearly enough. There\u2019s a claim that by the end of this year you will be able to subscribe, but I haven\u2019t seen serious commitment about delay, cost, handover issues or much of anything else really. It will certainly work at some point, but maybe not in a city centre without considerable expense on someone\u2019s part - you still need visibility of a reasonable part of the sky to get a usable link.

            "answer_text": "Somewhat. You can receive the internet from satellites (the downlink) but sending data TO the internet requires a landline connection to a satellite uplink station. That REALLY slows your internet connection as you have to WAIT while your signal transits several servers to get to the uplink and then waits in a queu to be sent. Most of the internet today is sent over glass fiber lines around the world and doesn\u2019t use satellites at all. Here is a map of the undersea fiber optic lines around the world. this does not include that land based fiber optic lines  ",
