            "answer_text": "I asked myself this question a while ago, and I didn\u2019t get a new phone. Turns out, I made both the right decision and the wrong decision. Right decision: My current one is fine. It\u2019s low on space and doesn\u2019t have a great camera, but the battery still works and I can use google maps and respond to texts/emails/notifications and browse the web when I\u2019m bored. Wrong decision: Every time I need to take a photo of something, I wish I had upgraded. Every. Time. 5G has the potential to be a \u201cBig Deal\u201d, but not until late 2020 at the earliest, I\u2019m guessing 2021 is more likely, though. You need to get devices on the market that actually use it right, and you also need to deploy a network that can support it. Both of those things are going to take a while, especially outside of big cities. Some networks say \u201c5G\u201d today, but that\u2019s marketing speak, not real technology. So: if your phone is busted today, get a phone today. Definitely. Or if you curse your phone for some feature or another every day, then maybe it\u2019s time to upgrade. And maybe you can find something good in the $200\u2013$300 range to hold you over. Otherwise, chill, enjoy your phone, wait for 5G to be a real thing. 4G isn\u2019t that bad. ",

            "answer_text": "I dont think you will actually use 5G bands when even they arrive as 4G is still enough fast, if you have the right network. (Else broadbands are also faster). 5G is still not regular or well released in to the global community, so they will be costly. And not just that costly, uselessly costly. You can still buy a good 4G phone and be happy with it. Waiting for 5G is not a bad option, but not of any profit at all either. 5G wont matter unless it brings noticeable data speed differences. Current smartphones are still good enough to satisfy all of your needs. And with real good future proof hardware. ",
