            "answer_text": "No. The most disastrous year in recorded history was 536 CE. Why 536 was \u2018the worst year to be alive\u2019 Scientists Have Identified the Actual Worst Year in History. And No, It's Not 2018 It started with the eruption of a supervolcano in Iceland. This eruption darkened the skies all over the world, causing temperatures to plummet and crops to fail. Temperatures dropped to the lowest point in nearly 2,500 years\u2014so low that snow fell mid-summer in many places. Then, piling misery on top of misery, bubonic plague got going. And going, and going, and going\u2026the plague peaked in 542, six years after it started. Between mass starvation and plague, a significant fraction of the world\u2019s population died. This caused so much economic devastation it took nearly a century for life to start to return to normal. 2020 isn\u2019t even the worst year of the past century (1968 and 1942 were worse). It\u2019s no peaches and cream, to be sure, but worst year ever? Not even close. [Edited to add] Several folks have asked why 1968 was worse. 1968 saw two high-profile political assassinations, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Racial tensions were so high that many cities were actually, literally burning. Street lynchings were common. The nightly news showed hour after hour of involuntary conscripts in the US army coming home in body bags from a wildly unpopular war in a far-off jungle. Richard Nixon won a bitterly fought election largely because of the overtly racist Southern Strategy. His campaign team negotiated with the Viet Cong to slow down peace talks and keep the fighting going in order to give Nixon an advantage in the election, a fact that didn\u2019t come out until years later. Police were killing anti-war protesters with complete impunity. In South Carolina, police massacred protesters at an anti-segregation rally. Walter Cronkite, arguably the most respected man alive, reported that American soldiers had participated in a massacre of a civilian village in Vietnam that brought back memories of Nazi atrocities, and declared that all hope of winning in Vietnam was lost. Oh, and there was a deadly influenza epidemic, too. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at some other years. 1939\u20131945: World War 2. Almost 70 million people dead all over the world. Unthinkable atrocities like Holocaust and loss of life and property. One of the most devastating wars economically except for USA. Such a catastrophe that after it has ended, recovery from it took years.  1918\u20131920: Spanish Flu. Killed more than 20 million people. If we compare it to now, Coronavirus has so far didn\u2019t even killed half a million.  1914\u20131918: The war to end all wars. 17 million people dead. WW1 caused empires to fall which has caused revolutions and more civil wars. Like the October revolution in Russia which gave birth to Communism.  1618\u20131648: Religious wars fought all over Europe. % of the world population that died during this time was even higher than WW1 with all of the technological advances in military weapons. Unthinkable atrocities happened during this period as it was a never-ending war.  1346\u20131353: Black Plague. 1/3 of European population died during this time. Biggest known pandemic in human history.  I can continue but I don\u2019t want this to be too long. All I can say is compared to the past, we have much more prosperity and peace in our lives. Until the 1800s most of the world\u2019s population consisted of slaves and poverty-stricken people. We have better technology and a better understanding of the medicine to deal with epidemics and we are living in probably the most peaceful time on earth. We were just confined to our homes playing video games, watching Netflix etc. I\u2019m not saying Coronavirus is not a bad thing. People are losing their jobs and there are violent protests in America right now. However, when compared to what happened in the past, we are having it easy. ",
