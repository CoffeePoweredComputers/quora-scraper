            "answer_text": "Justin O\u2019Beirne, former Head of Cartography at Apple, wrote a fascinating, in-depth post on this very subject just last month. Titled Google Maps\u2019s Moat, he explains why no other product, including Apple Maps, even comes close, and why it may take years for the competition to catch up\u2026if at all. I\u2019ll encourage you to read the original (long but interesting) post, but here are the key points that stood out for me:  #1. Google\u2019s Maps are incredibly detailed. Just how detailed? Not only does Google Maps render the actual shapes of homes and buildings, it even captures garages, bay windows, outdoor steps, and satellite dishes on the roof. By contrast, Apple Maps only features buildings for a few major cities. Here, for example is Queens, New York, seen on Apple Maps:  And the same area, using Google Maps:  Even in cities where Apple Maps does feature buildings, the level of detail just doesn\u2019t compare to Google\u2019s product. Here\u2019s what the Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco looks like:  This is Apple Maps\u2019s rendition of the area:  And here\u2019s Google\u2019s:  Never mind landmarks, here\u2019s the rendition and the actual house in a small rural town in the U.S. The only image here is for Google Maps, since it\u2019s just an empty space on Apple Maps:   #2. Forget Street View. Google has been updating its maps using aerial and satellite imagery. Remember the famous Street View vehicles that drove around cities and towns to capture imagery for Google Maps? There were plenty of small towns that those vehicles never got around to, yet Google still has buildings featured in those maps. How\u2019s that possible? It appears Google has intensified its use of aerial and satellite image captures, and is using computer vision techniques to extract detailed 3D models of the buildings for its maps.  Now Apple also uses satellite imagery, but as O\u2019Beirne writes in his post, the company does not appear to be extracting buildings for its maps.  #3. The pace at which Google is updating its maps is breathtaking. Google first began adding 3D buildings to its maps in 2012. It started with just 1,000 major world landmarks. Five years later, it has detailed imagery for virtually the entire United States (and much of the world). That\u2019s hundreds of millions of buildings. Here\u2019s how Google rendered the Empire State Building 10 years ago, and what it looks like now after the satellite rendition:  What\u2019s more, it appears the 3D generation of buildings and addition to the maps has been automated to such a degree that Google Maps get updated faster than the competition even gets started with adding buildings in.  #4. Google is algorithmically generating colour-coded \u2018Areas of Interest\u2019\u2014the only map to offer this feature. Google has, for some time, used shading in its high-level maps to indicate densities of cities. At some point, it realized it had valuable data in its possession which allows it to also indicate densities of businesses. Now as you zoom in to a map, there is copper shading that indicates the high-density commercial corridors, which Google calls \u201cAreas of Interest (AOI)\u201d. Here\u2019s one of the maps before the AOI update:  And what it looks like now:  This has been rolled out internationally, so most major cities now have this feature.    #5. Google already has a head start on the next generation of maps. Thanks to both Street View and satellite imagery, Google has an incredible amount of data in its possession. It now appears to be crunching its building and business data sets together to add an increasing amount of detail to its maps. O\u2019Beirne speculates that Google is now on track to highlight or light up the actual building/home/business on its map as you search for an address. The detailed info it has may also allow you to not only find the location of every door to a building, but also learn, for example, which one is wheelchair-friendly. I would add that the day may not be too far where you can point your Google phone camera at a building to check what businesses are inside, much like what Google Lens offers with identifying landmarks today. All of this is what prompts O\u2019Beirne to declare that Google Maps has surrounded itself with a \u201cmoat\u201d\u2014generating data from data, and creating features that Apple Maps and the rest simply cannot make without a years-long lead time.

            "answer_text": "InterfaceGoogle  Apple  Before you\u2019ve even entered a location or begun navigating, you\u2019ll notice a few differences in the way maps are represented. On Apple Maps, the surfaces are flatter and show more default locations. The user interface is also clean and simple. You can search for a specific location using the search bar at the bottom of the screen and change the map settings (map, satellite, or transit) by tapping the information button in the upper right. Apple also has custom icons for landmarks such as the Empire State Building, and you can see the current weather at whatever location you\u2019re looking at in the lower right. As for Google Maps, there are fewer icons initially presented on the screen, but more options to change your map: Explore, driving, transit, satellite, terrain, traffic, and biking. Google also has 3D models of most buildings (i.e. The Empire State Building actually looks like the building and not just like a flat rectangle). Apple has these in some locations, but not as often as Google Maps. Both apps have a current location button on the screen \u2014 the arrow on Apple Maps and the bull\u2019s-eye on Google Maps. Google also has a Google Assistant button, quick access to input an address, and settings for your Google account and map (Apple has these functions as well, but they are built into your device\u2019s OS). Navigation: Apple  Google  When it comes to the actual navigation screen, Apple\u2019s is once again very simple (particularly if you choose driving as your mode of transportation). There are not a lot of icons on the screen, which limits distractions if you\u2019re using the app while driving. If you zoom in or choose the walking option, you\u2019ll see more locations. Google has slightly more icons, but most of them are gas stations and parking lots; places you\u2019d likely stop at if you were driving. Similarly, if you choose walking mode, you\u2019ll see more general locations. Both base their arrival estimations on current traffic conditions. Red sections along your route indicate heavy traffic, yellow is moderate traffic, and blue is no or little traffic. You may also see various alerts, from accidents to road closures. Google is a bit clearer when it comes to how traffic will impact your commute by showing the travel time in red to indicate there is heavy traffic. Other than the differences mentioned above, this section is very similar for both versions. Google has a few more options on the main screen, such as sound, compass, and quick search, making it easier to tweak your settings on the fly. This information is available on Apple Maps as well, but you have to pull up from the bottom portion of the screen and press the corresponding category, which makes it a bit trickier. Standout features There are some standout features for Apple Maps, such as is its integration with iOS. Tell Siri where you want to go, and she\u2019ll start the process for you. You can also open maps, cancel an in-progress route, and make other small adjustments using just your voice. Apple Maps also uses vector graphics, which means you\u2019ll end up using slightly less data than if you were using Google Maps. One of the coolest features for Apple Maps, though, is Flyover Mode. This feature enables you to explore densely populated urban centers in 3D landscapes composed of models of buildings and structures. Flyover also has what are known as City Tours, which guide you around various landmarks in a city. There is no real equivalent in Google Maps (although Google Tour Creator[1] comes close). As for Google, there is a lot that stands out for this service. Where Apple has Flyover mode, Google has Street View, which provides panoramic views of many streets around the world. Google also lets you customize your routes by adding stops and avoiding tolls. But two of the biggest draws for Google Maps are Google\u2019s bicycle maps and offline accessibility. In a bike-friendly city, this is really handy, and Apple Maps simply doesn\u2019t have that functionality. Apple Maps recently added bike-sharing stations to its list of places[2], but that\u2019s not really the same, is it? Google also has primo offline planning for those with limited access to WiFi or data. While Apple Maps uses slightly less data than Google Maps, Google makes up for that by allowing you to download entire sections of maps for offline use. Other differences Another (and obvious) difference between Apple and Google\u2019s mapping services is that one is owned by Google and the other is owned by Apple. This is worth considering when it comes to how your data is stored and when your app will be updated. Google has different policies when it comes to how much of your data is collected and what it can do with it. Google\u2019s app has received criticism over the location history tracking page, and if you\u2019re concerned about privacy, Apple Maps may be a better choice. On the other hand, Apple Maps is only updated when you update iOS, whereas Google rolls updates into Google Maps whenever it feels like it. It\u2019s also worth noting that while both apps are currently available on Apple devices, you won\u2019t be finding Apple Maps on your Android phone or Windows computer anytime soon, which could be problematic for users who don\u2019t exclusively own Apple products. On the software side of things, Google tends to have better small city mapping data than Apple. This might just be because Google Maps has been around for longer, but for people who don\u2019t live in a big city, or don\u2019t rely on a car for their primary mode of transportation, it can make a big difference. Google also has information regarding opening times of businesses, descriptions, photos, and user-generated star ratings. Apple has this as well, but less often. Apple does also include TripAdvisor, Yelp, and other third-party app ratings. Google has released several updates in the last few months that allow you to see average wait times at restaurants, sort through reviews, and discover and navigate to new places easily. So while Apple Maps has made a lot of improvements over the last six years, and works well in major cities, Google Maps is still years ahead of the competition and definitely a top pick.
