            "answer_text": "It would be a complete non starter. While \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is evolving at a rapid pace, it\u2019s still not really any kind of real intelligence. If you were to compare artificial life\u2019s evolution path to biological lives evolution path, artificial life is still at the primordial soup state, it hasn\u2019t even managed to form a single celled life form yet. All \u201crobots\u201d or \u201cAI\u201d systems require constant human super vision. No matter how complicated, or advanced any system on earth is today, there\u2019s always a few human required to set up machines, maintain them, replace cutters, etc.. biological machines don\u2019t need that kind of supervision. At this point in time, for a machine to even consider going to war with humans, someone would have to specifically create a machine with that as it\u2019s goal. If we ever do create an artificial intelligence, there\u2019s no reason to think it would go to war with humans. It has no incentive too. If it doesn\u2019t like humans and living things in general it would be much easier for it to create a space faring body for itself and just leave earth. Humans like to see themselves as detached from the rest of the natural world, as if we are somehow above it. The AI might not see it that way, it may just see us as one of the animals of this ecosystem, and may see it as wrong for it to interfere with the natural order of things. If it did want to change things and was somehow able to control the machines of production. It could just as easily stop those means of production, come up with better products and force humans to change just by controlling food production, our dependence on global trade makes us very vulnerable that way. At the moment people don\u2019t go hungry because there isn\u2019t enough food in the world, they go hungry because they can\u2019t afford the food. People aren\u2019t homeless because there aren\u2019t enough homes. They just can't afford the cost of living in a home. So any AI could probably rearrange things pretty quickly to make life much better, for more people. It might not need to use war. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans win, hands down. Robots (today) don\u2019t have any real intelligence in them. They\u2019re either: 1) designed to perform a specific task over and over again. We\u2019d be pretty stupid to program them to \u201ckill all humans\u201d. Even if we did, they lack creativity or free will, so they\u2019d be pretty easy to beat after a round or two. or 2) Designed to be directed by humans and possessing limited autonomy. Any intelligence is to allow them to follow-through in the event of a loss or disruption of control. Without instructions or a human to initially designate targets, there isn\u2019t much to fight. If we ever did develop or facilitate an actual machine intelligence, we\u2019d have to be absolute idiots to enslave it in a weapons system. It would make about as much sense as making breast implants out of C-4. Zero benefit and a pointless and ridiculously high risk. ",
