            "answer_text": "I do not know these products, but per the experience of a friend of mine, who worked with Trivisio before, their owners Spass or Gerrit and Medea have no credibility even cheating. Below is my friend\u2019s true experience. Prior to the May of 2017, they were called Trivisio Prototyping GmbH based on Germany. Since then, they moved to Luxembourg, called Lux Prototyping S.A.R.L. They have two domain names, one is trivision.com, the other is luxprototyping.com. At the beginning of the cooperation, though their attitude was arrogant and their payment was slow, but they still would pay in the end. But this year (2019), for a general big order, they used a fake bank slip (a proof of payment) in German to cheat you to release the shipment. After almost 2 months they got the shipment, they started to say the quality of the goods was not good and refused to pay, in the same time they asked you to produce more parts for them, but no one word on they payment. Later, they used these as hostage to request you to ship products first while without plan to pay you anymore. My previous company suffered a loss of several thousand USD because of them. ",
