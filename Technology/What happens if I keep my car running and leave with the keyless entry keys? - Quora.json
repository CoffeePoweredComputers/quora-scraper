            "answer_text": "In keyless entry with pushbutton start systems, key is needed only for starting the car. Once the engine starts, it is possible to leave the car, with the engine still running. The engine would continue to run till it runs out of fuel. Please note that it is illegal to leave the vehicle unattended, with the engine running. My daughter learned this the hard way. A few months ago, she had gone to a hotel. She decided to avail the services of valet parking. She got off the car, with the engine running, and the valet got into the driver's seat and drove it towards the parking site. My daughter had forgotten to handover the fob to the valet. The valet realised the missing fob only after parking. He could not lock or start the car without the fob. the car was already running so he didn\u2019t need to start the car. The fob isn\u2019t needed to lock a car, as you can lock it with the switch inside the car. ",

Now I don\u2019t use the park brake on the Prius and it beeps if I open the door with it in the ready mode reminding me to push the button and it engages park when off by itself. I haven\u2019t found a solution with the Honda but will probably sell it as it is smaller less smother ride and uses 30% more fuel than the Prius and get an electric car a second hand Tesla model S.

And some car ping periodically for the key fob and behave differently when the key not around. In my experience with a rented Hyundai Elantra, I left the car with engine running to take some picture outside (and the key fob is with me) and my wife is still in the car. The car started to beep with an error shown on the dashboard saying key not found after I move few meters away. However, the engine still running and did not switch off. Not sure if the car can still be driven away though and we didn\u2019t try that. ",
