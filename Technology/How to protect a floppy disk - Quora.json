The only thing you can really do with floppy disks is try to keep them as dust-free as possible, but no matter how you look at it they are pretty fragile. I would not trust data to them long-term when you can use something better. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is ambiguous. Floppies have a write protection mechanism that on 3.5 disks was a switch that you could turn on and off. On older versions it was a cutoff that you could cover with non-transparent adhesive tape. Physically 3.5 inch disks needed lite protection, mainly against dirt in a pocket. 5.25 inch ones came with a paper sleeve but they could bend easily so some extra protection probably was needed. ",
