While we are unable to measure any changes in sea level and the \u2018best\u2019 science suggests a rise of 500 50 600 mm by 2100 which will see water at our front door. I would be lot more concerned if I lived in a large low lying coastal city. The logistics are mind boggling.

Climate change is what nature does and always has done and she doesn\u2019t care what humans do, think or say because we cannot dictate to nature how she will act. It\u2019s as simple a that. We can however avert the disease and filth experienced in places like LA and San Francisco by revoking Democrat policies and return to common sense legislation. ",
