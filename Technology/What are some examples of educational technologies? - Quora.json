            "answer_text": "Hmmm...this is a harder question than it might seem.  There is no stable or standard definition of the term - nor of its component words (education, technology).  Some people refer to Skype as an educational technology, for example, presumably because it can in theory be used to enable students to video chat with scientists and other professionals remotely.  Under this definition, almost any electronic device or piece of software could conceivably be included under the \"educational technology\" umbrella.  For example, if Skype is an educational technology then isn't a telephone also an educational technology of the same sort?  Wouldn't two tin cans connected by a string also be an educational technology of generally the same sort? As another example, there is a whole \"Education\" category of apps in the iTunes app store.  Many people seem to consider any app that is categorized into that category as an \"educational technology.\"  There is nothing preventing someone from putting any app at all into the Education category, however (and indeed many people do).  The publishers of \"Clash of Clans,\" \"Candy Crush,\" and \"Penultimate\" could move their apps into the Education category if they wanted.  Would that suddenly make them more educational than when they were in the Games or Productivity categories?  Hardly.  So these kinds of self-applied, ad hoc categories are also not a meaningful basis to identify which technologies are educational technologies. The term \"educational technology\" is pretty problematic, in fact.  In general it's not the technology that is inherently educational, but the way in which it is used that makes it an educational application of a technology. It's possible to define some useful definitions, although any attempt to do that will surely spark arguments from people with differing views.  But let's give it a go anyway. First, we need operational definitions of \"education\" and \"technology.\"  EducationEducation is not a well-defined concept.  It is sometimes used, for example, to refer to a process (e.g., systematic instruction), and at other times it is used to refer to a product or outcome (e.g., knowledge gained).  Sometimes people mean a formal system of instruction with explicit learning objectives, sometimes people mean any formal or informal experience that stimulates learning, and sometimes people would include under \"education\" a certain kind of experience - or any experience, whether there's any reason to believe learning occurred or not. TechnologyBroadly construed, technology could include a very diverse array of tools and artifacts.  A pencil, a piece of paper, or a chalkboard, for example, could reasonably be considered educational technologies under the broadest definition.  When people talk about \"educational technology\" today, they typically mean \"high technology\" and, more specifically, they usually mean electronic technologies like computers and the internet. Educational TechnologyIf we want a definition of educational technology that makes meaningful distinctions (doesn't include everything) and reflects how people commonly use the term, then we might define it something like this: Educational Technology is:1) an electronic device or computer application that2) leverages unique affordances of the technological medium and 3) is designed specifically for the purpose of supporting explicit learning objectives OR provides a standard paradigm for supporting learning objectives defined by a teacher, tutor, mentor, or the student himself/herself. Ideally, the technology should provide some way to verify that the learning objectives have been met and/or to assess incremental progress toward the objectives. We might go further and define Instructional Technology as a special case of Educational Technology that:1) Is designed to support learning toward a set of explicitly defined objectives2) Provides instruction to the user/student to help them achieve the learning objectives3) Allows the user/student to respond or express their understanding in some way4) Provides feedback on their performance against the explicit objectives The Carnegie Tutors (http://www.carnegielearning.com) are examples of instructional technologies. If you are interested in finding lots of curated examples of Instructional Technology, you should check out Balefire Labs (Finding Apps that Help Kids Learn).  They use evidence-based instructional design criteria aligned with the above list to evaluate which apps labeled \"Educational\" are more or less likely to provide effective instruction.  Interestingly, they have found that only two of the top 10 Education Apps in iTunes have even minimal instructional value (Only Two of Top 10 EdApps in iTunes are Worth Buying).  This underscores my point above about the problems with using the \"Education\" category in app stores as a guide to what is and is not educational technology.[Note: I am not affiliated with Balefire Labs in any way.] If you are interested in an example of educational technology that supports education without specifying specific learning objectives, check out Socrative (http://www.socrative.com).  They provide a general-purpose platform enabling formative assessment using any kind of web-enabled device.  This qualifies as an educational technology because it wouldn't be feasible to do what they do without the technology. [Note: I am not affiliated with Socrative in any way.] ",

            "answer_text": "The mode of learning is changing vastly with technological advancement students become more brilliant in education and have versatility in knowledge. Various tools and avenues create with the aim of delivering training and learning to learners more efficiently. Educational technology examples are several that bring knowledge to the people making them knowledgeable. Many institutions are now adopting sample technology plan for schools to make the study and interaction with their students more engaging and fruitful. The More Fruitful way is to give good ideas via mentorship. The most solid mentorship platform is SkillPal right now. They arrived in India in 2020. SkillPal will help anyone to get innovative ideas and skills. People will ask for a shoutout from industry experts and mentors. And within 7 days they will get a personalized video message from their favourite mentor. Education technology is related to good mentorship in a good classroom environment. At every level, mentoring is recognised as being an effective and highly-beneficial way to educate, develop and grow. This year, more than ever before, mentoring is so vital to individual success for students, graduates, and working professionals. Mentoring in education involves pairing young people with an older peer or volunteer, who acts as a positive role model. In general, mentoring aims to build confidence, develop resilience and character, or raise aspirations, rather than to develop specific academic skills or knowledge. Mentorship is the real cornerstone of education because if any mentor misleads any student on the education field that student would become clueless about the career. That\u2019s why a good mentor in any institute counselling the student and help him or her to build their career. Students may know the name of SkillPal. At SkillPal mentors came to provide personalized video to the pupils and help them to set new goals. A career building option and skill development platform is SkillPal. People who are in confusion and afraid of doing something new can come to SkillPal. This career-building or skill-building mentorship platform will provide personalized video chat against some money and help them to find the lost confidence. The sample technology plan for schools has tools that ease the learning process and help teachers to understand any issue affecting their students. For instance, you can learn about buoyancy and swimming but unless you get to a pool to be trained by an instructor, you wouldn't know how to swim. Motor learning, for instance, helps you to change and learn from experiences. It helps you to improve the accuracy of your movements and be more active on the tennis court. This is also why you steadily improve your reflexes when playing tennis, as you develop your motor skills. If you want to learn knowledge, you need to take the right steps. As motor learning is relatively permanent, you do not forget your skills, just like you can ride your bicycle even after years of riding one. Tennis players who practice hours on the tennis court every day can look to improve their reflexes, timing and organization abilities. A mentor of SkillPal can help you advance within your field and connect you with opportunities that you might not have otherwise had access to. They do this by sharing their knowledge, helping you identify opportunities in your path, and potentially opening doors for you when the time comes. Almost every great achiever in history has claimed that they had a great mentor at some point during their rise to excellence. Mentorship is a valuable tool for turning one\u2019s vision into reality. SkillPal Mentors are expected to guide and advise their mentees, helping them build a successful career or gain a solid footing within a certain organization. Typically, a mentor has one mentee at a time and can focus on shaping their trajectory. Skilled immigrants and international students who want to quickly advance in their career in a new country should take advantage of mentorships. Gaining knowledge from someone who has successfully navigated a similar experience can help you accelerate your growth. Someone who will help you make the right decisions at the right time could influence the rest of your life. The sample technology plan used by schools on their students is versatile. And can be used both online and in the classroom. Examples of educational technology in the classroom are tools such as; electronic whiteboards, flipped learning, desktops and laptops videoconferencing classroom technologies among other technologies. The objectives of educational technology with examples are; To provide education in the use of ICT, impacting learning experiences in institutions technology, to engage in computer-based educational resources. Those learners use on the practical use of technology integration among others and as an example, these technology tools use high tech tools which engage learners and lecturers in a digital mode. Using augmented reality in the classroom can turn an ordinary class into an engaging experience. AR technology provides virtual examples and adds gaming elements to support textbook materials. As a result, classes become more interactive. AR helps students better remember the information they\u2019ve just learned. Let's review a few examples of augmented reality in classroom education.
