            "answer_text": "The grandaddy of \u201cservice\u201d business models in tech are staffing and consulting. There are so many \u201cconsulting\u201d and \u201ccontracting\u201d agencies it\u2019s not even funny. You can do it as an individual, or as a group, and companies can grow from this. In other words, you can sell knowledge and know how. Staffing is all about finding the right people to do work. Consulting is providing guidance about how a project should be be done. Consulting tends to be far more about planning and establishing predictability while staffing is getting it done. There are also content services, such as educational platforms. You can sell tutorials, lessons, programs, etc. These are still human-powered services. Bottom line: you can start by selling knowledge. \u2014 It is very common for people to start out as a freelancer, looking to make the move into \u201cconsulting\u201d and eventually into a \u201cproduct\u201d business. This fails most of the time because people underestimate the sheer volume of effort required to build a consulting practice (lots of networking, marketing, sales, etc). Products tend to be pushed to the side, because they follow a different business model which is equally demanding. So, consider your future very carefully if you\u2019re considering a \u201cservice first\u201d approach to launching a business. It\u2019s a good way to make a living, but it\u2019s not the best \u201cgateway\u201d to another line of business. More successful tech companies start by building a product, either bootstrapping or raising funds. Services are added later, after the market has expanded. This is how open source systems like Red Hat got off the ground. Product first, expanding into services. ",
