Even though some people may come off as they don't. Don't the charade fool you. They're just putting on an appearance. The best advice from one human to another is to own it. Don't let it become a hindrance. Become strong in it. Stand tall in it. Just own your vulnerabilities and see how you can use than as your strengths. It may sound weird or counterintuitive but trust yourself to establish boundaries. I hope this helps. Stay Blessed Stay Woke \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f ",

I don\u2019t know what kind of \u201cvulnerability\u201d you mean, I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cdo with,\u201d nor do I have any idea what authorities you are obliquely referring to by asking \u201csupposed to.\u201d Example: if you are in a sports competition, say, on a football team, and you discover that you are vulnerable to someone disrupting you from your left side, then what you do with the KNOWLEDGE of that vulnerability, is to change how you play, to try to compensate, and avoid such disruption. If you are dealing with social arguments, and you find that you are vulnerable to being told that you have to have permission to speak from a specified debate leader, then you would logically investigate how to get that official permission.
