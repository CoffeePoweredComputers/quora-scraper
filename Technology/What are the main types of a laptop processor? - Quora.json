AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU), formerly known as Fusion, is the marketing term for a series of 64-bit microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), designed to act as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics accelerator unit (GPU) on a single die chip. AMD APU\u2019s list: Search Results Intel had recently a tie-up with AMD to produce Kaby lake G processors i.e, Intel processor with AMD discrete GPU on a single die. Products formerly Kaby Lake G Intel Processors are categorized by its suffix letters: Intel H (8th Gen 6-Core Intel Processors) HQ - High Performance Quad Core HK - High Performance Unlocked K \u2013 Unlocked M \u2013 Mobile Q \u2013 Quad-core U \u2013 Ultra-low power X \u2013 Extreme edition Y \u2013 Extremely low power Here is the detailed Lineup of Intel Processors from Westmere(1st Gen Intel Core Processors) to coffee lake(8th Gen Intel Core Processors) Intel\u00ae Processor Numbers: Laptop, Desktop, and Mobile Device Hope this helps..

            "answer_text": "Basically, the hierarchy of \"slow\" to \"fast\" processors, in general, is:   Dual Core -> Quad Core -> i3 -> i5 -> i7   That is, an i7 processor will generally give you the most performance for the same \"clock speed.\" To avoid getting into really complicated terms, a Dual Core processor has two processors inside it, a Quad Core has four, an i3 has two that do double duty, an i5 has four that do double duty, and an i7 has six that do double duty.   Basically, the easiest way to think of it is take the \"speed\" of the processor, like 2 GHz, 2.5 GHz, etc. and multiply it by the type:   Dual: 2  Quad: 4  i3: 4  i5: 8  i7: 12   It's not QUITE that simple in reality, but that's an easy way to look at it if you don't want to read a page and a half of computer geekery. :P Long story short, an i7 is going to be the fastest thing you can get. That doesn't mean a dual core is necessarily bad, though; if you're not gonna be doing a lot of computer-intensive stuff (video rendering, playing games) you could do just fine with a decently fast (2 GHz or higher) dual core.
