The program is called \u201clifeline\u201d, as is intended to make sure poor people have ready access to medical services. Do you qualify for Medicaid or SNAP? Is you income less than 135% of the poverty line? Then you can get a free phone provided by the carrier, a monthly quota of voice minutes, a monthly quota of data, and unlimited texts. Contract details vary, depending on what company you get your \u201clifeline\u201d service from. You must renew annually, which mean proving that you still qualify. ",

In \u2018Digital India,\u2019 Government Hands Out Free Phones to Win Votes gives one example of how free phones are distributed. There are a few websites that offer free phones as a reward to people who sign up and then do things to generate reward points. You could try those (google \u201cfree phones\u201d), but historically, free giveaways on the Internet always have a downside / catch. ",
