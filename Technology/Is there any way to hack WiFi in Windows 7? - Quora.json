            "answer_text": "yes, it's not work good but I can't say it's bad too. If you want to hack someones WiFi near you then You should be lucky :- yes luck plays a big role of you hacking someone WiFi password through windows 7. If password is long then it's really hard to crack or if password has space then it's like impossible to hack through windows 7. Time :- Time matters alot because your Computer doesn't know the password of someone WiFi so Computer will try key to key means combination keys. If password is long then it's takes long time. Network :- WiFi hacking depends on Network is good or bad. If it's good then cracking speed will be good too. Guessing :- sometimes guessing works like if you WiFi owner name or ph. No. then try to put that in as password might it can work. ( I guessed and it's worked but only 2 times ) Best way to hack WiFi password Well best way is Kali Linux. Kali Linux is the best to hack someones\u200b WiFi using aircrack in terminal and enjoy :) ",
