            "answer_text": "Apple is an unfortunate company, IMO, because its whole ethos, the reason it\u2019s been admired is that it takes technological risks to push a new idea into the technology space that others are not trying, and/or they take an idea that others have tried, and make it easier to use, and more attractive, but what made them do that was the vision and passion of Steve Jobs. When Jobs left Apple in 1985, the company managed to succeed very well for several years, but then it went into decline, to the point that it was a few months from being liquidated, in the late \u201890s. This was when Jobs came back, and revived it. When he died in 2011, I sold my Apple stock, because part of the reason I invested with the company was because he was there. The other part was I could see the value proposition of what they were doing with the iPhone and iPad, and their media business. He was clearly the reason that Apple was able to reinvent itself, and find a new way to succeed that went way beyond the way it had been able to succeed in the mid- and late \u201880s. I just didn\u2019t know what the company would be about after that, because its history had shown that without someone like Jobs there, it coasted. It stopped taking risks, and introducing something new. That didn\u2019t work for them, and ultimately, it could be argued, was a major factor in the rise of Microsoft in the \u201890s, and why it was able to become a monopoly. I talked with an editor of a technology publication back in 2012 about this, and he thought that the story with Apple would be different this time, because when Jobs left the first time, the man who became CEO, John Sculley, was someone he had hired outside of the company. Tim Cook was someone who had been with the company for years. He had risen up through the ranks. He had worked with Jobs for a long time, and was familiar with the company culture. He thought that Cook would be able to continue what Jobs started. I get the sense that Apple has been coasting. It\u2019s not taking risks the way it used to. It\u2019s becoming a carrier of commodity technology. Lately the company\u2019s official statements have indicated they know this, and intend to keep going on this path, which means that it\u2019s competing solely on price, rather than innovation, with other PC and mobile manufacturers who are making basically the same technology, in terms of what it functionally does. In that case, it just becomes a \u201cme-too\u201d company, whose only real value proposition to customers is that their technology is easy to use, that it has a secure app. store, and a media sales business. I can enjoy that just fine. I like their product, but I don\u2019t think in the long run that\u2019s a winning proposition for them, because everything they\u2019re doing now can, and is being commoditized, and they don\u2019t have an answer to that. That\u2019s what started their decline the first time this happened to them. When Apple\u2019s decline started, it was not sudden. It took several years before the end was looming. Apple at its peak has been a billion-dollar company, so one could imagine it could take longer to reach the point it did in the late \u201890s, but it\u2019s still a very real possibility. I\u2019m not saying that Jobs was the only one who could make the company succeed, but they need someone like him, and contrary to expectations, I don\u2019t think Cook fits with what\u2019s needed, despite all his experience with the company. I say that partly because Cook does not seem to have the charisma and chutzpah that Jobs had to push people to take bold risks, and to make them succeed. ",
