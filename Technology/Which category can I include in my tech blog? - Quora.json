            "answer_text": "Adding categories to your tech blog is a great idea. It\u2019ll make it easy for your readers to quickly get to topics that they are interested in without having to scroll through multiple blogs (yawn!). It also proves a tad useful to up your game at SEO. Consider this \u2013 what if you added categories that are most searched or the ones that you want your site to rank for? For example, our company Pepipost is an email delivery service. We help businesses send their emails and offer the best inbox rates. Given our knowledge and experience in email delivery, we write lots of blogs on how to improve email delivery, email best practices, etc. For an online business such as ours, ranking for our core keyword (in this case, email delivery service) becomes utmost crucial. This is the keyword for which we want to rank on page 1, the keyword that gets us the right traffic to our website. My suggestion to choosing categories for your tech blog \u2013 1. Choose ones that you want to drive traffic to your website/ blog page (get the right customers with the right keywords) 2. Do a quick keyword analysis (use free tools like Google Keyword Planner or UberSuggest) to see whether the category you listed is frequently searched and tweak word accordingly. Example \u2013 If I wrote blogs on the latest buzzword in technology, AI \u2013 I would rather write my blog category as artificial intelligence than AI, given the volume of searches  3. Another aspect you might want to consider is to mimic categories of popular tech blogs. If you go through the most read tech blog sites, you\u2019ll notice that they all have almost similar categories. Product Review is one very popular one, another is the latest technology (VR/ AI/ML, etc) 4. You can build your url path basis the category. Example \u2013 http://mytechblog.com/artificial-intelligence/impact-of-ai-in-marketing 5. To get good clicks on your categories, don\u2019t hide them. Make them clearly visible on your site. Like how we\u2019ve done at Pepipost.  Good luck with your tech blog site! ",

            "answer_text": "The Technical Field is very Vast. What are you targeting ? Mobile Phones, OS , Laptops or something else ? I would recommend that you create categories based on Devices/ Products. Look at How the top tech bloggers create categories that should give a good idea of how to get things rolling. Why don\u2019t you use polling option on Twitter or other Social Media platform, asking Tech Bloggers on how to they prefer to categorize their blog, that should give you a comprehensive answer. Do you already have a blog yet? Would love to see what you have there already. ",
