            "answer_text": "According to Baba Vanga, one of the greatest psychics: By 2028 we will have a new energy source. By 2043: the global economy will improve. On the other hand she predicts a new coming on another planet, so who knows. On the other hand, the energy might already be here, according to my experiments: Perpetual Motion Links A counterweight is proven to lift the same ball that later lifts it. SUCCESSFUL OVER-UNITY EXPERIMENT 1, REDONEIn another device, there is natural torque. PROVEN TORQUE W/ NATURAL TORQUE DEVICEA ball can be lifted by a downwards slope and then fall along a sinking rising slope. CRESCENT LEVER NOTABLE MODIFICATIONIn another device, there is natural rebound off a backboard at higher altitude with return. PERPETUAL MOTION: 'TRILLION-DOLLAR' DISCOVERY!In another device, momentum from a backboard could theoretically overcome a slight vertical angle. MASTER ANGLE REVERSE-GRAVITY PROOF1/2 mass * distance might be used to lift a supported wheel along an inward spiral, and then drop it back at a sharper angle. REAL PERPETUAL MOTION EXPERIMENT 2A device called Scarpa\u2019s Pendulum might show natural rotation between large spheres using the inner slope of a bowl. REAL PERPETUAL MOTION EXPERIMENT 1Support might be used to carry a cylinder back up to a point of leverage application.A counterweight can be lifted and return simply by inputting horizontal motion in a lighter opposing weight. ANOTHER NEAR-COMPLETE PROOF",
