            "answer_text": "Generally you can not use sim card in a laptop. Many laptops have a SIM card slot. What 90% of them don't have, is the optional and required WWAN card that accesses the cellular wireless service. If you do not see one of these mobile broadband (WWAN) adapters listed under the Network Adapters device manager category, then you can't connect to the internet using a SIM card. If you want to access mobile sim in a laptop then you need to install WWAN card that is a very complex process to begin with. Very few models of laptops actually supports mobile sim in that slot *very few* but there are some ways where you can run a sim card on a laptop. a sim card can be used with a USB internet modem(commonly called as dongle).which is used to connect to internet. from there you are also able to call someone, recieve text messages and use it for internet connectivity as well. and many of these dongles also support SD card for media purposes.

            "answer_text": "A Sim card needs GSM circuit to use its very basic feature such as making voice calls or use data packets. You have to use HP Elitebook or Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 4G. You can also connect a Sim Card reader / writer for making further use of Sim Card , but it wont allow you to make phone calls or use data service. The best option is to use the SIM with laptop is to use USB Data Adopter with Desktop Application so you can use Data / Internet and also make phone calls using earphone / mic . ",
