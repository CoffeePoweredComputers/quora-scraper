            "answer_text": "I'm sorry but I can't agree with your generalization that current computers are less reliable than older models. I have been building desktops and repairing both desktops and laptops since 2000. I never felt with any next generation of hardware that it was worse than the preceding generation. Every company has had their mistakes, but as a whole, if you buy a quality product you get a quality experience. If the buyer buys a new, piece of junk 250 dollar laptop, they are rolling the dice and that is the risk they take. Companies really don't want to put that poor quality laptop out there, but the buying public is basically not computer hardware litterate, and thinks that the only thing that matters is price. Well, I'm sorry, but quality costs money. If you want good components and quality manufacturing practices and quality display panels, then the buyer needs to expect to pay for that. So I would say that anyone who lived with expensive laptops from 2005 through 2012 when mass failures of video and Northridge chips that were attributed to poor soldering materials and insufficient cooling were left with inoperable laptops, would not ever wish to go back from their laptops of today. Especially when you consider how far we have come performance wise. ",

            "answer_text": "The function of a corporation is to make money for both the corporation itself and its shareholders. When corporations build up a large enough customer base, the realize they can deliver inferior products at lower manufacturing costs, and customers will still keep buying their products. Apple is a good example of this. It seems that their MacBooks get worse and worse with each new model, but customers keep buying them, and Apple keeps getting more money. It\u2019s not necessarily that the specs are getting worse (e.g. processor, graphics, screen), it\u2019s that the overall build quality of MacBooks are getting worse. Apple can do this because the majority of their customers don\u2019t care, and they\u2019re not losing any money by doing so. Just in case anyone doesn\u2019t think Apple\u2019s products are getting worse, check out this video from Louis Rossmann, the owner of an NYC MacBook repair shop. Even though he makes almost all of his money from repairing MacBooks, he doesn\u2019t recommend that anyone buy one. He goes into detail on how recent MacBooks are getting worse at around 2:00.  ",

            "answer_text": "Why are current computers less reliable than older models? I haven\u2019t seen a lot of difference between current computers and with older computers, for reliability. They have broken down at about the same rate, whether they were new or old. Some of the newer computers feel a bit flimsy, compared to something from the early 90\u2019s or late 80\u2019s, heck even machines from the early 2000\u2019s felt sturdier than some machines I see today. But, reliability-wise they all are about the same to me. ",
