            "answer_text": "Selective breeding is used to alter the appearance, behavior, or other traits in a population of organisms. It\u2019s essentially human-guided evolution. For example, if you want your corn to have larger kernels (more food per ear), you pick out which corn plants produced the largest kernels, and you keep those for planting, while you eat the rest. The next year, all the corn planted will be large-kerneled corn. When the end of the season comes, you do the same thing again - you pick the ears with the largest kernels, and save that seed to replant. Over time, your corn has ears with larger and larger kernels. Every time a chance mutation or the right combination of genes comes together to produce larger kernels, you select it for survival to the next generation, and the corn evolves to be the way you want it.

            "answer_text": "To breed domesticated animals for characteristics that (for instance) farmers, pet owners and breeders want.  Parent animals with the desired trait are mated and their offspring are mated, and on and on, until they breed true.  This is very simplified, but thats basically what is being done.  Over the thousands of years, we have livestock that is docile and easy to manage (compared to wild versions).   This is done with plants too, even more than animals.  Just about every fruit and vegetable we eat today has been selectively bred. ",
