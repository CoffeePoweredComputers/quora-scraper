            "answer_text": "The Finance function in any business is what determines the life of the business. Without there being revenue generation, no business will survive. In order to even start a business, a capital amount must be invested. This is then used to carry out business operations that will eventually fulfill the objectives of what the business initially set out to meet. Human and intellectual capital, raw materials, equipment and software, infrastructure, patents and copyrights, legal procedures and many other equally important divisions of the company require the support of financial resources to carry out their functions. Without there being consistent and profitable monetary transactions, the business will struggle to maintain a secure position in the market and will fall prey to the challenges posed by their competitors. Expansion, investments and futuristic growth of the company will not be possible without the availability of sufficient funds. Having a good credit standing is essential to secure loans and procure funds to grow the operations of the business. All in all, the finance function is the most important aspect of any business and requires a sound and qualified team to handle it. I hope this has been of use to you.
