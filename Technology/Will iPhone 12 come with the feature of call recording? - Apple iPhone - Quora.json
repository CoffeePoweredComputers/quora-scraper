            "answer_text": "Ios 14 is going to support call recording feature. So you can expect iphone 12 will get call recording feature, but there's a catch. Apple is only providing this feature in ios 14 where call recording is legally allowed. Countries like Australia and India don't allow users to call record, so some regions might not get this feature.(This information is based on the leaks, so it is not possible to tell whether iphone 12 will support call recording or not).

            "answer_text": "No! iOS and call recording do not go hand in hand! That\u2019s a privacy issue for them, infact so much so that you can not even find a reliable app in the app store which works as good as an android phone. Apple doesn\u2019t allow third-party software access to the microphone while the phone app is in use which is great for privacy. So the best option is to take the call via speakerphone and recording with another! Inconvenient.. I know! ",
