            "answer_text": "This is a bit hard to answer, because although \"sound recording\u201d means something specific today, it really isn't specific. For example, every time I write a song, I am recording what I'm writing on manuscript paper. Sound recordings can also be considered things like piano rolls and crank organ cards. Both use punch card style technology to reproduce sound.  Instruments that \"play themselves\u201d essentially reproduce sound. Since, for example, the crank organ has been around since the 15th century, there's no definitive answer to the first recording used for it, or any other instrument that uses similar mechanics to play music. Let alone the first sold. In a way, although the technology to read it is more advanced today, the idea of recording sound onto a medium hasn't really changed that much. Ever since Edison, it's been grooves on a thing. First grooves read by a needle on cylinders, then records, and now compact disks. Even hard drives are read essentially in the same way. Edison's first recorded sound was himself reciting \"Mary Had A Little Lamb.\u201d To date we believe the first recorded sound was in 1860 (17 years before Edison's cylinder).  Not only was the quality poor, but it doesn't translate to digital very well. As far as commercial success goes, Edison's cylinder saw it. But as far as \"first commercial release\u201d I highly doubt we'll ever know the answer. Initially blank cylinders sold most, and those who had the machine would use it to record themselves doing various things. This means it's highly likely that a band or a person sold cylinders they made to other people. After all, it was the first mass produced home recording machine. If I had lived in that time as a musician, I could have played popular music on my piano and record it on cylinder. Then, assuming I could buy enough blanks, I could sell my recording, licensed or not. This is why I would venture to say the first recordings to be sold were probably sold by everyday people, before Edison's studio started seriously recording. Especially because reproduction wasn't possible; if you wanted ten copies of a song, the musician would have to sing it ten times. Not to mention the early models of records didn't stand up to wear and tear.  Note it's sold as a \"talking machine.\u201d Initially voice recording was its main purpose. As far as we actually know, the first commercially available record was a 12 second recording of a woman singing \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\u201d The recording was written on a metal cylinder and was recently reproduced using a 3d printer. Edison was selling this recording for his \"talking doll.\u201d These are the earliest recordings of American female voices that we know of.  The talking doll not only had speaker holes, but a small cylinder player inside her that would play the record she came with, which varied between songs and children's poems. As mentioned in the video, this was done before mass replication came about, so each recording is unique. Will we ever know the first commercially available record? Probably not, at least I don't think we ever will. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Peter Copeland, (as he tells in his book about analogue sound restoration) the earliest commercially available recording is a cylinder, of course. The story goes that there was an importer of Edison dictation machines in London, who also provided service and blank cylinders and such. At a moment when the Earl of Winchelsea was buying some blanks, the singer Charles Coburn was \u201ctrying a phonograph by singing into it\u201d. The Earl noticed and asked if the cylinder was for sale. The cylinder was sold to him, \u201cand apparently Coburn carried all day singing unaccompanied into the machine. Other customers were informed that they were for sale and the whole stock was cleared by 11 o\u00b4clock next morning\u201d. Peter Copeland adds \u201cunfortunately history doesn\u00b4t relate how much they fetched\u201d. Copeland is above any doubt, which means, that man knew his onions and you can bet your life upon anything the man writes. And I can add, unfortunately he does not provide a date for the mentioned happenings, but they correspond to the times when Edison apparatus was the only existant sound machines in the world, and were meant and used solely for dictation purposes. The name \u201cJ.L. Young Manufacturing Company\u201d is the enterprise in whose premises the recording and sale of those cylinders took place, so some investigation might help setting an approximate date. Very possibly, that Coburn cylinder was the first ever sound recording offered for sale, bought, and the Earl of Winchelsea was the first ever sound recording buyer. ",
