            "answer_text": "It doesn't just depend on the core of the processor.A core is nothing but a processing unit of a CPU, which processes data. An octa-core processor is the one which has eight cores, having their independent cache memories, fixed on a single chip. Whereas a quad-core processor has, obviously as the name suggests, four cores on a chip.More the number of cores on a single chip, more will be its processing speed and more will be its multitasking capability, because it makes each of its core act as a single processor.Now the reason I said that it doesn't just depend on the core processor is because of another very important factor, which is RAM. We want an appreciable balance between the hardware and the software. If an android device has a processor of eight cores and a 1 GB RAM, while another one has a quad core processor and a RAM higher than the one with the octa-core, the former one might not be the better one. So we need an appropriate software-hardware coordination. ",

            "answer_text": "I think a quad core is more than enough for general usage and octa cores are actually a more like marketing gimmick from MediaTek and samsung to show off high scores in benchmarks . The truth is most of the octa cores dont use all its cores all the time and thats for reducing power consumption and heating . Qualcomm gave its try and experimented on octa core cpus and ended up having a big loss due to overheating issues in snapdragon 810. Now Qualcomm has opted for quad core in their snapdragon 820 chip, a much better chip. An advanced quad core cpu with good graphics card , a small lithography and faster clock speed is all needed for good performance as well as battery life ",
