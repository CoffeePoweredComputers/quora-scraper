            "answer_text": "A VPN creates a secure tunnel, between two endpoints - your end, and your employment or ISP. Traffic between each endpoint is encrypted at one end, and decrypted at the other end. The encryption will use significant bandwidth and CPU resources, between both endpoints. Your choice of having endpoints on your individual computers or on the router will depend upon many details. It may not be up to you, to choose. If you\u2019re using a VPN required by your employment, they may require a specific VPN endpoint on any protected computer - or they may require a specific router. VPN policy may encrypt all Internet traffic, and send all traffic through the tunnel. If you use router based endpoint, all computers in your house will be subject to the security policies of the VPN. This may restrict Internet access, on all computers. A VPN will use more bandwidth than you are using right now. You will want to review your current Internet setup, to start. If you\u2019re paying for limited bandwidth, you\u2019re going to want to enhance your plan. A VPN endpoint will use CPU cycles, on the individual computers or the router. Depending upon what is supported by the endpoint at the other end, you may setup your endpoint on the router, or add VPN endpoint software on each computer. Endpoint software on the individual computers will use CPU cycles on each computer. An endpoint on the router will use CPU resources there. If your LAN is WiFi based, you have lots of WiFi bandwidth, and you want to improve security, you will want to put endpoints on the individual computers. If your WiFi bandwidth is marginal, you may want to activate the endpoint on the router. If your LAN is Ethernet based, you can use either computer or router based endpoints. If you use a router based endpoint, all computers will be subject to security policies of the endpoint at the other end. This may hamper Internet access on all computers. Setting up a VPN requires planning, and attention to detail. Don\u2019t try this, if time and / or money is limited. ",

            "answer_text": "These days, almost all internet traffic is encrypted, thanks to https (emphasis on the \u201cs\u201d). A VPN won\u2019t add any security to that. If you want to make sure the site your are visiting is encrypting internet traffic, look for \u201chttps\u201d at the beginning of the web address, or an icon of a locked padlock. If you are using Chrome, any site that isn\u2019t encrypting traffic will be labeled \u201cNot secure\u201d. Skip the VPN. ",
