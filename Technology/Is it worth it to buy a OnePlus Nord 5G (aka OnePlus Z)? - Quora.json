            "answer_text": "It depends on your priorities. The OnePlus Z is rumoured to cost INR 24,999 for the 6GB RAM + 128GB ROM variant. It will come with the 765 or 765G SoC and a triple- or quad-camera setup (most likely main 48MP, wide 16MP, depth 2MP, and maybe macro sensors). The OnePlus Z will probably come with OxygenOS based on Android 10 out of the box, making it one of the best software experiences at this price point. The OnePlus Z/Nord will have a 4300 mAh battery with 30W charging (probably WarpCharge 30T) There are phones like the Redmi K20 Pro which offer 8-series Snapdragon processors at this price point, however, so it makes more sense to buy that instead. But the OnePlus is the better choice if you value a smooth, ad-free user interface. The 7-series chipset will be good enough for games like PUBG or COD, but over time it may slow down more than an 8-series one. The benefit of the 7-series SoC is that you will get considerably better battery life. ",
