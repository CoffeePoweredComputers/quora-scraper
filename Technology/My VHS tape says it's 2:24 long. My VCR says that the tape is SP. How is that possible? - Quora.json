            "answer_text": "How much tape fits inside a VHS cassette depends on the thickness of the tape. There are various standard tape lengths, up to 240 minutes at SP (Standard Play speed) for NTSC video (used in most of the Americas) and 300 minutes at SP for PAL countries. The thinner the tape, the more prone it is to jams and breaks, so the thinnest and longest tapes are less commonly used, but 144 minutes at SP is well within the length achievable using a standard VHS cassette. The lower speeds (LP and EP/SLP) give poorer video and audio quality, which is why very long films came on sets of two or more VHS tapes rather than just using a slower speed. ",
