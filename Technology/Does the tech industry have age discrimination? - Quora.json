            "answer_text": "The simple answer is: yes, age discrimination exists in every industry including the tech industry. The tech industry is unique, however, in its recent appetite for age discrimination. The tech sector is generally seen as housing a young and trendy workforce. This is because that stereotype generally holds true, as a majority of IT workers are young. Many believe that this is simply because younger generations are more tech savvy, but this is not necessarily true. There are a large number of older highly qualified and experienced IT workers who are unable to break into the tech industry due to what many have been referring to as a boys\u2019 club atmosphere. The facts are what they are, and if you Google age discrimination in the tech industry, you will see a lot of recent headlines about the issue. Many people are misinformed about what age discrimination actually means from a legal perspective. Age discrimination does not simply mean preferring one age demographic over another; it has a specific legal meaning under federal law. Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, age discrimination is discrimination against any person over the age of 40 in the hiring or firing process, the assigning of workplace privileges, or harassment in the workplace. The key marker of illegal age discrimination is any policy or actual instance of preference to the detriment of an employee or job applicant over the age of forty. Remember that picture of the young, bright, and creative new age workforce described earlier? The reality is that a majority of tech workers who do not hold senior executive positions are under the age of forty. This type of demographic imbalance does not occur simply by chance. Tech companies often explicitly target younger workers for hiring for many reasons from the perceived lack of experience in older tech workers and the notion that older employees may not fit in well with the primary workforce demographic, which is much younger. That said, it is not illegal to hire a younger worker over an older worker in most cases. Age discrimination is only actually illegal where either age directly factored into the critical employment decision (for example, deciding to fire a worker because he or she is older or because the worker\u2019s pension is about to vest is actual illegal discrimination) or where a workplace policy results in de facto discrimination. It is not illegal to hire a younger worker for many other reasons, however, such as the younger worker being more qualified, bringing diverse and creative ideas, or simply interviewing better. In sum, discrimination is occurring, but whether that discrimination is actually illegal or will ever be addressed is another issue. Proof in individual cases is harder to come by despite the larger picture being quite obvious. ",
