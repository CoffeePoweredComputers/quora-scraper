            "answer_text": "Exploring high-demand jobs is a good move for anyone trying to decide on a career path. After all, if you look through the careers in demand in 2019 and find one that draws on your interests and passions, your future could be one of unlimited potential. And since in-demand jobs can be found in a wide variety of industries, from hospitality and health care to technology and the skilled trades, you have plenty of career options to consider. Here\u2019s what experts reckon will be the most in-demand jobs for the next 4 years \u2013 and beyond. #10. Creatives:- Flannel-shirt wearing creatives are safe \u2013 for now. Designers, Marketers and Writers will benefit from new digital technology and easy access to roles. #9. Salespeople:- Salespeople have the originality, flexibility and management skills recruiters will look for in the future. And as urbanisation continues and high-street stores revive, shoppers will want to talk to actual, real people. Bad news for self-checkout bots. #8. Veterinary Nurses:- It\u2019s not all about us. With 44% of UK households owning some form of pet, it\u2019s logical that we will need people to look after our furry friends, too. The skills of Veterinary Nurses will be in demand for at least the next 4 years. #7. Healthcare Professionals:- As people live longer, we\u2019ll need Doctors, Nurses and Physiotherapists to look after us. But as medicines and living conditions improve, chances are we\u2019ll live our golden years in good health. #6. Engineers:- More and more people are moving to cities to work and live. To accommodate them, we\u2019ll need Electrical Engineers to wire our smart homes, Civil Engineers to design our roads, Software Engineers to connect streetlights to the internet, and Environmental Engineers to power them when oil runs out. But it\u2019s Sales Engineers, with in-demand technical knowledge of the goods and their market, who come out on top in the survey. #5. Hospitality and Catering Professionals:- As people crave new dining and flavor experiences, the food and drinks industry will boom. Chefs, Bartenders and Baristas tick the most in-demand skills for future employment: with originality, flexibility and management skills. #4. Skilled Tradespeople:- Automation will impact manual work jobs. But looking at how long it takes that Toyota robot to pour a glass of juice, tradespeople are safe for now. #3. Artisans:- Shoppers will pay extra for local, authentic and specialist products and services. That means artisans such as Coffee Roasters, Butchers and Barbers will help revitalize high streets. #2. Sports Therapists:- Millennials are more likely to hit 24-hour gyms than nightclubs. So, we\u2019ll need Personal Trainers to crunch their cores, Sports Therapists to ease strained hammies and Nutritionists to advise on which protein shakes to gulp down. #1. Teachers:- The future workforce will need a wide knowledge base as well as specialist skills. That means we\u2019ll need people to teach subjects such as English language, history and philosophy to prep candidates for future jobs. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A request. Here in the USA, jobs that will continue to be in demand include anything in computer science, data science, allied health care (but not pharmacy\u2026that market is flooded), finance and financial planning. The allied health professions: Occupational Therapy (OT), Physical Therapy (PT), nursing, nurses aids and nutritionists, physician assistants, physiologists and psychologists will continue to be needed due to the aging of the baby boom generation. As the body ages, there are more and more needs for medical interventions on joints that break or get worn out which will always require rehabilitation medical interventions (OT and PT). As the body ages, the probability of at least one chronic condition such as elevated blood pressure and type II diabetes increases, resulting in more nursing staff, nurse practitioners, nutritionists, etc. More nursing homes will probably be needed for this same reason. Thus the need for social workers who specialize in geriatrics will also probably spike. ",
