            "answer_text": "There are many problems you will face while using a computer, but all are fixable easily. And that is depend about how you handle the problem some people just scare of trying to fix it and they stuck, and others think they are not smart enough or have the knowledge to fix it!, i can count hundreds of problems (Hardware/Software) but it will be a waste of time because if you are using a computer chances are you have faced 90% of them at least. But if you haven\u2019t used a computer before my two advises to you: Don\u2019t be scared of trying and discovering in your computer or fixing the problems, and don\u2019t ask the help of expert unless your computer is not working probably or stopped working at all.You don\u2019t need to study everything about computer before start using it, you should only know what you need to know and within time you will be amazed how is that going to make you very good at using computer.",
