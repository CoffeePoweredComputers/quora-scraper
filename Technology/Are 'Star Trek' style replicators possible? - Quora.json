Which is essentially assembling a meal from a variety of flavoured pastes. The selection is naturally limited and requires storage tanks for the ingredients. A real Star Trek style replicator kind of works by the same principle just at a molecular level. Energy is converted to mass and a \u201cprotein resequencing\u201d machanism transforms it into a facsimile of the desired food item that is structurally similar enough to provide nutrients and an enjoyable eating experience. One could imagine a device similar to the Tokamak fusion reactors, using magnetic confinement beams, guiding and holding particles in places until they coalesce. It likely needs to shrink quite a bit to be useful though.  Fusion machines | Searching for the perfect shape Creating a net loss fusion reaction isn\u2019t difficult. It\u2019s basically an oversized pressurized microwave oven with magnets. Using the most basic elements and an enormous amount of energy to confine them it could be conceivable to create a large variety of molecules that would chemically react into the correct minerals and proteins as well as the materials that hold the food item. Chemical Synthesis of Proteins. This would require carefully controlled conditions. Each component may need to be isolated into microscopically separated regions so they can react thermally and create the correct colloidal systems. How Molecular Gastronomy Works It would also need a mechanism to remove excess heat non-violently.  E.g. separating glass, straw, olive and Martini. The glass may be much hotter than the boiling point of its contents shortly after creation. Rapid cooling could shatter it. It may be much more feasible to create each component separately. It\u2019s also likely that certain items require gravity to turn off to prevent more fragile structures from collapsing under their own weight before stabilising. Such device would therefore need to be in orbit, at least for certain products. Here's why NASA wants to 3D print human hearts in space Realistically though this is an unlikely future as the energy requirements alone may well exceed those of entire cities. Only to create a dinner plate. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the honest answer would have to be, we don\u2019t sincerely know. I\u2019m no educated scientist (the most complex job I\u2019ve ever done is day labourer), but having been reading about atomic fusion tonight, I\u2019m left speculating about this subject. It\u2019s been said that gold cannot be artificially created, because it takes the might of a supernova to bind all of the larger atomic particles (ie. hydrogen atoms) together. But so far, we do not know everything about strong and weak electromagnetism. And we also do not know everything about the sub-atomic particles which make up hydrogen atoms. I speculate that if a replicator were to exist, it would have to create objects by working on a more refined level of matter than atoms, so therefore in the sub-atomic or even sub-sub-atomic levels of fine- and ultrafine-matter. This is because as soon as you produce a hydrogen atom, it will produce an incredibly strong force of electromagnetism that has to be overcome. So it makes no sense to try and overcome it, when sub-atomic particles exert a far weaker force of electromagnetism. Therefore, I speculate that a replicator would need to make clever use of the weak and strong electromagnetism so as to compel the sub-atomic, or even sub-sub-atomic particles of matter to get drawn in to each other, perhaps simultaneously, so that the impossible-to-over-come gravitational forces can be avoided. Take gold for example. Perhaps instead of trying to fuse 79 hydrogen atoms together, it would be possible to fuse the hydrogen atoms (or even the sub-atomic particles making up hydrogen atoms) themselves together at the right moment, and in the absolutely correct configuration, which enables the gravitational force of repulsion to be avoided entirely. This is saying that, if perhaps the hydrogen atoms themselves are fused together using sub-atomic fusion at the exact right moment and with absolutely precise configuration, the 79 hydrogen atoms will just immediately bond together through their own native electromagnetic force at the very instant of their genesis, because they form up at the exact right moment, where instead of repelling one another, they will suddenly and immediately be drawn in to fuse tightly - requiring absolutely zero outside force, because the strong electromagnetic force created by their genesis will carry the action through. It\u2019s just uneducated speculation of course. But it\u2019s a fun thought experiment, I think so. Consider that if you first put hydrogen atoms together, the moment you create a hydrogen atom, it will have an incredibly strong magnetism. So if you try to press 79 already created hydrogen atoms together, you need the strength and force of a supernova to slam them together and make them fuse together. But that\u2019s only because hydrogen atoms so strongly, strongly repel each other, because once a hydrogen atom is created, it generates its own incredibly strong elecrtomagnetic force-field, which repels all the hydrogen atoms around it. Simply because while all 79 hydrogen atoms repel with their strong force-field, to press them all in together requires an unfathomable great amount of might - the might of a supernova. HOWEVER, in the realm of matter much tinier than atoms, sub-atomic particles express a far, far weaker gravitational force on one another, because they are vastly smaller. This is because sub-atomic particles are vastly smaller, and so none have their own force-field that is as strong as that of a single hydrogen atom. They can therefore get much closer to each other without requiring a lot of might, because they repel each other with much weaker force. So I speculate that a replicator may be able to work if, instead of trying to build atoms first, and then as the second step attempting to fuse those atoms together to create matter, the sub-atomic particles are controlled in such a way where they begin to flow into the final formation of the desired object already, even before a single hydrogen atom has been formed. Then, I speculate that if everything begins to bond and fuse together at the exact right moment, the gigantic force of atoms repelling each other will be overcome and avoided completely, because the weaker electromagnetic force will be changed into a strong electromagnetic force at the exact right moment, causing the hydrogen atoms to instead fuse themselves instantly together, instead of forcing themselves apart. This is all just uneducated speculation again, and at the present time, to compute the configuration of every last sub-atomic and sub-sub-atomic particles to the extent where they can guided into formation without a single actual hydrogen atom forming until everything is ready to fuse together perfectly, could possibly require an entire stadium of ultra-super computers. It would probably also be valuable to colonise the moon first, because conducting such precise and exacting experiments is probably quite dangerous, since who knows? A single slip could trigger an atomic explosion. Not that I know one way or the other, I\u2019m not a scientist. But I speculate that there IS a theoretical basis on which replicators can indeed work. I suppose it would just require computational power which vastly, vastly succeeds our fastest ultra-super computers, as well as requiring much more advanced particle accelerators. Thanks for reading and if you found to be an interesting thought experiment, please give an upvote :-) ",

            "answer_text": "The major problem with \u201creplicators\u201d is that you require the same atoms in their correct number and ratio with each other to create the foundational materials of the item, and then require the energy to actually put them together into the form that is desired. And in many cases the energy input required to make something form into a certain form is not the biggest issue, it is that a certain thermodynamic state and the transitions to other states must be created as well. So for instance, it may very well be possible to lets say create a robot to grab carbon atoms from the surrounding area and therefore get enough \u201catomic basic material\u201d to create a diamond, but you now need the correct temperature, pressure, and time scales to create that diamond. Outside of some basically magic methods, there is no physical way to think of a replicator a la Star Trek as really being possible in any feasible way within our lifetimes, because of the requirements of time, energy, and mass to replicate even the most simple items.

            "answer_text": "An interesting suggested way to do this is with quantum entanglement, entangling all the particles in your body with particles in another location. Of course, you first have to identify all the particles in your body, and a bunch of other very difficult / potentially impossible things. Anyway, it's an interesting idea. Check-out the video below (skip to Chapter 5, the Future of Travel):http://video.pbs.org/video/2167398185 And an interview with Brian Greene where he nicely summarizes:  Q: A lot of people probably feel as if they already know these characters pretty well. Can you explain what it is that they may not know? Greene: One thing has to do with so-called quantum entanglement. This is an idea that actually goes back to Einstein, which in its modern description shows that even though two particles may be very far apart in space, they don\u2019t necessarily operate independently, autonomously. Both the theory and experiments have shown that observations done on one particle can be instantaneously correlated with the properties of another particle that may be thousands or millions of miles away \u2014 a very strange kind of entanglement through space that arises from quantum effects. In a nutshell, even though two things are separate in space, they\u2019re not necessarily separate. Q: When you talk about quantum entanglement and teleportation, people might think immediately of the realm of \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Greene: Sure. The most amazing element of \u201cStar Trek\u201d is the transporter, I think: the ability to \u201cbeam\u201d a person or an object from one place to another. Certainly we cannot do that today. But using quantum entanglement, researchers have successfully beamed, if you will, a particle from one place to another. Now, doing that for a particle is a far cry from doing it for a human being. But it is the first baby step in that direction. That is very exciting. ",

The guy was hospitalized in a type of limbo state neither here nor there. The equipment needed to stabilise him had to generate frequencies for up to 93 elements. The same would be true for a replicator. It would be much better if they were able to integrate the mind into the workings of the device. The electronics for the imagery and orm etc, already exists there. But somebody probably mess it up and get the shape of the food or containers wrong.

Do your research and be smart before writing (like TNG writers did) to avoid contradictions and stupidness. As long as you do that, you can present just about any tech on the screen and millions of kids will grow up thinking about those technologies in the back of their head, and then invent them. Happens every time. Computers are so VASTLY important and likely the MOST IMPORTANT technology humans have ever and will ever invent. We need computers to do just about anything magic. Now that we have them, magic is becoming VERY VERY real. Turns out, in order to be a magician, you have to learn how stuff works. But did we really think otherwise? Of course not. It takes a long time to get computers to not suck. We think we are already there, but in reality, computers suck a LOT still. They are nowhere near where they are headed and will be literally millions and billions of times more powerful soon enough. Which means, we are still in the dark ages of computing, relatively speaking. But computers enable all kinds of zany things that are impossible without them, like stealth planes that shouldn\u2019t be able to fly, but because of computers can due to constantly readjusting themselves at a millisecond-order scale to keep from falling out of the sky. That\u2019s amazing. And it\u2019s just the beginning. The level of miniaturization we have achieved with computer chips already is incredible and it\u2019s only going to get better. We are hitting physical limits right now of course, and this requires us to change our tech, which we are in fact doing. But nothing else in any other industry really comes close to the breadth and depth of sophistication in miniaturizing that computers have. That makes sense. It\u2019s like we are focusing on figuring out computers so that we can then do whatever we want. If we can make an F17 plane fly using computers from the late 70s, we can definitely get the point where Quantum computers are building us nanoscale electrified lattices to steer atoms into position.

I don\u2019t recall anything that describes how replicators actually work,but I imagine they would work in a manner similar to von Neumann self replicating probes: Self-replicating machine - Wikipedia ,that would use locally sourced raw materials to reproduce themselves. So,given some hydrogen,carbon and oxygen,a replicator could assemble some bacon and eggs. So the idea of actual replicators is not outside the realm of possibility. What I do find as almost certainly impossible is the concept of the transporter,which I believe will never be seen in the real world,especially as depicted in Star Trek. ",

Similar to the water bottle that attempted to get kick-started recently that \"makes water from air\". Sure, over 30 or 60 days the physics it uses will collect enough water for a sip or two but there isn't masses of the base atoms simply floating around to turn into tangible amounts of food from thin air so to speak. 3d printed food is already here but again, that's not a materializing of matter from nearby elements. It exists in science fiction for now but perhaps one day we can click the button on the top of a jug of slime and pour out milk or juice or water from the same source materials, I simply doubt the process as StarTrek describes it as being a plausibility worthy of confidence.
