            "answer_text": "A firewall monitors the incoming and the outgoing traffic of a computer or network and filters the traffic based on some predefined rules. The firewall rules are set by an administrator. For example, a firewall can filter traffic based on source IP address, port number, certain protocols used, etc. A web application firewall can also filter traffic based on which application protocol is used.
