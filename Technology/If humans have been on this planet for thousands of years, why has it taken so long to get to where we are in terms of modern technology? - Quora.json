            "answer_text": "I can relate to what you've meant by \"modern technology\", though technology have always been there through the ages. Please bear with me if the answer goes a bit lengthy, but I'll try to be as brief in elaborating the human history. Advancement in technology has never been stopped at any point of time, but has seen lots of hindrances that slows down its development. Technology doesn't just bloomup at a single point of time, but it builds itself over the pre-existing technologies. Why did primitive man remain primitive for such a long period of time? Though modern humans evolved two lakh years ago, it took them almost till 60000 years back to completely eliminate the neanderthals, or other forms of homninis for that matter. Primitive man never had a permanent settlement. Their technology was very minimal, such as the weapons made out of twigs and branches, invention of fire etc... But that didn't really differentiate him from animals. Permanent settlement will provide meaningful permanent technology.No substantial increase in population as they get killed by animals or other humans.No distinct language.No requirement of writing. Permanent settlement will require the necessity of passing on the information to the future generations.Thus acquired knowledge and technology died then and there.Men began to differentiate himself from other animals only when he began to produce. Production is the most substantial step towards development in human's history. Know these following two important terms. Means of production -( land, technology, raw materials, human labour etc)Forces of production - (tends to relate with their property relations, i.e- primitive communism, slavery, serfdom, capitalism, communism, etc..)The dialectical relationship between the above two, influences almost every aspect of humans life, social institutions like religion, political ideologies, humans ideology etc. For instance, the primitive man (70000-64000 years ago) never had any substantiate technology. They were nomads who ate from trees wherever they find. No big social setup, no inequality, no male-female inequality and the Forces to production was Primitive communism here. But when he began to settle down permanently on lands to carry out settled agriculture, that's when men began to dominate fellow men to work on their lands. Slavery was born. Slaves need to be coerced to work, they are forced to serve. Several centuries later, with the technological advancements, these slaves were expected to have some interest to learn them. Will you have interest if you are coerced? No, right! So this slavery was changed to serfdom. Serfs were given little freedom than slaves. They can now have their own families, landlords gave a little land to the serfs for their own production, kind of incentives were provided. Producers now formed guild (associations) were they could sell by themselves and take care of their needs. But with the rise of merchants (middlemen who stood between the producers and market), guild system slowly began to fail. And with several historic factors like the discovery of route to south-asia, discovery of America, failure of crusades etc,.. gave birth to Captitalism. Capitalism as far as now, is the king of technological advancements. Though it had lots & lots of negative impacts on society, it also had positive impact on technological innovations. But why did i tell all these stories of human history of production? Because, according to marx the means of production and the forces of production are the two very aspects that influence all the social ideas, be it Religion, politics, education, human thinking etc. I would say, religion is the most important aspect that structured the society. Religion Religion has been through several forms and structures through human history. Religion and politics has been hand in hand throughout history. Religious leaders were also the political leaders, and religious beliefs is what framed the education, social stratification etc. According to august comte, theological ideas has been the human ideas ever since. Initial religions were fetishism (includes naturism, animism, totemism, etc..), then came polytheism (belief in several gods), then monotheism (single god belief), then metaphysical thinking which has been platform for reasoning and increase in secularism, which opened many hurdles for scientific thinking. Religion has controlled any free thinking and people who were open minded or spoke up against the religion were always executed and burnt in the name of god. You can find such instances happened even before the birth of Jesus, even in Greeks which happened to be the place of initial intellectual development. Religion controlled state, thus education, superstitions limited human thinking and thus technological development. But Religion was also responsible for advanced technological development! - You can find this in the famous book by Max weber - \u201cThe protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism\u201d with the reformation and the birth & rise of Protestatism, where martin Luther's belief on 'beruf' - calling and calvinist beliefs of 'predestination' made several countries to convert to Protestatism. And these beliefs made them work and work so much on the occupation, in the name of god, which was the most important factor responsible for the rise in capitalism. Capitalism gave way for increase in technological advancement in very short span of time. Thousands and thousands of industries bloomed up, goods were produced in extremely large amount, researches were made to improve technologies so as to compete with the fellow competitors. It was not the people who really were interested in developing new technologies, but it was the capitalistic system that demanded improvement in existing technologies, so as to sustain in the Market. Thats how we get so advanced computers, mobile phones, satellite technologies, superfast cars, and everyother technology developing every minute in the present day. ",

            "answer_text": "Well for most of the history of Earth, the only way to pass on knowledge from generation to generation was through memorization and oral learning. This system of knowledge transference severely limited how sophisticated a society could get. There is only so much knowledge you can pass along from memory and when somebody dies that possessed a lot of knowledge, often times society would lose a lot of the knowledge in the field of study that person created. The second reason why society has taken so long to technologically progress is because for most of human existence, we lacked the scientific method. This was horrible because for most of existence we had no formalized and official way of making sure knowledge was legitimate or not legitimate. As a result, most of the\u201cknowledge\u201d we gained was debatable and banished to the realm of philosophy were people merely speculated over the nature of fields such as cosmology or psychology. The second problem was that people were highly individualistic with their knowledge. They thought that if the knowledge they gained was shared with the world, then they'd surrender their economic advantage against other people they were competing against. Religious authority and dogma reigned supreme over rationality and critical thinking as well. If you did anything which dared questioned religions teachings or practices, then you'd be forced to destroy your discoveries or be killed. It was very easy for dogma to be cemented into the fabric of society since we lacked institutions and practices to fight and combat dogma. As a result, you had the teachings of Aristotle and Plato taught for thousands of years without anybody succeeding in overthrowing the mass acceptance of the premises or hypothesis\u2019s they brought to the world. The enlightenment ended up changing all of this by creating constitutional law which enabled people to pursue and question any types of knowledge that society dogmatically clung to either through political or religious means. The enlightenment also led to the creation of public schools, and the mass production of books. This combination of reforms brought to the world by the enlightenment is why the past 400 years has seen accelerating rates of innovation. People for the first time could educate themselves through mass literacy and public education, and then apply that knowledge in all facets of life. Mass literacy and publishing is why that progress has continued forward uninterrupted until the present. Despite the death of geniuses or the destruction of ways of life via war, the knowledge which society and individuals have accumulated is now always preserved through mediums such as books (and more recently now the internet). Finally the enlightenment also brought about the scientific method and devised a system of knowledge built around the principles of sharing knowledge. Scientist and epistemologist now had an official way of proving their hypothesis, preventing bias from plaguing their results, and a way to build off the work of others. This allowed for the creation of thousands of fields of study, and the improvement of countless more which continue to benefit society to this very day. ",
