            "answer_text": "There is no way to answer your question without knowing what the nature of your business may be and what the investment options are. Generally speaking, if your business is profitable, and generates cash flow, you are better off leasing capital equipment. This preserves your capital, provides an expense you can write off, and allows you to pay for only the depreciation of the equipment as you finish your lease. Should your business change in the future, you can upgrade to newer, faster, or entirely different equipment. Should you lease, be cautious of the lease terms you agree to. There are many different types of leases. Educate yourself first. Many firms do not want to own the equipment - that is really an installment purchase and not a lease at all. Be cautious of what you agree to. There is a filing called UCC-1 that specifies the collateral of a lease. Some leasing companies collateralize not just the equipment, but everything in the business including receivables. A lease is a great financial tool for firms who use equipment, but the terms can be deadly and limit your ability to efficiently run your business. That is only one of may possible pitfalls of leasing. Like everything in business, the devil is in the details. ",

            "answer_text": "As someone else said, it really does depend on your type of business. Without knowing, my advice is this. Invest into profitability multipliers. If you have a sales division, and sales is your path to profit, take a portion to invest into hardware/software, computers if that\u2019s your sales departments weapon of choice, and invest the balance in more sales people, or a combo of more sales people and advanced sales training for your sales force. Your profitability multiplier may be different, but the concept is the same. If your wife is doing your books, and she\u2019s great at sales or new product development, and she\u2019s billing, take that money and invest in a bookkeeper so your wife can do what she\u2019s good at that increases profitability. Sometimes, we as owners, are doing the job of a receptionist. When we do that and we are great at something, it costs you twice as your time as a receptionist is worth a lot less than your time selling, if that\u2019s your strength. In this case, finding the things you do that are more cheaply done by someone else can be a way to spend money to increase your profitability. Please don\u2019t spend money on new Macs if there\u2019s no good reason for it. ",
