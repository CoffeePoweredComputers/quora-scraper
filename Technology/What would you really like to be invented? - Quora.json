            "answer_text": "Body modification. Specifically, preventing the effects of aging and staying youthful, as well as being able to regenerate at a cellular level from physical injuries. A way to achieve immortality is probably better off not being invented because someday the universe itself will end and you don't wanna be there when it happens (or do you\u2026? Well, most people don't) If we could only regenerate\u2026well not everyone, it should be a luxury for the unfortunate and the rich only. It should be for people who lose limbs or organs in an accident, or for the rich who can afford such an amazing, innovative technology. The body is too fragile. As I type, I'm walking up the stairs. If I fall, I risk hitting my head and dying. What the fuck? I'm not dealing with that shit. The body is too vulnerable and it's annoying. I'm counting on some crazy genius out there to find a way for us to be able to regenerate. Naturally, the effects of aging are not desirable, so I don't like them. I often go to the skatepark to skate (duh) and I see people as I go, because it's near a neighborhood. There's so many old people, frail, fragile, weak, hardly able to walk, watching me skate down the street. Their lives are pretty much over, and they're physically incapable of exploring the world and having fun. It hurts me. They have a conscience. Don't they want to skate, or skydive, or ride a bike, or simply..run? Age takes away your young appearance, your healthy lifestyle, your hobbies, your memory, your sight, your hearing, and most importantly, it takes you away from your family. I've lost my great grandmother like this. I hadn't seen her since I was a child, and now being an early teen, I never got to speak to her again. An old fossil like her who was nearly 100 years old, who knows how long it had been since she could enjoy a good jog in a park. I think I've made my point. The human body is weak, vulnerable, and it's best weapon is the brain. Only the brain can hope to accomplish a way to make up for how weak our bodies are. I am confident someone will invent this kind of technology before I grow senile as an elder. Aging is nature's greatest curse. As we've done before with so many obstacles, we will overcome this one eventually too. ",

Uses: Prequalified and assesses you when: applying for a driving licence;purchasing firearms;profession entry;job interview;working with children approval;marriage;But most especially for: Qualifying when nominating and running for election to high office (PM, POTUS, Gov, Mayor);Qualifying for nomination to the bench of a court;Qualifying when voting in elections for the above;Standing down someone in high office at the point when they\u2019ve taken enough questionable steps in office;Recognising people got rewards and awards - especially those who work in the quiet for the benefit of the unsupported.Note, this wouldn\u2019t be a tool to screen out someone with strong political or particular religious beliefs except as they interfere with reasonable execution of decision making ability and fairness. e.g. You could be elected to run as mayor and when successful find yourself excluded from a vote on a city project because of a potential conflict of interest (youR Close nephew is bidding on that contract).You could be a senator but excluded from voting on an abortion bill because your religious practices are in contrast to the will of your electorate.You could be POTUS but if:publishing nasty tweets about people, that were unsubstantiated, oryou don\u2019t fund the promises you made in the election, oryou put up too many judicial nominations or appointments from one side of politics,your communications become nonsense,your people are dying in record numbers and you attack those who question that\u2026you\u2019d find your \u201cFit and Proper\u201c rating drop to a point where you\u2019d be escorted off the premises and receive a DCM. Similarly, if you don\u2019t know enough about the world from a variety of News services and sources, you should not have the right to vote for people into powerful office.

The dart guns we use for wildlife won\u2019t do, because the dart sometimes bounces off, they\u2019re dose-critical, and they take a couple of minutes to knock the target out. But there are already sleeping drugs on which it\u2019s almost impossible to overdose - the more you take the longer you sleep, but you don\u2019t die - so it just needs faster action and a reliable delivery system.

You hand write whatever you know about the item on a sticky note attached to it. When it\u2019s full you carry it to the curb and It summons a truck that injects the box with foam for transport, then picks it up and takes it to a warehouse. Everything is photographed in very high resolution from many angles by a robot. Then each item is listed online with the photos and your sticky note, for a fixed price, and the price goes down every day. At the end of one year, everything unsold is donated to a charity. You get either the selling price less a commission, or a tax receipt for the donation. The starting price is on the box you put things in. There are $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1000 boxes. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Which invention do you wish you had invented? Answer: Drop Ceilings (with the patent). That guy changed business interior design and made sooo much money. More interesting question: If you could finish developing one technology and/or invention that is currently under develop, what would it be. You get credit for its discovery, you may or may not get the patent and the attached royalties. Answer: With this more interesting question, I would be torn between cellular printers (large 3-D printers that work with custom grown cells to create genetically identical replacement parts for humans) or Entangled Particle cards. Cellular printers would allow any part of a person (with the notable exception of the Brain) to be reprinted with their own cells and then reattached/replaced through surgery. Hopefully, our understanding of neurology would also continue, but if it didn\u2019t, we would still be able to replace most major organ failures and accident induced loses with no need for donors or anti-rejection drugs. With Entangled Particle cards, we would could create trillions of cards the size of micro-SD cards with thin sheets of Entangled Particles where there are hundreds/thousands of pairs and one half of each pair is on one card and the other half of each pair is on the other card. Then, one card is given to a telecommunications company and the other goes into your phone/computer/etc. Entangled Particles utilized Einstein\u2019s \u201cSpooky action\u201d, with both particles of a pair of Entangled Particles behaving as it they were next to each other regardless of the distance. Using this technology in this manner, communication between the device and the telecommunications service is nearly instantaneous with no issues caused by \u2018power lines\u2019, \u2018distance from the nearest cell tower\u2019, \u2018being in a tunnel or large building\u2019, etc. Instantaneous and clear. You can maintain a large server / server farm and everyone who is on the same server would also have nearly perfect communication. Put all of the server farms for all of the large telecoms in the same basic area and it won\u2019t be long before they are all connected with state of the art communication lines that add only milliseconds to any data transfer. Transform some of the servers from mere telecom servers to computational servers and phones/laptops/tablets could suddenly behave as if they were super-computers (reducing what needs to be onboard to the minimum and using the servers chips as their own.) This would allow companies to build tiny, handheld medical devices that use the processing power of the corporations\u2019 giant server/computer half a world away. Medical costs would drop through-out the world. Tablet and phone prices would drop. Data transfers would be done at bus speeds, not wireless. Phones could be small and carried by everyone, while working in cities or remote areas (making it much easier to find people who get abandoned/lost/kidnapped). Communications would still be nearly instantaneous, even when talking to people on Mars or another solar system. It would redefine how we treat computers/software. ",

To a paint restorative, rust remover, graphics glue remover. To travelling at the speed of light, this is the 6th one. The problem with the 6th was plausibility. We both agreed it sounded plausible, but how to prove that on earth without talking to others and losing protection of the initial concept. The Holodeck experience was deemed to be fairly easy to patent compared to the one above. Today I was in our local major hospital and it reminded me of one of my older ideas. Very useful in this scenario as it would be in any hotel, office block or block of flats. One I didn\u2019t have in the list of 6. I think the one I\u2019d most like to bring to fruition is the ability to travel at the speed of light. Obvious why. My many other ideas will fund this at some point if nobody else does. ",

It could have done with some improvements though. Various ingredients that are used in firework displays. It really was lacking in colour. Now if you had orange, green, red and yellow in the mix it would be a whole different ball game. It would have made setting them off much more acceptable. Indeed I can just imagine people gathering around their television sets eagerly waiting for the big show. Sounds ridiculous? Not a bit. ",

As it is now, these two light gases diffuse quite rapidly through anything - including steel ! So, it\u2019s not possible to have a lighter-than-air balloon permanently up above the Earth for surveillance, exploration or cell phone signal transmission. There are some thick films that resist hydrogen diffusion, but they are too stiff, heavy and brittle for balloon use. Some day, somebody will crack this problem. ",
