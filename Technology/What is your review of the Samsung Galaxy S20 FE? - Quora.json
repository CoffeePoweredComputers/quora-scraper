            "answer_text": "Samsung S20 FE is an attempt made by Samsung to compete with the iPhone 11 and other smartphones in the $700 category. Flagships have become more expensive than ever before, and hence, smartphones at this price make more sense than ever. Moreover, this category of smartphones (high-end mid-range devices) is flourishing more than ever, thus leading to an increase in the competition. Hence, the question is, did Samsung make the cut? Design  Image Source: Android Headlines The S20 FE has a polycarbonate back, which has its own set of advantages and disadvantages over glass. Samsung calls this material \u2018Glastic\u2019, which basically means that this looks like glass, but feels like, and is, plastic. Thankfully, there is no camera bump! Flipping the phone around, you are greeted by an edge to edge display. The bezels are not as thin as Samsung\u2019s own flagships, but are still fairly thin. This is a flat panel though, which, yet again, has its own set of advantages and disadvantages over curved screens. Samsung opted for a punch hole to house the cameras, which sit at the top centre of the screen. Thankfully, the punch hole is one of the smallest I have ever seen on a smartphone. One cool thing about this smartphone is that it is available in a plethora of colours (Cloud Red, Cloud Orange, Cloud Lavender, Cloud Mint, Cloud Navy and Cloud White; damn, that\u2019s a lot!). Overall, I am impressed by the design, but there is scope for improvement here. The phone is IP68 water and dust resistant (go and take it in a swimming pool with you! Just don\u2019t let it stay in there for more than 30 minutes :P), and it is nice on Samsung\u2019s part to provide a screen protector at no additional cost. Display  Image Source: Samsung Ok! I am tired of saying this again and again, but I\u2019ll repeat this one more time: Samsung makes some of the best panels in the world, and the S20 FE is no exception. The S20 FE comes with a 6.55 inch Super AMOLED display. And, just like any other Samsung display, this one is super accurate, bright, has brilliant colour reproduction, etc. However, the headline feature of this display is definitely that it can refresh at 120Hz! High refresh rate displays are a game-changer. Everything from scrolling to response feels smoother. Trust me, if you start using 120Hz, using 60Hz again would become extremely difficult. This is a Full HD+ display, though. However, that does not disappoint me as you are allowed to use 120Hz with Full HD+ resolution on the flagships of Samsung as well. This is probably the best display you can get at this price, period. Performance  Image Source: The Verge The S20 FE uses the same chipsets that powered the S20 series. This means that you can either get Snapdragon 865, or Exynos 990, depending on the model you buy, and depending on your region. Now, I won\u2019t go into the disparity between the two processors (it\u2019s a long story). However, I can ensure that both the chipsets provide flagship performance, and at the end of the day (if you\u2019re not a power user of course!), that\u2019s all that matters. The smartphone comes with 6GB LPDDR5 RAM though, which is a bummer as at this price, Samsung is expected to give at least 8GB RAM. Thankfully, we get the UFS 3.0 storage, which makes the whole smartphone pretty fast. In a nutshell, this phone would be able to handle anything you throw at it. Cameras and Battery  Image Source: Android Authority The camera setup on the S20 FE is extremely similar to the S20. The phone has a triple rear camera setup, which includes a 12MP Ultra Wide lens, 12MP Wide angle lens (also called the main camera), and an 8MP telephoto lens. Thankfully, this camera system is good enough to compete with the iPhone 11, which has some of the best cameras at this price. Initially, I was skeptical about this camera system, but I am so damn happy I was wrong! The photos from this smartphone are pretty vivid, have pretty good dynamic range, and color accuracy (all this is based on the photos I have seen from this smartphone, I myself haven\u2019t tried this camera yet!). The telephoto lens is capable of 3x digital zoom, and 30x times optical zoom, which is more than enough for most of the users (I don\u2019t think you might want to click photos ob objects that are hundreds of meters away from you after all!). This does not have support for 8K video recording, but, once again, a lot of you are not gonna miss it. The front camera has a resolution of 32MP and clicks fairly good photos. From what I could see from the images, photos in low lighting conditions were passable too. Samsung seems to have improved its camera software. As for the battery, it is powered by a 4500 mAh cell, which is huge enough to let it last the whole day on moderate usage. The phone supports 25W fast charging, but it\u2019s a shame that Samsung just provides a 15W charger inside the box, as the competition is reaching speeds of 65W. Thankfully, we do have support for 15W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, which does reduce the negative impact of just getting a 15W charger. All the little extra stuff  Image Source: Samsung The phone comes with 128 GB of base storage, which can be upgraded to 256 GB of storage. Moreover, there is support for microSD card here, which makes it possible to upgrade storage, without shelling out a lot of money. The phone also supports Wi-Fi 6. There is support for 5G if you buy the Snapdragon 865 model (available in a few regions only), but thanks to the limited range and availability of 5G, this feature might not be a deciding factor for a lot of users. The phone has also got dual stereo speakers, which sound good enough (I don\u2019t know a lot about speakers). And lastly, you get an in-display optical fingerprint scanner. Final Thoughts The conclusion of this review is pretty hard to give right now. This smartphone, at $699 ($599 if you buy the Exynos 990 variant), provides a lot of seriously impressive features like a 120Hz display, a pretty good battery life, brilliant performance, good cameras, and more. However, in regions like India, this smartphone might be priced at around Rs. 50,000, the same price at which you could buy some Chinese flagship smartphones. Even in other regions, we\u2019ll need to wait for smartphones like the iPhone 12 Max, Google Pixel 5 (it was released yesterday), and the OnePlus 8T, before giving the final verdict. If you can wait for some time, check the new iPhones and OnePlus 8T out before making a decision (you can ask for my help). However, if you want a smartphone urgently, and can spend only $700, this smartphone is a pretty solid choice, and won\u2019t disappoint you. I hope you liked my answer! Do tell me what you think about the new S20 FE and whether it\u2019s a good choice at $700, in the comments section. By the way, FE stands for Fan Edition, and I don\u2019t have a clue why Samsung even used FE for this smartphone (it reminds me of the infamous Note7!). Take care! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there! No, I don\u2019t think that S20 FE is a worthy buy. If we assume that it launches at 55k INR, then it is definitely expensive. For that price, you can buy OnePlus 8 Pro which offers way better features then Samsung. Reasons: Display- Nothing special with 6.5\u2033 flat 120Hz FHD+ Super Amoled Display. At that price you can have Mi 10 with the same specs with a curved screen but with 90Hz refresh rate. OnePlus leads with 6.78\u2033 Curved WQHD+ 120Hz Fluid Amoled Display.Performance- I fell like imprisoning Samsung. Exynos 990 4G is the worst flagship processor. You easily get Snapdragon 865 or even Snapdragon 865+ and that too with 5G as well.Battery- Battery capacity is good at 4500mAh battery, with 25W charging, slower wireless charging and wireless powershare as well. All of this is also available in Mi 10 and OnePlus 8 pro. They even have Superfast wireless charging at 30 Watts.Camera- It has a versatile camera setup, which is the same as Galaxy S10 from 2019. I haven\u2019t seen much photos yet, but it should take good photos. OnePlus and Mi have 48 and 108MP sensors respectively, which should be comparable to Samsung.Build- Samsung is known to give the not so premium glastic back on its less expensive phones. On the other hand OnePlus and Mi provide Glass Back with Gorilla Glass protection as well. So Samsung\u2019s build quality makes no sense.Other features like stereo speakers, IP68 water resistance, in display fingerprint scanner etc are common to OnePLus and Xiaomi as well. (Xiaomi doesn\u2019t have IP68 water and dust resistance.) As you see, Samsung S20 FE doesn\u2019t make much sense. So go with it if you are a die hard Samsung fan or have fallen in love with S20 FE\u2019s colours. If you read this far, then thank you for your patience. Thanks Again! ",
