            "answer_text": "Well I don't really think that Artificial Intelligence is ever going to impact any jobs. Why ? Well, it is primarily because of 2 things, The skill set in this field, in India, is the one based on online courses, which is not enough to get a job in this field. Adding to it, the number of masters and PhD students are less. In order to automate the daily manual tasks you need to hire candidates who have good grasp of the algorithms and the MATHS behind it.Secondly, even if an organisation outsource AI based system, it would still require some kind of manual monitoring because of the False negative and False positives that comes free with these systems. For monitoring, the organisation would want to hire candidates with good proficiency in AI or computer programming.",
