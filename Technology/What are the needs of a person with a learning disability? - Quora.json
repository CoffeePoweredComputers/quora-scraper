            "answer_text": "It really all depends on what type of learning disability the person has what his or her individual needs are. These can be addressed in an IEP. For myself, I always had help through 2 wonderful teachers in the resource room all through school. If I didn\u2019t understand an assignment, they could help. I also was allowed extra time on my tests including state-mandated ones and I could have them read to me if I wanted to. I could also use a calculator on any of my math tests once I got to 7th grade. For my daughter, she\u2019s gotten a ride to school on the bus since Kindergarten - she\u2019s now 15 and will be in 10th grade in September. She also can use a calculator on her math tests, have them read to her, and gets extra time on her tests in a room with minimal distractions. I suspect that all of these accommodations on her IEP will stay in effect until she turns 18 and graduates from high school. ",

There are so many different disabilities that the needs are just as varied. It can be as simple as inserting a worksheet or book under a yellow transparent sheet to help eyesight problems or as complicated as apparatus similar to that used by Steven Hawking. ",
