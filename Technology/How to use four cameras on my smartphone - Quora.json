            "answer_text": "By Simply adding more lenses in the cellular phones means more variety. With a four-camera setup companies offer a standard lens, a zoom and a wide-angle all wrapped into one. We've already seen such options in the market. Some of these camera phones offer periscope zoom lens, which means we can zoom even further in on the action without loss (or to 10x with hybrid zoom). In addition to its standard and wide-angle lens, the fourth to make up to quad selection is time-of-flight Infrared Optic which means a sonar-like solution, used to capture depth data, a bit like a bat would read its surroundings. That data can then be used in the software to apply background blur while keeping the main subject sharp \u2013 this is what iPad/iPhone calls 'Portrait' mode, basically, and what so many others have delivered even better. Do we need four cameras? The trick to all this is ease of use and design subtlety. We don't think people want to say 'I have more cameras than you', they want the widest capability from their phone. At the moment, it's multiple cameras that achieve that, until some new-fangled technology comes out that can hide away all these. I truly believe that It's not essential to have 4 Camera Phone unless you want true wide-angle and true optical zoom or the utmost quality then it's the best solution right now. ",
