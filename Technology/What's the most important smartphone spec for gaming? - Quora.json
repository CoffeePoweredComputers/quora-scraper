            "answer_text": "There are only three things to consider while determining gaming capability of a smartphone CPU : cpu core count and clock speed is important, the higher, the betterGPU : Diving into the gpu shader core, clock speed might be complicated but if you are buying a phone with a qualcomm SoC inside, then it\u2019s quite easy to understand. The hierarchy goes like this : sd 8xx > sd 6xx > sd 4xx > sd 2xxSo, if you have a phone that has a qualcomm snapdragon 835 SoC inside, it is currently better than every other SoCs in the market and it\u2019s gpu performance is topnotch. Again if you have a phone with snapdragon 625 SoC inside, that is a mid tier SoC and will perform better than the entry level SoCs but won\u2019t outperform 8xx series SoCs.RAM : This is quite simple. The more the RAM the better",

            "answer_text": "As with PC, the most important parts will be CPU, GPU and RAM. Since the design of a smartphone is very compact, almost everything are integrated into a system-on-a-chip (SoC). SoCs are built based on ARM architecture which will be another discussion by itself. For Android, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragons and Samsung\u2019s Exynos are considered as the better performance SoCs. While iPhones have their own A series SoCs.    Snapdragon is good in gaming due to the Adreno GPU processor. Likewise, Exynos and A series have good GPUs. Thus, if best gaming experience is your requirement, go for the smartphones with those SoCs since they are considered the best. Just remember, since they are the best, it means you have to pay more.
