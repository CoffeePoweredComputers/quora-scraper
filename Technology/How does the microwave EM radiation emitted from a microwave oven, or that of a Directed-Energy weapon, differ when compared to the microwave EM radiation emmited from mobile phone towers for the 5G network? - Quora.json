            "answer_text": "It is different. The frequency of the wave, the amplitude of the wave and the power density of the wave and the distance of the wave from the target as well as the antenna size are variables. A greater amplitude (the same frequency) requires more energy to transmit the same distance. To say it\u2019s the energy behind the wave is the factor is not quite correct. It\u2019s the technology behind the wave. And its more dangerously complicated than that. 5G (and most likely a directed energy weapon) is not an ordinary signal. Its a steerable focused beam. 5G is really a phased array radar. So less power is required to transmit the signal. As it is a focused (steerable) beam, it focuses and it pulses the energy, rising and lowering the power density behind the signal, and this is damaging. What a microwave oven is about is instructive. It heats tissue from the inside out with continuous waves. The distance to the source of the wave is determined, and the food turns to cook it evenly, oddly from the inside out, even though it\u2019s in a reflective chamber. A 2G, 3G, 4G cell phone uses a longer wave, and it is pulsed. This wave like the microwave is non-ionizing. It produces heat, but in theory, it does not change the molecular structure of what it hits. However these waves create harm by a different mechanism, such as to genetic material, (birth defects, miscarriages, infertility) destruction of the blood brain barrier, and damage to eyes through heat stress to living tissue. The story for 5G (and probably the directed energy weapon) includes 2G, 3G and 4G wave harm, but more. 5G is millimeter wave radar technology. As such it differs and the simple assessment of power density or the energy of the signal is inadequate. Energy will be broadcast from multiple very small antennas working in phase, spread out in an array. An example is the Pave Paws Radar installation on Cape Cod. It is said to use 145,000 watts to broadcast a signal 3400 miles , north, south and east across the Atlantic, in order to detect sub launched missiles. Pave Paws looks like a pyramid. Its surface is covered with 3,600 antennas arranged in 2 phased arrays of 1,800 antennas each. The steerable beam it forms has the effective power of 4 billion watts, thus giving it a phenomenal trans-Atlantic range. 5G uses Pave Paws technology. The FCC has auctioned 24GHz to 48GHz and may go up to 95GHz for 5G. With 48 GHz short mm waves, an array of 1024 antennas measure only 4\u2033 square. The emission of 10 to 100 watts of power, like Pave Paws will be amplified to emit a very high effective radiated power. FCC rules allow up to 30,000 watts per 100 MHz of spectrum. Like a radar, a millimeter beam reflects off of what it hits and tracks. That is how radar works. 5G is rolled out in order to provide the backbone for The Internet of Things (IoT) as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). It is planned that 5G will track, and connect everything and everybody, as Pave Paws can track multiple warhead incoming ICBMs. 5G will provide extremely large band width with low latency, meaning that it handles massive Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs (MIMO) very fast in order to track the world for IoT, for robotics, AI and so on. Although the USAF denies responsibility for the increased cancers and illness around Pave Paws, there is enough evidence to say that the Pave Paws radar is the smoking gun. The elevated rate is not just a statistical fluke. In a paper written by R. Albanese et al, Armstrong Lab of USAF (1993) entitled \u201cUltrashort Electromagnetic Signals, Biophysical Questions, Safety Issues and Medical Opportunities\u201d he states \u201cUntil the issue of tissue damage mechanisms associated to pulses that cause precursors is fully studied, the authors recommend zero human exposure to such unique precursor and gendering pulses.\u201d He is referring to Brillouin precursors. When extremely short waves strike a body, the moving charge re-radiates in the magnetic field, damaging or changing tissue deeper in body. After the initial pulse passes, another is started causing a cascade of deleterious biologic effects. If 5G does handle the speeds that it advertises that it will handle, this is the situation. This is one reason why over 200 scientists, internationally, are calling for an immediate moratorium on 5G. 5Gappeal.eu To add more complexity to an opaque situation, it is known that a EMF/RF can sometimes have a greater biological impact at 12\u2033 than at 4\u2033. It is also known that sometimes a stronger wave can have less impact than a weaker wave. It is known that a proximate weaker signal can be more harmful than a distant strong signal. The directed energy weapon likely has an optimum range. Maybe the energy must be tweaked to be effective closer or further. How will 5G steerable beams be calibrated as the beams echo around canyons formed by city buildings, bouncing and hitting our children from every direction? It\u2019s doubtful that the beams will be so easily interfered with than anyone passing between the beam and the handset will stop communication. Some writers say that our body does not just possess an electric field, which is our vital force, but further, that our body is an electrical field. Our weather, as revealed by lightning storms, perhaps earth quakes, perhaps meteors, is an electric field. Others would say we live in an electric universe. ",

            "answer_text": "All can be of the same frequency. They would differ in bandwidth and power. The big difference is power. A microwave typically has a 750W to 1kW microwave transmitter. Almost all of that energy is converted to heat to cook the food. Only a tiny amount leaks out of the closed door or other imperfections in the shielding. That leakage is probably measurable in microwatts. I don\u2019t know much about a weaponized microwave pulse. I assume it is extremely short bursts of enormous power. I did have some experience with aircraft radar about 50 years ago. The transmitters and antenna produced extremely short pulses of power that had an instantaneous effective radiated power (ERP) in millions of watts. It was dangerous to stand in front of (prohibited) at close range and I was taught that it could damage internal organs or damage eyesight. With that amount of power we were trained to be very careful when working close to a transmitter. It was considered harmless at hundreds of feet. A weapon would need to have much more powerful pulses. I presume tiny bursts of billions of watts of ERP (perhaps many billions). A 5G device (or tower) establishes communications between the tower and the cell phone, and from the cell phone to the tower. Both ends have relatively broad antennas. The amount of power experienced from the tower to a person standing half a mile away is extremely small. The cell phone has to transmit its signal back to the tower the same distance. The receiving antenna at the tower has considerably more \u201cgain\u201d than the receiving antenna of a cell phone so the phone signal doesn\u2019t have to be as large as the signal emitted from the tower, but the phone is held very close to the person. The intensity of the radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from a transmitting antenna. A person using a cell phone will be exposed to much more radiation from his own phone than a person half a mile from a cell tower walking down the street (as long as no one near him is using a phone that emits radiation). A person in a room with a person using a cell phone is likely exposed to more radiation than that person alone out in the street. The power of a cell phone transmitter is probably measured in a few watts. A cell tower typically has a cluster of transmitters and antennas that each cover a slice of direction in a circle around the antenna. Each transmitter has a significant amount of power compared to the cell phone but it is probably still just a few watts. Other microwave devices like the wifi router or a laptop or notebook are also exposing people 24\u20137 in their homes. The risk of any health effect is considered to be trivial to none. The power of the transmitters in these devices is measured in miliwatts. ",
