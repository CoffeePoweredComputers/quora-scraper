            "answer_text": "Superiority is subjective to why you are using the computer in the first place. To see macs as superior you have to value these things: Aesthetically pleasing design that you wouldn't mind being displayedAll in one package of hardware and software that is supported by a single companyTechnical Support in your languageWilling to pay a premium for well-packaged hardware and components that power creative, professional software and not have to research and purchase a ton of 3rd party internal components (graphics cards, SSD storage, GPU, etc.) that are not supported by the company you bought the computer fromA product in an ecosystem that works with every other Apple productA windows based computer can be one of many computer manufacturers. Windows is just software. If you are into building hardware to your exact specs and willing to purchase many 3rd party components to execute the task you wanted the computer for in the first place, windows based is for you. What is more important for the none techie buyer is the support. Microsoft support is ok if you are just asking about Microsoft software. Anything outside of that, you're on your own. ",

            "answer_text": "For general use yes. Since you specifically mentioned laptops I will interpret that as a question about hardware rather than a macOS vs Windows OS comparison where the former is demonstrably easier to use, more stable and secure but has a more limited range of software titles. Apple laptops design and build quality is second to none, but there are manufacturers of Windows based laptops that are also very good. They are however similarly expensive. If you are in the market for such a machine then ignoring the Apple laptops is folly. What the Windows world of manufacturers offer is choice for many different use cases that Apple just doesn\u2019t serve. Good design is often about making the right compromises and that means there will never be a single device that is superior in all respects to anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "The build quality on Macbooks is really quite nice, but it really is subjective depending on what you want need to do. If you just do standard things with your machine, and you are really on the go a lot, if it\u2019s in your budget, I can\u2019t see a reason to not buy a Macbook Pro, but I only have one compelling reason to have one and that is strictly work related. AppleConnect doesn\u2019t work on Windows, so I can\u2019t connect to the Apple network without one. I have a lot of other reasons why I use my Dell Precision on Windows 10 for everything else. Other than that, it\u2019s just another piece of kit to me. If I was into the graphic arts I might have a different opinion on that one. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. I tend to evaluate laptops based on what hardware their carrying, their battery, keyboard, and cooling. Apple has never done particularly well in any of the metrics I typically look at, usually being a day late and a dollar short when it comes to offering high performance hardware affordably. Their by no means terrible, but I have yet to find an instance where I would consider a Macbook a good daily driver unless your specifically interested in Mac OS or Mac OS related software. ",
