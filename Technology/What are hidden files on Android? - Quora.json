            "answer_text": "Hidden files are basically files with a \u2018.\u2019 before its name. Any file can be made hidden this way. Like for example, a file called 'abcd.mp4\u2032 can be hidden by renaming it as \u2018.abcd.mp4\u2032. However I guess to view these files you have to use better file managers like es file manager. It can also be viewed by connecting the phone to a PC. ES file manager provides a better way to hide files. After encryption is done by ES, the file can only be viewed by decrypting it by ES itself.
