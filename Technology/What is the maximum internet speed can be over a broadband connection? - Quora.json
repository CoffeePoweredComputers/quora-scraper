            "answer_text": "What is the maximum speed of your two wheeler. For example 200km. How long can you go at that speed with out causing an accident on Indian roads. The same is true with internet. I am getting 100 mb. speed which is minimum by my provider. They can give up to 5gb. for more cost. When I want to read a news paper it takes the same time as of 500kb speed. Since their servers can not handle high speed. If you watch you tube you will spend the same time as of 500kb. which is good enough. Only if you down load from you tube, even a 1gb movie takes few seconds. This is my experience. Just like in the computer memory chips, two chips with different speeds, the computer will work basing on the lowest speed. The same is true for internet. The only advantage is if used with WiFi 200 people can watch you tube simultaniously with 100 mb speed connection. Now it is for you to decide. ",

            "answer_text": "My broadband provider give 100 Mbps max speed. That is good for normal use. If you are using FTTH, there is no real limit other than what your ISP can provide, my router can support 1 Gbps (as per manual). There are some ISPs that provider 1 Gbps, never seen anything higher, even if they offer, cost will be higher, also most home users may not have a 10 Gbps network card on their computer/laptop. ",
