            "answer_text": "IMO, it\u2019s is very important that HR departments have the chance to reap the benefits of HR Technology. Here\u2019s where I come up with that: Marketing has a system. Sales has a system. Customer Service has a system \u2026 why shouldn\u2019t your HR department \u2013 or at the very least, the recruiting arm of that department \u2013 have a recruiting system that maximizes their resources?Speaking of maximizing resources \u2026 did you know that 27% of the U.S. employers surveyed said that just one bad hire costs a company more than $50,000? That\u2019s a massive amount of cost for a mistake that recruiting software for the HR department can help you to avoid.Recruiting should be be a part of everyone\u2019s job \u2026 and at Breezy HR we make it easy to dedicate your whole team to recruiting \u2013 so your HR department can do more of what they\u2019re best at, and your team can hire the best people for each role.Something that I hear pretty often when people start wondering if they really need software to help solve their problems is concern over cost. That\u2019s exactly why we make Breezy an easy month-to-month contract, with completely transparent pricing. You can try us for free, see how much your team loves the system, and decide your needs from there \u2026 no pushy salespeople or giant 5-year enterprise contract required ;). One final note \u2026 when you\u2019re thinking about \u201cOk, does the HR department really need it\u2019s own tech?\u201d check out what independent reviewers are saying about the cost for the value of Breezy HR\u2019s recruiting software:  Those kinda reviews speak for themselves, right? :) Hope I\u2019ve convinced you to give HR Tech a try \u2026 bet you\u2019ll love the mistake avoidance, time savings, and more you get from it.

            "answer_text": "HR Department is supposed to be interacting with people all the time to understand the emotions and help them use their capabilities for Self and Organisational Development. We noticed that many of the HR professionals are very very busy in day-to-day operations and do not have time for actual work. There is more than 80% of the time is consumed by the operational issues. If HR Department has to be relevant to Business and its people its important to focus on elimating operational aspects using Technology. Technology can play a great role in minimizing the time in operations and maximising efforts on People related interactions. HR Cloud is important to take care of HR Records, Employee Leave Management, Payroll Management, Employee Self Service, Mobile based HR application for employee and manager to operate. This would ease the pressure on HR Department. No technology in HR, No role of HR in future. REgards, GR Reddy HR Automation for your Company! - ApHusys.com ",
