            "answer_text": "At first I was super skeptical about shifting ISP\u2019s because I was satisfied with what Airtel used to offer (40 Mbps Down/ 8 Mbps Upload). Was okay with the download speed but that upload speed was pathetic, after being a customer for 6 years I decided to move on and explore better options in my area. Booked an appointment online, representative came the next day to verify the details and advance payment (everything digitally). Few hours the installation guys came and installed everything within an hour. My main purpose was to get a new internet connection and I didn\u2019t pay attention to the bundle that comes with it: 4K Set Top Box with OTT Apps. Internet Plan that I subscribed to was a Gold Plan which cost me around Rs. 1299 + GST per month, giving 250 Mbps Download and 25 Mbps Upload with 1250 GB Data per month. Jio Router supports dual bands - 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz. The guy installing told me that 2.4 Ghz will give you good range but slower speed, while 5 Ghz will give you good speed but range will be less - this was when we were deciding where to install it. Check the screenshot below that I took when I got my connection  Was happy with that download speed but upload speed was still not that great since last month they had plans with upload speed being 1/10th of download speed. I did give them a suggestion for better upload speeds, 2 days later jio came with symmetrical speeds, I was happy. Since my connection was new..they upgraded my current connection to 300 Mbps Plan for the month. Speed I used to get was  Extremely satisfied\u2026but since Jio launched new plans hence Old Jio => 250 Mbps/Rs. 1299 New Jio => 150Mbps/Rs. 999  As per the speeds advertised I think I still have no complaints whatsoever. [WILL UPDATE SOME MORE SPECIFICS] Edit: 14th October 2020 After using Jio Fiber for about 45 days or so I am updating some more information regarding OTT apps and 4K Set Top Box. So along with the \u20b9999 Plan we get a 4K Set Top Box which looks like this & the remote control has voice feature so yes that is a plus for some of us lazy bums \ud83d\ude02  Since I am a Gold user that means I get around 11 Subscriptions (OTT Apps) with my plan: Amazon Prime (1 Year?)Sony LivDisney Hotstar VIPAlt BalajiZee 5Jio CinemaVootSun NXTShematooLionsgate PlayHoiChoiOut of these apps I have tried Amazon Prime, Sony Liv, Disney Hotstar, Zee 5 & Voot. All apps work fine and ad free except Disney Hotstar VIP. In Disney Hotstar you will get a lot of content but not in English, they will be dubbed in Hindi. Also, no american shows. Check the difference between VIP & Premium   Apart from this I think we have no issues at all, all apps work pretty smooth and we can easily click the cast button from our mobile to play the content we like. Recently got an update and Netflix application also got installed, do note that Netflix doesn\u2019t come with Gold plan but you can use your existing login details & use it easily.  One thing I didn\u2019t like was the Set Top Box can start automatically updating software while you are enjoying your content, and well that update will interrupt your viewing experience. It would be better if we get a prompt before proceeding. If you have any other question regarding this then you can drop them below or send me a message & I\u2019ll try my best to help you. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been using Jio Fiber since 1st Jan 2018. The speed as promised is 100 Mbps. What you practically get depends on how you connect to the router i.e the WiFi version on your device, how crowded the WiFi spectrum is at your place, how far you are from the router etc. It also depends on the server being able to send you data at 100 Mbps. More often than not, the bottle neck is the server   Speed tests show speeds in 91 - 96 Mbps range. This is understandable as speed test applications test speed at Application Layer whereas connection speeds are specified at Physical Layer. Speed at Application Layer will obviously be lesser than Physical Layer due to protocol overheads. They have done a very thorough job of cabling. The fiber cable is buried under concrete and travels up the building through pipes. So it is well protected from damage. The connection is very stable. But once in a week or two entire sections of internet become inaccessible while others are accessible as usual. It usually happens with Amazon and sites hosted on AWS including Quora. They are able to fix it remotely as soon as you call them. It looks like a software glitch. I think they will be able to fix it in future. Only real limitation is that the the router sits behind Jio\u2019s firewall which blocks inbound connections. This happens at the ISP so you can\u2019t turn it off from router settings. If you want to host a server using Jio Fiber, you can\u2019t. But I guess majority of users don\u2019t want to do this, so there are almost no cons for them. (Edit: Jio has recently unblocked incoming IPv6 connections but incoming IPv4 connections are still blocked) The higher speed has led to some changes in how I use the Internet. I no longer hold on to large setup files or anything downloaded from the net as it can be re-downloaded in a minute if needed. When this service goes mainstream, servers across the world are going to be flooded with traffic from India. I suspect this will trigger a trend where popular internet sites will be served from India based data centers to save on international bandwidth cost and latency. Edit: The preview offer has ended and now the upload speed has been reduced to 10 Mbps. So uploading videos to YouTube or Syncing high res photos with Google Photos will take 10 times longer. Download speed is still 100 Mbps (or higher based on plan). Edit: April 2020 The upload speed has now been capped at 10 Mbps  The problem of large swathes of internet becoming inaccessible every once in a while has become worse Some reports claim that VPNs are being blocked. Other than VPNs, Jio is the ISP with the largest number of unauthorized blocks (i.e. it blocks sites or protocols even in absence of any legal order to block them). Update: They are not blocking VPN ports/protocol because I am able to use one. They may be blocking specific VPN Server IPs but I can\u2019t verify that. Jio will not share router password with you so you can no longer log into the router. You can exercise some basic control through the MyJio app - like setting WiFi password, listing connected devices etc. IPv6 is disabled now.  IPv6/4 connectivity and speed test ",
