            "answer_text": "In my opinion, in professional sports you should either be able to review everything or nothing. Only being able to review select plays creates a double standard like we saw with the pass interference no-call in the NFC championship, or the various bad calls we saw throughout the NHL playoffs (5 minute majors, pucks out of play, hand passes, abysmal no-calls etc.). These are all things you can\u2019t review. However in the NFL and NHL, to continue with the example, you can review silly stuff such as if the ball moved upon contact with the ground, or an offsides that happens a minute and a half before a goal was scored. Not that these aren\u2019t important and potentially game changing plays, but the plays mentioned above that are not reviewable are just as, if not more, potentially game changing, and in the case of the Saints and Golden Knights, season changing. Now it is my opinion that reviewing everything would slow the pace of the games (especially baseball, which is already slow) far too much and make them unentertaining to watch, or at least less entertaining (you would be hard pressed to make playoff hockey unentertaining). So with that in mind, I think that the best thing the NHL, NFL, NBA and MLB could do would be to stop official reviews and stick with the call made in the moment by the official. I would listen to arguments that would make any play challengeable by a coach or manager, with an obvious restrictions on the number of challenges available to the coach. I also like the way the NHL does it wherein a failed challenge results in a delay of game penalty. However at the end of the day, if we make everything reviewable and and challengeable, what\u2019s the point in having an umpire or referee in the first place. With all that said, I realize that none of this really answers your question, to do so, I would say that the NHL has the worst replay system just because of the ambiguity of what is challengeable and reviewable and what is not. This year\u2019s playoffs were a great example.

            "answer_text": "The NBA. Because it shouldn't be there. The fast flow and tempo of the game are too severely disrupted by the review process. Unlike they are in MLB and NFL, since the pace is much slower. The NFL review process is also too slow. It needs to be under 60 seconds. The NBA review needs to be gone. Or if continued, mandated to be under 60 seconds as well. The problem is enforcing this mandate. The NFL tried to, about three years ago, but to to no avail. The refs still take as long as they like. Because they can. LOL. Who's gonna penalize them? And how? The League office really cannot, since it cares primarily about the zebras just making the correct decisions. Sure, they could dock the refs' score for the game, but that's apparently not much of an incentive for the refs to quicken the process. From what I can tell, reviews take longer than ever. I'd just as soon eliminate them rather than have my teams momentum derailed for three minutes during a crucial potential game winning drive. ",
