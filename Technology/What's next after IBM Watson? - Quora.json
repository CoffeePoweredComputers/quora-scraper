            "answer_text": "IBM has already announced that they intend to commercialize Watson.  Healthcare is the first industry they are going after.  The basic idea will be that doctors and nurses can give Watson symptoms and Watson will recommend a range of treatment options, saying for example that it has 90% confidence that a particular chemotherapy regimen should be used for a particular cancer patient, given all the clinical data it has received from doctors.  Medical evidence doubles every five years, and \u201cit\u2019s not humanly possible for doctors to keep up with all of that\u201d information, she added. Watson can quickly scan the latest medical literature and keep physicians current.[1] Doctors can benefit from having more information easily available to them.  One in five diagnoses are incorrect or incomplete and nearly 1.5 million medication errors are made in the US every year. [6] The launch of a Q&A service will augment doctors' knowledge. Here's how one doctor describes the way Watson helped him. A patient was pregnant, had Lyme disease, and was also allergic to penicillin. And Watson came up with a drug. The first thing I thought was, Watson made a mistake. That drug can't be given to someone allergic to penicillin.\" But Chase was wrong, not Watson. \"My knowledge was about five years old,\" he says. \"And in the past couple of years, all the muckety-mucks had reviewed all the studies and had concluded yes, you can give that drug to someone who's allergic to penicillin.\"[2] Watson can handle natural language queries in healthcare: a physician can use Watson to assist in diagnosing and treating patients. First the physician might pose a query to the system, describing symptoms and other related factors. Watson begins by parsing the input to identify the key pieces of information. The system supports medical terminology by design, extending Watson's natural language processing capabilities.[6] Watson is going after three distinct markets in healthcare : Watson will answer medical questions from doctors, researchers, medical centers and insurance carriers[7] Watson is meeting some success in the market. By the end of 2013, 1,600 providers and 50 percent of nurses in the system of WellPoint, the second-largest U.S. health insurer, will be using a Watson product for recommending whether medical procedures should be approved, IBM said.[3] After healthcare, Watson will be offered for the financial services industry: An investment advisor wants to be able to confidently recommend investments and portfolio changes. Evaluating an investment target requires looking at a wide range of data and interrelated factors. Financial services professionals need assistance in consuming and analyzing available data to improve decision making. [1] What Is The Future Of Health Care?

Given a topic, the computer interacts with human actors to quickly produce a short comic skit that successfully leaves the audience falling of their seats laughing.  Get a special on Comedy Central. This may sound less serious than answering trivia questions, but this would require a leap forward in understanding the subtleties of language, timing, etc.  It is one thing to understand questions and recall answers from an encyclopedia. It is another thing to simulate, even in a small degree, creative collaboration with humans. Another idea would be to take on the Turing Test in 2012, the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth:  http://www.kevinwarwick.com/turing100.htm ",
