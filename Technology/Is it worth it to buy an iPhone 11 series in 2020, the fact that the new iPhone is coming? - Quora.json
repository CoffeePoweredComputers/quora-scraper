            "answer_text": "It depends on various things. But in general, YES. Let me ask you a single question, why do you want to buy it? Are you in need of a phone for general use? I mean just for texting and calling. If yes, then buy it. The phone is definitely worth it.Are you looking for an entertaining device? For watching videos, listening to music, read the news, or just using the social platforms? If yes, then buy the phone. It operates just as good as an entertaining device.Or you are pursuing cutting-edge technology? If yes, then don\u2019t buy the phone. It is a little out-dated now.Personally, I still use the iPhone 6 which I bought 3 years ago. It still functions as well as I expected. But if the chance is there, I might want to upgrade it. ",

If you like having the latest and greatest and have the money to indulge in that, you should buy when they\u2019re first released to maximize the time you spend in that zone. But otherwise, unless it\u2019s really close (and seven months isn\u2019t) just get what\u2019s there now. ",
