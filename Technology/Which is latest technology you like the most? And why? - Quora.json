            "answer_text": "Distributed ledgers and SSDs. SSD: It should be obvious, they are faster than a hard disk, simpler to install, and don\u2019t get as hot, so they don\u2019t require as much cooling. What is not to like? Distributed ledgers (BlockChain)First, a disclaimer, I am NOT referring to anything about BitCoin. If you want that, stop reading here. The world\u2019s business runs on making transactions between buyer and seller. The explicit transaction contract has ACID properties, meaning that a transaction can be undone so that it never existed. No partial results hang around. If the buyer accepts the goods, the seller is guaranteed payment, it is a done deal. In modern commerce, there may be many partners within the scope of a traditional transaction, the jobber, the shipper, the warehousing company, ... it is not easy to roll back a transaction, when the shipper did his job and the warehousing company did theirs, but there is a dispute over the goods delivered between the original buyer and seller. There needs to be a better solution, and a lot of people think that is the BlockChain or distributed ledger. It is a complicated mechanism, involving non-changeable data protected by encryption mechanisms, and beyond what I would attempt to describe here. But it is of high interest to the heavy-hitters in global commerce, so it is something to watch. ",
