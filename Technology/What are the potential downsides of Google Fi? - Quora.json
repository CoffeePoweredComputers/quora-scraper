            "answer_text": "My wife and I have been using Google\u2019s Project Fi (now renamed \u201cGoogle Fi\u201d) since the summer of 2015. You may find this hard to believe\u2026 There are no downsides. None. What is Google Fi, how does it work, and why do I want it? Pricing is cheap - and stupid simple. $20 per line, plus $10 per gig of data. Billing/payment is a total non-issue, just give them your credit card number. If you have kids who love to stream, don\u2019t worry about the $10 per gig - your bill is capped at $80. Use less cell data - you pay less. Using Fi helps you to be aware of and make use of the thousands of free WiFi hotspots - which is all to the good. In fact, I personally believe we all have Google to thank for significantly lowering cellular plan/carrier prices. When Fi first came out, their pricing beat pretty much everyone, usually by a wide margin. Post Fi, I\u2019ve watched carrier prices fall - and then fall more. Google Fi - Frequently asked questions I know this new interest in Fi is mostly sparked by people who want to keep their iPhone - and pay less. I get that. iPhone is justifiably famous for its simplicity and reliability. That said, I personally would not trade my $299 Moto X4 for any iPhone, nor a new top end Galaxy or what have you. No, I\u2019m not exaggerating. As it happens, a brand new Pixel was offered to me, still in the box. I thanked the kind gentleman, sincerely\u2026 and turned it down. Even though a Pixel is a Fi-capable phone, and a \u201cpure\u201d Android - which I highly recommend. Ditto a brand new iPhone X, just a couple weeks ago. Offered to me free. No thanks. Why? 2 reasons. Unlike other phone plans, Google Fi offers cellular coverage across three leading networks (T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular) and Wi-Fi hotspots, with a phone designed for Fi. Phones that are not designed for Fi but are still compatible with Fi have nationwide access to the T-Mobile network. - There\u2019s very little to complain about with the T Mobile network. Lots of towers, good coverage. But I\u2019m used to having 3 networks, plus thousands of free hotspots. I have coverage EVERYWHERE. That\u2019s the biggest benefit of a \u201cFi capable\u201d phone, and yes, the Pixel would have given me that. But\u2026 One specific thing - that admittedly isn\u2019t important to everyone. My Moto X4 has a microSD slot. I\u2019m a Geek. I have thousands of books, and many thousands of MP3\u2019s & FLAC\u2019s. I\u2019m too cheap to sign up for any monthly $$$ service for music, or even waste data streaming my own music from my home server. For me, a phone with expandable storage, allowing me up to 512 GB? That\u2019s luxury beyond price. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are the potential downsides of Google Fi?\u201d I'm going to assume the readers know about and understand what Google Fi (Project Fi) is. If not, I have answered that question many times. Please look into my profile. Coverage. Sprint and Tmobile have less network coverage of Verizon and AT&T, even when/if they merge.Google Fi only functions 100% on a handful of devices, whereas the other supported devices only have partial functionality. (Tmobile only)More expensive for data-heavy users, even with Data usage capped at $60.00.Backend systems. Fi uses the Google Voice system and its Google Fi app to provide its customers with the cool functionality it offers. These systems often go down or are slowed by outside forces.Even with these potential and current downsides, Fi is still a very intriguing service that is a proof of concept of sorts. Imagine if Google was able to incorporate AT&T and Verizon also, instead of only Tmobile, Sprint and Verizon\u2026 This would essentially merge all US mobile networks onto a single device. But that is why it wouldn't ever happen. That would be amazing though. I'm very interested about the impact that 5g may have on Fi and I'm looking forward to seeing what's in store for Google's MVNO.
