            "answer_text": "Schmidt became CEO in 2001.  If this article is to be believed, the answer to your question is 400.  I cannot authenticate the accuracy of this number as Google was a privately held company prior to 2004, so there was really no reason for them to disclose employee headcount to the general public.  The number may be an educated guess. ",
