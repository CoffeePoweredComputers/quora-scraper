            "answer_text": "Technology contributes to the healthcare evolution in many different ways, but some fields change quicker than others. Let\u2019s see major ways technology is changing Healthcare: Medical imaging diagnosticsNo one can dispute the power of MRI, X-ray machines, and CT scanners. Doctors successfully use these tools for decades, but they can never be 100% sure of the outcome because images can be shady enough to hide the actual condition. This is exactly where AI steps in to upgrade the process. AI-supported scanners can delve much deeper into the patient\u2019s body, thus creating perfectly accurate images that reveal the presence or absence of illness. Working in close cooperation with each other, doctors and pathology experts are able to interpret new scans much easier and bring more accurate decisions. AI systems quickly distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells and the stage of the disease to help decide how to cure it. AI-performed surgeriesRobot doctors are gradually taking over the surgery scene by making surgeries cleaner and more precise. They mostly use laser tools to perform non-invasive operations, making the process simpler and effortless. Doing so, robot surgeons make less damage to the nearby tissue and allow patients to heal faster than usual. There are some robots that help the surgeon while performing the surgery resulting in saving time and effort. Drug development:AI is almost as clever as a human being, but it can process information much faster than our brains. As such, the new technology can analyze large datasets and to identify connections and patterns researchers could never detect. Disease Detection:AI has played an important role in the diagnosis of certain diseases. Depression is a big threat to global well-being, affecting hundreds of millions all over the world. However, AI-based apps can successfully track and evaluate user behavior, thus discovering the first signs of mood swings and depressive behavior, for Instance, BioBeats. AI is already able to detect skin cancer more accurately than dermatology experts. Namely, the system analyzes thousands of skin cancer images and combines these insights with the existing documentation to determine whether it\u2019s really melanoma or not. Reducing antibiotic resistance:People use way too many antibiotics all over the world, which increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. This is both dangerous and costly since patients don\u2019t react to common drugs and also waste money buying inefficient medicine. With AI, it will be possible to prevent a lot of illnesses and eliminate the need for using antibiotics in the first place. Securing Privacy Of Patients:The huge revenues of the healthcare industry have also attracted a lot of scammers and fraudsters as well. The cybercriminals steal medical insurance data of anyone and use it to avail or sell off further medical procedures like buying drugs and getting medical tests done in labs. So deal with this issue AI-powered SaaS products are helping the insurance companies and hospitals to provide KYC services that can be used in this sector to keep identity theft at bay by means of facial recognition that supports only live face detection and by document verification. These digital KYC systems use advanced AI and HI (Human Intelligence) to pick up fraudulent attempts. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost every aspect of our lives has been changed - and usually simplified - by technology: from communicating to banking to shopping. But, somehow, healthcare has been left behind because we all believed that it was too complicated to fix, or that the solutions were impossible due to regulations. That\u2019s just not true. Now, more than ever, we can take some of the same approaches that have simplified so many other consumer industries and bring them to healthcare. I believe technology has the potential to not just improve the consumer experience of healthcare, but also to remove unneeded cost from the system. The first step of this is aligning the incentives right, and the second step is enabling better outcomes. What does technology have to do with aligning the incentives in healthcare? Everything. Today, 87% of private sector health insurance is paid for by employers. It\u2019s an \u2018employer-sponsored\u2019 healthcare system, but one in which the employers have had very little choice and very little true control. Technology is allowing us to move to an \u2018employer-driven\u2019 healthcare system. Employers can now - with new technology - put in place best in class solutions, measure what works, and even create novel designs around medical networks and communications. They can literally run their mini-health insurance companies - at the employer level - as well as a big insurance company could. Technology enables employers to be more than a paying passenger of healthcare, but to be the driver that has the incentives to control costs and improve the experience. Technology can also enable better outcomes. I see care guidance as one of the most immediate areas that technology can have a major, positive impact on in healthcare. Today, the average consumer of healthcare is setup to fail. Most doctors can\u2019t even understand their health benefits, let alone the average consumer\u2014how can we expect people to make the right decisions? At Collective Health, we\u2019ve see the true power of care guidance manifest itself in the form of technology paired with the human touch. The combination of machine learning-based data analysis, care advocacy, and better user experiences\u2014via modern mobile and web tools\u2014can help guide patients to the right care, at the right time. What encourages me is that this smarter use of healthcare not only gets people the treatments they need, it appears to reduce costs. We recently ran an analysis of medical trend\u2014the YoY change in healthcare costs per employee\u2014for our returning clients and found that the combination of our technology tools and concierge service drove a -.3% medical trend, effectively reducing year-over-year healthcare costs for our clients. And, the more members interacted with Collective Health, the lower the trend\u2014people who engaged with us realized a -.8% trend. ",
