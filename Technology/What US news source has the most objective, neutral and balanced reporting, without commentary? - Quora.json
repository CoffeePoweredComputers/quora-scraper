That simply means you\u2019re not feeling or not thinking. And I can\u2019t be bothered by a newspaper that is so bland, so eager to please, that is has no opinion or commentary. So long as that commentary is on the opinion page, where it belongs. That said, here are 10 sources you can trust, according to Forbes magazine.

But I don\u2019t know of ANY news source that\u2019s straight hard news, without commentary. The Associated Press will give you a nice balance of hard news, but even that site has commentary. ",
