            "answer_text": "Yes. Ch can have multiple pronunciations, generally corresponding to when the words entered the language. The oldest ch words are generally pronounced with a hard k sound, as they were being pronounced in Latin at the time. Christian words, such as Christ and Christmas are examples of this, but also ache, school, and stomach.Words that entered in the late Old English period and Middle English period generally have the traditional ch sound. Words like church, cheese, and much. (Note that you will sometimes see old documents spelling and pronouncing church \u201ckirke,\u201d with the hard k sound. Also, fun little trivia, the English word cheese and the Spanish word queso are cognate, both originating from the original Vandal word.)Words that entered English from French in the modern period, typically pronounce the ch as the much softer sh, such as machine, champagne, and charade.This \u201ctime rule\u201d is a generalization, and there are many, many exceptions.

It is difficult to tell which French-looking words came from which French language, but words like cherry are from Norman French and have the [t\u0283] sound, while words from modern French like chateau have the [\u0283] sound. Additionally, a few words from Norman French like chemise used to have the /t\u0283/ sound but then became France-Frenchified in the 1800s and now have the [\u0283] sound. The dominant language of France lost the distinction between /\u0283/ and /t\u0283/ after Norman French stopped being spoon as a native language in England. Once France became a world power and Parisian French was the dominant dialect, English speakers began speaking French with closer to Parisian pronunciations and began pronouncing some French words that way too, even if the words were older than Parisian French\u2019s status as the dominant dialect.
