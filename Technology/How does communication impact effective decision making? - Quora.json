            "answer_text": "There are several stages to effective communication and all are necessary if you want to make the best decision. Among the most important are listening, duh asking the right questions, sometimes more than once hearing what they say and don\u2019t say confirming what you\u2019ve heard (so you\u2019re not blinded by your own perspective) collaboration If any of these are missing you\u2019ll be missing the pertinent information along with the information you didn\u2019t know you needed to know. The opinions/suggestions of others serves two purposes here; when listening to others you will have a gut check opportunity-does this sound right or not? And to all of you Gladwell fans I\u2019ll add that your stomach has brain cells in it (a throwback to more linear beings but still) which many scientists believe communicate with the brain more than we think so a finely honed instinct borne of experience and knowledge, is a great sign post and aid to making decisions.

            "answer_text": "Have you ever made a decision without getting some information off other people? That information you get will depend on both your ability to ask the right questions and your ability to understand what you are told. This is why dictatorships do so badly. A dictator will punish people for telling things he does not want to hear. And then people will not give him information he needs because they are scared of what the response will be. We have all persuaded ourselves of something that wasn\u2019t true and then made a bad decision. ",
