            "answer_text": "This is the logo for LRG (http://l-r-g.com/).  Lifted Research Group was created as a niche lifestyle clothing company in 1999.  Formed in Orange County, California from the alumnus of formerly niche apparel producers: Quiksilver, O'Neill, and Katin.  They also produce electronic accessories, extreme vehicles, outdoor equipment including sporting goods, etc.   They are primarily distributed through Skate, Snow and Surf shops and sponsor and support athletes at these events.  They also support many independent music artists and low key music events.   The company seems to have been profitable since the early 2000s.  The companies products becomes more or less relevant on a 3-4 year cycle.  The current brand ethos is to design products that would not have mainstream appeal and to have limited production.   They have very loyal support through the network of stores that carry their products. Logo Analysis  The logo represents the action sports culture that this company is a part of.  Most of the artists and employees at the company are very much a part of this culture. Like all logos that have detailed thought there is a high symbolizing at play:  The idealized Pine Tree represents nature and growth. It also is a part of the mountain areas where snowboarding takes place.  The modified swiss/iron cross is a nod to an edgy Alpine culture of snow sports.  The clear roots are representative of how the company will not go against the roots that formed the company and the culture that surrounds it.  The circle is representative of how things recycle and a nod to the support of ecology that makes action sports possible.  ",
