            "answer_text": "Here are a few pointers that might help: 1. Don't keep the battery at 100% all the time. if you're not using it, remove it. If you can't (or don't want to), cap the battery at 80% at max (I keep mine at 60%). There are softwares usually provided by Dell for doing this AFAIK. 2. Don't let it overheat. Anything that heats up the laptop is a big no-no. (Games, softwares etc.). If your laptop can't handle it without heating, better let it go. 3. Don't keep the laptop on your lap. The ventilation on the bottom get blocked by your clothes which starts heating the laptop. By extension, bed and sofas are not suitable as well. Plain surfaces like table or a desk will do. 4. Don't keep the laptop on dusty surfaces. The dust gets through the ventilation and dirties the fans. 5. If you spill water/juice/soda, shut off the laptop immediately, remove the batteries and let it dry for atleast 24 hours.  A couple myths: MYTH 1: You have to drain the battery atleast once a month to avoid the memory effect.People might say you have to drain the battery completely and charge it fully in order to avoid the memory effect. Let me enlighten you on this topic. It's all hokum.  It's a thing of the past. Modern lithium ion batteries don't have this problem.  MYTH 2: Batteries get overcharged if not unplugged and get damaged.You cannot overcharge the battery. The manufacturers are smart enough to keep a check on when the battery is full. Once it's full, they stop charging the battery and provide direct AC current to the laptop. ",
