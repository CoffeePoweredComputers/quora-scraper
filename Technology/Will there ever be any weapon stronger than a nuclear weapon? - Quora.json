            "answer_text": "Indeed destructive in itself is a relative and vague term, also how destructive something is depends on the perspective of the person, creature or object in danger of being affected(destroyed) by whatever destructive force is present, which could relate to the point down below by Howard, to a population of people, indeed bio weapons may be quite the destructive force but also think about how they could be controlled (easily compared to other forces) for example biological suits to protect and new medical technologies which may help cure people afflicted by bio weapons, in the end this is only considered destructive to people or possibly other living creatures. Would it be destructive to the other things such as the atmosphere or even the earth itself? In the short term probably not, the earth is here to stay until the nth unit of time. Nuclear on the other hand, yes the need for fissile materials (for example Uranium-235) needed to start a fission reaction or fusion materials (for example Deuterium and Tritium) probably suppresses the destructive nature of nuclear reactions but given enough, they can practically trump over much of the other destructive forces, they can destroy almost anything and everything. Levelling and burning, decaying and irradiating, everything within their range (it has the potential to destroy the earth). Very few things you can do to stop that kind of force, maybe some lead or concrete for the radiation, but for a full on nuclear detonation, you may as well dig yourself a grave. Nuclear weapons are just the beginning, much of the universe around us is basically a result of nuclear reactions and interactions (indeed it\u2019s considered both a destructive and constructive force in nature). A good example about a more destructive side of nuclear forces is as stated by Bill Ireland below, anti-matter which just annihilates any regular matter in the way and as a result releasing energy, no stopping that for sure. That\u2019s just scratching the surface by the way, the even uglier results as a result nuclear processes has the potential to destroy even whole galaxies. If you\u2019re asking in terms of man-harnessed forces, yes nuclear would probably be the most powerful destructive force. It may not be (the universe will never fail to surprise us) but if nuclear forces are indeed the most powerful, we haven\u2019t learnt how to harness it completely which is good\u2026 the only thing that has the potential to be more destructive than the actual forces themselves is the one smart and capable enough to harness such forces for their ownself; humans and human nature in itself have the potential to be most destructive force out there. One that should not be underestimated. Extra: Going even deeper, if considered the true destructive force could be the universe or nature itself, maybe a deity(not sure if I believe this one), which created all of these destructive forces.

            "answer_text": "A \u201dwell\u201d designed biological weapon is the current king of the terrible weapon pile. We have a few theoretical weapons that could potentially kill all life on our planet, but from what we know, they don't exist yet. Of what currently exists a biological weapon designed and deployed for maximum lethality could potentially kill the vast majority of the human population. I did read about a soil bacteria developed in the 1990s that was designed to help break down plant waste and form biofuels. At the last minute, they realized it was lethal to living plants. It didn't just turn dead plants to alcohol it started on the roots of living plants too. That would have happened to absolutely every known variety of the plant around the world. This turned into a weapon is probably the most powerful weapon in existence, if released it would kill the entire food chain, no plant or animal on the surface of the earth would survive. Not only that but thinking about it, alcohol released into the water table would do an excellent job of killing the majority of aquatic life as well. So it would do to the earth what an alcohol wipe does to your skin before a shot, for all intents and purposes sterilization. Nothing else can touch that level of destruction ",
