            "answer_text": "USB is very user friendly interface. It has hot-plug capabilities, drivers come bundeled in every OS in every laptop, desktop, smartphone, embedded micro-controllers, tiny micro-controllers, printers, scanners, washing machine, electric cars, any kind of development board, super-computers, even GPU cards have one. I am guessing the Soyuz capsule has a bunch of USB ports, as does the ISS. The point is that USB pretty popular around the word, . The USB protocol is incredibly robust from the link point of view, so is the host controller interface i.e., windows driver application. Speeds upto USB 2.0 are even more reliable, which is why 90% of the world uses USB 2.0 as opposed to USB3.0. But the question is why is every damn thing not USB ? The flexibility of USB protocol means that you have to compromise on raw performance. Not everybody wants 10Gbps capability on a 5m cable. For Display (HDMI or DP), you don't care about a few bits going corrupt here and there. For high speed Ethernet, you would use specialized links with carrier modulations. USB has attempted to fix many of the problems like introduction of SCSI over USB for performance, Dual Lane 20Gbps typeC controllers, and now USB-4 to absorb display and PCIE via tunneling. In the future, Display would probably move to USB-4 which promises 40Gbps link speeds. Moreover Type-C capability allows Power Delivery in the most sophisticated way. Going back to the original question, not everything needs to be as user friendly as USB. It is often overkill to use USB packet encoding for every purpose. However, of you need a reliable, cheap and easy to use medium, use USB. ",

            "answer_text": "Looking at the back of my PC - I see USB, HDMI, Ethernet and a bunch of 3mm audio jacks. Let\u2019s look at USB: A typical USB 3.0 port can manage 5Gbits/sec.The very latest USB 3.2 can do 20Gbits/sec.Data can be sent in either direction at full speed.The max distance USB can connect over is 3 meters.OK - so let\u2019s see what USB could replace: HDMI Video: A typical HDMI 2.0 port can manage 18Gbits/sec.The very latest HDMI 2.1 will do 48Gbits/sec.So USB isn\u2019t fast enough for the most demanding video users. There is a good reason for that - it\u2019s because USB can send that much data in either direction - but when you\u2019re sending video to a monitor - you need more speed but almost all of the data goes in ONE direction. ETHERNET: Ethernet cables could be replaced by USB in most cases - but USB cables have a maximum length of 3m and Ethernet can go 100 meters. USB is FAR too short to wire up buildings with. AUDIO JACKS: USB could DEFINITELY replace audio jacks\u2026but do you recall the howls of anguish from iPhone users when Apple took away their audio jacks? Plus - there is a ton of super-cheap audio gear that uses simple analog jacks. This is my audio mixer that mixes my radio, my Linux, Windows, Chromebook and Phone audio into a pair of speakers:  Sure you COULD do that with a USB-based audio mixer and amplifiers - but right now - I don\u2019t see those in the $20 price range that I paid for this one.
