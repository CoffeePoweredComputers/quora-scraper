The problem is that you can\u2019t get much power out of it using the configuration as is. You could, but the efficiency must go down, such as here:  See how wide the nozzles are? They allow much more steam to pass through. No worries, steam expands about 2000 times. You can also tune the engine to be either fast/weak (nozzles close to axis of rotation) or strong/slow (nozzles far from axis of rotation). I designed this one to use both at the expense of some efficiency, but with much more power out. I estimate that this engine hods great promise for aircraft propulsion, being light, fast and efficient. In addition, I don\u2019t think I am the first human ever who thought so:  ",
