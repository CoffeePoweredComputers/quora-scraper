            "answer_text": "In my opinion Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just starting to show the potential of the blockchain technology behind them. And there is clearly a lot of demand for cryptocurrencies as we can see this on exchanges like Coinbase, Primexbt, Kraken from the number of people going to them. The demand is there, there is innovation, there is big potential. This is just like the internet in the beginning of the 90s - slow and complicated for use, but guess what will happen at one point in time - the technology will scale and things will change. ",
