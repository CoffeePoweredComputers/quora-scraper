            "answer_text": "A note to Quora... This is a direct answer to the question (a different answer would simply be missing vital info or even be wrong) originally written by me, based on my deep experience and NOTHING is copied from anyone else! Just updated 21 february 2020 with deeper information. Many wonder about the best TV brand and that is almost too easy to answer today... * Sony is clearly best, especially with their excellent 75 and 65 inch budget TV's and Samsung is also a very fine alternative, except their too expensive Qled versions... Then has Panasonic very fine alternatives, but they are normally more expensive... And there are also some silly expensive \"design\" brands, but they don't make finer screens... Mainly because the electronics for really fine picture processing, which your TV must have to show a really fine moving picture - without any irritating errors and especially with advanced upscaling (so most DVD's and even standard definition broadcasts look almost as sharp as full HD BluRays) are very complicated to produce, or very expensive to buy... And many makers like LG don't want to pay any extra for really fine electronics in budget models, so LG only pay for almost perfect picture quality in some very expensive models, which then cost more than finer Panasonic and Sony alternatives... And that is also why the otherwise amazing low-cost white OLED from LG (especially the B7 to B9 versions) has some irritating picture problems and very bad upscaling, according to many user reviews... But Sony and Samsung has already excellent picture processing technology \"in house\" so you get really fine picture processing, even with their budget LCD models and Sony has also some amazing OLED models, with white OLED panels from LG and truly brilliant Sony electronics inside, which give you the absolute finest picture quality today and they cost anyhow less than LG's medium fine OLED models, but they are naturally a bit more expensive than LG's budget OLED models! * Note that Samsung QLED has nothing to do with OLED and give actually not a clearly better picture than Sony's very fine 75 inch budget models, with classic LCD panels... * The LED in names, is normally only the type / method of white backlight that practically every modern LCD screen have... * Then have it only been a few 1 to 4 inch TV's and game screens made of colour LED pixels... Plus three amazing TV prototypes with Sony's \"Crystal LED technology\" which mainly are colour LED pixels, but they was a lot more expensive to make than OLED so they did not begin to mass produce them... But some companies, including Samsung and LG are recently working on 75 to 146 inch \"MicroLED\" screens, which also use colour LED pixels and that technology seem to become the absolute best alternative, sometime in the future... But maybe never, at ordinary prices... Yes \"MicroLED\" work just like the first version of Organic LED or OLED with pixel groups of three colour subpixels... But the blue OLED subpixel did die twice as fast, so LG invented WhiteOLED which are groups of four white subpixels, with a colour filter over three subpixels and the last white subpixel, compensate then for the loss of light the filter create... And that also mean that every smartphone with classic OLED screens, will die extra fast. * And then have many famous original makers (as Philips) simply stop producing TV's and sold the brand name to factories in China... The Chinese company Hisense produce for example low quality sets as Sharp (who originally made the finest big screens in Japan) and Toshiba for America... And a company in Poland makes the last screens (of very low quality) as Sharp that are sold in Europe... And the Turkish company Vestel makes clearly worse quality TV's for Europa, which are badged with over 30 old brand names as Hitachi, Toshiba, JVC, Sanyo and even some budget Panasonic, including the 4k CX400 model! * The same TV can also cost very different in different shops, so use always a price comparison site, even if you want to buy in a shop! * Look then for the right size, so you can view the finest details... A great TV should naturally be just like a clear window to another place and you need both perfect eyes and a 65 to 75 inch screen, to be able to see the finest Full HD details from 263 to 303cm distance... See more in my list below * Then are anyhow extra popular sizes 55 inch extra expensive, compared with slightly bigger or smaller... See more about that below... * And you get normally most smart TV functions, even in a budget 65 or 75 inch TV so you get automatically that functionality, without any extra cost! * Some shops try to fool you that you need 100hz or more... The truth is that fine modern 50hz sets from Sony and Samsung, handle movements very smooth and sharp... But not all 50hz sets, of course... And some older 100hz sets are actually worse than a fine 50hz set... A few shops show even special made videos to demonstrate the \"huge\" difference and sets with 50hz look then dramatically worse, sometimes even horrible... Even if exactly the same 50hz TV show movement just as nice (smooth and sharp) as other 100hz TVs, with a normal / ordinary signal, from a film or broadcast... Okay, it may still be a tiny difference, but it's practically impossible to see! * A really fine VA LCD screen must be able to show very deep black (practically as deep as an OLED screen, but some times first after some adjustments) some fine details even in dark shadows, details in white shirts and be able to produce very bright white... Any screen use to show great colours right from the front... But some VA screens can dim colours dramatically from a side angle, even if the best can look perfect anyhow... And IPS screens use to show clear fine colours, even from a side angle BUT the darkest \"black\" look only like \"almost really black\" instead... Except with some amazing Sony IPS screens, which anyhow can show rather deep black... And WhiteOLED combine finally the best, total black and perfect colors even from the side, but some do not show any details in dark shadows and the really fine are very expensive and the budget versions form LG have both some picture errors and bad upscaling! * Fine upscaling, as you find in every big budget Samsung TV with UltraHD can make ordinary TV broadcasting and fine DVD films, almost as sharp as Full HD BluRay films... And Sony's brilliant upscaling is even better... But budget TV sets from LG and many others, give normally a much worse blurry result with DVD films. * Demo TVs in shops have often strange blue tint settings and too strong colors, but that can you normally adjust at home... Just change to the \"film\" or \"movie\" mode and then will you normally get the best picture. * Turn also OFF all or most of the artificial \"picture improvements\" and change to a \"neutral\" or \"warm\" colour temp setting - for a truly natural picture, that should be just like a clear window to another place... * And the best test films, to make accurate natural settings, might be L\u00e9on / The Professional, Gladiator, The Rock and Titanic. * Finally sound most modern TV speakers rather awful, so you should always connect the set to a HiFi equipment or at least buy separate loudspeakers, that may be rather cheap and still give a GREAT improvement! And here have you a very exact answer about the optimal viewing distance, with help of 3 great methods... 1) The first method is extra easy, made by me and also the only method that work perfectly, even if you have extra fine OR bad eyesight... We begin with a special version for 4K UltraHD simply because most screens have that resolution... Stand first so incredibly close to the screen, that you really can see some of the pixels and measure then the distance, between your nose and the screen... Then are BluRay films and most HD TV broadcasting max FullHD and people do normally not want to sit extremely close to the screen (see more about that below) anyhow... So you can simply double the nose to screen distance you measure, to get the best viewing distance for FullHD and there can you truly enjoy the finest details in a Full HD picture... And that is the max distance, even with an UltraHD 4K screen, because if you move back more, will you naturally see less and less of the finest FullHD details... And then the version for a Full HD screen... Stand first so close to the screen, that you just can see the pixels and move then back 6 cm... Then can you enjoy the finest details in a Full HD picture... That is simply the optimal distance, because if you move back more, will you naturally see less and less of the finest details and if you sit closer, will you see some pixels... Yes, most people don't want the screen very close and sit actually too far away, to even see the finest FullHD details... They have normally a 55 inch TV about 300cm from the sofa, when a 55 inch screen should be max 224cm away (if you have perfect eyes) and then is it naturally impossible to see the finest FullHD details... And then have 4K or UltraHD even finer details, which naturally are even more impossible to see, if you sit too far away (as most do) and not extremely close... You must first sit closer than 224cm to begin to see more than FullHD details and max 115cm away (with perfect eyes) from a 55 inch 4K screen to see the finest UltraHD 4K details... Which mainly means, that you never have to invest in an UltraHD player or films... And remember that most programs are shown in max Full HD anyhow... But a fine 4K UltraHD screen cost about the same as a fine Full HD and if your kids sit very close to the TV, can they naturally enjoy the extra up-scaled 4K details... And then can you also use a fine 40 inch 4K screen as a giant computer monitor (at the perfect 85cm distance) instead of four 20 inch screens *hehe* 2) If you use method one, with a FullHD screen and have perfect eyesight, will you see that the screens diagonal size in inch x 4 simply happen to be the almost exact optimal distance in centimetres (and cm x 0.3937 is inch) and if you sit further away, will you see less and less fine FullHD details... But this method work ONLY if you have PERFECT eyes, otherwise must you first move closer, until you can see some pixels and then move back 6 cm... And to see the finest 4K or UltraHD details (with perfect eyesight) must you actually sit little closer to the screen, than the screen is wide! 3) Here you have the optimal viewing distance in numbers, to enjoy the finest 1920x1080 FullHD details, with perfect eyes... Because you can see a 1mm object max 346cm away, with perfect vision and then must you move back max 6cm, to not see any pixels and max details! 15.6\" notebook screen (show FullHD pixels max 62cm away) 64cm 32\" 704x396mm 27.9dm2 (pixels to max 127cm +6cm) 133cm 37\" 814x458mm 37.3dm2 - 152cm or max 76cm for finest UltraHD 40\" 880x495mm 43.6dm2 - 164cm or max 85cm for finest UltraHD details! 42\" 924x520mm 48.0dm2 - 172cm 44\" 968x546mm 52.7dm2 - 181cm 46\" 1012x569mm 57.6dm2 - 188cm 49\" 1078x606mm 65.4dm2 - 200cm 52\" 1144x644mm 73.6dm2 - 212cm 55\" 1210x681mm 82.4dm2 - 224cm or max 115cm for finest UltraHD details! 60\" 1320x743mm 0.98m2 - 244cm 65\" 1430x804mm 1.15m2 - 263cm or max 134cm for finest UltraHD details! 70\" 1540x866mm 1.33m2 - 283cm 75\" 1650x928mm 1.53m2 - 303cm or max 155cm for finest UltraHD details! 80\" 1760x990mm 1.74m2 - 323cm or max 164cm for finest UltraHD details! 87\" 1920x1080mm 2.07m2 - 352cm And an extra tip... A really fine 55 inch smart TV costs often more than a truly excellent \"budget\" 65 inch TV from Sony or Samsung... Because 55 inch TVs are the most popular size, so they are normally overpriced and many think that a 65 inch TV are too big, so they are often under priced! But even 65 inch is too small, to show the finest Full HD details from a normal sofa position... So if you want the best and sit 3 meters away, do you really need a 75 inch and that's why that size did cost dramatically more... And I have now a Sony Bravia KD-75XG8096 with a magnificent 75 inch VA screen, that give me a perfect \"magic window\" picture - with brilliant sharpness (even with fine DVD's) delicious natural colors (even from a side angle) really deep black (which look like an OLED screen) fine details in dark shadows and in white clothes, plus sharp smooth movements\u2026 So I truly love the amazingly high picture quality! And can you really trust my words? I got a comment from John Randall... \"Having worked for 40 years at Sony in the service side, I have yet to hear such a great report on TV\u2019s. This is very well reported and very factual. Good work and well said!\" Originally written by me, to help everyone find a finer TV And I'm from Sweden, so I may write slightly strange... But I hope my answer will be a great help, anyhow! ",
