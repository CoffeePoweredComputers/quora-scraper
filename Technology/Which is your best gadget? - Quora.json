            "answer_text": "In my personal opinion a gadet is considered cool when it becomes an integral part of your life. Being a 90\u2019s kid of India I have seen the rise and fall of many cool gadgets which the future generation could never truly value or will understand it's value. So listed below is my personal list of cool gadgets since my childhood (most of these are still in my possession and in damn good condition). Hand held game console During my junior high not a single night went by without playing a game or two on this device, which ran on a pair of double A batteries and had 8 games with different levels. Got this as my 10th birthday present.Walkman and Discman When I recall late 90s it brings back some of my happy memories. Those were days where I used to carry cassette held Walkman and later on Discman with earphones in my pocket like a hippie. 2 or 3 good songs were enough to cover whole summer holidays.Tv connected Video Game Player This epic beast helped me make new friends. It had huge impact on every kid at that time. Used to exchange game cassette in school. Most of the evenings went by playing Contra, Mario,Double Dragon etc.Mp4 Player or JXD In around 2004 or 2006 Mp4 player was the new craze in the market. Just imagine a small device that could play your videos , audios had some games . It had a little camera also though a low quality VGA.Touch Screen Mobile I don't know why my first touch screen mobile still dosnt gives me that nostalgic feeling that nokia phones used to give. But still I would keep it in my list.JBL BLUETOOTH SPEAKER This bluetooth speaker serves me a lot of purpose.Its compact structure is easy to carry anywhere. Home, office or travel ; whatever place it is, just connect it with your cell phone and enjoy with a decent sound.FitBit This fitness wrist watch helps me keep my vitals in check. Fitbit trackers can capture GPS data including route, distance, and pace in your exercise history.",

            "answer_text": "A) The first coolest thing which I own the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X Professional Studio Monitor Headphones and I absolutely love these.  Online reviewers, top audio professionals and cult followers have long agreed that the ATH-M50 is an unmatched combination of audio and build quality, whether in the studio or on the go. Its a matter of choice too to own what kind of music one likes etc. I personally like the ATH for its true sound. As the song is intended to be heard according to the artist. Bass is real and not overwhelming like in many of the high end headphones. Build is good and fits really nice. Good for long hours of use.  B) The next coolest thing which I own is the Nokia 3310.  This guy definitely needs no explanation or reviews ;) C) The next thing on this list is the LG G4. This was the only flagship model in the market with a removable battery as of now. This phone also features a removable back cover and a leather casing which is totally cool on various levels.  This phone has a QHD screen and has a good screen on time of about 4 hours as I play Marvel's contest of champions game daily on a regular basis. This phone has the best camera which I have ever owned and has a good a micro SD card slot too. That's all for now, more cool stuff to come later. :) ",
