            "answer_text": "Current wireless chargers for phones (including the upcoming iPhone X) are based on magnetic induction charging that operate at a very short distance. This is essentially a transformer cut in two, one section with the primary winding is inside the mat and the other part , the secondary winding, is inside the phone. The concept is simple and has existed for years even in electric toothbrushes however making it flat without giving up efficiency is a challenge. Other wireless technologies are unde consideration but none is commercially available. One is using radio waves just like WiFi in a room. Thus far a very little power is available over distance. The other is small lasers in the infrared range that steer their beam to the phone and a mini solar panel on the phone to convert the light to electricity. This is a promising technology as it operates over distance of tens of feet thus doesn\u2019t require the phone to touch a mat. ",

            "answer_text": " A wirelessly powered model car at the Grand Maket Rossiya museum.  The primary coil in the charger induces a current in the secondary coil in the device being charged. Inductive charging (also known as wireless charging or cordless charging) uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energybetween two objects through electromagnetic induction. This is usually done with a charging station. Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device. Induction chargers use an induction coil to create an alternating electromagnetic field from within a charging base, and a second induction coil in the portable device takes power from the electromagnetic field and converts it back into electric current to charge the battery. The two induction coils in proximity combine to form an electrical transformer. [1] [2] Greater distances between sender and receiver coils can be achieved when the inductive charging system uses resonant inductive coupling. Recent improvements to this resonant system include using a movable transmission coil (i.e. mounted on an elevating platform or arm) and the use of other materials for the receiver coil made of silver plated copper or sometimes aluminium to minimize weight and decrease resistance due to the skin effect.
