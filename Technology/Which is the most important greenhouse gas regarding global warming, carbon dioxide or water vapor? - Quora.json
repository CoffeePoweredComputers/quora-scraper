            "answer_text": "CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas because it is the main driver for global warming.  Water vapor is second because it is a positive feedback mechanism, which increases the CO2-caused warming.  Methane is potentially important, but not yet.  Below are the details of the mechanisms and why CO2 is the most important. First, the greenhouse effect results from a gas being relatively transparent to ultraviolet radiation coming from the sun and relatively absorptive to infrared radiation leaving the earth.  The greenhouse calculation involves radiation heat transport.  It must consider gas absorption and transmission properties of all the gasses in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength, density, and temperature and transport in various directions. Water vapor is a very important greenhouse gas but not the most important for global warming. It contributes 36\u201372% to the greenhouse effect.  Water vapor has a high infrared absorption and relatively high concentrations in the atmosphere.  Without water vapor, the earth would be a snowball.  However, water vapor has a very short lifetime in the atmosphere.  The concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere tends to be in almost immediate equilibrium with the temperature and pressure conditions on earth due to evaporation and rain.  Thus, concentrations of water vapor are spatially varying over the surface of the earth depending on local weather.  For example, if a local region warms, the increased temperature in that region results in more water vapor being evaporated into and absorbed by the atmosphere, until, in the limit of 100% relative humidity, it rains. Methane is also a powerful greenhouse gas, but it exists in lower concentrations than water vapor and CO2.  Its contribution to the greenhouse effect is 4\u20139% .  Methane has a significant lifetime in the atmosphere (around 12 years), but not so long as to be problematic.  In other words, if the production of methane ceased, its effect would die out in a couple of decades.  Sources of methane include decay of organic matter.  Some of this is natural (bogs), and some of this is man made (deforestation, large numbers of cattle). Carbon Dioxide is by far the most troublesome and important gas for global warming.  CO2 has a long lifetime in the atmosphere, around 30-100 years.  It contributes about 9\u201326% to the greenhouse effect.  This contribution is less than water vapor contribution, but with global warming it is the changes that matter, not the total contribution.  The difference of effect between water vapor and CO2 is in the lifetime of CO2 and the mechanism for the creation of CO2.  Water vapor by itself does not cause global warming.  CO2 does, for reasons explained below. If you look at the long history of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, first using ice core data and recently using direct measurements, you will see that in the distant past, during ice age cycles, CO2 has fluctuated between around 180 ppm (cold part of ice-age cycle) and 280 ppm (warm part of ice-age cycle).  These natural cycles have continued in almost exact repetition for hundreds of thousands of years.  Much more recently, since the beginning of the industrial age 150 years ago, CO2 has increased 40%, from 280 ppm (ice age peak) to 400 ppm.  This increase of CO2 concentration, which is based on direct measurement, is attributed to human activity for three reasons: (1) estimates of CO2 emission by burning fossil fuels (and other sources) along with models of the carbon cycle considering all sources and sinks, (2) isotopic analysis, and (3) the fact that there is no known natural cause for such an increase. Thus, we get to the mechanism of anthropogenic (human caused) global warming (AGW).  The net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere causes an increase in the greenhouse effect.  The increase in the greenhouse effect causes a net increase of heat flux into the earth.  Most of this heat is absorbed in the oceans (for delayed release into the atmosphere, e.g., via the El Nino cycle).  Some of this heat is absorbed in ice caps, melting land-ice caps over Greenland and Antarctica, resulting in sea level rise. Some of the heat warms the land and the air. The net heat increase, and the resultant global warming, cause an increase in the global average concentration of water vapor. This causes an increase in the water vapor contribution to the greenhouse effect.  Thus, water vapor is a positive feedback mechanism that about doubles the global warming effect of CO2 alone.  However, CO2 is the direct cause of this water vapor feedback.  Without the additional CO2, the water vapor feedback would not occur. There is also a feedback mechanism involving methane if permafrost melts in polar regions or oceans release some their methane deposits.  So far, this has not happened in large enough quantities to be significant, but some scientists are worried about runaway feedback from methane if global warming were to become severe enough.  The best plan is to stay away from these potential tipping points. Where do we stand now?  If you look at current temperature increases and sea level rises, they seem to be relatively small.  The problem with AGW is not the current state of the earth. The problem with AGW is the potential for a large increase in warming above what we see now. The large increase would be caused by the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere (if we stopped all CO2 emission now, the warming would continue for 100 years) and the various feedbacks that could occur.   These future increases in global warming cannot be measured, of course. They can be calculated only with climate models, or computer codes. Without going into detail, suffice it to say that the science community is anxious to limit the future global average temperature anomaly to less than 2.0C, the internationally-agreed target for limiting global warming.  The global average land and sea anomaly is now at 0.87C and accelerating.  So, we are not as far from the target as one might think. ",

            "answer_text": "Synopsis Both. Explanation That question is like asking: which is more important bones or muscle. One cannot function without the other. The Earth\u2019s Surface is the Heart The Earth\u2019s surface is the most important factor in preventing the Earth from overheating. It helps keep the Earth cool by emitting IR radiation to the atmosphere and space. Water vapor is the Muscle Water vapor is the second most important factor in preventing the Earth from overheating. It helps keep the Earth cool by emitting IR radiation to the atmosphere and space. It does most of the cooling performed by the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the Bones Carbon dioxide is the third most important factor by which the atmosphere is kept from overheating. It helps keep the Earth cool by emitting IR radiation to the atmosphere and space. It does a significant amount of the cooling performed by the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide acts like a pilot light in a gas heater, it keeps the atmosphere just warm enough so that the stronger water vapor can persist in the atmosphere. Water vapor by itself would do too good a job, so it would cool and fall as snow. Without CO2 it would never melt and the whole Earth would freeze. Conclusion Both carbon dioxide and water vapor are important. Water vapor cannot exist in the atmosphere without carbon dioxide, while water vapor does a large proportion of the work preventing the Earth from overheating. P.S. Yes it\u2019s a paradox. Radiation by the surface, water vapor and CO2 prevents the Earth from overheating. But it\u2019s the inefficiency of those processes which allow the Earth to be warm enough to support life. ",
