            "answer_text": "You will see a 5G logo on the back of the phone.. they do this so people can easily tell if it is a 5G phone or not: Galaxy S10 5G Version (Verizon):   LG V50 with 5G (Sprint)   Motorola 5G Mod Attachment Upgrade:  *Note: some 5G phones released more recently in 2020 may not have a 5G logo on the back anymore or have a 5G wallpaper.. so you may need to check the model of the phone and look at the specs online to know if it has 5G. The newer LG V60 and Samsung Galaxy S20 do not have 5G logos anymore:   Download Speed Test on your phone (free on Google Play app store). First disconnect WiFi and connect to mobile data. If you have 5G, your internet speeds will be crazy FAST as shown below:    Your phone probably doesn't have 5G most likely, you need to buy a phone that has 5G capability built in.. it CAN'T be installed or updated through a \u201csoftware update\u201d (with the exception of the Motorola Moto Mods 5G attachment accessory which you physically attach to the back of the phone). Most likely, a \u201c5G\u201d logo will be shown on the back of the phone to differentiate it from others and maybe a stock wallpaper photo on the phone showing a 5G background wallpaper or a 5G bootup logo splash screen (but like I said, some phones may not have a 5G logo on them so you'll need to check online for the specs). Another thing, 5G phones will have a very steep price tag.. so you'd know if you bought a 5G phone. Verizon is selling the Samsung 5G version of the Galaxy S10 phone for $1299.. so if you payed that much, you would know what it is capable of and what you're paying for. The LG V60 has 5G and the price is between $800\u2013$900 (The LG V50 with 5G was like $1000)\u2026 Not too bad but still expensive. Here's a list of 5G phones available and where you can get them: 5G Phones: Every Known Phone and Release Date Note: AT&T is trying to trick people with a FAKE \u201c5G E\u201d logo which is NOT actually 5G but an improved version of 4G LTE\u2026 so don't be fooled. And also, you need to make sure your location where you live has 5G support.. 5G may not be available everywhere just yet.. only big major cities. FAKE 5G if you see it says \u201c5G E\u201d on AT&T:   How to turn off 5G (if you have it): If you buy a 5G phone but you DON'T want to use 5G, you can actually turn it OFF. On Android, just go to your \"settings\", select \"network\", then select \"mobile data\".. then press the menu button and select \"mobile networks\".. then select \"network mode\" and change the preferred network mode. Here you can change between 2G/3G, 4G LTE, and 5G. Why have 5G? Why not? App downloads will be instantaneous.. social media video uploads will be instantaneous.. HD 4K video streaming or downloading will not take long.. zoom conference video calls will not lag or buffer.. YouTube videos will always play videos at high definition instead of downgrading the resolution.. If you work in the hospital, government, or do business work on your phone, time is always essential and important.. so faster internet speeds means less time wasted and more extra free time to spare and get more things done. Why people are paranoid about 5G? There have been right wing conspiracy theorists that spreaded misinformation on YouTube.. YouTube took those videos down but it was already too late and the rumors already spread. Now there are certain people that think 5G is deadly or dangerous.. yet funny enough, they don't realize that FM radio emits more radiation than 5G. People have the tendency to beleive conspiracies or rumors at a much faster and higher rate than actual facts or science. Does Apple have 5G on their iPhones? NO, currently, Apple does not have any 5G capable phone.. the recent iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max do not have 5G, they are only 4G LTE. Maybe in the future, Apple will release a 5G phone. ",

            "answer_text": "There are very few smartphones that have 5G support. Regardless of what you hear the naysayers lying about, 5G is nationwide in the US as we speak. T-Mobile just launched the first true nationwide deployment of 5G using the low-band 600MHz spectrum. This is the first type of 5G. The second type, known as mid-band sub-6GHz has been launched by Sprint in select cities throughout the country. The third type and the fastest, high-band mmWave, has been launched by Verizon and AT&T in select US cities as well. It is confirmed to be over ten times faster than LTE Advanced, but has a small footprint as its disadvantage, meaning the signal doesn't travel far. Carriers are actively working on solutions to broaden the infrastructure of mmWave 5G. So in the US, we won't be waiting ten years for 5G. We won't be waiting ten minutes. All four major carriers have launched 5G and subscribers with 5G supported devices are using it as we speak. That's a fact. To your original question, how do you know if your phone has 5G? Believe me when I say, if your device supported 5G you would know because the 5G nomenclature would be included in the name of your device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 5G, Galaxy S10 Plus 5G, etc.).

            "answer_text": " Image : Credit 5G has not yet been launched commercially and in the testing phase. So it is unlikely that you will have a phone that supports 5G. Moreover, there is hardly any phone in the market that supports 5G at present. Obviously, in the coming years, we will see mobile phones with 5G technology and they will display 5G on the signal bar and let you know that it is a 5G enabled handset. Moreover, you will get the option of switching between 4G or 5G depending upon your preference and network availability. But as of the present scenario, your phone is most likely not to have 5G because the industry is still not fully prepared for 5G and waiting for commercial launch. Moreover, you will need to change your existing mobile phone and buy a new one in order to experience true 5G speed because your old phone will only support up to 4G.  Hope it helps!
