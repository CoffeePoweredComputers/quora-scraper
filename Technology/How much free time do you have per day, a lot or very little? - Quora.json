Once I back from the office till 8.15\u20138.30 I cook and have dinner till 9 max, after that sometime I watch web series or any thing , sometime I do laundry during the weekdays in the night to save my time for weekends. I love sleeping so some times I sleep at 10\u201310.30 also but usually I sleep at 11.00 Max. So I do not think so during the week days I have much free time, however in the weekends I am able to manage more free time ,which I spend with my family, clean the house, manage cupboards and other household things. I also want to contribute some times in social activities hence I attend programs in Jain temple. when I am at home I love to cook something special, when I am not doing anything I love to create my own crafts. I am sure, people wonder how would I get time to write and read on Quora :-D, so I write and read when I get any free time in office, I am less active on Quora during weekends. Also, I am not active on FB, Insta and any other social networking sites. Thanks for reading. ",
