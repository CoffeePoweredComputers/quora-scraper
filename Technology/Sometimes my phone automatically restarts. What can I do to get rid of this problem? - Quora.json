            "answer_text": "You could have an app causing it. You could have a firmware problem, fixed by backing up the phone, performing a factory reset through the service menu, then restore the backup. You could also have a bad power switch issue. I've seen this on many different makes and models of cell phones and tablets, but especially Samsung. The same exact switches are sometimes used by many different manufacturers and sometimes they are defective, hence the random device restarts as the internal parts float, causing the restart. You can do your own simple check to see if it's a switch problem by simply turning it on and leaving it on a desk without any interaction. After a while it will restart on its own. This repair could be free if it's still under warranty, or around $20-30 if out of warranty for most phones. ",

            "answer_text": "There could be two problems with your phone: Software issue - in this case, I suggest you update to the latest ROM and see. If the problem persists, shift to stock Android and check again. If you still encounter the problem then -You have a RAM issue. Your phone does not have sufficient RAM to handle tasks. A phone upgrade is recommended. Alternatively, you could restart the phone occasionally too, but keep in mind that this is not a permanent fix.",
