            "answer_text": "A thesis statement is* tells the reader how you will understand the significance of the topic matter under discussion. * is a road map for the paper; in other words, it tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paper. * Directly answers the question asked of you. A thesis is an interpretation of a question or subject, not the subject itself.The subject, or topic, of an essay might be World War II or Moby Dick; a thesis must then offer a way to understand the war or the novel. * makes a claim that others might dispute. * is usually a single sentence somewhere in your first paragraph that presents your argument to the reader. The rest of the paper, the body of the essay, gathers and organizes evidence that will persuade the reader of the logic of your interpretation. If your assignment asks you to take a position or develop a claim about a topic, you may need to convey that position or claim in a thesis statement near the starting of your draft. The assignment may no texplicitly state that you need a thesis statement because your instructor may assume you will include one. When in doubt, ask your instructor if the assignment requires a thesis statement. When an assignment asks you to analyze,to interpret, to compare and contrast, to demonstrate cause and effect, or to take a stand on an issue, it is likely that you are being asked to develop a thesis and to support it persuasively. A thesis statement declares what you believe and what you intend to prove. A good thesis statement makes the difference between a thoughtful research project and a simple retelling of facts. In summary, it's basically a more technical term for main idea and immediately after your statement should list the supporting reasons. The thesis statement is more often opinionated since you are providing 'X' amounts of reasons which are opinions that will help you to argue or prove your point. ",

            "answer_text": "Do a literature search of papers that have been published by current professors in your department. Your department is well known in some branch of genetic engineering that makes it better (and hopefully top amongst that branch)Find other authors on Research Gate and LinkedIn who have similar articles. Reach out and email a few.Find another good thesis advisor outside of your department from another university (ties in with step 2). You should have some ability to work well together.Talk about your ideas and debate with your current thesis advisor and thesis advisor outside of your university. If they are worth their salt, they will point out logical fallacies in your hypothesis.You have chosen your thesis topic\u2014-now go do some lit research and create new knowledge.",
