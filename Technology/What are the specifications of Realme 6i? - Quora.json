            "answer_text": "Realme has now launched its entire series of Realme 6 smartphones and it won\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that almost all its latest smartphones are targeted towards the gamers. First it gave Realme C3 with Mediatek Helio G70 processor and them came the Realme 6 and Realme 6 pro smartphones with Mediatek helio G90T and Snapdragon 730G processors. Continuing its streak of good gaming smartphones, Realme has came up with Realme 6i which again contains a Mediatek gaming processor. Realme 6i is powered by Mediatek Helio G80 processor which is octa-core in nature and is clocked at 2GHz. A thing to note here is that this is the first smartphone with this processor and is expected to hit the market in the budget segment. Besides this, the smartphone contains a 6.5-inch display with 720p display resolution. It also contains the latest Android 10 operating system and Mali-G52 MC2 as its GPU. As per the leaked specs, the smartphone is available in 3GB and 4GB RAM variants with 64GB and 128GB internal storage. The camera of the smartphone is good to. It contains a 48MP + 8MP + 2MP + 2MP quad rear camera with an LED flash and a 16MP front camera as well. The smartphone is said to have 5000mAh of battery with 18W quick charging support and I think the features of this smartphone are good enough even at 12k. So if Realme decides to launch this smartphone within 10k, it would be a jackpot for the gamers and even the camera lovers. If you too are a budget buyer, I would ask you to wait for this smartphone or you can even got for Realme 6 which has a much better gaming power with mediatek Helio G90T processor. ",
