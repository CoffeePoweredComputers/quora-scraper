            "answer_text": "The most popular recent critique of the Twitter product is from Chris Sacca, one of Twitter's largest investors: What Twitter Can Be. In it, he calls out a few reasons why he thinks Twitter's product is not living up to it's potential. Specifically: \"(1) New user growth has stalled, (2) Almost one billion users have tried Twitter and not stuck around.\" Basically, Twitter has been able to build a massive user base, but the primary engagement comes from a small subset of users. As a metric, my guess is that their DAU/MAU (daily-active-users over monthly-active-users) is fairly low compared to other social platforms like Facebook or chat apps like WhatsApp. So that means that despite the billion users that have tried Twitter, only a small percent are actively using Twitter (and therefore, their primary form of revenue through advertising is limited).

            "answer_text": "I have never read anything about twitter having a problem, but I think I know what they are talking about. For social media websites, you have to understand that the \"product\" is what is being sold. People tend to think that youtube's product is videos and Facebook' product is a communication platform but that is missing the point. Facebook and YouTube both sell advertising to their users. The people and the delivery mechanism to the people is the product. Facebook has a kick a$$ product for advertisers because it has the best and most powerful targeting out there which allows advertisers to focus only on their customers. I almost never use twitter. I dont think I've ever seen an ad on twitter and I doubt twitter can target as well as facebook. That's a problem for twitter, because who's going to buy ads on twitter when you can get a better roi on facebook? ",
