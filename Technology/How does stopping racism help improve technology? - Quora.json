            "answer_text": "That is easy to explain when you take a reverse approach and look at Nazi Germany, the nation where extreme racism was government mandated. The key word here is \u201cbrain drain\u201d. If the Germans didn\u2019t discriminate against and wage a genocide on their own Jewish citizens, this man would probably be considered to be one of the greatest German theoretical physicists ever, if not the greatest:  Instead, he renounced his German citizenship and left the country, kickstarted the Manhattan Project that helped the USA win the war in the Pacific and is now synonymous with \u201cgenius\u201d all over the world - but not with \u201cGerman\u201d. Stop racism and make sure the next Albert Einstein stays in your country. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think stopping racism helps with the improvement of technology, but it sure would help in the workplace where differently raced people work together, they can co-operate without hate towards one another because of their background, or the colour of their skin. I think racism has more to do with culture, and the willingness to accept one another. Take the US for example. There are racist people who hate Asians, blacks, Mexicans etc. But there are also people who accept them. It is a matter of who is willing to accept them and who is willing to co-exist with said race or cultural difference. ",
