            "answer_text": "Oh !! I just found my picture which my husband took with a smart phone. I had a phone but my son wanted me to change to another one. So I said yes. I blocked all my emails and other data was transferred to new phone. I do not remember but it was his wife\u2019s phone. He bought new one for her and gave me her old one. I was happy as I could save pictures of his baby and record his small innocent activities too. When I came back my husband took me at the mall and he took this picture at home. Friends ,I wish you could see me kissing small baby one hundred times in one hour. I am so blessed that she trusted me to stay alone with cutest baby at home when both parents went outside for shopping and some alone time away from child. I called them to come back soon but they were so worry free and bought for me a diamond ring as gift for becoming a grand mother. Love my baby and his parents till I am alive. Here I am 57 years old as luckiest grand mother but so young and charming I looked with white hair covered with hat. Kids make you more young and grand kids make you younger with beautiful smile.  ",
