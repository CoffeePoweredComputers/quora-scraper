            "answer_text": "There was a recent study published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine on the accuracy of several devices. The beginning of their discussion says (emphasis added): There are three principal findings from the current study. In a diverse group of individuals: (1) most wrist-worn monitoring devices report HR with acceptable error under controlled laboratory conditions of walking, running and cycling; (2) no wrist-worn monitoring devices report EE within an acceptable error range under these conditions; (3) of the devices tested, the Apple Watch had the most favorable error profile while the Samsung Gear S2 had the least favorable error profile. There are variables that contribute to metabolism that can be hard to account for so far technologically. But, in line with that paper\u2019s comments regarding heart rate monitoring technology, I imagine calorie burn too will improve over time. ",
