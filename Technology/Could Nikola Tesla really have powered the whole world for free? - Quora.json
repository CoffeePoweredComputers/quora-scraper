            "answer_text": "No, never was his system to been free, this is the garbage made up by the morons. Secondly, Tesla never was using the potential difference between Earth and ionosphere for electricity, another pure brainless concept a caveman would design. Third, the wireless aspect was never to be airborne either, too much resistance and another moron idea. Tesla was many things, but his intelligence was so far beyond the morons today using their half-ass science trying to figure out what he was doing is a complete comedy. Tesla was transmitting energy, not through the air and it would take a Tesla\u2019s receiver to convert the energy into electricity, and it all could have been metered. One would needed to understand how Tesla\u2019s transformers worked to duplicate the receiver, and this is still unknown today; one reason because it resides outside the half-ass science being taught today. If anyone wants to truly understand Tesla, they need to get inside his brain, definitely think outside the box of today\u2019s scientific thinking and maybe then one will get a glimpse of the man and his ideas. The only people doing it today is the top-secret U.S. military and they are spending millions to deciphering his ideas. When one sees physics professors, physicists, and even students making their stupid Tesla statements, it is like watching the coyote trying to catch the roadrunner comedy. The world we see that seems so insane is the result of a belief system that is not working. To perceive the world differently, we must be willing to change our belief system, let the past slip away, expand our sense of now, and dissolve the fear in our minds. - William James ",
