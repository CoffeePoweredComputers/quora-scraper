            "answer_text": "That is a good question. In terms of what we have achieved over thousands of years, the last 50 or so years have been a joke. Sure, some impressive medical advancements have been made, programming, computer and data storage systems have made leaps and bounds, movie CGI is obviously massively improved, our portable handheld communication devices are pretty remarkable. But other than those things to say that this has been a \u201cslow period\u201d of human history is a dramatic understatement. Our species made a \u201csmall step for man, a large step for mankind\u201d and then soon after\u2026. FA for the last 50 years. No human has even left Earth\u2019s orbit in my lifetime. Energy storage and output systems compared to almost any other technology has improved BARELY. Almost everything else has either moved on a multitude of generations or left behind entire concepts to embrace something entirely new. But energy storage? Snails pace of progress over the decades. We currently drive vehicles that are still based on the core principal design that was developed 150 years ago. Sure they are shinier and have bluetooth\u2026 their engines have been tweaked and refined, but they are still essentially the SAME BASIC COMBUSTION PRINCIPAL. How the freak is this possible that we are still clinging to literal ancient technologies all this time later without moving on to the next stage yet? The problem is on multiple fronts\u2026 In our recent history we have given things \u201ccurrent worth\u201d by what they are predicted to be worth in the future, rather than simply what they are worth in this exact moment. Entire economic structures are based around this concept. This means that something that is outdated and far past it\u2019s \u201cuse by date\u201d still has been given \u201cworth\u201d tomorrow. You try to remove it, and the prediction models crash\u2026 causing massive negative effects of populations. This makes it very difficult to \u201cmove forwards\u201d if moving forwards comes with severe immediate consequences of countries economies, populations jobs and financial security etc. This system literally binds us to the past and punishes us for moving forwards to the next step in a very real way. Intentionally binding ourselves to old technologies with rewards to keep them in place and punishments for leaving them behind is not exactly helpful for an intelligent species to embrace their current potential and capabilities. It is a system that forces intellectual and technological stagnation and keeps us looking backwards instead of forwards. The other problem is that for quite some time now THE HUMAN RACE HAS NOT HAD ANY PLANS OR GOALS FOR OUR FUTURE. None in the short term, none in the long term. We are \u201cmoving forwards\u201d at astronomical speed. Attempting to \u201cprogress\u201d and an impressive rate regardless of any collateral damage that is inflicted in the momentum\u2026 towards LITERALLY NOTHING IN PARTICULAR. No plans, no strategy, no idea of a direction we would like to go as a species, no \u201cnext step\u201d towards any specific outcome. Without any kind of purpose. Right now, we are running at full pace as crazy fast as we possibly can\u2026 towards absolutely nothing. It\u2019s ridiculous\u2026 Our ancestors had inspiration and motivation to keep them goal driven. To give them something to work towards. Mainly which were initially survival, then exploration, then conquering, and then building empires. Now, our survival isn\u2019t a priority (the greatest threat to our own survival is now US), we have explored pretty much everything that we can on this planet, our ability to conquer others is severely impeded by the threat of \u201cmutual destruction\u201d if we try, and we already have our \u201cempire\u201d. The old goals as we knew them are meaningless if we don\u2019t look to \u201cnew horizons\u201d\u2026 which we currently are not. \u2026 and here is the thing. You can\u2019t \u201cget to where you are going\u201d if you have no idea in the slightest of where you are going. You can\u2019t \u201cachieve outcomes\u201d if you have none. You can\u2019t \u201cprogress\u201d without having anything to \u201cprogress towards\u201d. Even a puppy chasing it\u2019s own tail, as futile as it may be STILL HAS A GOAL, but as of recently we humans\u2026 don\u2019t even have that. We are not even \u201crunning on the spot\u201d. Instead picture billions of humans in a field running around in no particular direction, arms flailing, trying to grab everything around them all at once in a frenetic frenzy occasionally crashing into each other and then just instantly getting back up and running around again\u2026 endlessly. Well\u2026 until they stoke out and in their final moments thinking \u201cwhat happened? Where did my life go?\u201d before dying and leaving it to any surviving generations to continue the aimless frenzy. That is pretty much the human race\u2019s current condition. \u201cAimless frenzy\u201d. These days the closest to a goal that we as a species have is trying to fix our own past screwups\u2026 and arguing why we should or shouldn\u2019t and screwing things up more while we argue. That\u2019s it. That is all I\u2019ve seen happen in my life on this planet during this period of history. Talk and talk, argue and argue, make things worse in the meantime and DO f*ck all while the planet slowly suffers in the background more and more while we are endlessly distracting ourselves with our \u201cgoals of nothing at all\u201d. Which is exactly what happens when YOU HAVE NO SHORT OR LONGTERM GOALS AS A SPECIES\u2026 obviously. If your aim is to go nowhere, that\u2019s pretty much where you\u2019ll end up. ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect that there is a process that is common to all evolution on all planets. The planet evolves life, and over millions of years that life generates low entropy (high energy) bodies that get buried underground when they die. One day, one life form evolves sufficiently to exploit that energy. They burn coal, they burn oil. This species grows dramatically in population as a result. From its greater population, greater health and greater inter-communication resulting from the \u201cfree energy\u201d, it advances rapidly. It uses the energy to pull other \u201cfree resources\u201d from the ground, do build towering buildings, create roads, rail, etc. It marvels in its wondrousness. Then the species advances to the point that it realises that its own success has been built on the unsustainable extraction of its planet. It was like a tinderbox that was ready to light, and it has lit all at once. The energy and resources are depleted rapidly and the population boom stops, populations begin to decline. The waste of resources by ancestors is seen as overt and irresponsible. Life on the planet may go one of two ways. If depletion is too great, we lose energy, population, wealth and biodiversity in a runaway effect. Humans regress to middle-ages, but without the earth resources to ever industrialise again. If depletion is less then we may be able to advance beyond our reliance on earth\u2019s non-renewables, and reach an efficient and semi sustainable existence. So to answer the question. I think all civilisations go through this \u201ctinder box\u201d stage, where they find they have access to free resources. This buys them a limited window to transcend into a sustainable species. Whether humans manage to do that on Earth remains to be seen. ",
