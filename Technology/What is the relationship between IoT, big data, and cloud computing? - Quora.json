            "answer_text": "Well, think of it this way. The Internet of Things refers to putting sensors on everything and tracking it. Machines will be given IP addresses and communicate with each other. For example, a refrigerator might track what kind of food it has and once it runs out of something, it will order that. Your electricity will monitor itself and create data about how and when you use energy so it will be used more efficiently. There's a ton of applications Internet of Things  The Internet of Things, giving all these devices and people sensors, creates a lot of data on usage. This is called Big Data.  Big Data, in turn, is stored in the cloud. ",

Example:Nest is IoT for thermostats, generates tons of big data which is stored in the cloud to process and automatically set up your thermostat settings. You can add the following buzzwords to what is happening here:- machine learning: to automate IoT- mobile apps: to act as remote control- security: to secure the new end points- analytics: to analyze the data ",
