            "answer_text": "The best calculator for a math student taking math classes in high school or university is one of the models that is being used by the teacher or professor to demonstrate problem solving techniques. If the teacher is using any of the TI-83 or TI-84+ graphing calculators in class, then the TI-84+ CE Graphing Calculator is the best calculator for the students in that class. You can read why the CE is better than all the other 84\u2019s or 83\u2019s here: Why the TI-84-Plus-CE is better than all the other TI-84's If the teachers will be using the TI-nSpire graphing calculators (or another brand of graphing calculator) in class, then the best model of that calculator (that is allowed by the entire math department) will be the best. However, bear in mind that the CAS model of some calculators is not allowed by some schools or by some testing organizations (unless that calculator has an exam mode). See the website of those testing sites for details. In my opinion, this paragraph should be emphasized. Buy your student the calculator that the teacher will be teaching, except that you should, in general, buy the newest model of that calculator model. If your student is a math nerd, there is nothing wrong with getting him several different models, but don\u2019t only get him what you think is best when your opinion is different from the teachers. You will be doing your student a disservice. What did my school use? When I decided (after retirement) to take all the math classes again, I started out with the TI-84+ Silver Edition, but when I realized that the CE had seven times the memory of the SE, I knew I had to get it. I also own a TI-nSpire, an HP Prime, and a Casio fx-CG50; but the CE is the first one I reach for when I want to solve something. It is from personal experience as a retired student that I recommend that a student use what the teacher teaches with. Why is the CE better than the 84+? To give an idea of why the CE is better than the SE or the older 84\u2019s or 83\u2019s, try to plot this equation on an older 84. It can\u2019t be done except mathematically. Piecewise functions were only introduced recently and are only available on the CE, not the SE or earlier.  The CE also has seven times the user-available memory, useful if your student will try to learn programming on the calculator or will be downloading other apps. . Question originally answered: Is the TI-84+ CE the best calculator for students who are or will be taking advanced math classes at high school or university? ",
