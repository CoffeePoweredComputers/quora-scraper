But unless you\u2019re backing up irreplaceable things like home videos or something which was never released in another format, it\u2019s usually not worth bothering. The quality will only be as good as the original tape. Use the tapes as they are, then as they wear out, replace them with DVD on a tape-by-tape basis. For home videos, the best method is to get a PC capture card to which you connect a VCR, and a free or cheap video editor. You can then copy the footage to PC, edit it as you wish, and create DVDs that way. ",

            "answer_text": "A few years back I had the problem of wanting to use a videotape I had recorded, to use in my lectures at university. The video format was no longer supported by the equipment in the lecture room. The tech department copied the contents of the videotape onto a DVD. The last few years I have been using the DVD copy but the quality of the original videotape wasn\u2019t so great and now that is also reflected in the image quality on the DVD. ",
