            "answer_text": "Easily, if you go to a site that offers free books. There are many places you can go to find any number of books from throughout history all the way through to the 1940s and later. And if the author is dead and the work is out of copyright, you can download as many books as you want, all for free. However, if the books are still in print and in copyright, you will be breaking the law. People who download books without paying the author are stealing that author\u2019s work. If everyone does that, no author will be able to afford to live. Of course, you may not be over worried about that. Still, here\u2019s another little point. All the firms providing free downloads are, of course, breaking the law. They are deliberately infringing the author\u2019s copyright. They are happy to do so because most of these firms are criminal gangs in their own right. They will happily promise to download a book to you, Some may ask for your credit card details, just as a proof of your ID. If you give them your card details, you will almost certainly be robbed. But even if you don\u2019t give them your card details, usually such companies will be scamming you, not providing a download, but instead loading malware on your computer. This will invisibly hunt around your hard drive and find all your details for ID theft. Many will also hunt down your bank account and details. The short answer is, if you go to illegal sites that are providing criminal services, you can expect to be robbed. And to be frank, if you want to go to the trouble of depriving authors of their income, you deserve it. ",

            "answer_text": "Go to your local library. Most subscribe to services like Overdrive, so that they can loan out ebooks. Go to promotional sites, where authors give away copies to get reviews or to build a fan base. Instafreebie is one. Great deals on bestsellers you'll love has good deals, and giveaways, too. Go to sites where writers who are starting out offer their early works for free, to build up a fan base. There are dozens of them. What you don\u2019t want to do is pirate books. Think about it: these people have no problem taking the money out of the hands of the people who create the work that they love. Why would they have a problem with stealing your id, or putting malware on your computer, etc? You\u2019re not a friend, nor do you do anything they like. You\u2019ve got to be lower on their priority list, than the authors/musicians/etc. And, let\u2019s face it: piracy is defined by taking away the ONLY thing that lets authors, actors, and others make some return on the time and money that they\u2019ve put into making the stuff you want. That is, indeed, theft. Do the right thing, and get books legally. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you are talking about LEGALLY downloading books for free? Mercedes R. Lackey has given 3 good links below where out-of-copyright books can be found. For a book to be out of copyright, its author has to have been dead for 70 years. And then there are the giveaways from companies like Amazon, Smashwords etc. Just Google free ebooks. Of course, a retailer must have a reason for giving away current books for nothing; it might that is what the book is worth\u2026 You can pirate books but I advise against it. Firstly, you are only saving yourself a small amount and often getting a poor quality product. And secondly, it\u2019s stealing coffee out of the mouths of impoverished authors like me (yes, roughly two ebooks purchased will buy me a coffee - but no cookie to go with it). I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to do that. ",

Depending on the book you\u2019re looking for though you may have some options. The library in my town uses Overdrive and Hoopla. Overdrive (Ocean State Libraries eZone) lets users download ebooks for 21 days. At the end of the 21 days the file will automatically lock and you won\u2019t be able to access it again. If you weren\u2019t done you\u2019d have to re-download it. Hoopla (https://www.hoopladigital.com/)lets you borrow a set number of titles per month. This service focuses more on other media (movies, CD\u2019s) but has some books as well. These are the services that allow you to borrow ebooks at no cost. Some companies like Amazon have a subscription service where you can read select ebooks from their catalog, but you need to pay for the service. If you\u2019re looking for something to read for fun or a school reading assignment these might be helpful. ",
