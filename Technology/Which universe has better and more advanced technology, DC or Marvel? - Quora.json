            "answer_text": "Depends. DC has motherbox, time portals, and inter dimensional tech. DC time travel works over the same timeline -probably due the way time travel affects the reality, the CW way-. They have meta dampeners and aparently inter dimenional travel dampeners. Wait, and quantum computers. Brainiac species can digitalize full planets. Mobius could build an anti-matter weapon, able to vaporize all the reality, using technology from Earth 1 and 2. The most advanced tech probably was the Time Master\u2019s Oracle, or the 3D organic printing -since anyone can perform TT, aparently-. A 3D printer is aparently able to clone a full functional adult -Ava Sharp(12)-. Or Kriptonian Tech. From portals to unbreakable cloths. Marvel in the other hand. Time travel -lineal time line in comics-. Clean energy sources -arc reactor-, cool holograms, etc. Magic manipulation by Shury, the Agamoto Eye or Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. Magic is a force. Vibranium based Tech like guns and suites. Dr. Cho developed a 3D organic printer, but it requires vibranium. Is biocompatible, not the same DNA. Sorry Marvel. The writters have the last word. ",

            "answer_text": "Both Marvel and DC have very high tech worlds, people, and individuals. Portrayal of that tech however appears more in DC, and used more often, but the consequences/morality of that techs use is portrayed better in Marvel. Individuals, like Stark really like to showcase his tech (he's a showman) and Avengers have his tech, the other tech is either tied up in Fantastic Four, Dr. Doom, and Shield (almost forgot Ant Man). Asgard has magic-tech (celestial enhanced and unchanged in several thousands of years), Kree/Skrull/Shi'ar/Nova and others have tech but the stories are tied to \u201cgalactic\u201d heroes, and they take the tech for granted (maybe not Rocket, he'll find a way to kit something). The X-Men used to have a gadget guy (Forge) but he got killed off in the early 1990\u2032s and one of the bad countries (made up to mimic South Africa and Apartheid but a very tech savvy place where they used mutants as slaves and weapons) went away after the country was devastated by Magneto, then later brought back for Magneto and mutants to live in peace (but then something happened to wipe it all away again). In DC, almost all the heroes show off some tech (Wonder Woman's invisible jet\u2026well she flying now in the comics, so that's moot), Justice League (current year) has Bat-tech and if they tie in Green Arrow $, more Bruce Wayne and Krypton tech is underlying in the Hall of Justice. Future Legion of Superheroes have flying rings, shield rings, space suits, ships, Sci-Police, etc. The main bad guy (Darkseid) has tech galore as does Lex 1990's,. ",
