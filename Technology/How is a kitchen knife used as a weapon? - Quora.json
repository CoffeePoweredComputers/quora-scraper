            "answer_text": "The pointy end goes into the other person. Pretty simple. Or the sharp edge is used to open a larger hole in the other person. If you need to crush something on the other person, the blunt edge of the handle makes for a simple bashing instrument. Pretty pedestrian question really. A rock or heavy glass could be a weapon when picked up and used on another. The person holding the item is the weapon. The item is a means of delivering harm in their hands. Until that point it is inert. ",
