            "answer_text": "The question assumes the United States, and civilization itself, has another 50\u2013100 years of history left to it. Assuming dire events do not supervene\u2014and assuming fifty to a hundred years of a Royal Straight Flush of Trumps\u2014I will venture: SpaceX takes it to the next level, by building a true space-to-space ship that can fly interplanetary missions with ease. As a corollary to this, we see new cities with these names: Selenopolis, Areopolis, and Nephelopolis (or perhaps Cynthiopolis). I\u2019ll give you a hint: that last city will be on (or rather in the atmosphere of) the planet Venus. I\u2019ll let you guess where the other cities might stand.Controlled fusion finally comes on-line, in time to compete with SpaceX\u2019s other major accomplishment: a network of solar batteries in space beaming their energy to energy-hungry cities. Out in Sticksville, farms will have solar batteries and wind turbines as commonly as today they have windmills. They\u2019ll need those to run their electric tractors, harvesters, and other equipment.Additive manufacturing (\u201c3D printing\u201d) will cause the springing-up of hundreds of cottage artisanal industries.Almost as a corollary to this, law enforcement and homeland defense will decentralize. \u201cGun control\u201d will be impossible when anyone can act as his own gunsmith. So instead, police agencies will ally with the citizens they are sworn \u201cto protect and to serve,\u201d and lay aside the not-quite-hostility too many police department display today. Militia, within the original meaning of the Second Amendment, will once again form an integral part of the layered defense the United States enjoyed shortly after recognition of its independence.",

            "answer_text": "It would be great if we can make our highways much better like when they were first implemented so many years ago. Right now in many places traffic is just absurd. It would also be nice if we can make more friends or at least neutral acquaintances, than enemies. But that just depends who happens to be in power at the time. Not getting rid of Affordable Care Act, but to work on it to make it better. Or if you can create a better one, by all means do so, but make sure everyone is covered. No more homelessness would be nice as well, although some people like to live like that and answer to no one. Everyone has a job and no more welfare or food stamps except for those who actually truly need it. Like transitioning between jobs or they are really disabled. Having our people come off of illegal drugs completely and those legal drugs that are used unwisely. Better eating habits for all our citizens. Still freedom of choice, but people being fully aware of their actions. Better internet service around the country, although this is more a selfish request\u2026 ^_^ ",

Much political power de-centralized from Washington D.C. to the states, per the original Constitutional framework.Re-establishment of the Pax Americana that more or less existed after WW-2, and peacefully ending the Cold War in the late 1980\u2019s \u2026 but other nations like Japan and Western Europe paying their appropriate share.China gives up their quest for dominance of East Asia, as does radical jihadist Islam in the Middle East.Expansion of nuclear power for greener energy using partially depleted uranium, and perhaps even fusion power from sea water and essentially zero pollution.",
