            "answer_text": "Why I bought the iPhone SE in 2018. Small miracle It was not an impulsive purchase. I've been thinking about him for a long time. Whatever you may say, the iPhone SE is an absolutely unique smartphone. Not only among other iPhones, but also in the market as a whole. One of a kind small flagship with unique advantages and no real drawbacks. Even the owner of an iPhone X may want to buy an iPhone SE. Desire is absolutely normal. So I could not resist. I hold in my hands a 128-gigabyte model and have no regrets. As many as five things in it are not found in any other iPhone. 1. This case is IDEAL  No matter how much I liked the steel \u201cremnant\u201d of the iPhone X, not one Apple smartphone reached the perfect style of the iPhone 5, 5s and SE. Sharp sharpened edges. Organic glass inserts in the back. Ideal shades of colors without a single unsuccessful - I want anyone, even pink. Brushed aluminum. Yes, this is a \"bar\", and now such a design seems to be out of fashion. But every time I see an iPhone SE on the table, it\u2019s hard not to allow myself to pick it up. As if this beauty was turned from a single piece of metal. I admit that I am in the minority. That most will prefer some 6s for a similar amount. But for me they are incredibly boring against the background of the SE. Neither the iPhone 6 nor the iPhone 8 evokes such sensations. The only complaint - the face cut into the hand, but you get used to it. Yes, and you can buy a case. And I do not want, so stylish thing once turned out at Apple. 2. It is very FAST. Fulminant I remind you that the iPhone SE is equal to the iPhone 6s in terms of characteristics: A9 processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM. In the Android world, two gigabytes can only be made fun of. But in the Apple world, this is enough for great performance. 2 years after the announcement, iPhone SE continues to amaze with the speed of work. Between him and the iPhone 5s - the abyss of opportunities. When the 5s is stupid, the SE doesn't even stutter. And all modern applications and games are compatible with SE, including advanced PUBG or Fortnite. There is one more important thing. So I have never been a fan of the trend to sculpt space resolution screens into smartphones. Pixels difficult to distinguish? Great, that's enough. The relatively small display of the iPhone SE gives it a lethal advantage over the similar in characteristics of the iPhone 6s. No wonder that benchmark is worse. When less resources are spent on maintaining extra pixels, even the iOS system menus tritely open faster. I speak from the experience of testing iOS 11.3 beta 6. As a result, the owner of the iPhone SE enjoys instant opening of all applications, smooth animation, quick switching and other pleasures of life, which are easy to forget, being the owner of a technically more advanced, but as yet unfinished iPhone X. 3. This is the most convenient iPhone of all. The first days after the purchase, I caught myself thinking: trying to use this small device with two hands, and it turns out so-so. Just because you can\u2019t beat a few years of using the iPhone Plus, and X cannot be called fully one-handed. In the world of big smartphones, the iPhone SE is an anomaly. After all, it can never be taken in the second hand. Type messages on the go, open and interact with notifications, reach the edge of the screen to the opposite hand. This is strange, nice and definitely great. The iOS interface is absolutely normal and looks organic on a small scale. I would even say that iOS 11 looks better on the screen of the SE than on the iPhone X: the clumsy minimalism of the Cupertins there to face. The text scale for some seems too large, but it is easily corrected in Settings. Personally, I like setting one division below the standard \u2014 within my use habits (and the screen's distance from the face) I lose nothing and at the same time I see more on each screen of the system. The size as a whole makes the iPhone SE the ideal second smartphone for those who are not ready to go on Android. Especially with the following chips. 4. iPhone SE works MAGICALLY LONG  Once Apple did not seek to reduce the body in favor of autonomous work. Therefore, iPhone SE manages to work longer than most other, expensive iPhones. The iPhone SE runs for 2 hours longer than the iPhone 6s with the same iron \u2014 9 and a half hours with moderate continuous load versus 7 and a half hours. They solve a relatively large battery, a small energy-efficient screen and a minimum of useless frills. The vitality of SE allows you not to bathe with it as a backup smart. I threw it in my bag, I forgot it for a day or two. And when it is needed, it will be discharged to a maximum of 20%, and the balance will be exactly enough for a whole day of battery life. Less than a week after the day of purchase, and my iPhone SE already helped me out twice when the battery on the main iPhone X was discharged. Then why buy a \u201cdialer\u201d or \u201cbucket\u201d if you can stay in the Apple ecosystem with one of the most successful devices of the company at a low price? So I decided the same way. 5. It is practically worthless. That month in a row, the iPhone SE is selling right and left. I saw prices around 12 thousand rubles for a new smartphone! Not recovered. You can be bent and take a model of 128 gigabytes. And you can search a little longer and find the 16 gig version already out of production for relative pennies. This is definitely enough if you use the device as a secondary. I sincerely do not know a single smartphone in Russia, which will give the same level of speed, battery life, usability, support for top applications and games. Oh yeah, another cool design, which is now not even find the flagships without a magnifying glass and the game \"find 5 differences.\" It is impossible to compete with him, so no one even tries. Yes, you can buy a \"xiaomi\" the size of a shovel, fantasize about its coolness, but secretly sit your pants on the forum 4pda in search of a solution to the next proprietary problem of Chinese androids. But we will be smarter here, right? The moral is simple. Take the iPhone SE. Do not wait for SE 2. Even when it comes out, you will sell yours for a similar amount and you will not really lose anything. Respect those people in Apple who made this smartphone. More to these. ============Upvotes my answer, if you agree with me=============== ",

            "answer_text": "Apple iPhone SE - Is it worth considering? Please note, this answer is for Indian market only. Apple announced their latest iPhone a few days back, the iPhone SE. It is a fusion between an iPhone 5S and an iPhone 6S. I feel it is a much better experiment from the cupertino company than the age old iPhone 5C which was a disappointment. But is iPhone SE a worthy option and will it sell as much as the flagship iPhones? Let's try and find an answer for that. Let me give you a quick recap of the important specs of the iPhone SE - Body identical to iPhone 5S (123x58x7.6mm, 113 gms)4 inch IPS LCD display with 326 ppi  A very capable Apple A9 processor with 2GB RAM 16/64 GB storage iOS 9.3An excellent 12 MP rear camera and 1.2 MP front camera1642 mAh battery Fingerprint sensorKeeping the specs aside, The biggest bummer for us Indians is the price tag (Apple does it again). In USA, it will sell for 399 USD (About 27000 INR) but in India, it will cost a whopping 39000 INR, which is insane. Apple is trying to establish itself in the Indian market and these insane initial pricing will hurt that plan. But that's how Apple does its business and they are doing amazingly well. As far as the phone is concerned, I feel it is a very good smartphone. Apart from the smaller 4 inch screen, everything is flagship grade. Based on the current trends and my personal preference, 4.7 inch to 5 inch is the sweet spot for screen size but there will always be a demand for 4 inch phones. Smaller screen size does affect media consumption (like photo viewing, video watching) and internet browsing but for some people, it is not a deal breaker. In that size, you get a very good camera, one of the best processor in a smartphone right now, fingerprint sensor, assured software updates for years to come. But again I can't help but get back to the asking price in the Indian market. 40K is just too much when it is in a body that is same as the iPhone 5S which is selling for less than half of that. By using the same design, Apple was able to cut costs further and it shows in the 400 USD price tag, but that benefit didn't pass down to the Indian market. Buying an iPhone 6S which is available for as low as 41K or even iPhone 6 for 33K makes more sense to me than buying an iPhone SE for 40K and this is when I am ignoring the options in Android altogether. A price tag of 32K-35K would have been competitive and would have helped Apple solidify its position in the market. With a price tag of 40K, I don't see it happening. There is no doubt that it will do very well in its home market (USA) but this will be difficult in India. ",
