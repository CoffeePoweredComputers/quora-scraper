            "answer_text": "Nahla, I guess when you think about it, technology and music have been with us, witness, Beethovens early devices to aid in his deafness. Music went thru many transformations from early sound recordings by Edison, piano rolls, these could be considered technological advances. I think what youre referring to is current issues. In 1970, I was using cassette players to record, then, reel to reel, then DAT machines, finally machines that can record to CD. Now I am using the Zoom R16. An amazing machine. Kind of a learning curve, I was afraid to touch it for a while. But I finally got the DVD tutorial and went thru the manual, and was able to record something in a a couple of hours.Technology has brought music production to the home. No longer is it absolutely necessary to go to a studio. Of course if you can thats great. But new technology in the form of the DX7 as an instrument is an example. The most important technological thing is your brain, which computes, in some ways, faster than a computer. But really, thru innovative inventions, music can be recorded nd preserved on a thumb drive. Its amazing. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great question. Producing Music these days strongly depends on well functioning computers and audio equippment. It doesn't matter if you make music with aucustic instruments or synthesize the sound, you depend on your PC. Synthesizing music in real time is a very cpu intensve task that lets modern cpus struggle. And acoustic music can be processed a lot faster with a computer than with a tape machine. Music now is a part of the digital enviroment you see every day on the internet and it is honestly a good thing, because it makes the internet much more enjoyable. Youtube wouldn't be YouTube without music. Hence music creates the need for faster internet. There will always be a demand for acoustic technology solutions. Telecommunication has benefited from the improvement of microphones and speakers. ",
