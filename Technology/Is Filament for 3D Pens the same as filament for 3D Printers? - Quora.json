            "answer_text": "There are 3 key features to assume about 3d pens: they heat enough but not over 200\u00b0C; you hold them in your hand; what you are goind to build. Most of the 3d pens need 1.75 mm diameter filament and for this reason you can use/buy 3d printers\u2019 filament, with 200\u00b0C or less melting temperature (mostly it is going to be PLA, ABS, PLA blended with other things). As in the introduction, you have to check the length of the filament in order to fit your hand/arm and the fina project. with this in mind 3d pen manifacturers have a special stock of shot filaments or little spool, about 50 gr. If you want to buy filament for your 3d pen, but you want to save money with 3d printers spools, as 0,75 or 1 kg, you can. If you want to be able to print with a full 1 kg spool, you need to create a spool holder (or buy one), or check thingiverse, myminifactory or cults3d for a project to print/build. If you want just 50gr of filament, you can check on some sites where you can choose sample spools of about 50gr, as the one you can buy as \u201cfor 3d pen\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, yes. You have to know the specifics of the pen, though. Most 3d pens use the same 1.75mm PLA or ABS filaments as the desktop 3D printers, but a few use a special low temperature plastic that\u2019s safer for children, and a few others - like the original 3doodler pen - use 3mm filament. If the specific pen you\u2019re considering lists either PLA or ABS plastics and 1.75mm diameter, you should be good to go buying either of these as you would for most 3d printers. Be advised, though, that most printer filament is sold in 1kg spools (2.2 lbs), and one of these will last a very long time. Amazon and some of the other markets sell samplers with a dozen or so colors of filament in shorter coils that you can buy reasonably cheaply that will give enough variety to do quite a few projects. The larger spools are quite a bit cheaper overall, but you\u2019ll get only one color. ",
