            "answer_text": "The question if taken literally of what you ask is asking when it will be available across the United States on all the major wireless networks. That will take several years. The US is a big area and has a lot of space between LA and NYC. If you live in one of these mega cities then the 5G networks will roll out later this year and the coming years. If you live in the majority of the US then you might not see 5G for a very long time. The reason is the range of broadcasting the signal. The signal is substantially shorter than 4G and requires many more nodes in a given area than 4G. You can put this node on street lamps, stop lights, building, and other close proximity structures. Sprint and T-Mobil use the towers from Verizon and AT&T mostly and the others do the same of all of them. When Verizon and AT&T put up more towers then the others will gain 5G access for the most part. They have some of their own but mainly rely on AT&T and Verizon towers for much of their nationwide access coverage. ",
