            "answer_text": "YouTube videos vary in bitrate from 70 Mbps to 0.7 Mbps. Assuming the worst case scenario: 2 hours * 60 minutes / hour = 120 minutes120 minutes * 60 seconds / minute = 7200 seconds7200 seconds * 70 megabits / second = 504000 megabits504000 megabits / 8 bits / byte = 63000 megabytes63000 megabytes / 1000 megabytes / gigabyte = 63 GBSo, streaming a 4k 60 fps video from YouTube for 2 hours would be about 63 GB of data transfer. Streaming a 240p 30 fps video from YouTube for 2 hours would be about 630 MB. So, somewhere between 630 MB and 63 GB, depending on what you streamed. ",

            "answer_text": "The other answers on this question answer the amount of data for 1080p and lower. I though it was interesting to investigate how much data a 4K video on youtube would roughly use. I downloaded a 4K youtube video the other day for offline watching. It was 17 minutes long and takes 2.17 GB of space. For the sake of science I downloaded another two 4K videos from Youtube. One was 5:33 long and takes 590mb of space on my drive. The other was 5:41 long and takes 713mb of space on my drive.(Note the space difference here despite being about the same length) Now some math: 2170 (mb) / 17 (minutes) = 128mb per minute.590 / 5.33 = 110mb per minute.713 / 5.41 = 131mb per minute. 128 + 110 + 131 = 369 / 3 = 123mb on average per minute with these 3 videos. This is of course not a scientifically correct number but will give us a rough idea. 123 * 60 = 7.380mb per hour (7.4GB)123 * 120 = 14.760mb per two hours (14.8GB) Wow, I did not expect such a high amount of bandwith usage per hour when watching Youtube videos in 4K. But with the amount of pixels, send over to your device at 30 frames per second, it is a realistic number. Overall on 4k, or UHD to be specific you display a whopping 248.832.000 pixels per second on your screen. ",
