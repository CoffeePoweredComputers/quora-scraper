            "answer_text": "Optical fiber feeds the cellular towers that will eventually provide 5G. I'm not sure if that is what you are looking for or were you trying to get more of a comparison? There's really no comparison if you want to compare a home with a fiber connection to the internet vs a home only using 5G to get their internet. In today's world, fiber will always win. In tomorrow's world, I feel fiber will still be the clear winner, as 5G has a lot of obstacles in iits way. The key advantage of 5G is that cellular service companies do not have to run a fiber to your home for them to be able to sell you their service, they just blanket the area with their cellular signal and you get service. The fiber provider does have to run a fiber to your home for it to work, but once that fiber is there, you will always have the speed and bandwidth that you pay for. 5G on the other hand will have problems, such as the frequency it will run on is very high, meaning it has problems penetrating objects, like glass, wood, rubber, metal, concr6and other common materials that we use to build our homes, cars, restaurants and most buildings. This has already been shown to be the case in test markets where the user had to go outside and move around to an open location to get actual 5G. That's why AT&T coded their phones to indicate 5G as long as you are on a 4G or better connection, because if you actually see how often you are not on 5G you will get upset and complain. So far the FCC hasnt made them change that, but they are being forced to pull their 5G advertising. Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I hope that answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "They go together like peanut butter and jelly. Well kind of. Fiber is an enabler to the massive data tsunami that 5G promises to deliver over cellular networks. In the US, companies like AT&T and Verizon have been laying several thousand miles of fiber to support their 5G rollouts. Optical fiber equipment manufacturers are also gearing up for 5G\u2019s demand by pushing speeds well past 400 Gbps. We\u2019re not seeing these type of speeds over traditional copper networks. As 5G is deployed in various countries around the world, expect to see fiber demand grow in proportion. ",
