            "answer_text": "well, if you\u2019re the tinfoil hat type, the \u201chidden bluetooth device\u201d in question should have some input, like a mic or camera - you know, so the russkies can spy on your secret experiments with pumping the essense of rap music into animal body parts, so I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s one of those \u201cbug\u201d style listening devices. All you really need is to build a device (or buy one, they\u2019re not that hard to find) that sniffs out the frequency changes in an average bluetooth range, say, 2.4 Ghz. the problem is, you\u2019ll get WIFI interference too, so it won\u2019t be particularly useful. One other thing you could do is something you\u2019ve always been able to do with a computing device with a bluetooth radio in it. run a \u201cpair\u201d sequence and see what pops up. unless it\u2019s a particularly intelligent bluetooth \u201cbug\u201d it will send a reply string if a computing device sends a \u201chello\u201d string, and you\u2019ll know something is amiss. Remember, bluetooth\u2019s range is around 33 meters for most devices with walls and doors reducing that number considerably so finding a receiver should be a simple matter of elimination. (consequently, any good spy won\u2019t be using something so ghetto as a bluetooth anything, as bluetooth has so short a range and the radios are due to FCC emasculation techniques. You won\u2019t know what frequency your spy will be using. So be good!) ",

            "answer_text": "How do I find a hidden Bluetooth device? Visual inspection. Good luck with that though. A BT device can be as small as a coin-sized battery. Assuming the BT device is On and it's either in pairing mode or paired with another device\u2026 Turn your smartphone BT on and let it search for BT devices. It will list BT devices within range, including possibly your neighbors'. Any look odd or unknown? Use a spectrum analyzer and a loop antenna/probe. Turn off all electronic devices in the immediate area. Scan and locate any source with emissions centered on 2.4 GHz. ",
