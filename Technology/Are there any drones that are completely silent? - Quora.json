            "answer_text": "A Mavic 2 is the quietest of the larger camera drones and anything like a Spark or Mavic Air, or even a Pro is lots louder. People can\u2019t hear a Mavic 2 at a 150 or 200 feet, but everybody would be looking for an Inspire, which is a big, badass drone, or an Air which is small, but is obnoxiously loud. Some of the little Whoop class and larger drones are quieter than others. A TinyHawk Freestyle is quiet at 100 feet but much closer and it\u2019s like a swarm of bees. And, they\u2019ve only got several minutes battery life, enough for a race, and they don\u2019t have good cameras, only enough to support FPV goggles. I don\u2019t know of a \u2018completely silent\u2019 drone in production, although searching gets you to some experimental drones with some kind of ion propulsion, or maybe an ornithopter that\u2019s interesting but no real solution yet. I don\u2019t drones are a good way to sneak up on people or critters if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got in mind, and \u2018peeping\u2019 into private areas with a drone is illegal in most places\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is ever completely silent, but there are drones that glide that would be close to silent, even if they went right by your ear. There are also underwater drone \u201cgliders\u201d that can cross vast distances and obtain propulsion through variation in buoyancy and then move underwater through this. There are also airship drones that use helium for lift and low-speed propellers for control and propulsion - these are incredibly quiet - and there\u2019s even some that swim through the air like a fish or a bird. Anything with a propeller will cause noise - because moving air around is noise - but a lot of newer quadcopters are quite quiet and you generally won\u2019t hear them if they are a few hundred feet away.
