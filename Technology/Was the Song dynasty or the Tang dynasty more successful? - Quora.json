            "answer_text": "Tang , it took all of China proper , created a stable society . There were little rebellion from society up til an lu Shan rebellion( a military one ) There was also a label of \u201c \u76db\u4e16\u201d which han / tang had but not song. While song was culturally more advanced it was beset by peasant rebellions which points to an oppressve society . It was also almost always under threat from a northern invasion and reduced to a vassal state status. Tang built a more powerful state more stable society . Song had a more advance elitist culture . Likely shitty to live in if you're not well to do . ",
