            "answer_text": "Yes! It just gets really messy really fast. In theoretical science we always start with the simplest model of the system\u2014say approximating molecular bond vibrations as harmonic oscillators\u2014and see how well it represents what is really happening. For the most part, these simple models do a pretty good job of getting you close to the physical reality or at least qualitatively describing what the trends are (such as how pressure increases if you decrease volume at constant temperature). In classes, you\u2019ll encounter the ideal formulations first. If everything was nice and neat and perfect, the formulas are simpler and easier to understand. When you want to get a description that is closer to what you see in the real world, you can account for the non-ideality of the system. If we stick with the harmonic oscillator model, this means adding in terms to account for anharmonicity. In thermodynamics, there are non-ideal Gibbs energies, as an example. You will likely encounter these in upper level courses that focus more specifically on a topic (like a class focused entirely on thermodynamics). ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The vast majority of thermodynamics deals with non ideal systems. Ideal systems are used to introduce students to the basic concepts of thermo. But once beyond that the real fun begins with concepts like chemical potential, activity, fugacity, virial equations, and so much more! ",
