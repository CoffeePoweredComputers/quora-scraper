            "answer_text": "Light is a form of electromagnetic energy just like radio. It\u2019s just at a much higher frequency. One key difference is that radio signals tend to spread out the farther they get from a transmitter. Lasers use coherent light (a single color) and disperse very little. They are a point to point form of communication. That\u2019s why they are used from earth stations to satellites and from satellites to satellites. Because of this tight beam, they are very energy efficient, and harder to jam and intercept. They can also send data much faster. We learned long ago that the higher the frequency the signal the more data that can be put on the signal. Whereas radio signals began using AM and FM to put voice on the radio, light-based signals are usually digitally encoded. They turn the light on and off billions of times/second. On represents a digital \u201cone\u201d and off representing a digital \u201czero\u201d. If you look at the core of the Internet, most of the data transferred between core routers is in the form of light passed through fiber optic cables. Sending signals between satellites is the same without the fiber optical cable. They just beam the light directly using computers and pointing systems to point exactly where you want to send the signal. ",

            "answer_text": "Very few do, because it\u2019s an expensive system. It requires very precise pointing and navigation knowledge and control, that many satellites do not have. In addition, it\u2019s a rather expensive system. The few that do are basically pulsing digitally in a format (on/off duration) that a photo-receptor receives, usually with filters for a specific frequency of light to minimize noise from other sources (basically the Sun). And, very few satellites have actual satellite to satellite links. GPS uses a broad coverage radio broadcast signal, but other satellites do not communicate back. ",
