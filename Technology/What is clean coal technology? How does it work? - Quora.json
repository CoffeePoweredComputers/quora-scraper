            "answer_text": "Most of clean coal technology was grinding coal finely and putting into a fluidized bed to remove the Pyrite. The Pyrite is FeS2, which burns producing a gas that combines with water to make Sulfuric Acid. It is expensive to do. The other part of technology relating to the clean use of coal is exhaust scrubbers to remove pollutants from power plant exhaust. Also expensive. The only person I know of who believes in clean coal as a technology that is economical is Donald Trump. ",
