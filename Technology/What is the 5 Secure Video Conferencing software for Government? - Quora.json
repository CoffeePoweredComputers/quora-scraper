            "answer_text": "If security of communications is the major concern, one has to opt for on-premise software since it enables users to take full control of their data. Given this consideration, your choice will narrow down to very few options such as: TrueConf Server: a self-hosted video conferencing solution that incorporates multiple security safeguards like media data encryption, mandatory authorization, and proprietary codecs making it impossible to reproduce video streams. Besides, this software supports video conferences with up to 300 participants and enables users to communicate from PCs and mobile devices.Skype for Business Server: server-based software allowing instant audio/video calls and instant messaging. This solution also has video conferencing capabilities, but much will depend on the package you have. It also may be a good fit for government organizations.Cisco Meeting Server: premises-based software designed for video conferencing in business settings or government agencies. This software supports TSL encryption and NTP authentication keys; so, it can keep your communications safe.",
