            "answer_text": "I learned about global warming in 3rd grade, which would have been 1974\u201375. At that time, it was a hypothesis. By the time I was in college and heard about it again an educational setting, it was about 1991. It was accepted science by then. that was 29 years ago. We\u2019ve done next-to-nothing. Exxon Mobile knew about climate change in the 70s, as shown by their own documents. They have documents showing they saw global warming as helping them, since the arctic would be free of ice (allowing drilling) more months of the year. Yet they paid big money to promote the myth that global warming was a myth. (This is well known.) President Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, an agreement that was signed on by every other country in the world. To have every country in the world agree to something is unprecedented. Even if we pulled out all the stops, it would be hard going. We aren\u2019t going to pull out all the stops. We just won\u2019t. No, we will not be able to overcome global warming/climate change. What will happen is that the disasters, civil wars, refugee movement will cost taxpayers more and more and more. There will be unrest, wars, people fighting over water, then over food. Countries will be taken over by authoritarians as poeple become more and more afraid of the effect of refugees coming to their country (not unfounded). The unrest, wars, poverty, resource scarcity will cause more and more problems until the unrest will be greater than anything we\u2019ve seen before. In the United States, as the western United States starts to fall, that is when we will hit the downward spiral that we won\u2019t be able to recover from. The plastic pollution will exacerbate the situation, and in fact might end up causing more problems sort-term than climate change. The best hope is that most people in the world die in a short time period. I hope that I am wrong. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen, doesn\u2019t have to happen. The untold suffering keeps me awake at night. But it might the best for humanity, the earth, and all the species if that happens. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see why we all can\u2019t just demand cheap clean energy. We\u2019re going to need it to power ten billion people at high standards, anyways. I\u2019m trying to save money to invest in Tesla, however, I\u2019m forced to continue within the dino paradigm (got to drive to work). Here\u2019s proof that deniers are WRONG. GHG induced radiative forcing is a thing that\u2019s just as real as any other physics. Once they learn the physics, they\u2019ll start saying \u201cbut it\u2019s still ok to warm the planet\u201d (in fact, they are already doing so, using the way it was hundreds of millions of years ago as a pretence)! Why is it that deniers accept the fact that scientists know what the sun is made out of, or that Pangea was real, but not the extra radiative forcing (global warming)? For the same reason, we will probably not solve the challenge and humanity will succumb to economic collapse into an overheated biosphere. All we need is primary clean energy. Solar, wind, nuclear, you know, ALL of them! Batteries are getting cheaper and better, too. Here\u2019s a link about CHEAP SOLAR! 8 Countries (Besides the US) With Solar Under $25 per Megawatt-Hour We\u2019ve the solutions but not the will. ",
