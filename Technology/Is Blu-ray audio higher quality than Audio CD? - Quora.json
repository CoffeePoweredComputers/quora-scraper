            "answer_text": "It certainly can be, by a long shot. CD audio, specifically as defined in the Red Book standard, consists of two channels (stereo) of 16-bit, 44.1 KHz linear-PCM audio. As I understand it, the standard can, theoretically, incorporate quadraphonic audio (i.e., 4 channels of audio), but no CD audio player ever implemented it, and no discs contain it. There are a few CDs that, instead of containing linear-PCM audio, contained DTS 5.1-encoded audio (a lossy, multichannel format also employed on some DVD-Video titles and some Blu-ray Disc titles) in its 1509 Kbps mode, but those are rare, and technically don't fall within the Red Book specifications. Blu-ray Disc, by comparison, can support several audio formats: Multi-channel LPCM, with sample rates of 48, 96, or 192 KHz, in 16, 20, or 24-bit sample depth, in 1 to 5.1 channels, or 7.1 channels in 48 or 96 KHz sample ratesDolby TrueHD (a lossless audio codec, derived from Meridian Lossless Packing format), with the same sample rate restrictions as LPCMDTS-HD Master Audio (also lossless, implemented as an extension over the core DTS bitstream format), with sample rates of 48, 96, or 192 KHz, in 16, 20, or 24-bit sample depth, in 1 to 7.1 channelsDolby Digital Plus (E-AC3), with a sample rate of 48 KHz, in 16, 20 or 24-bit sample depth, in 1 to 7.1 channels, with encoded bitrates up to 6 MbpsDTS-HD High Resolution (a lossy codec, but supporting higher bitrates than core DTS, also implemented as an extension over core DTS), with sample rates of 48 or 96 KHz, in 16, 20, or 24-bit sample depth, in 1 to 7.1 channels, with encoded bitrates up to 6 MbpsConventional Dolby Digital audio, with a sample rate of 48 KHz, in 16-bit sample depth, in 1 to 5.1 channels (though it can support a matrixed surround back channel if the encoder is licensed for and supports Dolby Digital EX), with encoded bitrates up to 640 Kbps (TrueHD and DD+ streams also contain a Dolby Digital companion stream for compatibility with older Blu-ray Disc players and receivers that don't understand those newer, advanced codecs)Conventional DTS audio, with sample rates of 48 or 96 KHz, in 16, 20 or 24-bit sample depth, in 1 to 5.1 channels (or up to 7.1 channels if the encoder is licensed for and implements DTS-ES Matrix and/or Discrete extension modes), with encoded bitrates of 754.5 or 1509 Kbps (compatibility with older players and receivers is maintained by the DTS core/extension bitstream structure; if a decoder doesn't implement DTS-HD HR or MA decoding, those extensions are simply ignored)Also, the new DTS:X and Dolby Atmos object based formats, which are implemented as extensions on top of DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD, respectively; each implements a \u201cbed\u201d of the base format, with audio object metadata embedded in the stream, allowing hardware that doesn't know about the object format to ignore it and decode it as per usualThe Blu-ray Disc standard only requires LPCM, core DTS and basic Dolby Digital decoding, but most players these days implement TrueHD and DTS-HD MA as well. Object based audio requires bitstreaming to a compliant receiver. So TL;DR: Yes, Blu-ray Disc supports much higher quality audio than CD. ",
