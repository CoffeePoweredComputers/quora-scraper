            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a huge library user myself, but I have been in the past and I know quite a few librarians, and by all accounts, libraries are nowhere near dying out - in some senses, they\u2019re thriving. Librarians are among the first professionals in society to have understood the full impact of the growth of the Internet. They have been acutely aware of what it is and its implications much earlier than anyone other than the technologists creating the Internet tools themselves. And the perspective of librarians is very wide, so it\u2019s not controversial to say that they understood better than the techies what the broader social implications would be. Consequently, libraries have been under constant and rapid development and change since the early 90s. Librarians bring unique skills to the Internet world, and they are masters at collecting, organizing, and making available masses of information, and also going further and collecting enough different materials to allow information to be appropriately contextualized. The older model of a lending library that makes the latest bestsellers accessible might not be super healthy (though it may be OK, I\u2019m simply not sure about that side of things), but if you're looking at the larger mandate of collecting and making information available, they\u2019re uniquely positioned to do this effectively.

            "answer_text": "Public libraries are very advanced in technology. For the most part, you can use your library from home. Also, libraries are a very organic purpose in the community serving all members. They reach out to all ages, types, and interests with fervor and entertainment. Why would they die out? They\u2019ve been around for centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "For many people, libraries are where they go to interact with technology. Libraries are funded by local municipalities. 95%-99% of funding for most public libraries in the United States and Canada comes from local and state taxes. If they die, it will not be because people don\u2019t need or use them. It will be because a vocal minority succeed in murdering them, along with other necessary local services. ",
