            "answer_text": "This is a tough question to answer because the topic is so broad and varies so much from organization to organization. In short, though: DAM involves determining and enforcing policies that govern how your digital content is stored and used. That is absolutely an oversimplification but, at its core, that's pretty much what DAM is all about. Now, to make that possible, the following are considered:  Defining those policiesTraining users about those policiesConfiguring software to help enforce those policies through compliant storage and access to the contentMonitoring it all to make sure its working and continues to make sense\"Policy\" is the primary reason why file servers and file sharing services, like Dropbox or Google Drive, are not truly DAM options. For example, I can share a file with you using any of those options. But am I permitted to do so? Have the proper approvals been granted? Is there an embargo in effect? Am I permitted to share that type of content outside my organization? Would sharing that particular piece of content be a copyright or license violation? When properly configured, a DAM software system will save users from having to guess any of these things. Or, at the very least, it will enable them to figure out what the answers to those questions might be. In essence, DAM is not the \"can I?\" of content sharing and use; but the \"may I?\" of content sharing and use. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Digital asset management is all about: Having access to all your files,Keeping control of them, and,Being able to share them with whoever you want to - both inside and outside your company. This, however, can be difficult without the right tools, especially if you want to keep your assets well-organised and safe. That\u2019s precisely why DAM software exists. It provides a secure repository for all your files, facilitating their creation, storage and distribution. This, in turn, gives you plenty of benefits - such as keeping all your files safe and sound (not to mention easily accessible) in the cloud at all times, sharing all your assets (even the biggest files!) without problems, as well as saving time, effort and money. What\u2019s not to like about that? Actually, if you\u2019re currently on the lookout for an intuitive DAM solution, try Filecamp. It allows organising, sharing, tagging, and distributing all your digital assets from one easy-to-use and custom branded platform in the cloud, and comes with unlimited users, advanced sharing permissions, file previews, and a mobile-ready user interface.
