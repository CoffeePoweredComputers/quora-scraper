            "answer_text": "The USB is generally responsible for connecting input devices to a computer. And as far as that goes, as long as the tablet is USB chances are you will be able to plug it in to your laptop. However there are a few important things to consider: Does your laptop have the necessary drivers to handle the tablet as an input device? (Chances are yes, but if you find it's not working try looking for specific drivers on the tablet manufacturers website) Is whatever software your using on the laptop take advantage of different pressure inputs and other tablet features? I had a graphics tablet and for a long time I was using it as a glorified mouse because the program I was using didn't recognise varying pressure. Is your screen high enough quality to display a large amount of colours in a true to life fashion? And will you have enough screen space to work? This was addressed by another answer, I've found that the screen size isn't too important as long as you're comfortable working with zooms. And the colour quality of your display is probably more important when working on photography and other things that might be printed out, generally digital work that stays online is going to be seen on a variety of different screens anyway. Is your tablet supported on your operating system? I haven't really heard of this as a problem but in a freak case scenario the tablet you use on your iMac might not work on your windows laptop (for instance). However this is fairly unlikely. Generally speaking if it's USB and works on a desktop, there's no huge reason it shouldn't work on a laptop. ",

You can get either a : Cintiq companion (heavy and gets warm pretty quickly and lets not talk about the fan noise)Surface pro (inferior stylus compared to the other two, somewhat heavy)IPad Pro + Pencil (restricted to apps, no 3D sculpting for you if you use this)The IPad Pro is my favourite, in my case. Since well almost everyone owns a laptop or a computer so you'll basically do the same things you can on your pc, and you'll stop using one of them. And that's not the case with an iPad since you don't have files, computer programs or utorrent (ahah) but you get a lot of extras on the other side just for the IPad Pro. And Procreate can really remplace your Photoshop so no bummers, only if you want to sculpt then you have a problem, unless you mirror your pc screen with an application and use it as computer connected digital tablet :) ",

            "answer_text": "Get a Surface. Surface 3 Most drawing tablets require a computer, and the surface IS a computer. But I thought its stylus was really great, and if you get a decent drawing software, it is more than enough. In terms of price, most drawing tablets are really expensive, without coming with the capability of a computer. So the price is actually not that high. And, if you get it at the Microsoft store, you can actually return it within 30 days, which is enough time to decide if you want it or not. Oh yeah, and why a Surface instead of any other tablet: Palm rejection (since it has a recognized stylus instead of just a touch screen)Pressure sensitivity levels for the stylusPhotoshop. Or any Windows compatible drawing app (so, Gimp too)Review: Microsoft Surface 3 for Artists and Drawing  ",

Samsung Galaxy Note series Apple iPad Pro with Pencil Surface devices Wacom devices All of these are computers. They may appear as not a computer, but yes, indeed they are computers. Now, to answer the question you were actually asking, I personally have a Note Series Tablet. I love it, I can sketch and draw and colour. It's amazing. I only wish the spen was a little longer. Although, nowadays the surface is an outstanding device for drawing on a full blown windows device. The Apple iPad and pencil are also a good option, but a very premium one. I hope this helps! ",

The range of Wacom hardware support varies from machine to machine, but most machines in the last 15 or 20 years or so included pressure support for sketching and painting. Only Wacom\u2019s own tablet models include advanced stuff like tilt-sensing (this is suppose to change any day now). So if you want laptop portability but the power of a stylus digitizer, consider looking at laptops that feature the digitizer built - into the screen. There are more of these now than ever before. ",
