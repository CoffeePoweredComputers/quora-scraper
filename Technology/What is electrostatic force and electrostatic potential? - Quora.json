            "answer_text": "The electrostatic force is a conservative force. This means that the work it does on a particle depends only on the initial and final position of the particle, and not on the path followed. With each conservative force, a potential energy can be associated. The introduction of the potential energy is useful since it allows us to apply conservation of mechanical energy which simplifies the solution of a large number of problems.  Coulomb force, also called electrostatic force or Coulomb interaction, attraction or repulsion of particles or objects because of their electric charge.Feb 25, 2014 ",

            "answer_text": "Electrostatics is basically just wringing as much insight as possible out of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law, which is the first of the four https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations, before going on to more complicated stuff. It's nearly all you need to understand \"static electricity\". ",
