            "answer_text": "The western world was the only ones who had mobile technologies. Started by Motorola who invented mobile technologies and later the \u201cbrick\u201d mobile phones. Following Motorola lead were companies like Bell Labs and AT&T where they were later spun off to become Lucent Technologies where they merged and split and collapsed to be acquired by Alcatel and enterprise because Avaya technologies. Canadian Nortel Networks also grew but also collapsed. Europeans Siemens, Marconi, followed that trend of either getting eaten or collapsed. Today only Ericsson (2nd)and Nokia (3rd only after selling their mobile phones business to Microsoft and that eventually saved Nokia) remains in the infrastructure telecom business (both sold or close their terminal, mobile phone businesses). Today only HuaWei (1st in infrastructure telecommunications) has the end-to-end telecommunications equipment business. ZTE On the other hand only has bits pieces of the telecommunications businesses, thus they have to partner with other companies in order to provide a true end-to -end business (that is why they are more vulnerable to US sanction). HuaWei on the other hand built everything themselves even to the chipset level and they could switch OS (servers, terminals, handsets) at any moment notice (HuaWei even announced they can take Microsoft and Google out of the eco system when needed \u2026 and even cheekily said these two are the vulnerable part \u2026 prone to hacking in the entire telecommunications network ) \u2026\u2026 PRISM PRISM ON THE WALL \u2026. indicating it is the US Government (NSA, CIA, FBI, Military Inteligence) that has ask US companies to create back door for stealing information (not sure if these US companies have closed those back doors yet) via Wikileaks by Edward Snowden. Chinese who are long term players, over the last 20 plus years have been quietly learning and investing billions on R&D. Their initial strategy was coming out with simple dependable products with no fancy bells or whistles but at a very affordable aggressive pricing. Later as they evolve, their products were no longer me too but innovative and features rich products but still at a aggressive affordable pricing. All this while they take a big chunk of their profits and plow it back into R&D which western companies started to cut R&D expenses and also their staff (which a fair bit went to the 2 Chinese firms). Thus after 20 plus years the Chinese now control a big portion of 5G IP and also the manufacturing know how. Their strength pricingservices (fast)reliablespeedscaliabilty from 4G to 5G and beyondcustomer centric killer applicationsend-to-end (1 stop solutions)financingThe western companies have been plagued by internal politics, mergers and acquisitions, upsizing, downsizing, rightsizing and finally Capsizing. Now trump Administration hopes to use dirty American politics to help western companies to win back the 5G technology. Fyi \u2026 got a friend in a American bank told me why he choose HuaWei over Cisco Networks\u2026 pricing, reliability, scalability, features and of course good fast response customer services. ",

            "answer_text": "China is not leading the 5G industry because there are no 5G networks builtChina is not leading the 5G industry because the international 5G standard has not yet signed the stands document so it is completely possible that Huawei guessed that the standard will go one way and created their products against that guess but the standard could change at the last second (it has happened) and then Huawei equipment would not work, so they have to rush back to engineering and start to redesign it al over again.The US has plenty of companies investing in 5G technology, man are waiting for the stands to be signed (later in 2019) so they know which characteristics they have to design for.Years ago Huawei received a fortune in taxpayer dollars from the Chinese Government, with the goal of having Huawei corner (dominate) the market by having hardware ready before the standard was signed.If the 5G standard changes significantly in the next few months then Huawei will not be in the lead of 5G readiness, they will be behind everyone else, and be in last place.",
