            "answer_text": "Yes, but only in the sense that the Tesla Autopilot is only possible because every Tesla vehicle since the first Model S sedans on 6/22/2012 has been equipped with 4GLTE cellular and WiFi transceivers for free lifetime Internet access and over-the-air software updates, something that NO OTHER AUTOMAKER dares to offer. The latest Tesla Autopilot software version is downloaded and installed with each new vehicle software release. Each Tesla vehicle has specific options enabled, the corresponding software features are also enabled. The Tesla Autopilot system does not have to actively access the Internet during operation. However, the Tesla Navigation system accesses the Internet for live crowd-sourced traffic data, map updates and other navigation data, and the Tesla Autopilot uses the Navigation system, so the Autopilot \u201cdepends\u201d on the Internet indirectly to a small degree.

            "answer_text": "Tesla Autopilot uses sensors in the car and GPS location, along with stored maps (that are downloaded periodically over the Internet). Autopilot, as far as I know, does not use the Internet in real time, nor could it because that would make it fail in no-signal areas. Tesla has a new patent for a more accurate GPS location that uses information from other cars. I didn\u2019t see what protol they intend to use for car-to-car communication. Tesla patents technology for more accurate GPS positioning ",
