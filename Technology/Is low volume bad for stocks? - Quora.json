            "answer_text": "Volume itself isn't a factor on which price makes high or low. Low volume means that less people are interested in selling or buying. If you see volume is increasing tremendously then it means smart money has entered into trade. Smart money in intraday trading refers to a big giant who's interested in the trade. If you see price of share is increasing with volume increasing then then smart money is interested in buying the share. And other way around if you see volume increasing and share price is going down then smart money is interested in selling. Sudden surge of volume is because of smart money. Normal traders like you and me buy or sell like 500 shares, 1000 shares, or even a lot. But smart money trades like 10,000,00 shares in one go. Which will huge reflection on the numbers or volume. If a retail trader wants to make some quick bucks then he should follow smart money. The catch here is entry and exit. Which you should be careful of. Hope you like my answer I am a newbie in the trading. I wrote what I have knowledge regarding volume. If I amwrong somewhere then I am open for corrections. Please ignore grammatical mistakes. Thank you and happy trading. ",

            "answer_text": "Volume really only matters if it will prevent you from getting out of a position without facing substantial losses. As long as you are holding some tiny fraction of shares compared to the daily volume, it should be no problem. You wouldn\u2019t want to be holding 50k shares of something that trades like 5 shares a day or something. You would be much better off holding 5 shares of something that trades 50k/day. ",
