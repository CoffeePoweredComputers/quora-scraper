            "answer_text": "Their service. Here is what I have posted on facebook, Its been more then a day and still no reply: I have bought a Micromax Canvas Knight A350 mobile handset from Micromax about 8-9 months ago. Around 5th -6th June, my mobile suddenly stopped charging. So I went to the micromax service center in MG Road, Gurgaon. Since the phone was within warranty, they accepted the phone (on 11th June) and said that the repair process will take 20-25 days. Around 3 weeks back, a phone call came and said that they are not able to repair the mobile phone, and hence will give a new handset. Since then I have been contacted them 7-10 times, and every time the response has been same: 1-2 more days. It has already been a delay of more than 10 days over and above the 25 days time frame (which I believe is enough for any kind of job). There customer service agents are also liars ( I asked them one day strictly and said they actually dont have any intimation from the company) . The argument that the company does not have handset does not make sense. They can buy it from Amazon. It delivers in 1 day. also, finally I got a call from them on 16th july asking that the phone has arrived. I went on Friday 17th july. However they said that the phone that arrived was defective, and hence they have ordered a new phone which should arrive by the post in 1.5 hours,and then I can collect it (This conversation happened at 17:30) I called at 19:00, they picked up the phone, said that the phone has arrived but I cannot collect it as the service center has closed. Before I can inquire any further, they rudely hung up. This is the way you guys treat your customers.And, interestingly they said that the delay is due to the fact that the previous piece which arrived was also defective.How can new phones be faulty 2 times. Is it that Micromax as replacement gives out refurbished phones? plus your service center guy is really rude. Your experience is the worst experience and nobody should buy a Micromax Mobile ",

            "answer_text": "Well, to get started with, I'll say everything. Here is a brief list: Even their flagship is a rebranded handset: Obviously you have heard of Yu Yureka. Great specs, 4G at such low costs and CM OS. BUt guess what? Even this phone is a rebranded Coolpad F2 4G. So can you expect a company, which has not even enough resources to make their own flagships, to deliver even a basic smartphone?Virtually non-existent after-sales services: A friend of mine has a Micromax. Due to some mishap, the screen cracked and he wanted to contact the after-sales service regarding the warranty. He kept trying for about a week. Micromax officials never took up his call. He tried once or twice more after that, gave up, and now is going to get a premium brand like Xiaomi or HTC. Narrating that incident, he jokingly remarked that maybe the guys at Micromax have their own Micromax telephone/intercom devices. That's why they don't work.Extremely poor performance: Most Micromax phones, (more precisely rebranded lesser-known Chinese devices), run on weak Mediateks. Except a few. Oh wait. That is a Coolpad/rebranded device.Cheating to get high benchmark scores: I had my other friend with a Micromax Unite 2 to run AnTuTu on his device. Surprisingly, his RAM speed was faster than my LPDDR2 device. Now, you can put all your money on a bet for the fact that Micromax Unite 2 doesn't have LPDDR2. It has most possibly LPDDR. If anything below that exists, then Unite 2 has that. It scored an AnTuTu of 17k, which is pretty decent by Indian standards. Ran AnTuTu X (http://www.antutu.com/view.shtml?id=7242). Boom. Score fell to ~14k. Then come the processors. Octa-core Mediateks. But they're sold only as \"octa-cores.\" Hardly many people using Micromax know what Mediatek or Snapdragon are. Honestly, I'd choose a dual-core Snapdragon 200 over any octa-core Micromax offers in its rebranded devices.Amazing cameras: No, I mean that. Truly amazing how you can think that 13 MP local lens can beat my Sony 8 MP lens. MPs don't translate to image quality, my dear Micromax fans.Over-priced handsets: So, we had Moto E, probably the first Snapdragon below Rs. 10k in India. And before that, Micromax didn't even had the guts to sell a rebranded quad-core Mediatek below ~7k. It is only due to Motorola and Xiaomi that Micromax has started rebranding better phones at lower prices.Rare updates, if ever: There are dozens of earlier Micromax flagships waiting to get an update. After all, Micromax had promised that! Not to worry, the Unite 2 received the \"latest\" Lollipop 5.0 (which is heavily modded to look like Micromax Ugly) the year Marshmallow is being released.",
