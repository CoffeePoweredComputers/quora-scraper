            "answer_text": "It helps if it does not distract from the live performance or call attention to itself as something apart from the performance. It hurts if it is not perceived as organically connected to the performance. For example, if part of the scenery is projected onto the stage or in the theater, it must be high enough quality and resolution as to not look like a cartoon element unless the rest of the setting is cartoonish already. Some of the technical advances in lighting have helped productions. Lights can be programmed to follow actors without being reset or having the lighting transferred to a different instrument. This means that fewer lights can be used. Similarly, the color of the lights and the gels that are used to provide that color can be changed remotely during the performance and that adds versatility to the lighting. The ability to focus sound or to make sounds directional in the theater helps to create a greater sense of reality to the performance space. Having the sound of an approaching storm or an army on the march coming from a particular direction gives the audience a sense of time, distance, and place. Over-reliance on technology suggests that the performers are too weak to engage the audience\u2019s attention by themselves. When the audience is constantly reminded of the technology in use, it loses focus on the actors and the story they are telling. ",
