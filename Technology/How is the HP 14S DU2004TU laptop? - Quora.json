            "answer_text": "Checked online but couldn\u2019t find the mentioned model. Instead i found the model HP Laptop - 15s-du2004tu I read the specifications and here is my analysis; Processor is not that good since it is i3, would suggest you to take i5 since it is far better in performance. RAM 4GB is fine but look for upgrade options so that you can bump it up to 8GB at least later on. Graphics is basic Intel. Fine if you are not into gaming or heavy graphical interface usage. It is a 5400 RPM HDD, no SSD and your laptop will be much slower compared to the SSD one\u2019s. The recent trend is SSD. Try to get one with a SSD rather than HDD. You will feel a huge difference in performance and speed. Check the YouTube for comparison videos. Rest configuration is general and pretty much nice. Thanks ! ",
