            "answer_text": "I'm a tad radical when it comes to politics, but yes, I believe this would be a good thing. For several reasons : The main one being that an average income would deter a lot of selfish and/or corrupt people to get into politics. Doing politics for the sake of serving the people who elected you, not for self-enrichment.Also, this would allow to reduce budget expenses. While actual wages might not yield that much money when scaled up to the yearly tax revenue of a government, it is still a solid amount that could be put to better use. For instance, in 2016, politicians wages represented 85M \u20ac for the french government. All of that for merely 968 people. An average income of 87K\u20ac/y for them, whereas the average income in 2015 for us plebs was about 36K\u20ac/y.I assume that such a reform would not be half-ass done, so one could extrapolate the previous item to expenses accounts. Now that\u2019s a lot of money being siphoned off by our glorious politicians, that could as well be put to use somewhere else. No more private jet, expensive restaurants and hotel bills payed by the common citizen. Actual numbers for this are hard to come by, but wages expenses would look reasonable in comparison.Now you got me started, and this was only the tip of the iceberg. I believe that, in order to make politics at the service of the people (you know, what democracy is supposed to be like), a few more changes would be more than welcomed : No more combinable mandates. Be it of nature (like, mayor of said town AND congressman) or in time. You get to serve one mandate, which you were elected for, and that\u2019s it, back to your ordinary life. This would prevent careerist people to become politicians, and reduce the amount of conflicts of interest.Revocable mandates. You fucked up ? Time for a referendum. Let the people decide if you are still fit to represent them. If not, goodbye.This last one is a bit controversial, but how about randomly picked people to serve as politicians ? You can turn down the honnor of course, it would not be mandatory. And sure you might get some loonies, but then again, if they are not fit so serve, they can easily be revoked. But this would spare us the electoral campaign feast, and put genuine people in charge of the country.I\u2019ve always believed that as long as being a politician is somewhat of a job or career, it will never serve the people, but only those who are elected. If someone wants to be elected, I\u2019m not that enclined to give him my vote, like at all.

            "answer_text": "I think that might be a start. My problem with this question is, wouldn\u2019t you think that teachers would be retired by the time they become octogenarians and secondly don\u2019t mix people who provide a great benefit to society (teachers that is) with some of these old, male, octogenarian, arrogant, out of touch, owned, stubborn, carry overs, \u201cof no color \u201c(white), and some \u201cof no class\u201d who are trampling everyone in their way. If I were a teacher I would be pissed! ",
