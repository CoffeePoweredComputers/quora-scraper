            "answer_text": "A good question! There are many theories of Tradition, and it is also a concept that some people misunderstand. Firstly what Tradition is not, and that is picking what the norms, culture and aesthetics of some arbitrary point in the past were, and projecting them on to the present. Tradition is something that does change and evolve but slowly and over longer periods of time. Some Traditionalists are very conservative and sceptical of all change and innovation. Other traditionalists recognize that the world they grew up in is changing constantly and ever more rapidly. They try to maintain what is good in their culture and cultural inheritance, while accepting the need to re-evaluate these in light of new circumstances, information, and knowledge. Then in turn passing that cultural inheritance on to the next generation in light of their insights and lived experience. Of these approaches to tradition, I am probably somewhere in between although much closer to the latter than the former. Therefore, while I believe that tradition is important and I have a healthy respect for it, it is not the be all and end all of everything. However, I also take being a rational transmitter of my traditions and culture to my son, and other younger people for whom I have responsibilities very seriously, and hopefully with respect for the context in which they are growing up and making sense of the world.
