            "answer_text": "In screenshot2, although your ISP is not giving you the content you request, it is still giving you content so a page is rendered and javascript is executed. In screenshot1, your ISP has blocked it and isn't giving you any content. Chrome therefore doesn't render a page and javascript is not executed. When I was writing my Chrome Extension, @Oh No You Didn't! I had a similar issue and exploited this \"feature\" to my benefit. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Maybe there is another way of doing it? ",
