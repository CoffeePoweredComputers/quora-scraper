            "answer_text": "How did you find out about education technology you are using in the classroom? We (The QWK2LRN Project) first asked the question:  How can low income school districts acquire enough technology to close the digital divide?  We  found six major barriers to the \u201ceffective use\u201d of technology in the classroom:  CostObsolescenceMal-wareSpeedReliabilitySustainability Cost When we started looking at this problem, the average initial acquisition cost of a new PC was over $1.000.  This barrier caused us to look at the unlimited supply of older PCs available to schools.  The ideal technology for schools would be an under $100 device. Obsolescence The PC life cycle is 24-36 months with many school districts extending this period to 60 months or longer.  The ideal technology for schools is technology with a 72 months life or longer.  In large school districts like Chicago, Los Angeles or New York a technology is often obsolete before it can be fully deployed. Adding further complexity to this problem are frequent Operating system upgrades which often rendered curriculum products unusable.  The ideal technology would have NO Operating system and a life of 72 months or longer.  Steve Jobs describes the ideal technology for Schools  at the 1997 iCloud conference. Mal-ware In the typical school computer lab only half the machines work, on good day Who foots the Bill for the Computer Lab .  The ideal technology is a stateless device with no operating System. Speed Slow computers are ineffective classroom devices. Children will not use them.  They destroy classroom productivity and lower standardized test results. The speed problem has risen to become a significant crisis as school districts implement blended learning and Common Core assessments.Zuckerberg and Gates fund $8 Million effort to Speed up Schools  The ideal technology for schools would not slow down over its life, it would speed up. Reliability Every school or school district has a room or warehouse crammed with out of service computers.  This problem is exacerbated by the habit school districts have of not budgeting for service, when they acquire new devices. Many Educators ignore the reality that up to 80% of the total cost of ownership can be service and support after initial acquisition. The ideal technology for schools is a zero maintenance device. Sustainability The sad reality is that most consumer technology is unsustainable in the school environment. A sustainable technology for schools looks very different than the devices we see on TV or in magazines. An ideal technology for schools might look like this:  Under $100Available to low income \tschools in Grants60 Month or longer \twarranty periodThe technology would \tspeed up not slow down over it lifeMean Time Between \tFailure of 30.000 hours or longer (Sixteen 180 day school years)All classroom devices \twould be centrally managed from a network consoleThe technology would be \tcompatible with and support all Common Core browsers Needless to say this technology does not exist.............yet. Practical Solutions for now Educators are faced with the reality of classroom without enough technology and need practical answers for today.  Here are a few ideas that will work in any classroom in the U.S.:   Make full use of all \tavailable resourcesConsider moving to \tcloud computingDon't fall in love with \tspecific brands or technologiesAlways focus on better \tways to access content and curriculum Any U.S. School district has access to an unlimited supply of computers starting with the ones in their warehouse.  Installing LINUX on these computers will make them immediately usable and much faster than with their original O.S.  Here is a way to get LINUX for free 10 Lightweight Distros that will turn your crippled PCs into Ferrari's Moving into High Gear Now that you know slow computers and obsolescence are just marketing strategies you can consider really high performance options for your school that achieve the following:  Turn PCs into stateless \tdevicesFully enable cloud \tcomputing in your classroomsProvide infinite \tscalability How is this magic trick accomplished?  Simple, we use a technology that's been around for decades but always avoided by schools, Terminal Servers.  By implementing powerful servers to drive the unlimited supply of obsolete devices available to U.S. School any School district can close the \u201cDigital Divide.  How to implement a scalable low cost solution for schools. (more to come)  Enterprise solutions for very large school districtsCasual use versus mission critical solutionsFunding technology with Government grantsUnder $100 devicesMoving the needle on student achievement",
