            "answer_text": "Tech stack refers to a set of technologies, programming languages, frameworks, software and tools including server infrastructure that are used in the development and deployment of sites, apps, and other digital products. In the web development, there is usually the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) parts of a tech stack. Here is a basic presentation of client-side and server-side workflow:  FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY STACK Front-end e.g. from client-side web development refers to everything users see on their screens. The most commonly used in front-end development toolkit includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML e.g. Hypertext Markup Language is a standardized system used for tagging text files on World Wide Web pages.CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language that basically describes how the document written in HTML, will be displayed on the users\u2019 screens.JavaScript: It is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.HTML and CSS Tech Stack There are several frameworks used for HTML and CSS. Some of them include: BootstrapFoundationBulmaUIkitSusyMaterializePureBut popular among them is Bootstrap and Foundation. While Bootstrap uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery library to make responsive web pages, Foundation is ideal for developing nimble, responsive websites. JavaScript Tech Stack For Front-End Development Modern web applications use JavaScript in the front-end. The most popular javascript frameworks are Angular, React and Vue.js (the progressive javascript framework). These trios are the best java framework for web applications.  BACK-END DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY STACK The back-end or server-side development stack consists of the entire business logic of your product work, the back-end is what executes CRUD operations which is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Demand operations. The back-end development would include: The operating system of the development process.Web server setup.Database storage setup.The programming language used.Web development framework for faster and easier development.In back-end technology, there are common programming languages:  While a few types of back-end tech stack would include the following: LAMP StackThe lamp stack is a classic stack. The LAMP stack is traditionally used for creating an environment for running PHP applications. It is used for hosting websites on Linux. The stack is made up of the following technologies: Linux (the environments OS), Apache (the HTTP server), MySQL (the database), and PHP (the server-side programming language). The WordPress, Drupal, and Larave App were built using the LAMP stack. Wins StackWindows Internet Naming Service (Wins) is another back-end stack that consists of windows server, internet information services, .Net, and Microsoft SQL Server. It is a system that is used to determine the IP address associated with a particular network computer. The OTRO app was built with the Wins stack. MEAN StackThe mean stack consists of MongoDB, express.js, angular.js, and node.js. It is more of a full-stack structure. It is an open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. Xampp (X, Apache, MySQL or MariaDB, PHP, Perl) StackXampp toolkit consists of X, Apache, MySQL or MariaDB, PHP, Perl. AMP stack which lets you install Apache, MySQL, and PHP in your computer together with some other useful software. It has been designed to provide you an easy installation experience. MERN StackMERN consists, MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, and Node.js. The MERN stack is very similar to the MEAN stack. It is used because of the growth of popularity of ReactJS in front-end development and NodeJS in back-end development, and it is useful for building high-end single-page applications, like Plaid app. Serverless StackServerless computing and the function-as-a-service platform is another branch-off that is worth mentioning. The serverless computing service provides a platform for users to develop, run, and manage application functionalities. With the serverless computing service, you will be needing less server to run and manage your project. They are AWS Lambda Tech Stack, Now by Zeit, Google Cloud. The key idea in choosing some or another one set of technologies should be based primarily on the functional and quality requirements you want to build in your software.

            "answer_text": "Basically, a tech stack is a set of programming languages, libraries, frameworks, databases, servers and other components, which are needed to develop a software of any kind. There are two major parts of every tech stack: 1. Client-side (frontend), which revolves around everything that\u2019s displayed on users\u2019 screens. The most common components of the frontend are: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which defines the structure of the information presented in the browser,CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which determine the style of the application, including colours and fonts,JavaScript, an object-oriented computer programming language, which enables interactivity on the website, and its frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue.js. The most popular framework for HTML and CSS is Bootstrap. 2. Server-side (backend), which remains invisible to users, but in fact \u201cpowers\u201d the client-side. As a result, though, the backend is usually more complex and diverse - you can choose from numerous: programming languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, Java),databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB),frameworks (Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel),runtime environments (Node.js),servers (Apache, Nginx) andoperating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).In case you\u2019re wondering, here\u2019s how to choose the right tech stack for your web app. ",
