            "answer_text": "This is my feedback as a user since connectivity started in Hyderabad. I\u2019ve used Airtel, Beam cable, Hathway, ActFiber (used for Office), now using YouBroadband 75 mbps (now taken over by Vodafone). To decide there are many parameters to consider. Cost & Affordability.Speed/Band width.Data Limit.Requirement of Usage & Preference of download Speed.Consistency of the Network Connectivity & Maintenance.Stability of the activeness & power backup to their local switch.Grade & Quality of Cables & connectivity.Number of users.Turnaround time.Points 1 to 4 are user based & 5 to 9 are ISP based. Reliable brands (Now in 2020): Airtel, Act-Fiber for best in points from 5 to 9 but bit costlier than others. Reliance also if available. If you are looking at cost effective solution, then go for YouBroadband or other providers but might face connection problems like ping loss, connectivity problems, frequent issues etc. check with locals for service providers available, service provided in your community & take feedback etc. this is the basic homework has to be done if you opt for cost effective solution. if you are not bothered about money then just go for Airtel or ActFiber. You can compare their packages in their website & decide based on your need. Most of us use internet for our Mobiles & TVs for entertainment, downloading movies, videos, educational stuff for children etc. technology is not like before, now each video is of HD so it is high in file size, similarly other images or movies or other stuff, which leads to opt for high speed & heavy data pack. you can take lower size 1st then upgrade based on your usage of 3 months. Now other factor to consider & gadget involved is, your router which is usually missed by most of users, actually is the unit plays major role in any home. make sure that it has Dual band width - Supports to 2.4GHz & 5GHz (this 5G is WiFi Signal wavelength, not 5G in mobile network which is upcoming)It should support 8.11. b/g/n & ac (b/g/n is past ac is present & future will be \u2018ar\u2019 which is in process of approval)It should Support high band width. If you are planning to buy new one then go for 1gbps down load speed which can support & compatible to new & upcoming technology for next 5 yrs. If you have one & facing range problem then you should be buy WiFi extenders available in market & online as well.I Learnt that ISPs are limiting band width based on our usage, means if we are not using then they are reducing the speed from backend, if it is happening then check your router 1st if still not useful if you are confident then use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) if you can.

            "answer_text": "Hyderbad is a place where you are very much required to get a Broadband network. All the Cities amenities and government schemes/ Bills/ tax payments can be done online. Everything can be bought from online these days and Hyderabad is the center of all the development in present times. I would suggest You take ACT. why ? High value, they offer 100Mbps at 1050 + taxes.Good or better customer care (there is scope for improvement ), very easy to contact (sometimes the line or queue can be long ).has connectivity all over the city in all 3000+ Sq Km of areaVery easy to shift the connection due to its network all over the cityGood Data per month something is now 1TB for 1200 rupees at 100 mbps.has some connection to Netflix and Prime for new offers when taken with some kind of combo planMost important uninterrupted connection.If there is any loss of connection they will decrease the bill for the days which they have not given you the connection",
