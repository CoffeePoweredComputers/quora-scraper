Receiver implies it receives radio and/or TV signals. Receivers typically have built-in power amp outputs you attach to speakers. If you use powered speakers - speakers with built-in power amps - the receiver will have appropriate outputs for this use. They may be labeled Pre-amp Outs or something similar. Most modern receivers will play stereo, 5.1, 7.1 and even 7.1.2 Dolby Atmos programs. Receivers will also have inputs for a phono turntable, CD player, media players of various sorts, and sometimes Bluetooth inputs for playing from your computer, phone or tablet. Here\u2019s the rear panel of a receiver.  ",
