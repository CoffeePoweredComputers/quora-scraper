            "answer_text": "Consultancies like Careernet, Magna Infotech etc (Bangalore) have a deal with big companies like Accenture, Bosch, HP etc. When there is a vacancy in any of these companies, they will ask the consultancy to hire the candidates and Consultancy firm conducts the basic rounds to filter the candidates and send company for final round, sometimes they may take final round there itself rather than sending you to company. When this happens, the vacancy is filled in the company and they will pay service charge to the firm, that is why genuine consultancies never ask money to the candidate. ",

In consultancy like Optiwise solutions (Vijayawada) can conduct the basic interview rounds to filter the right candidate and send to the company. Company can do final round of interview and hire them. After vacancy filled the company only pay service charges to that consultancy. ",
