            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A: One thing to understand is that \u201chologram\u201d is a mathematical description of the universe. The universe is made of stuff that can be completely described by information theory and mathematics. Most people have experienced a holographic world we call dreams. In a dream world, we infer space from the passage of time. In the real world, it could be that we infer time from passage through space (and by one definition we call \u201crelativity\u201d that\u2019s exactly what we do), but there are arguments for the case that in the real world, we infer space as well. We cannot say with certainty that what we call the real world is anything more than a kind of shared dream; a manifestation of a kind of universal collective consciousness to which your physical brain interfaces. I think there is a difference between matter that is in phase with our brain\u2019s mathematical interpretation of visual reality and matter that is in phase across all QFT definitions of space and time\u2014 quantally cohesive matter. Even if we are made of quantally cohesive matter, it is not possible to say with certainty that what appears real to us is not an elaborate holographic projection that only you really see. I believe the difference between dreams and reality is that in dreams we see narrow-phase perceptions that are only real to us, but in reality we see matter that has a wide-gamut spread of phase that is real to others. But that is not to say we cannot perceive objects slightly out of phase with our universe; and those objects could be physically real under constrained definitions of QFT and able to interact with the neutrino field but not with light (we can\u2019t see them, but duly sensitized we can feel them). And that is not to say there are not objects in the real world that are only in phase to our\u2014or a small segment of the world\u2019s\u2014 perceptions; objects \u201cmade of light\u201d that are so carefully rendered we cannot see the difference between them and objects we could touch. I think that will be how we make holograms we control a reality is through understanding our perceptual machinery to such a degree that we can \u201ctrick\u201d the visual cortex with a coherent phase-locked perception that is only visually real. But I also think there is no mathematical description of the universe that forbids dream-world objects from existing in the real world once there is sufficient entanglement with another\u2019s consciousness to permit information transfer from mind to mind. I think that probably already happens. And also why loved ones sometimes literally share dreams :) ",

            "answer_text": "There is no reason to presume that something that has been done in the past is not possible to do now, or will not be possible to make in the future. The word \u201chologram\u201d has one useful meaning, at this time: the record of highly coherent monochromatic light reflecting from a three-dimensional surface, recorded in a film emulsion, by interfering the reflected light with a spread and spatially-filtered sample of the same light under circumstances where both the reflected (object) beam and spread beam (reference) interfere at or within the emulsion. When developed and illuminated with just the reference beam, the hologram recreates the object beam, presenting to a properly placed observer the same view whether the object remains or not. The term \u201cholograph\u201d is said to be the same as \u201chologram\u201d, but holograph has been used to describe a manuscript in the author\u2019s or composer\u2019s handwriting. Other uses of Hologram include descriptions of a frozen view of a reference frame in the Universe, real or imagined, which captures all of the details of the frame. Whether this variety of hologram is actually \u201cmade\u201d or merely formulated, hypothesized, or conceptually grasped is more a function of the locutor who is using the term than anything else. Holograms as in Holography are simple enough to make so that many people have made them with nothing more than a glass photographic plate and a pointer laser with the lens removed. They can also be as complex as the specially constructed holograms which start as a series of pictures from different angles which are recorded into stripes on a photographic plate, each stripe being a holographic recording of the light visible from the angle the camera took that image from, then transferred to another hologram so the stripes are no longer visible as an artifact. The final hologram can be illuminated with white light or coherent light, depending on the geometries of how it is made, to produce an apparent 3D image of the portrait\u2019s subject, without laser light ever coming in contact with them. Additionally, holography can be conducted in the focal plane of a camera, with the reference beam being added to lie over the same plane, and modulated. This method lends itself to an actual holographic interferometry application, where bands of light and dark, called \u201cfringes\u201d present as a topographical map of displacement or vibration shape. As I said, there\u2019s no reason that every one of these approaches can continue to be used to create holograms through the foreseeable and far-extended future. ",

            "answer_text": "We already have. Several years back at a conference focused on 3D displays and their applications, one group of engineers presented a box you could stick your hand into and experience a holographic rain storm. This was accomplished by the use of a transparent 3D LCD serving as the lid of the box, a series of cameras to identify the location of the hand within the box, and an array of focused ultrasonic emitters producing what's known as a \u201chaptic hologram,\u201d basically a standing soundwave that has a physical presence but is otherwise invisible. By combining all these different technologies, a person could see and feel holographic raindrops hitting their hand. And just last year the technology was rolled out again as a novel way to produce an invisible shape-shifting set of controls for cars. I wouldn't start planning to add a holodeck in your house just yet though. ",
