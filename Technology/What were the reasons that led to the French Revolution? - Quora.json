            "answer_text": "There are many factors that explain the Revolution, but I will try to synthesize the causes, as requested, into six main ones. The absolutism of the monarchy, particularly pronounced since Louis XIV, was criticised. This can be explained first by the emergence of the philosophical current of the Enlightenment, which advocated the separation of powers (Montesquieu) and the sovereignty of the people (Rousseau). The English revolutions of 1641-1649 and 1688-1689, as well as the emergence of the federal republic of the United States, also encouraged the emergence of new ideas.The year 1788 was catastrophic and France suffered a major food crisis due to an unfavourable climate. This caused, by a chain reaction, unemployment and thus the worsening of economic problems, knowing that taxes were badly collected and that France was in deficit following the war of independence of the United States.The queen suffered from a bad reputation due in particular to the Affair of the Diamond Necklace and to her too noble tastes, whereas paradoxically the king was criticized for his personality considered too simple, without charisma, thus losing the respect of the people, who saw in him only an ordinary man and not a monarch of divine right.The power of the Catholic authorities was challenged, particularly by the Jansenists.Legislative and administrative decisions were rather complicated, since there were many differences between each region, as well as internal customs.And of course, the archaic social system of the three estates, with privileges for nobility and clergy and overwhelming taxes for the third estate. In addition, there were also inequalities within each estate, with significant differences between lower and upper nobility, between lower and upper clergy and between peasants and the bourgeoisie.",

            "answer_text": "The four causes of French revolution: social cause :the Fench society was divided into three estates -a. Clergy b. Nobels c. Commoners The first two estates were exempted from taxes and enjoyed many privileges by birth but on the other hand commoners lived a very hard life.They have to pay all the types of taxes. 2. Political cause : the king Louis xvi and queen Marie Antoinette led a luxurious life.The whole administration was corrupt and people were tired of such rotten system and wanted a change. 3. Financial problems: Long years of war had drained the wealth of France.Added to this the king had to pay 2 billion LIVRES as loan ,and because of bad harvest the prices of grains rose high and many people were not able to afford it and this led to crisis of subsistence. 4. Role of philosophers : The philosophers like John Locke , Rousseau , Montesquieu played important role in french revolution. These people had given ideas for the betterment of the society. There ideas got popularised among the masses. As the result the middle class emerged and started seeking their rights. ",

            "answer_text": "The immediate cause was that the French government was broke, and the King, Louis XVI called the Estates General into session (the last time it was in session was 1614, over 150 years earlier). It had gotten into this state from expenditures from the Seven Years War (known in America as the French and Indian war) and from assistance France gave to the American colonies in the American Revolutionary war. France\u2019s tax system was highly inefficient, with both the clergy (particularly the higher clergy, bishops and and above) and nobility being exempt from many of them while the burden fell on the peasants and the middle class. The Estates General was divided into three classes, or estates, the clergy (the first estate), the nobility (the 2nd estate) and the commons, (the 3rd estate). Each estate had collectively one vote, and since the commons comprised over 90% of the population of France they were obviously not happy about the set up. To compress the story quite a bit the commons withdrew from the proceedings and re-invented themselves as the National Assembly. When Louis XVI closed and locked their hall, and stationed soldiers to guard it, they withdrew to a nearby tennis court and swore an oath not to disband until they had drawn up a constitution for France. This is known as \u201cThe Tennis Court Oath\u201d and generally considered the beginning of the French Revolution. The popular view is that the French Revolution was a case of oppressed peasants and working class people rising up against exploitive aristocrats, but the reality was quite different. The revolutionaries were, for the most part, middle class intellectuals, and a fair number of both clergy (especially lower clergy) and aristocrats joined the National Assembly in the Tennis Court Oath. The aristocratic class in France included many who in Britain would have been considered part of the gentry, and many of them were impoverished land owners who were scarcely better off than their peasant neighbors. One of the few advantages some of the lower nobility had was a chance to get a commission as an officer if they choose a military career, something that would normally not be possible for a peasant. Conversely many successful businessmen had various ways to acquire noble titles, often through marriage or patronage. Also, although Louis XVI is sometimes portrayed as an evil monarch one of the reasons the revolution succeeded was because, at critical moments, he was unwilling to take forceful action against his subjects. He was in reality a kind hearted man and weak monarch who was really out of his depth. It has been said that the best thing he did for his nation was to die like a king, he went to his execution in a dignified manner. Edit to original post, I first had the monarch at the time of the revolution as Louis XIV. It was in reality Louis XVI. ",

            "answer_text": "French Revolution also called the revolution of 1789, the revolutionary movement that shook France b/w 1787 and 1799, and reached its first climax there in 1789.  Photo: The Execution of Louis XVI in 1793. There Were Cultural, Social, Political and Economic Causes Of French Revolution. Let us Take A Look At All These Causes: 1 Political Cause: During the eighteen the Century France was the centre of autocratic monarchy. The French Monarchs had unlimited power and they declared themselves as the \u201cRepresentative of God\u201d. Louis XIV was the exponent of this view. The French Monarchs engaged themselves in luxurious and extravagance at the royal court of Versailles. They enjoyed unlimited power, they arrested any person at any time and imprisoned them. They paid no attention towards their subjects. Louis XIV (1643-1715) of the Bourbon Dynasty was a powerful monarch. He was an efficient, hard-working and confident ruler. He participated in many wars. Louis XIV\u2019s concept of unlimited royal power is revealed by his famous remarks, \u201cI am the State\u201d. Louis XV (1715-1774) succeeded Louix XIV He was a \u2018butterfly monarch\u2019. His defective foreign policy weakened the economic condition of France. After Louis XV, Louis XVI (1774-1793) ascended the throne of France. During that period, the economic condition of France became weak. Louis XVI was an innocent and simple man. But he was influenced by his queen Marie Antoinette who always interfered in the state affairs. She always enjoyed luxurious and extravagant life. She sowed seed of the French Revolution. Thus, the autrocratic monarchy, defective administration, extravagant expenditure formed the political cause of the French Revolution. 2. Economic Cause: The economic condition of France formed another cause for the outbreak of the French Revolution. The economic condition of France became poor due to the foreign wars of Louis XIV, the seven years War of Louis XV and other expensive wars. During the reign period of Louis XVI, the royal treasury became empty as extravagant expenses of his queen Marie Antoinette. 3. Social Cause: The Social condition of France during the eighteenth century was very miserable. The then French Society was divided into three classes\u2014 the Clergy, Nobles and Common People. The Clergy belonged to the First Estate. The Clergy was sub\u00addivided into two groups i.e. the higher clergy and the lower clergy. The higher clergy occupied the top position in the society. They managed the churches, monasteries and educational institutions of France. They did not pay any tax to the monarch.They exploited the common people in various ways. The higher clergy lived in the midst of scandalous luxury and extravagance. The common people had a strong hatred towards the higher clergy. The Nobility was regarded as the Second Estate in the French Society. They also did not pay any tax to the king. The Nobility was also sub divided into two groups-the Court nobles and the provincial nobles. The court nobles lived in pomp and luxury. They did not pay any heed towards the problems of the common people of their areas. On the other hand, the provincial nobles paid their attention towards the problems of the people. But they did not enjoy the same privileges as the Court nobles enjoyed. The Third Estate formed a heterogenous class. The farmers, cobblers, sweepers and other lower classes belonged to this class. The condition of the farmers was very miserable. They paid the taxes like Taille, Tithe and Gable. The Bourgeoisie formed the top most group of the Third Estate. The doctors, lawyers, teachers, businessmen, writers and philosophers belonged to this class. They had the wealth and social status. So they influenced the people for revolution. They aroused the common people about their rights. Thus, the common people became rebellious. 4. Cultural Cause: The Enlightenment philosophy desacralized the authority of the monarchy and the Catholic Church, and promoted a new society based on reason instead of traditions. These Four Reasons Were The Cause Of French Revolution. Resources: Wikipedia , History Homepage | History Discussion - Discuss Anything About History and Encyclopedia Britannica Hope this will help.
