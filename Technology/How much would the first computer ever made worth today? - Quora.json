A replica of the design, completed, has been made and I suspect you could make further replicas at a profit to other museums and computer manufacturers. Bearing in mind the skill and effort required and how pretty it looks I would guess you're into 6 figures, in GBP.Antikythera mechanism? To put the whole thing together, if you could, doing all the research necessary to complete the lost, what is it, 50 odd wheels and to make it work as intended, 7 figures? Depends a bit who sells it and to whom and how accurate it is. And if the completed device revealed further engineering skills of the people who made the first one it could cause something of an upset in historical circles.I wouldn't mind betting you could nudge 8 figures on the right day. Mind you, as I understand the complexity of the original you're going to need at least the very latest 3d printer to get anywhere near a replica of the complete thing and they don't work brass yet.
