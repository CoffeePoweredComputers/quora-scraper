            "answer_text": "There are several plastics used in the automotive industry. While all of the ones listed bellow may easily be used in a single vehicle, just three types of plastic make up approximately 66% of the total plastics used: polypropylene (32%), polyurethane (17%) and PVC (16%).  1) Polypropylene (PP) Polypropylene (thermoplastic polymer) is used in a wide variety of applications. such as automotive bumpers, chemical tanks, cable insulation, gas cans, carpet fibers.  2) Polyurethane (PUR) Solid Polyurethane (elastomeric material) with exceptional properties such as toughness, flexibility, and resistance to abrasion and temperature. Usually found in flexible foam seating, foam insulation panels, elastomeric wheels and tires, automotive suspension bushings, cushions, electrical potting compounds, hard plastic parts.  3) PolyVinyl-Chloride (PVC) PVC has good flexibility, is flame retardant, and has good thermal stability, a high gloss, and low lead content. Used in automobile instrument panels, sheathing of electrical cables, pipes, doors.  4) ABS Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (copolymer) made by polymerizing styrene and acrylonitrile in the presence of polybutadiene. The styrene gives the plastic a shiny, impervious surface. The butadiene, a rubbery substance, provides resilience even at low temperatures. Used in body parts, dashboards, wheel covers.  5) Polyamide (PA, Nylon 6/6, Nylon 6) Nylon 6/6 frequently used when a low cost, high mechanical strength, rigid and stable material is required. Used in gears, bushes, cams, bearings, weather proof coatings.  6) Polystyrene (PS) Naturally clear, polystyrene is used in equipment housings, buttons, car fittings, display bases.  7) Polyethylene (PE) Polyethylene has high impact resistant, low density, and toughness. Used in car bodies (glass reinforced), electrical insulation.  8) POM (polyoxymethylene) POM has excellent stiffness, rigidity, and yield strength. Used in interior and exterior trims, fuel systems, small gears.  9) Polycarbonate (PC) Amorphous polycarbonate polymer offers a unique combination of stiffness, hardness and toughness. Used in bumpers, headlamp lenses.  10) Acrylic (PMMA) A transparent thermoplastic, PMMA . Often used as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass in windows, displays, screens.  11) PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) The thermoplastic PBT is used as an insulator in the electrical and electronics industries. Used in door handles, bumpers, carburetor components.  12) Polyethylene Teraphthalate (PET) PET used to create synthetic fibers and plastic bottles. Examples: wiper arm and gear housings, headlamp retainer, engine cover, connector housings.  13) ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate) ASA has great toughness and rigidity, good chemical resistance and thermal stability, outstanding resistance to weather, aging and yellowing, and high gloss. Uses are housings, profiles, interior parts and outdoor applications.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Source: AUTOMOTIVE MATERIALS PLASTICS IN AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS TODAY Identify Plastics ",

            "answer_text": "Plastics are lighter and more resilient than metals where they really count. Small panels, bumpers, seat fabrics, car fixtures, instrument clusters, dash boards, wire insulation looms, seals, gaskets, synthetic rubber, heavy weight nylon seat belt straps, air bags, light fixtures. Plastics are not there to keep costs down, they do other things no metal can do. The insulate, absorb vibration, make the car absorb energy from a crash without it doing as much damage to your body. Plastics make the car lighter and that saves gas. ",
