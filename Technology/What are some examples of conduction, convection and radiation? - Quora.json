            "answer_text": "Basically, conduction is the transfer of heat by contact or touching. An example is the ironing of clothes. The radiant heat from the iron is transferred to the shirt by touching. Convection is the transfer of heat by moving fluids such as air. Cool air blowing out of an air conditioner distributes cold air (negative heat). Convection involves the circulation of a moving fluid. The fluid can also be a gas or liquid. Radiation is like energy from the Sun. Heat energy can flow across a vacuum such as outer space. There does not need to be a moving fluid, and no contact is needed. An interesting piece of equipment is the modern heat pump used to heat a house. The heat pump is used to a much greater extent in southern states of the USA because the units are barely efficient whenever the outside temperature drops below 40 degrees F. The unit works much like a refrigerator by compressing Freon and circulating it. Of course, the pump is reversible (automatically) depending on winter or summer. Whenever the outside temperature drops below 40 degrees F, the unit must rely on \u201cheat strips\u201d. The strips are composed of coils of wire (usually copper). Electric current is passed through the coils and a fan forces air through the coils. The operation of the heat strips is much less efficient than the heat pump, and thus more expensive to operate. In colder northern climates, gas furnaces are more common and more expensive to operate. ",

            "answer_text": "Heat is a form of energy that gives you the feeling of an object being hot or cold. All these three are modes in which heat transfer takes place due to difference in temperatures of the two objects you are concerned with. Conduction occurs through a medium due to passing of energy from a higher energy molecule to lower one due to temperature difference. The analogy is that if you want to pass a pen in a line of people from the first to the last, it goes by passing from one person to the next until it reaches the last one. Example is the heating up of spoon placed in a cup of tea. Convection occurs when a fluid transfers heat by flowing from one place to another. Referring to the analogy, it is equivalent to the first person directly changing his position and taking the pen to the last person. Example is a fan which circulates air in the room as hot air moves to the top and cool air descends down due to convection. Radiation is the heat transfer in the form of electromagnetic waves (like light) without a medium. Analogy is that the first person directly throws the pen to the last person. Example is the heat coming from the sun to earth or the heat when you stand directly in front of the heater. It is the basis of thermal imaging. ",
