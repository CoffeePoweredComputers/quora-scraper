            "answer_text": "I used to work for the largest credit card issuer that was not a traditional retail bank. First USA pioneered direct mail pre-approval applications and was basically printing money from 1985 until it was acquired by Bank One in 1997. It ultimately dragged down Bank One due to some of its efforts to maximize profitability through questionable practices. The 25% return on investment for owners was stunning at the time. It peioneered no annual fee and introductory interest rate cards. As Christopher mentioned, you need to have a lot of capital - John Tolleson got all his wealthy friends together to capitalize First USA after working for Lomas for several years You have to be a bank - you are making loans You need a staff - HR, Regulations and Compliance (this is an ever increasing portion of banking operations), Operations, Sales, Capital Markets (to have money to loan), Credit, Operations, Facilities, Legal (someone has to write all those contracts), Fraud investigations, Product, Loyalty Rewards (if you are going to offer them), Marketing, Technology and Desktop Services, at minimum A Visa/MasterCard/Amex certified card printer and fulfillment center - to print your cards and mail them out, along with all those convenience checks and other marketing Membership to the Associations you will be issuing cards for - Visa, MasterCard, American Express Of course, a Business plan - high risk customers always are worth more in various types of fees, but they will default. Quality customers already have the credit they need, so how do you draw them to your card (again those loyalty rewards)? A realistic assessment of how many clients you will have, how much money you will make, how much you will lose, and find that right balance I may be missing a few items, but these are what I can think of off the top of my head. So\u2026are you ready to start your own issuing bank? ",

Several million US$ or GB\u00a3In the UK you would need a trading license to provide lines of Credit, and a \u00a31 000 000 bond, with the Bank of England.Acknowledge that you are going to experience default and bad debt, so your profits are not going to be high.You would then have to design the card, make it Chip\u2019n Pin and have a processor to create and encode the pin for you.Register with the clearing authorities; VISA and Master card, again significant amount of money.In short a lot of money, and not something that you are likely to do on your own.
