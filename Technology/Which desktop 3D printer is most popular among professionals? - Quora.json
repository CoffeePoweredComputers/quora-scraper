However, it\u2019s quite likely we\u2019re talking here about an FDM machine (Fusion Deposition Modelling) and since no extraordinary requirements are listed, I\u2019d suggest it doesn\u2019t need to be very large. As such, the best source of information on this is probably: 2017 Best 3D Printer Guide from 3DHubs since their listings are based upon actual use by people selling their services (as opposed to being the opinions of reviewers or personal favourites). According the latest stats, the most popular are as follows: Budget: Original Prusa i3 MK2 (now selling the MK2S) ~$699 Workhorse: Makergear M2 ~$1825 Prosumer: Ultimaker 2+ ~$2499 (although now you\u2019d probably buy the 3) ",
