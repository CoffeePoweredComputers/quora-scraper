            "answer_text": "Conditions in code, used for branching and looping, are an example of mathematical logic. Relational databases are based on the mathematical concept of relations. Routing in networks is based on graph theory and Boolean algebra. Cryptography is based on number theory. Artificial intelligence uses statistics. SQL is another example of mathematical logic. The performance of programs is strongly influenced by algorithmic complexity, which is based on algebra. Computers even add with a hardware implementation that uses Boolean algebra. Business models of which projects make sense to do are based on algebra, as are most models of development effort and schedule. Game development involves math related to physics. Business software development often includes math models of finance. Social networks and Excel are based on graph theory. I have personally used transitive closures in graphs and topological sorts of partial orders in graphs in interesting applications. Compilers use trees. Indexes in databases do too. ",

            "answer_text": "Some areas of information technology have significantly more math involved than others. For example, video game development with it\u2019s various physics simulations and intense graphics. Software development in general uses a fair amount of math. Network and systems administration use math for calculating IP addresses available in a given network, etc.. Since the fundamentals of information technology operate on logical systems where math is intrinsic to their operations, it may be difficult to find a single area of information technology that does not use math. Before we had digital computers, math mathematicians were kind of like software developers. They could develop a series of formulas and equations that took numbers as the input and delivered numbers as an output to represent some sort of function. This type of math is known as functional programming in software development. Just the other day, I wrote a plugin for a diagram editing application that calculated volume of a contour map. I wrote this plugin in Python and used the diagram editing applications API. Today I wrote a function that delivered an ETA for one of our printing systems. Tomorrow I plan on writing a unit conversion function. In summary, the application of math in information technology is nearly endless. ",

Some of them require math so much, it would be almost impossible to operate without it, for others a general understanding of the basics would be enough. That is if you're interested in this question because you plan to start a career in IT, you should really look into what knowledge base each specialization requires. ",
