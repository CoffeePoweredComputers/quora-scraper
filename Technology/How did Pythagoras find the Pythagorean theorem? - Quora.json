            "answer_text": "Take a right angled triangle which has base length \u2018a\u2019, height length \u2018b\u2019, and the side that joins them (hypotenuse) of length c.  Now consider a square consisting of four of these triangles:  The area of the whole square is quite obviously [math](a+b)^2 = A[/math] Now it becomes quite clear to see that the same area is also equal to the area of four of those triangles and the square in the middle, hence : [math]A= (4*(ab)/2) + c^2[/math] As the two areas are equal, we can simplify and solve: [math]a^2+2ab+b^2=2ab+c^2[/math] Subtract 2ab: [math]a^2+b^2=c^2[/math] And fini. That is one of many ways to show it and I believe that to be my favouite one of all. ",
