            "answer_text": "I serviced HP Proliant servers for about 8 years as a field tech for HP. I would occasionally get that question when I was working on a customer\u2019s server. My answer: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Everyone I\u2019ve ever seen has been broken.\u201d The DL380 is probably the most popular version in the Proliant series. In my current job I support about 95 Proliant DL 380s. They just work. In the last two years I\u2019ve replaced one system board and maybe 7 or 8 hot-swappable hard drives. The batteries for the cache module (BBWC) can stop charging after a few years so I\u2019ve replaced 3 or 4 of those, and my company likes to upgrade the cache module at the same time the battery is replaced. But maintenance wise, that\u2019s about it. I find the DL380\u2019s to be solid and reliable and if I had my own business I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to fill my racks with them. ",
