            "answer_text": "Ya of course, interactive education will improve the quality of education in India. There is a huge requirement of inclusion of technology. Government is trying best to do it. As of Karnataka, where I live, government have included programmes including TALP(Technical Aided Learning Programme) and many more things. But the problem is its not reaching in correct place at correct quality as the authorities in between are mostly corrupt they wont give the best possible quality of education as the funds are all taken away by the authorities. I came to know it by my mother as she is also working in a BEO(block education officer)office she discusses it with my father and I would silently be listening to her. According to her an officer atleast makes around 4\u20135 lacs a year illegally this is the reason of poor quality. Thanks for scrolling down. Please upvote if you liked it. ",
