            "answer_text": "Many negative and bewildering effects, those who say there are none are just cheerleaders for modern society. ENVIRONMENTAL Many negative environmental effects such as global warming, pollution etc. Many species are now going extinct. Many parts of our biosphere are slowly becoming uninhabitable, the Sahara desert is growing. SOCIAL Social withdrawal, social isolation, too much screen time. Not getting married, not having children: In developed countries the adults are simply not reproducing enough, leading to the decline of European peoples, Japanese peoples and so on. Old people are often left in retirement homes where in past they would live with their sons or daughters. MENTAL Many new mental illnesses are being exasperated by being in an industrial society. Many insane ideologies have sprung up as a direct result of the destabilizing element that technology has done to the traditional structure of society(PUA, Mens rights, Black lives matter, Feminism, Incels) Being in populated areas leads to a higher stress level. EMOTIONAL People feel they cannot find a partner, they feel isolated etc. PHYSICAL HEALTH Lots of new cancers and carcinogenic agents have been introduced due to the industrialism. Over abundance of food while in other parts of world total starvation. In developed nations people spend more time in front of screen and are slowly losing the ability to function in the natural world, weak, fat, etc. ECONOMIC The economy is in a perpetual state of growth, which is impossible to maintain, the economy is spread too wide and thin insuring an eventual economic collapse due to lack of available resources to support such a wide spread global society with 8+ billion members. There are many positive aspects too, but you wanted to know the negative ones. ",

            "answer_text": "So far, science and technologies have very little negative effects on society. what we could say is that science and technologies are the hopes of tomorrow, likewise the development of engineering in technologies and sciences enrich people lives in many different ways. You\u2019ll see these will be the advantages for the foundation of humanity to build a modern society. In actuality look at all the things that you have around: electronic devices, vehicles, trains, planes those thing were made based on the applied science and technologies. Although, let\u2019s just talk about negative effects as you\u2019re asking for. Basically we know that we can create something but that\u2019s not enough, things are not always that perfect, we still lack of perception. Meanwhile, we have a group of people that focusing on the impact of technologies make on humanity as a whole. what we do is that we make a deep research of some related topics like global warming due to the high level of CO2 in the atmosphere. So clearly we could say this is the most disadvantage of technologies. Probably some of us know that a lot of things we\u2019re using everyday contribute to the environment. Not even mention this; Industrial   Notice that the temperature is hotter and hotter every year. more and more people get health problems due to air pollution. Accordingly, hurricanes and tsunami constantly happened since 2015, Greenhouse gases/CO2 from the million and million automobiles; along with that we\u2019re still using a very unstable and unsustainable source like oil. Oil been around for a long time, we turn oil into gasoline and we use gasoline to run most of machineries. So the question is what if one day these sources are gone? The problem with that is the technologies that we have still running on unsustainable source. In order to fix that, we have to create the sustainable source; meaning that when we use it, it\u2019s gone but is harmless and can remake with almost no effort. Example: electric cars with zero emission; emits H2O only Hope that these related topics help you understand about the disadvantage and inefficiency of technologies we have, as well as an impact on society in general ",
