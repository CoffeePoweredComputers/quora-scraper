            "answer_text": "I. Work for myself Think of this as a show or a business. You can work on your own, or you can start a small company by partnering with friends. Yes, teamwork means the profits will have to be split, but also means a lot of work can be done quickly and more importantly, safety, which means you can be more flexible. When working with friends, divide work fairly and fairly (rotate work if possible to make people happy), gather in groups after class or on weekends around the neighborhood. , then get hired for a variety of jobs that can be completed quickly at a fixed price. A lot of people will turn their backs on a teenager when they see him knocking on their door for fear that he looks suspicious. But if they see you working in a group, they'll trust you to get in and out of their house quickly without disturbing your neighbors. If you are making money for a specific purpose (for example, buying an instrument, going on a field trip), tell everyone that; they will often buy from someone with a specific purpose of making money and maybe even pay you a little extra. 2. Consider doing common tasks. Babysitting, taking a dog for a walk, washing a car, or even videotaping and posting online with a genuine partnership, then you can make a lot of money from this job. Or you can mow the lawn for neighbors' houses. You can make a lot of money, but it takes hard work and a lot of weekend time. If you are distracted or depressed, remind yourself that hard work will produce real results. Set up groups for new jobs such as landscape decoration: a lawn mower, a water gutter cleaner, a hedge trimmer, and a pile of bricks and tiles. Ask your parents or parents of friends to lend 4. Doing chores in the house Talk to your parents about assigning chores to you. Try to choose things that parents may have to hire workers to do, like cleaning the toilet and only taking parents for half the price. Ask your parents if you can move every week. Wash your own clothes and wash dishes. Make sure you do a good job doing chores in the home or your parents will think you are not doing well for the money your parents pay you. If you don't have a lot of work to do, you can find other ways to make money (for example, \"If your child is really trying to save water and electricity, parents can pay for the amount of money their family saves compared to chemicals). last month? \"). Sometimes parents will be willing to help you if they know your plan, so share details with your parents. 5. Running errands for the elderly. Go for groceries, lift heavy things, repair computers or do whatever they are having trouble with. Try to make a good relationship with those people; Remember that they may feel very lonely and may enjoy spending time with young people as friends (Make them feel younger). The happier they are with you, the more they will pay you for the services you provide. 6. Bring trash to the curb. The day before the garbage truck arrives, go to all the families in the neighborhood you live in and ask to be paid VND 10,000 for you to take all the garbage to the curb to help them. (Don't ask for more; this is a simple job, so you have to maintain a reasonable price proportional to idle to get people more excited.) If you can collect garbage for twenty families, you have earned up to 200,000 VND with almost nothing to do. You may be even more fortunate if you work in the community of the elderly or the area you know may have many elderly people living. Do not do this in drainage areas or in the homes of any strangers for any reason. It is better to have an ally working in some situations 7. Start with the car wash job. Car wash and car care is a great money-making idea. With just a few people all the work can be done easily: one person wash and scrub the car, one takes care of the windows, the other two are in charge of the interior. Remember to vacuum thoroughly inside the car, scrub the wheel with a wax wheel, scrub the inside with a plastic brush (if the surface is plastic), and do it very carefully. Remember, if people don't like the results of your work, they can rely on professionals and can get it done for less. Always remember who you are competing with. 8. Disposal of old furniture. If you have a yard, consider selling second hand goods. You will be surprised to see how quickly they sell. Clean out your closet, attic, basement, and collect whatever else in your home is no longer needed and post ads for sale in the yard. Everything can give you some money. \"Promotion\" added by inviting shoppers for light, inexpensive drinks and beverages. It could be lemonade or popcorn if the weather is nice; or hot cup of tea if it's cold. You can sell for \"super\" cheap prices (because they sell second hand goods), almost for free, or for free, but accept donations (some people may be more generous than you think). If you have time, you can also make your own for sale. Just make sure you're still profitable! You have to consider the cost of raw materials. If you're serious about selling something, learn more about bargaining. 9. Advertise its services. Order a low-cost newspaper or online advertising such as babysitting, babysitting, pet care, etc. You can also hand out leaflets and business cards to people who need help advertising. Craigslist is a great website for you to provide your services, but consider having a parent or guardian for you when you plan to do business; Business is not the ideal job, but there are still many people out there trying to take advantage of you, and you need to prepare yourself well. You don't need to worry, but there are still many things to be aware of. I use update part II. We look forward to the support of the people You can contribute comments here ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer-Not sure what your gender is because you didn't specifically mention it so I'm just going to write this answer from a boys point of view. There are five main ways to earn money as a teen that I know of Mow lawns. I know, I know, typical answer, one you've probably gotten from countless others already, but it truly is a great first job. It requires little experience or skill, you pretty much have an infinite supply of lawns to mow (I garuntee if you ask around enough and offer a reasonable (or less than reasonable, you're not a professional after all) price, you\u2019ll find plenty of jobs), and you don't need too many expensive tools (either you or this person likely already has a lawn mower). It does have a few cons though, which I will put in bullet form after each example.Physical laborNot always the best payCan get boring and requires a vehicle (unless you\u2019re mowing your neighbors lawns)Garage sale. This is mainly if you need some quick cash for something and not a permanent job. Surely you have some old toys or clothes that you don't use any more laying around your room. My friend in middle school sold off all his Pok\u00e9mon card collection along with his baby clothes once and pulled in nearly $200. Cons:Could be tough to convince your parents to let you do thisYou need semi-valuabmale stuff to sell, people won't just buy junkNeed to live in a house; appartment won't doOne-offAsk your parents to set up an allowance for you. This one is probably the simplest. Just ask your parents if they\u2019d be willing to give you a weekly or monthly allowance. Tell them that it would teach you fiscal responsibility and offer to do more chores around the house to compensate. If they still won't budge, ask them to start off with something small, maybe $1\u20133 a week, and just save it all until you have enough for whatever you want (dont forget to put some in the bank, too). Just remember, your parents might not be able to afford this, so don't push it too hard, and be understanding if they say no. Cons:Small amount of money over long period of timeMight take some convincing to get your parents to pay you anythingNot affordable for some familiesSell stuff at school. This is probably the most lucrative of all the methods listed here. You can sell pretty much anything at school, be it food, supplies, shoes, or even homework answers (not recommended but hey, don't shoot the messenger). Simply buy stuff at a super cheap conscience store, or other people, as is the case with shoes, and then resell it for a higher price. Easy profit, especially selling to kids with parents who wouldn't let them buy that kind of stuff normally. Cons:99.99% chance it's not allowed at your school (but hey, that doesn't mean it's impossible to get away with it. Just be smart about it)You\u2019ll need an older sibling, really chill parent, or other trusted older friend to buy the stuff in the first place, then give it to you to sell at school (remember to kick them a few dollars if you have one of the 3)Selling shoes and answers are both pretty riskyGet a traditional job. This is going to be the most difficult, if not downright impossible, depdending on where you live, thing to do. First, you\u2019ll need a work permit from your school\u2019s principal (depending on your age, it varies by state). You\u2019ll need to set up an appointment with him/her and tell them where you plan on working, how long you plan on working a week, and how it will effect your grades (you\u2019ll need to maintain decent to good grades (B- to A+ ish) if you even want your principle to consider it. On top of that, you'll need to find a teen friendly job, like busing tables, limited cooking, limited cleaning, theme park ride attendant, or parking attendant. Cons:Lots of convincing both your parents and schools admins that you are mature and responsible enough to get a jobFinding a place that will hire a teen. (Just ask around at your favorite restaurants if they are hiring and during your interview try to act as mature and as grown up as you can.)Realizimg that this is a real-life commitment, and that you won't have as much time to hang out with your friends or do other social/fun like that if you take this job.Keeping your grades upThat's really all that I could think of. If you\u2019re a girl, I'm so sorry! I couldn't think of anything other than baby-sitting (in addition to the boys list) that you could do, and I don't know enough about babysitting to say anythign about it with any level of authority. Hope this helped! Edit 1: spelling and grammar ",
