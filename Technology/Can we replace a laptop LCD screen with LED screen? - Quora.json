            "answer_text": "Unless you refer to an OLED screen, going by conventionally used terminology , you will already have an LED backlit LCD display. The other kind of LCD display is no longer manufactured and is a CCFL ( Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) backlit LCD display. You cannot replace a LCD with an OLED as the panel won\u2019t be manufactured to fit . OLED screens are extremely expensive and are not available in too may sizes. ",

You can buy a new panel and install it yourself to the laptop, too - check out some DIY videos on this. ",
