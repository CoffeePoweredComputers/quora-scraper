            "answer_text": "Unlikely. We know that the anus can take even a thick penis without being stretched permanently. That\u2019s the equivalent of three fingers. It\u2019s really only when fingering at four fingers that stretch of the anal sphincters might become significant. Even then the four fingers would have to be held in the anus, without any movement that altered the stretch, for many hours. That would have to be repeated on other days. The anal sphincters would then be loosened. I doubt that you would find someone who would subject their fingers to such extreme treatment. For a deliberate loosening project a Butt Plug is used. It\u2019s a toy that is specially shaped to stay in the anus with minimal risk of popping out. Tight underwear adds extra protection. The Butt Plug comes in different width sizes depending on the target loosening, e.g. a thin penis, or thick penis , or the different sizes of fists. An alternative is an anus that can stretch but has elasticity, an ability to return to the original size. This can be achieved by using the Butt Plug repeatedly, but for much shorter periods. Exercising the outer sphincter adds to the amount of anal control the person can develop. Fears that the anus may permanently leak are just fears. In my experience such anuses are quite rare. Much more commonly seen is that the fear inhibits the person achieving their goal and enjoying the result. ",

            "answer_text": "Not very likely. The anus has an extremely strong set of external muscles that go back to their original tight seal within time after any amount of stretching. Now, one can do damage to a muscle if one stretches it to the point where it breaks. But, it is not very likely that fingers are going to do that. Play gently, and use lots of lubricant. ",
