            "answer_text": "Due to the advancement of technology, online ID verification has become the latest topic to manage long-term security for businesses. As we know in the age of the internet, hacking is the by-handed game for the system admins who not only steal your information but also loot your bank accounts with the utmost ease. Therefore, we can say that the use of biometrics, face detection systems, video & voice verification gives tremendous security in the future and ends up the financial crisis which is very common with the unsustainable macroeconomic policies. How does technology affect identity checks? It is so hard to make future predictions about the technology due to the frequent changes which we have seen in our day-to-day life. Still, your business needs to be aware of the various advances which are especially discovered for the ID verification online. Biometric Biometric is one of the leading and worthwhile technologies that are used to verify/identify online identification via hand geometry, face recognition, fingerprints, voice, retinal, iris, vein & handwriting. It measures the behavioral & physical characteristics to maintain the records in the system that the people who have made entry are genuine or do not commit any crime. Real-time ID Verification \u2013 Artificial Intelligence Talk about the Apple that specially provides facial recognition systems in iPhone to protect the personal information from other users. Face Id automatically configures who you are and unlock the phone immediately to help you to access the inner applications. Another example is onboarding technology that works on the concept of AI (Artificial Intelligence). It offers an extensive range of features; likewise, validation forgery check, object detection, video-based ID verification to make it efficient full setup in customer onboarding. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, 10 years is too long a time to be able to forecast with any amount of confidence, especially when it comes to technology and all things internet. In November 2004 Palm had just started shipping Treo 650 and the year's bestseller was the MotoRazr V3 and none of us predicting what the internet would look like in 2014 could have been anywhere near where we now are.I would conjecture about the near future holding the following in store: Consolidation of identities: Before we can see emergence of some form of near omnipresent identity verification, we first need a ubiquitous identity. We're all tired of managing a different identities for getting different things done. In the next few years, we should see consolidation of identity management to a handful of alternatives. I do not foresee this consolidated identity being a biometric measure just yet since it is cumbersome to operate with using our current technologies and social protocols (same as passports, driving license etc.). One possibility is of Apple/Google/Facebook IDs becoming this consolidated identity - however none is currently near ubiquitous. Given how strongly lines are drawn between Apple/Google, it seems unlikely that either of them will have the lion share of the market (thereby consolidating it into an identity). Of all the measures of online identity, Facebook may become the first to be an identity for all humans (and possibly devices) connected to the internet, but given the social implications of its privacy, I'm skeptical of that too. The other foreseeable universal identity may be phone numbers. As smartphone penetration reaches saturation, nearly all of these phone numbers will be connected to the internet and thus enable the easiest, most widely adopted, unique identity. I am inclined to believe the phone number will be this consolidated identity.Streamlining of Identity Verification: Once this happens, we should start seeing a streamlining of identity verification. Within the next couple of years, most iOS devices will undeniably be touch ID enabled - and Google will follow suit. For security and privacy concerns, though, I'd presume these will simply be measures that are used by your devices to verify your identity and not shared online - that is, you will probably not sign onto Facebook or your bank online with Touch ID. Once your internet enabled device (phone, tablet or anything else) is assured its user is indeed you, it will then identify you with your phone number (which consolidates all your identities, depending on what you're doing/using) behind the scenes. Correlating your phone number with the task at hand and the context of the communication will result in identity verification. In other words, Context will be the verification. To explain what I mean, consider this - Because Facebook knows your phone number, when you use Facebook from your phone, it would be automatically authenticated. You'll authenticate your other internet enabled devices using your phone number as well - by ensuring your phone and you are in possession of the device you wish to authenticate yourself on. If you want to do a bank transaction, it will be allowed through your phone number from a device that is known to be yours and can be verified to be with you. All of these will be done in the background and unless something changes in your context - place, time, behaviour, etc. - nothing will require an explicit authentication.Unfortunately, I see neither sci-fi visions of identity verification on the internet nor a complete redundancy of the password in the near future. Above all, nothing can help an idea that's ahead of its time; nor stop one whose time has come - so none of these conjectures may come true even in 10 years, or all of them could be realised in a couple of years. At Nexmo, where I work, we're excited to be working on phone number based methods of verification. ",

            "answer_text": "Online Identity verification is simply verifying a person\u2019s identity over the internet using government-issued documents. In recent years, technological advances have given rise to digital fraud and cybercrime which increases the risk of data loss. While verifying identity online is a good means of cutting on time and resources, identity theft remains a concern. Amid the expansion of online businesses and FinTechs, there has been a rapid transition in customer verification methods. This change has created better opportunities in the digital security domain. As a need of the hour, conventional businesses and retailers are now shifting to online payment methods and ID verification services to expand their scope in better reaching their end-users. Recently, AI-based solutions have also emerged as a valuable addition to online identification. Online verification services are now combining machine learning with human intelligence to provide highly effective identification services. Biometrics and advanced AI models have the demand for these products, promising a bright future of the identity verification industry due to their increasing need and ease of use. The main selling point of these products includes security at a click of the button. Hence, online identity verification remains a trending topic for the future. ",
