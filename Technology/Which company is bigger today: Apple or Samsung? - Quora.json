            "answer_text": "ANSWER: SAMSUNG Apple is more \"valuable\" as a brand, meaning more stock holders value Apple and place a high value on it.. but Samsung GENERATES more profits.. plus Samsung has much more employees than Apple. The value people place on Apple is just a made up value.. that's how their net worth is inflated. It's just like when Donald Trump bragged about how rich he was.. that inflated his net worth and helped him get into the Forbes 100 list (which they've since retracted him from it).. Trump didn't actually have that much money, it's just investors thought he was valuable and placed a high value on him (which allowed him to get bank loans which he never paid back). Samsung makes money selling parts to Apple.. so thus, when Apple sells, Samsung also sells and prosper. An AMOLED display on the iPhone X costs Apple $110 for each panel. Apple has no choice, no one else makes AMOLED screens (except LG, whom is now providing the OLED screens for the iPhone XS and XS Max). Samsung makes many other things other than phones and computers.. they are a household name brand and known for their TVs, refrigerators (including smart fridges with a touch screen on it), washers and dryers, and smart home technology... they also make serious military equipment such as tanks and they even own a basketball team (watch the video below if you don't believe me). Yes, Apple owns half of the smartphone marketshare in the USA and Samsung only owns a quarter.. but in the international market (rest of the world), Samsung is number 1 and Apple is actually at the bottom of the list, under Huawei, Oppo, and other brands. Samsung makes parts for Apple including AMOLED screens (on the iPhone X and Apple Watch), RAM chips for their phones and computers as Samsung makes RAM memory, SSD memory for storage memory for their phones and computers (sometimes they use them or sometimes they used SanDisk), camera sensors for smartphones (their Samsung ISOCELL sensor), CPU processors (Samsung Exynos) etc. All of this is produced in their giant factories in South Korea\u2026 Samsung makes money off of other smartphone companies other than Apple as well.. especially with their RAM, SSD, and camera sensors. Apple does not own any factories, they pay Taiwanese based company, Foxconn, to assemble them in China. Samsung on the other hand actually owns factories.. a gigantic one in South Korea and some factories in Vietnam. Google obviously does not have any factories whatsoever and they pay various companies to make their phones (they did however used to own Motorola and once had a USA factory to assemble the phone but it was a huge failure). Samsung makes a lot of money FROM Apple. Apple usually only makes a handful selection of iPhones, high end computers which not everyone can afford to buy; their Apple TV and Smart Home Speaker were a fail and didn't really take off (although their Apple TV unit might make a comeback since they launched the Apple TV+ service).. Apple is number one in terms of smartphones sold in the USA.. however, Samsung is actually number one in the whole world especially since they make specific phones for each market and country which best suits their budget. Most iPhones that are sold internationally are sold on the black market.. imported or a \u201crepaired\u201d iPhone that ends up wrapped up inside a new box and sold as \u201cnew\u201d using replacement parts from China. Samsung also makes other things such as TVs, refrigerators, washer and dryers, smart home devices, laptops, all types of cameras, SSD memory (SSD drives and micro SD cards), smart home products, and many other industrial things like serious military equipment like tanks and machine guns, ships, machines, etc.. they own a basketball team that play on their behalf (watch video below).. Apple does not make any TVs, refrigerators, washer and dryers, make military weapons and vehicles, own a basketball team named after them, etc. As mentioned earlier, Samsung makes money selling parts to other companies, they actually make more money selling parts to Apple than they do make from their own Galaxy smartphones (you can fact check that). They actually hold the biggest market share of AMOLED screens (LG owns a small portion but it's now growing bigger, especially after working with Apple). Nobody else really makes AMOLED screens so Google and Apple have to get it from Samsung.. if they can't, then they usually get it from LG. American brand electronics usually are not made by the company.. they hire other companies to make them and purchase parts from different companies in Asia (China, South Korea, and Japan). Samsung also makes their own processor (Exynos processor) and they also make very good cameras as well (the NX cameras). I have a 2013 Samsung laptop and it's absolutely superb.. the hardware is built rock solid.. especially since Samsung uses a lot of their OWN PARTS when they make the PC. Apple, on the other hand, must pay for parts from all other companies.. usually Foxconn.. and for SSD they get it from SanDisk or possibly Samsung.. screens they get from LG or Samsung (for LCD screens, they go with LG).. the camera sensor is usually from Sony (or also possibly a Samsung), and for RAM memory, Apple uses Samsung and have been using it since the iPhone 1. Samsung is very rich, it's just that Apple is more popular in the USA.. in order to be rich, you need to sell more things other than phones and computers. Apple is now focusing on making money off services.. either selling more cloud storage or making TV shows and movies with their Apple TV+ streaming service which appears to be aimed at Gen Z and millennials. If you don't believe me, watch this video about Samsung and you'll learn a lot more.. don't mind the funny thumbnail picture (that is Samsung's quality assurance test to make sure their smartphones passes the bend test when you put the phone in your back pocket). It's an interesting video about Samsung's history and really explains what else they do besides make electronics:  ",

            "answer_text": "I want to give a biased answer to this question. Basic info about myself: Smartphone: CasperMP3 Player and earphone, headphones: Philips, Sony, CasperLaptop: ASUSTV, washing mashine, etc. : None of them are product of Samsung or AppleSW preference: Like iOS approach more than Android oneHW preference: Think Samsung is better in this area nowThe short answer: In consumer electronics branch => AppleAs a company/group => SamsungAs a whole company/group the two are not even comparable. However in term of consumer electronics, Apple is bigger. Apple\u2019s net income is more than that of Samsung Group, meaning Apple is earning more money each year than the whole Samsung Group. However Samsung has much more revenue than Apple. If Samsung has much more revenue than Apple, then why Apple\u2019s net income is larger than that of Samsung Group? Because Samsung spends more money to expend itself than Apple does. Samsung is trying to become leader in every possible branch of business. Of course it is far from accomplishing that, but in some branches they are considered one of the best companies (as you might be familiar with some of them). As I mentioned earlier, Apple is bigger than Samsung Electronics now, but not sure what will happen in the future, because in terms of hardware and technology, Apple\u2019s dependency on other companies is increasing and the opposite is true for Samsung as it recently became leader of semiconductor sales. One can only compare consumer electronics of Samsung to that of Apple. Samsung as a company is not all about electronics. Samsung has hundreds of business branches, these are just some of them: Samsung ElectronicsSamsung EngineeringSamsung SemiconductorSamsung Life InsuranceSamsung Fire & MarineSamsung C&T CorporationSamsung SDSSamsung Electro-mechanicsRenault Samsung MotorsSamsung FashionAnd many othersTo illustrate how big Samsung is read the following facts. Intel is not leader of semiconductor branch anymore because of Samsung Semiconductor (Samsung surpasses Intel as world's biggest chipmaker for the first time). Samsung Semiconductor suddenly became famous and nowadays Apple itself is dependent on itIf you are one of the Apple fans, then imagine if you buy an IPhone X, then you are paying $110 of it to Samsung (Samsung's component division will make more money off the iPhone X than the Galaxy S8)You might have heard about Burj Khalifa in UAE, research about which company has built itSamsung manufactures even tanks (and other military equipment)!!!It manufactures industrial machines, ships, etc.It even has well known medical centerSamsung Group\u2019s revenue is more than 70% of national budget of South Korea!!!These are just some of the facts about Samsung Group. To make it simple, if you had enough money to buy everything on planet and decided to buy both Samsung Group and Apple, assuming both agree to sell it to you at their market price. Apple would cost more than Samsung ElectronicsSamsung would cost more than AppleHope it answered your question. I would be grateful if you write your suggestions and points that I missed as a comment. ",
