            "answer_text": "Apple had already started manufacturing iPhone 6S, 7 and 8 in 2017 in their Wistron Plant near Bangalore. Since August 2019, they have also been assembling iPhone XR. It\u2019s not much difficult for Apple to expand to other iPhone or maybe even MacBooks and iPads. They are definitely looking for alternative countries to spread out the manufacturing process. They have definitely learnt well from Corona Virus lockdowns across China. At the moment, it\u2019s difficult something like this will happen this year itself. More likely 2022 will be a safe bet when Apple actually manufacturers the latest generation iPhone from India. Presently it manufactures only old model. I would like to clarify, that it\u2019s not \u201cshifting\u201d it\u2019s \u201cexpanding\u201d. Because they won\u2019t be shutting down the existing plants in China. They might downsize, but will never shut down. They\u2019ll only spread more plants around the world, but China will still remain the manufacturing hub for not only Apple but many others. ",
