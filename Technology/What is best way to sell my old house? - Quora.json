            "answer_text": "Believe it or not, I, as a real estate agent veteran, will not simply say that you should always use a professional agent. True, more often than not, you are far better off. But there are instances where it may not make sense for you to try to sell a home on your own. First, you need to know the pricing trends, inventory levels, and absorption rates in your neighborhood (or fairly short proximity). Very rarely are two home exactly alike, so understanding the value of what makes your home special is helpful to ensure you capture the highest sales price possible. For example, if your home is a 4 bedroom, and recently sold homes nearby all had three bedrooms, how much more is that bedroom worth in your neighborhood? Knowing that information can be worth thousands of dollars to you. Same goes for basements, attics, pools, covered patios, and a huge list of other features that might apply to you. Now that you have identified what your home is worth (approximately), it\u2019s time to get the word out. Pictures are worth a thousand words, so take a lot of them, and seriously consider hiring a professional photographer to do it for you. Ok, you are priced right and look great (photos and actual house). How do you get people to see you? Have you ever had a garage sale? How did you let people know about it? Think along those lines when advertising your home, only much, much \u201cbigger\u201d. Promoting a garage sale tells people that live in or near your neighborhood about your event. But, if those people already live nearby, they are probably not your buyer, so take the same concept and spread it all over town\u2026the city\u2026the state\u2026the country. On-line is helpful for this, but promoting to the local agents is also advised (hint: an agent is going to want to get paid to find your buyer for you, so consider an offering of somewhere around 2\u20133%). After you find your buyer, you are going to need to hire an attorney to make sure you protect yourself. This is one of your most valuable assets; please do not leave it to chance. So, to summarize, you can run around and do all these things in place of hiring an agent, and you should be able to save money. Estimating most agents charge somewhere around 6%, I would say you could save about 2%, maybe 3% of that by doing it on your own. But, just because you didn\u2019t pay an agent 6% doesn\u2019t mean you saved 6% when you sold your home yourself. You are probably looking at more like 2%-3%. Oh, and by the way\u2026when selling on your own, a buyer almost immediately wants to pay you 6% less for your home. So, excellent negotiating skills will be needed. Title insurance, approval letters for the buyer, appraisal contingencies, inspections, attorney\u2019s fees, prorations, recording documents, surveys, deed assignments, transfer taxes, HOA responsibilities - You probably need to know how all these things work as well. Find a QUALITY real estate agent and find a way to work with him/her. It will save you SO much headache and only cost you a fraction of what you think it will. ",

            "answer_text": "Hire a good stager that will give you advise. Your house may even show better vacant. Trust the advise of the stager and make the changes.Hire a professional to paint those rooms in the colors recommended by the stager.Hire a professional house cleaner and window cleaner. If you have carpeting, replace only the bedroom carpets if they cannot clean to look & smell like new. If you have worn carpeting in the living rooms, change it to at least laminate. Costco has nice looking wide plank laminate for not much money.If you have pets, remove dogs for ALL showings.. Cats can stay.Hire someone else to attend showings as it's very uncomfortable for buyers to view a home while an owner is present.Buy an electronic lockbox to allow Realtors to show at their Buyer's convenience. Typically agents will show 5 or 6 properties in a row and if you cannot accommodate the showing time requested, the agent will bypass your house.Hire an attorney to review offers, renegotiate after inspections and review your final settlement statement and closing documents.Plan to negotiate hard with buyers that are not working with a Realtor, they will want your commission savings in their pocket.Buy a wifi connected thermostat so you can adjust the temperature remotely to assure it is right for showings.Don't waste your time doing an Open House, the odds are very slim a buyer that is ready to buy will not already be working with a Realtor.Hire a professional photographer once you've made the corrections suggested by the Stager. If your stager recommends you leave rooms vacant then also hire a virtual stager.Good luck! ",
