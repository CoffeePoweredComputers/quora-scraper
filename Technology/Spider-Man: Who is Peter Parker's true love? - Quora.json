            "answer_text": "Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, may be thought of as a nerd, socially awkward guy, but for a kid that weird he surely has a lot of luck with the women. Peter has had many girlfriends in his long history. Some last, others end in tragedy, but all are ones that progress Peter as a character. Probably his most popular girlfriends in the comics include; Mary Jane WatsonGwen StacyFelicia Hardy, aka Black CatBetty BrantLiz AllanBut he has also had many others. But they prize the winning position as Spider-Man one true love? We can already put Liz Allan and Betty Brant out of the loop. Liz and Peter\u2019s relationship was always going to fail. Liz was a primary bully in Parker\u2019s youth, whilst Betty was Peter\u2019s first but it ended in when Parker was unable to commit to a relationship due to his alter ego Spider-Man. That leaves us with MJ, Gwen Stacy and Black Cat to go. I am counting Black Cat out as she is ultimately with Spidey for the fun. She has no desire to find out who is under the mask of Spidey even to the point that when Spidey did finally unmask himself, she left and refused to talk to Spider-Man again. So that's not true love. This leaves Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane remaining. Lets look at these two women: Gwen Stacy:  Gwen Stacy is the first true love of Peter\u2019s life. They met at the Empire State University where Gwen initially took an unliking to Peter. She thought him too quiet and shy. But attraction came all too soon for the two. She soon saw him as a science lover, like herself and they became romantically involved. Parker at the time was dating MJ, but the two broke up because Peter thought her too out of his league and self absorbed. Gwen and Peter developed one of the most beloved comic book couples ever, with the two of them becoming icons. Gwen\u2019s father, Captain George Stacy, was both fond of Peter and Spider-Man, which Peter was happy about. Unfortunately Gwen didn\u2019t think much of Spider-Man. When George was killed in a battle with Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man, a rift grew between the two similar to the rift that caused Betty and Peter to break up. Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her fathers death. Gwen soon leaves New York City for Europe in the hopes that Peter will ask her to marry him for her to stay, but Peter is too self-absorbed in guilt to notice. Then, in one of the most shocking story lines ever Gwen Stacy was captured by the Green Goblin, Spider-Man\u2019s arch rival, and chucked off the George Washington Bridge, fitting as her father was also named George. Spidey races to capture her and as Gwen is thrown off by the Goblin, Peter spins a web intended to catch Gwen, but the result causes a whiplash, thus breaking Gwen\u2019s neck.  It is still a cause of debate over what finished her off; The shock of the fall or the webbing, but either way one thing was clear, Gwen was dead and not returning. Peter later killed the Green Goblin in anger and was hunted by the cops for a while. Gwen later appeared in the Clone Saga. Apparently a scientist liked Gwen and after he heard of her death he became obsessed with trying to bring her back and ultimately made a clone of her. When Peter first saw Gwen \u201creturn\u201d to life, he was already in a deep relationship with Mary Jane Watson. Gwen was revealed to be a clone but it showed Spidey still cares about Gwen. Now we get to why fans debate. Gwen Stacy is shown to have a massive effect on Peter\u2019s life. Her death taught him that he had to actually jump after people falling and his webbings couldn\u2019t do all of the work. Peter still even talks about Gwen, thinks of Gwen and even visits her grave every so often. He still loves her deeply. Nothing will ever change that. But Gwen Stacy wasn\u2019t little miss perfect. Whilst in a strong relationship with Peter it was revealed she actually had an affair with none other than her murderer, Green Goblin. They even had three children together! This proves Gwen wasn\u2019t as faithful to Peter as some may think. Hold that thought. Mary Jane Watson:  Mary Jane Watson, the girl next door, was the woman Peter\u2019s own aunt and MJ\u2019s aunt tried to hook him up with. Aunt May always loved the idea of Peter dating Mary Jane and tried so hard, maybe a little too hard, to get the two together. Peter always dodged Aunt May\u2019s attempts to unite the two as he thought Mary Jane would be too out of his league. But the two finally met in this great and iconic scene of comic book history:  \u201cFace it tiger, you just hit the jackpot!\u201d was the first line of dialogue Mary Jane spoke to Peter Parker. The two begin to date much to the pleasure of Aunt May and Anna, but to the distaste of Gwen Stacy. The two begin to become irritated with each other and break up. Peter chooses Gwen over MJ. Mary Jane doesn\u2019t let this gets to her and eventually goes on to date Peter\u2019s friend Harry Osborn. Mary remains a close friend to both Peter and Gwen. Mary Jane really came back into Peter\u2019s life after Gwen was killed by the Goblin. Mary Jane rushed over to help Peter in his time of grief and stayed with him, talked with him and cared for him, Gwen was her friend too. Peter however accuses her of not caring about anyone and even uses a what if your mother died on her. Unknown to Peter Mary Jane had lost her mother, and hurt by his comments she wants to leave but ultimately decides to stay with Peter. This changes the course of Parker\u2019s and Watson\u2019s relationship forever. They soon rekindle their relationship, however MJ was scared of settling down with one man for good and when Peter finally proposes she turns him down. (What kind of love is this? First he finds MJ irritating, and then leaves her for Gwen? Next the two only get together because she died. And now she turns down his proposal! MJ is horrible). Well bear with me for a minute. MJ wanted to be fully and 100% in with Peter and she didn\u2019t want any reservations. So she leaves Peter and New York City behind her. In her absence Peter dates other women, particularly Felicia Hardy, otherwise known as the Black Cat. But she soon returns a new women, she appears to have grown up. She left her party girl aspect behind her. Now she admits to Peter she knows he is Spider-Man, as she saw him crawl out of the bedroom one night. But she still doesn\u2019t want to resume a relationship and they remain friends. This proves MJ is in it not only for fame or to be with a hero. Peter talked to MJ about giving up being Spider-Man, a decision she fully agrees too. The two soon have a few longer years apart but soon resume a romance. Peter proposes again, and Mary Jane again turns him down, again unsure, but finally agrees to marry the webbed crawler. The two were married for over twenty years! Their marriage suffered hardships and a little arguments, but also spawned happiness and peace to both. Sure, Mary Jane did feel attracted to a few other people whilst married to Peter but always knew not to cheat. During the Civil War Mary Jane Watson agreed to live in Stark Tower with Aunt May for protection, but she also sided with Peter on everything. However when problems occur after Aunt May is shot it causes Peter and MJ to unite like never before. Aunt May had always had health issues, but now it was life of death. The devil, Mephisto, created a deal with the pair; He would save Aunt May if it meant he could take what was most precious to the two of them- their marriage\u2026 Peter and MJ agree. This is how much MJ loves Peter; She is willing to give up their marriage in order to save Peter\u2019s aunt. MJ also wishes Peter a happy life and begs Mephisto to allow his secret identity to be retconned back to it being secret. Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker may have had their memories and years of happiness wiped from their minds in the comics, how long before they can\u2019t ignore their fate together? Yes, Gwen Stacy may be Peter\u2019s first and yes she may have a special place in Peter\u2019s heart, but MJ and Peter have more history. MJ and Peter took years to get their relationship perfect. They worked hard for it, and in their end their marriage was the happiest thing they had. Mephisto may of taken it away. But MJ is Spidey\u2019s true love. MJ is Spider-Man\u2019s Lois Lane. MJ and Spider-Man forever.  ",

            "answer_text": "One thing\u2019s for sure, Peter Parker has a lot of beautiful anatomically absurd ladies to choose from.  I mean the guys a veritable wall-crawling Casanova. As the 15 Things You Didn't Know About Spider-Man proves he has had more woman swinging through his life than most realize. There\u2019s Kitty Pryde, who he dated during Ultimate Spider-Man though later broke-up with after reconciling with Mary Jane.  Betty Brant, who was a secretary at the Daily Bugle and eventually left Peter for the guy that would become Hobgoblin. Ouch.  Debra Whitman, who he hooked up with while at college until she went nuts trying to figure out his true identity and ran away like a crazy person.  Carlie Cooper, who was a cop that got a Spider-Man tattoo because how else do you show Spider-Man you love him?  And then the heavy hitters\u2026 Like Felicia Hardy aka the Black Cat, who is basically the Catwoman of Spidey\u2019s world. Only a lot more fun.  And of course, Gwen Stacy.  Gwen is iconic for having been thrown off a bridge by the Green Goblin.  Goblin may have snapped her neck prior to the hurl. Spider-Man may have killed her via the whiplash of his webs trying to save her. Either way, she died and it was a huge deal and made a huge impact on the rest of Peter\u2019s life.  She\u2019s also less known for having cheated on him with the Green Goblin aka Norman Osborne. An affair in which she got knocked up and had twins.  (And unfortunately now you you know what it\u2019s like to have sex with Tommy Lee Jones. Try not dreaming about that tonight.) Though I wouldn\u2019t call her his true love. She\u2019s the love he lost.  Sure during House of M it was implied Peter\u2019s ideal world involved being married to Gwen. But what we think we want is not always necessarily what we really want. And I think that\u2019s the case with Gwen Stacy. Because she was always more of an ideal and than a reality.  The redheaded spunky Mary Jane Watson on the other hand was very much real, and the only one of Spidey\u2019s many love interests that Parker married.  She\u2019s the Lois to his Clark. The Pepper to his Tony. The Robin to his Bruce. She\u2019s the romantic love of his life.  You know this because they did it a lot.  All kinky web sex aside, they also had a connection that none of his other romantic relationships could live up to.  This was a probably best on display during the Reign story arc, set 30 years in an alternate future where we find Spider-Man absolutely devastated by the loss of his MJ.  Sure, the reason she died was because his radioactive sperm gave her cancer, but that just makes it all more tragic.  And gross. Even Mephisto, Marvel\u2019s version of the devil, said their love was \u201cone in a millennia.\u201d  Which is why he was willing to make a deal with Peter to erase every trace of his ever having been married to Mary Jane from existence. Because the devil\u2019s a dick. Why would anyone want to break up this?  Well for a very good reason actually. The deal with the devil was made so Spider-man could save the life of the only other woman that matters to him more than Mary Jane; which leads me to my answer to this question. Peter Parker\u2019s true love is his Aunt May.  For over fifty years, Spider-Man has been closer to or trusted no other woman more than her. Really, save for Alfred Pennyworth, no other comic character has been more devoted or caring of their superhero counterpart than his elderly adopted caregiver.  Relationships will come and go, but the love of a motherly aunt will never go away. Nor will the feelings Spider-Man has for her. And besides, how many of Spider-Man\u2019s ladies look this good in his costume.  ",
