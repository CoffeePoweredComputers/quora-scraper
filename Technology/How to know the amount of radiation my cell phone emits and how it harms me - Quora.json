            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very excellent question! Electronic devices we use on a day-to-day basis works through the medium of electromagnetic & ionic radiations. These radiations are capable of piercing through human bodies & affect it in many different ways. Some studies have linked the exposure of cell phone radiations & different types of cancers. Studies have shown that excessive use of Cell phones may cause Brain cancer. That being said, let\u2019s see how to measure radiations emitted from your cell phone devices. Radiations coming from the Cell phone or Mobile device can be determined based on their SAR value. This value can help us know how exposed are humans to the radiation emitted from your smartphone devices. SAR rating simply stands for Specific Absorption Rate. It is a measure of the maximum energy absorbed a unit of mass of exposed tissue of a human body from a mobile phone for a given period of time. OR simply, \u2018 the rate of electromagnetic radiation frequency absorbed by a human body from the source into consideration - in this scenario, a cell phone. Now, let\u2019s find out how can you measure the SAR value of your cellphone? Check your Mobile User Guide. It is likely that you find the value there.Check on your Mobile Phone Manufacturer Website: For ease, please find the ones of the popular brands as below,AppleSamsungSonyDial the USSD code - #07#Look into your Phone\u2019s Settings.Check it here on the FCC Website: Type in the FCC ID number of your Cell phone & hit search.So, that\u2019s how you know the SAR value of your smartphone. To see the SAR value of different smartphones & read more on Radiations from Cellphones check out the blog here. ",

            "answer_text": "On your phone open the dialer or phone app. -- Now dial *#07# in your phone. This will show the you the SAR measurement of your device as specified by the manufacturer. So how much SAR is better? Lower is better, although as noted earlier FCC in the US considers SAR level of 1.6W/kg good enough. So don't worry if your phone has a SAR value of 1.2 or something like that even though most phones are nowadays in the range of 0.5 to 0.6. At the same time, you can limit the exposure phone radiation by using earphones with mobile when you are talking and limiting the usage of mobile devices. Also, usually bigger brands tend to have phones with lower SAR value. ",
