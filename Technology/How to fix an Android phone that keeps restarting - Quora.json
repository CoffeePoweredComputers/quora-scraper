            "answer_text": "In Android development we call this \u201crandom rebooting.\u201d This can be a huge nuisance and is obviously problematic in terms of reliability. This problem is almost always due to a bug or corruption in your kernel, which ironically, is located in your boot image. If you have modified your stock configuration in any way (rooted, custom recovery, custom kernel, Xposed Framework, etc.), your best option is to revert back to a full stock configuration (stock recovery, stock kernel, stock ROM), and start over on your customizations, taking special care to watch for random rebooting. If you have never modified your device in any way, random rebooting can most easily be corrected by performing a factory data reset. First backup all important userdata, charge your battery to at least 60%, go to Settings>Backup & Reset and opt for a factory data reset. Your device will boot into stock recovery and your /system and /cache partitions will be wiped completely, effectively reverting your device back to stock factory condition. If this does not fix the problem, you will need to manually flash your device will a stock firmware package. Visit XDA-Developers Android Forums and search for your model. There you can typically find stock firmware and tutorials for flashing your particular device. ",
