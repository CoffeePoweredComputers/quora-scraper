            "answer_text": "Think about this a moment; since energy cannot be multiplied. You have a charger putting out X volts at 1 Amp (1000 mA) designed to charge your power bank. So now you plug your phone into the power bank and expect that supply to charge the PB battery AND your phone with that 1 Amp? If you were the mtg of said PB and chose to design the device to split the current between the two, you now have to design extra circuitry to monitor the power needs and split the energy between two loads. Then there is the fact that neither device will be full anytime soon. Maybe overnight they would be full but certainly not the couple of hours it was designed to take for charging. Granted there may be a few power banks designed to do this but they will have beefier supply inputs and it would be up to you to research this. It's easier to plan your usage accordingly or if you use the power banks a lot, then buy two so you always have a backup. They certainly are cheap enough. ",

            "answer_text": "They are designed not to. Apparently they can also detect when connected to a powerbank via their charging port, so they don't charge themselves or charge from one another. I tried this the other day as it was useful to daisy chain them as I only had one charger output. The second powerbank in the chain would not charge. The ones I've got will pass through the input of a connected charger to the output but no more or less. So you can go charger-powerbank-phone but the phone charges first then the powerbank. I think the circuitry required to simultaneously charge and be charged is just a bit more expensive. Phones can do it inherently, you don't have to turn them off to charge them. ",
