Facebook development right now is not about the its social media anymore. You should googling \"Internet.org by Facebook\". That is the biggest stories and article right now about them. And my second question is, what do you do for living? This question should coming out from people want to build a big company like that. Or it is just a curiosity? Thirdly, have you watch facebook film? The title is \"Social Network\". You could found it in any sharing places. And what about google? They have alooong stories about themselves tho. It is begin when Sergey and larry page making a search engine for their document's in college. People documented this stories anywhere in the web, you just have to googling it. And for your information, they do not interest making money at the first. It's just a cool thing for them, and voila! it turns to a billion-valuable company.

            "answer_text": "Well, Initially you start with building something that people want. To build something people want, you need to understand what this thing is and have a good developer (which could be you- in the case of Facebook) and a server to host this product. Now you need to get it out there to people. If it is really good, people will bring their friends (this is called viral growth), so you would not need to spend any money on marketing. If it grows to the stage where it clearly demonstrates strong interest in the market, then investors will become keen on putting in their money to get you to grow more. This is what happened with many internet startups, like facebook, twitter, google and instagram they received investor money that kept them floating before they ever were able to generate sufficient revenues. However, it is important to know that investors only put their money into these companies because they saw a potential for large growth that could be 'monetised' someway or another. Investors do not usually put their money into a new website before the entrepreneurs can provide sufficient evidence that they can grow the website and make money, this is called 'validation'. ",
