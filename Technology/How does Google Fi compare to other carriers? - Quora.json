            "answer_text": "Google Fi is an MVNO, not a carrier. (The carriers they use are TMobile, Sprint and US Cellular.) They compare pretty equally to MVNOs like Straight Talk, which uses AT&T, Sprint, TMobile and Verizon, just not at the same time. Fi uses all 3 in the same phone, with the same SIM, choosing the one that\u2019s best where you are (usually - but it will hold on to a signal as it gets weak enough to lose a call before switching sometimes). It\u2019s also more expensive than some of the others. It depends on what you need. (I\u2019m always near WiFi, so I don\u2019t need much data - so I get by with Mint Mobile - 3GB for $15/month.) ",
