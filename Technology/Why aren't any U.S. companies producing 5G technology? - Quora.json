            "answer_text": "US companies focus on the \u201cretail\u201d aspects of 5G. Qualcomm is a leading developer of 5G technology in US. However, most of their focus is in developing 5G compatible chipsets that go into mobile devices. Apple develops software for 5G compatible iPhones in US. US networking companies such as Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Ciena are focused more on packet-optical technologies instead of \u201cwireless technologies\u201d. Ericsson (Sweden), Nokia (Finland) and Samsung (South Korea) are key vendors developing 5G technologies in the market - however they are outside of US. Several US companies such as Lucent and Nortel that competed with the European players such as Ericsson and Nokia, vanished in the last 2 decades (especially during the dot-com burst). Hence, there is a void in the wireless technology vendors in USA. ",
