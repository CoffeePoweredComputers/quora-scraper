Outlined below: Break down in trust Trust in expertsWhen experts fail to protect, or worse are complicit, it teaches people to be suspicious of expert opinion. Most harmful in technical areas where solutions are often counter intuitive.Trust in governmentEspecially when government is the bad actor.Trust in other people, organizations, companiesTrust in things you don\u2019t understand, or have limited experience or information in.See: climate change, space programs, the justice system, medical treatments, etc. Flat earth and moon landing conspiracies are examples of both the causes and effects of this.Loss of privacy Also adding to the complexity of privacy \u2013 forcing us to consider the nature of privacyHow can we both protect political dissidents and expose corrupt interference with electionsEmbarrassmentLoss of AnonymityLoss of control over what is disclosed and to whomMacroeconomic and micro-economic harm Increased spending on risk management in generalIncreased spending on security and protection of information, translating to increased costs to consumers.Loss of opportunities (to share information, extract meaning, research)Wasting resourcesLoss of salesLoss of job opportunitiesSetting a bad example for future generations Creating a new normal that harms the social fabric and self-perpetuatesHelping other criminality Organized crime benefits through exploiting new attack vectorsHelps criminals avoid enforcementHelps criminals launder and monetize illicit gainsHelping authoritarian states Manipulating information is one of the most common and effective tactics of such regimesSee China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, etc.Maintaining and amplifying (unreasonably or unfairly) power imbalance based on economic power Those with money and power are more likely to benefit from the ability to discover information and exploit it unfairly.Gatekeepers of information like Facebook, google can unfairly maintain effective monopolies or exert undue influenceBenefits of these institutions are also harmed when they are the victimHindering progress If the small group of physicists working on the early internet were hacking and DDOS\u2019ing each other, how would that have affected the world?footnotes: Aaron Swartz - Wikipedia ",
