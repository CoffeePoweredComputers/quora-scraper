            "answer_text": "Two places come to mind: Apple\u2019s own store website has a \u201cRefurbished and Clearance\u201d section offering discounted prices on models that are being discontinued, or units that have been returned by their original purchasers and refurbished to \u201clike new\u201d condition by Apple. 1-year warranty is standard, you can buy AppleCare to extend that to three years.Other World Computing, in addition to selling all kinds of accessories and upgrades for Macs, also refurbishes and sells used Macs, often going back six years or more, with a 90-day warranty. If you\u2019re on a seriously limited budget and don\u2019t need the latest and greatest, you can probably find something on their site for half what you\u2019d pay for a newer one on Apple\u2019s site.As an example, right now: The basic 21.5-inch iMac since 2017 (HD, not 4K) with a 2.3GHz dual-core i5, 8GB RAM and 1TB fusion drive is $1,099 brand-new.In Apple\u2019s refurbs section, the same configuration is $1,019.OWC has a 2015-revision 21.5-inch iMac 4K with a 3.1GHz quad-core i5, 16GB RAM and 1TB 5400rpm HDD for $929.OWC has a 2013-revision 21.5-inch iMac (HD, not 4K) with a 2.7GHz quad-core i5, 16GB RAM and 1TB 5400rpm HDD for $549.That\u2019s a pretty broad price spread. And any of those models will run the current version of OS X, although I\u2019m unsure how many future versions the 2013 will run. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on what kind of Apple products you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re looking for new Apple products: Apple education discount if you have an .edu email.eBay often has dealers that sell brand new Apple products for cheaper than retail.Amazon sometimes has sales and offers on new products.If you\u2019re looking for used or refurbished Apple products: Apple Refurbished Store is the most reliable since it comes straight from Apple and includes their warranty.eBay once again has many individual sellers that want to get rid of their old machines and will sell them for cheap.Craigslist (my favorite) is dependent on your location but often have people selling the cheapest Apple Products you can find anywhere.Whether you\u2019re planning on getting new or used products, make sure the seller is reputable and that the product is legitimate and not stolen by checking its serial number on Apple\u2019s coverage site.
