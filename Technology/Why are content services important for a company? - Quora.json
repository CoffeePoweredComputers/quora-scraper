            "answer_text": "Content services include platforms, applications, and components, the term itself encourages businesses to manage content in whatever way supports their goals and needs. The flexibility that content services offer organizations allows for a more strategic approach to managing content. Since managing content in different platforms and applications allows managers to customize workspaces based on departments\u2019 objectives, employees are empowered with the information they need to make good decisions and aren\u2019t burdened with the information they don\u2019t need. With more personalized applications, employees can work faster and spend more of their time on revenue-generating activities. In the same vein, this approach makes it easy for employees to share and retrieve information. Content services can automate the movement of content across the entire organization as well as intelligently categorize information for easy searching. ",

If your ECM solutions have allowed you to capture, manage, store and preserve content through the organization, content services can extend that and improve information sharing, automation, collaboration and analytics. You might think that the old approach to creating SEO articles is a thing of the past. But in reality, content that gets highly ranked on search engines is what many marketers are still aiming to achieve. The name of the game might have changed.
