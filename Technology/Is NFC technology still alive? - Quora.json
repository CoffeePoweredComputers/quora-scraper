            "answer_text": "I'll respond Yes even if the word \"still\" in your question almost show that you are already sure that No. (I'm right ;-)NFC is cool but as many new technologies it take some time to pop into the market. I'll make a very strange comparison: auto stop-start technology of cars that stop engine a red traffic light. Well the idea is really old, WW also years ago used it. Why did it take so much time ? Ask an expert but it's rather because \" it was not the good time\". I bet my dollar bill that it will be the same with NFC, when people will say \"yes of course we used NFC\" it willl be the time. Main advantage for me: just put a NFC sticker somewhere, it least forever active since no battery is needed. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it's alive! There's not too much buzz around it, but the technology is gaining popularity in mPayment, for example in London.  Just recently, it was announced that there, it can be used for ticketing on the metro.  That's a lot like the authentification case of using NFC as an electronic key for opening doors. You'll find many Kickstarter projects following this idea.  It's also used for coupling, especially in the area of connecting smartphones to Bluetooth speakers and headphones. Most of the mid-range speakers support it nowadays.  It can also be used for triggering actions on your smartphone or tracking/location based services, but in most cases, Bluetooth Low Energy/ beacons are way better, no matter whether they're working with the  iBeacons or Eddystone protocol.  NFC is a background technology. There's nothing cool about it itself, just the cool use cases it enables. ",
