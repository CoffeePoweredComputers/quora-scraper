If so, I think that it might be doable (to some extent) but with a *lot* of effort, reading and experimentation and still in the end may not be a *usable* MacOS setup. It may be so slow that you might ditch it before it boots and presents the desktop. I had Mojave running in Virtualbox VM with 4GB RAM and 4 vCPUs on Linux host on an Intel i5\u20138400, and it was far from being very smooth. ",
