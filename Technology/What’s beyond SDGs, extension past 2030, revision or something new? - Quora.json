            "answer_text": "You ask \u201cWhat\u2019s beyond SDGs, extension past 2030, revision, or something new?\u201d I realize that my opinions on these things are rather extreme, and rather negative. But I have given the SDGs a lot of personal attention, and I think they are doomed to fail. They are based on a narrow understanding of how the world works that does not integrate all of the many major problems we now face. The concept of the SDG is not achievable, in my opinion. ( Sustainable Development Goals - Wikipedia ) SDG stands for sustainable development goal, set on a global scale. ( Sustainable Development Goals | UNDP ) If you understand the concept of an ecological footprint ( Ecological footprint - Wikipedia) then you will know that the current population of the Earth is vastly beyond anything sustainable. Our planet is dying, even as we plan to \u201cdevelop\u201d it more. I, personally, suspect that the population of the Earth will drop dramatically in the near future, possibly by 2030, whether we plan to make it happen, or it is forced upon us by starvation. What we need is \u201csustainability goals\u201d, leaving out the idea of further development and exploitation of the biosphere of our dying planet. Our current level of exploitation of the biosphere is unsustainable so we need to understand how to exploit it less. Perhaps \u201csustainable degrowth goals\u201d should replace the current regime of SDGs. I have two opinions of the UN organizations. The people that produce the IPCC documents are in touch with reality. ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - Wikipedia ) The people who produce the SDG documents are dreaming and/or delusional. ",
