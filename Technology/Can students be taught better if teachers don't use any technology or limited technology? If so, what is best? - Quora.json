            "answer_text": "About a year ago I attended a workshop session on this topic at the national conference of the NSTA (National Science Teachers Association, now the National Science Teaching Association) in St. Louis. The presenters made very powerful and persuasive arguments, backed up with copious data, for limiting the use of technology much more severely than is currently fashionable. Among the best evidence were experimental studies that supported the idea that our brains have been hard-wired (through evolution) to learn and think differently than what screen technology requires. There are some interesting bits about the use of hands and eyes and brain together. Here are a couple of the resources they quoted from: \u201cMultiple Pathways to the Student Brain\u201d (I know this should be underlined but that option doesn\u2019t seem to be available), a book by Janet Nay Zadina; \u201cDigitizing Literacy: Reflections on the Haptics of Writing,\u201d by Anne Mangen and Jean-Luc Velay. (I think this is a peer-reviewed article or a chapter in a larger book.) A couple other notes about tech and students. I have read that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs sent their own kids to schools that used little or no tech, no screen time. Some have speculated that this was because they understood better than most the negative effects of screen time on kids\u2019 thinking ability or other developmental aspects. I believe the sources of the information were reliable. If not, I apologize for spreading false rumors. On a personal note: The last high school where I taught had gone one-to-one with iPads just the year I arrived. In the four years for which I saw testing results, the ACT scores had declined every year. The administration refused to even entertain the possibility that there was a cause-effect link of any sort. Bad optics for the donors to the private (Catholic) school, you know. There was a constant battle to keep games and distracting apps off the iPads. The students were always a step or two ahead of the tech guy on this, and he was no slouch. There are just too many ways to misuse tech. The iPads were a constant distraction in classes whether teachers were using them or not. This question also includes phones, I suppose, which are especially distracting, since the school can not control in any way what a student has on their phone. S0 - email, twitter, instagram, facebook, shopping, etc., etc. And they are a very useful tool for cheating. Not only have I caught students using phones to cheat, I once saw a TV news story about cheating in France or Switzerland. I saw it while I was eating pizza in Switzerland. I couldn\u2019t understand a word of French, but the gist of the story was very plain. Bottom line: I am not a big fan of screen technology in the classroom. I am, however, a fan of lab technology in the science lab/classroom, and I believe students ought to learn how to write code beginning no later than junior high/middle school. Teach them real tech use. They already know how to use the internet. That reminds me of one other problem of tech: the internet. Students can often find homework answers online, not to mention the availability of papers. I once had students who found an entire teachers edition of a physics text which someone had posted online. I used a chemistry resource called ChemQuest written by a teacher in Michigan. People had posted numerous copies of his work, answers included. (This really bugged me because he had written this by himself, and these posters were denying him his hard-earned financial reward.) Students used to copy the answers without doing the work. Once I figured this out I started changing the numbers in my PDFs of the homework I took for a grade. Since it wasn\u2019t the brightest students who were cheating, it took some of them a while to catch on. It was quite gratifying to use technology to stop their cheating. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my answer from a similar Quora Question: What's the role of technology in education? I was always an early and avid adopter. What kills learning in the classroom is boredom. Lectures are boring. High student participation with open debate based on pre-reading and especially well-chosen open-ended case studies heightens energy and learning in the classroom. Technology is a part of a multi-channel approach to facilitating learning. Chalkboards, overhead projectors, document cameras, wifi internet connections (fraught with challenges), simulations, video clips, lighting management, audio clips, flip charts (3M Post-It versions that can easily hang on the walls likety split), microphones, Adelphi voting stations, Excel mirroring from student computers, distance learning cameras, and more CAN BE excellent accelerators of learning facilitation. The key is to be so practiced that the transitions from one channel/mode to another are seamless and without stumbling. If the video won\u2019t play, if the audio doesn\u2019t work, if the cable isn\u2019t connected properly, etc., the disruption destroys the \u201cmagic bubble\u201d that I tried to create in every class\u2014a situation in which everyone was enthralled with what was happening the room and paying attention 100%. Seamlessly moving from one mode to another provides variety, energy, and poignancy. AND technology may not be the right answer for any given element. I have taught worldwide the second chapter of Shaara\u2019s book Killer Angels about the dilemma Joshua Chamberlain faced (https://faculty.darden.virginia.edu/clawsonj/General/PUBLIC/Chamberlain.pdf ) for 40 years. I told the story and recited Chamberlain\u2019s speech to the deserters live (using some drama techniques). It was always, no matter what continent we were on, a very powerful class: Would you, given legal authority, shoot the deserters? When the film Gettysburg starring Jeff Daniel came out I was excited to load the clip onto my PowerPoint pages with menu of multiple video clips (so you could pick one at a moment\u2019s notice depending on the discussion). I did so, used it 2\u20133 times and you could feel the energy leaking out of the room. So I went back to doing the episode live and in person\u2014and the energy level went back up. Technology is not always the best channel. Technology is not the goal, it\u2019s one tool for facilitating learning. I taught some on-line distance classes. Students were spread all over the world. Sometimes the connections weren\u2019t that good, sometimes students were on commuter trains trying to listen, or in coffee shops getting breakfast. I had no way of knowing if they were prepared, had read the assignment, etc. For learning, it was a poor mode/channel. I taught some classes face-to-face in a Middle Eastern country. Not a classroom, rather a flat room with movable chairs, no desks. At first, there were 10\u201315 people there. By the first afternoon there were 50 people there. By the next day, 100. The culture was, a few will \u201ccheck it out\u201d and text whether it was worth while or not. No advance prep, no attendance guidelines\u2014but the technology grew the class hour by hour. With technology we can listen to people speak worldwide and that's a plus. We can invite speakers to check into our classrooms. Having a meaningful discussion with eye contact over that medium is much more difficult--and ultimately unsatisfying. Can't do role plays. Can't scan and assess room energy and mood. etc. Technology is a tool not an end goal. If it helps, great. If it gets in the way, lose it. There are things we do in a F2F classroom that we just cannot do over technology linkages. ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching is about people following along on an informational field trip. It\u2019s hard to say what is going to inspire interest by the students but for sure, a lack of interest by the teacher in the trip is going to dampen everyone\u2019s spirits. Technology is useful in as much as it can present an idea clearly. Sometimes it\u2019s great. Sometimes it\u2019s not necessarily at all. What is essential is a bond between teacher and student. It is essential that each feel an urgency and keen interest in developing insight into the topic. There is no technology for that. I can say from experience that the more regulated the classroom becomes the more difficult that spirit is to thrive. Technology is seen as a cure for a flat personal dynamic. It\u2019s is unsustainable. Interest in tech is mostly about the novelty and novelty is of course short lived. If indeed all we needed was educational TV, interactive or not, we would have gone this route much earlier. It\u2019s still about a human bond. Teachers long for it, students long for it. Unfortunately we\u2019ve lost track of how to form it. Reaching for new tech is the latest hope for a shared excitement, but as I said, it won\u2019t sustain. The best connection between student and teacher is talking. It needs to be dialogue. It needs to be based on truth and trust! There is an distinct lack of both these days and little room of ability to build it up. I like field trips for building this up but it requires more money and escorts than is ever allotted. About eight kids per chaperone with each chaperone highly informed and informative is ideal. Even one good one per semester is beneficial. Kids will seek out the class that has one of these by tradition. ",

            "answer_text": "For most of my career, I taught with limited technology. Even when teaching an ITV class, my notes were simply projected on the tv, there were no internet capabilities in the class. Then in my last few years teaching, things changed. Students were issued iPads, the internet (within reason) was opened up to them, and choices abounded. In Literature we were no longer bound to the excerpts included in the textbook, I was able to add the text of several MLK Jr. Speeches to the course showing the effectiveness of his repetitive rhythm in speaking. I was able to pull in current autobiographical works and many other resources. While I felt I did a good job teaching before this technology explosion, having the options technology gave me made teaching more exciting. I know there were teachers who had the class check on the wolves of Yellowstone or watch the baby animal feeds from various zoos, who used Shark tank episodes to learn what makes a product marketable, who looked at the universe through telescope feeds from the other side of the country or out of the earth. Why would anyone want to limit their resources like that? In addition, having this technology in the students hands meant reports became movies, PowerPoint presentations that were projected for all to see, and student stress often decreased because of the options available. Personally I believe technology in the classroom should only be limited enough to maintain control, use as much as allowed, connect with student brains any way you can! ",

Some schools claim to have technology, but when you get there to teach, there is little more than a white board and an overhead projector, if you\u2019re lucky. Other schools have electronic whiteboards and students expect to be dazzled with fabulous technologically brilliant lessons. Often, they are subjected to death by power point. What is best is to have teachers taught how to use the technology at the school where they work and be encouraged to work together to create exciting student-friendly and accessible lessons. There are platforms such as Kahoot to name but one, where you can give your students quizzes to see if they\u2019ve learned what they needed to in class. However, if the teacher is passionate about their subject and is able to teacher students who are interested in their subject, technology can be used as a tool to keep students\u2019 interest when used properly.

            "answer_text": "No. The whole point of having technology in the classroom is to make classes more interesting, to allow students to work at their own speed, and to help students participate more fully. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean we should have technology as the central point of the classroom - that\u2019s where the students are. I\u2019m a rather old fashioned teacher. I like \u2018teaching from the front\u2019 - giving whole class explanations and instructions. However, I also like to teach English as a foreign language by giving students a wide range of sources to work from: video, audio, and written sources are all useful. How can I, with only my variety of British English, prepare students for the richness of all the different accents and varieties of English that they might encounter? Online resources, and especially online dictionaries, are invaluable for language classes. If you have students with the self control to use their telephones effectively, they can really enhance learning. (I have a telephone table for those who have problems with that. Some students put their phones there at the start of every class.) If I have students with disabilities, using a social media is great, as being able to access what we are going to be doing in class in advance on the class Facebook page is useful. Dyslexic students sometimes use a reader to have an understanding of any text before the lesson, and students with a visual impairment can format documents in a way that suits them, for example. There are moments when it\u2019s great to put away all technology, such as class discussions, but banishing it from the classroom would be a terrible mistake. ",

So I would say that the first 5\u20136 grades should not use calculators. My robotics engineer son says he's lost his ability, once he used a calculator. But, he can quickly improve it with brain use! However, using calculators and graphing calculators allows eighth grade students to do 10 problems in the same time it took 4th-year college students to do one. Thus, the student can see the PATTERN that a parabola looks like a \u201crounded V\u201d when the leading coefficient is positive and like \u201can arch\u201d when the leading coefficient is negative. They can see that the steepness or shallowness of the parabola matches a larger or smaller leading coefficient, respectively. They can see that the final Constant is Always the y-intercept of any equation. They can see how the slope-intercept form of linear equation is easier to graph but the Standard form Ax + By = C is easier to use in Systems of Equations. This allows more learning before 18 years old when the brain starts to prune back neurons to HALF as many! A win if we can teach more sooner.
