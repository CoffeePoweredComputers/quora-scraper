            "answer_text": "It should be more and more normal. In fact, the best way to assess the skills of an applicant is by actually doing the work that will be required in the next job. Not talking about it. Not telling stories about it (\u201cTell me about a time when\u2026.\u201d). Not answering questions about your perceived and self-reported strengths and weaknesses. (It\u2019s not just me that says this\u2014the academic peer-reviewed literature bears this out, too. The project should be concise, painless (since you already know how to do this stuff, right?)\u2014and may stretch you a little bit (the best assessments do!). It should reflect real-world work conditions as closely as possible, and should have a standardized method of scoring (preferably one that has been independently evaluated). It should be directly relevant to the skills you have, and the work the company needs done. Unless a good part of your job will be done performing tasks in front of others, it probably should be done in private, too\u2014not necessarily on the spot in front of people (why make someone unnecessarily nervous, if they won\u2019t be in the situation at work?).

            "answer_text": "Yes it can happen sometimes. Companies want to test people with real skills. A lot of times job seekers think they can do a job but they are not able to see the difficulties ahead. Or the company has learned from its past experience people committing to the job but not being able to fulfil the criteria. Take it as a challenge and opportunity to prove your true capabilities. Also see this as a learning experience since you are getting paid with free lessons or takeaways. ",
