            "answer_text": "December 26 2010 was a life changing event for me. It changed me mentally, emotionally, changed how I saw the world, who I was, it changed my life forever. I was 12/13 years old at the time. It was the day after Christmas, my family and I lived in a small town in Texas. I asked my parents if we could go to a nearby city so I could spend my Christmas money. So we go to the city which is about an hour drive from where we lived. We spent most of the day there went to a few stores and saw a movie etc. Then we were driving home. The quickest way to get to the city from where we lived was kinda some back roads normally only traveled by locals. It\u2019s winding roads and lots of hills and in the middle of nowhere so you have to be careful when driving this way. I remember I was in the back seat listening to my MP3 player and I noticed we slowed down and stopped. I looked ahead and saw 2 wrecked vehicles. One was a blueish looking small car with the front completely smashed in and the second closest to us was a white suburban on its side with the front passenger side smashed in and the tire missing. My dad ran out of the car to check on them while my mom called 911. I remember being scared and wondering what\u2019s going on. I could see my dad yelling at someone and making a motion to turn off the engine on one of the vehicles. The driver side door on my car was open so I could hear some of what was being said. Some people behind us ran over to help and I heard someone in the suburban yell \u201cGet the girls!\u201d My dad and two others climbed on top of the turnover suburban and opened the back passenger door. One person jumped in and pulled out 2 girls younger than I was at the time. I believe they were 6/7 and 3/4. We put them in the back seat of my car next to me. They were in shock they youngest crying uncontrollably. They got the dad out and he walked over to check on his daughters. I still remember to this day his first words I heard him say to my dad. \u201cMy wife\u2019s dead\u201d that shocked me. My mom and I are trying to calm down the girls but I\u2019m still kinda fixated on the scene. People are standing around waiting for help to arrive. Remember we\u2019re in the middle of no where. And the closet help from where we\u2019re at is maybe 10 minutes away. My mom was finally able to calm down the girls. We started talking about their Christmas and their trip to Disney world they recently took. Back on the even for what seemed like forever people were trying to come up with some way to get the mother out. (I later realized that she was alive but she was stuck in her seat and the seatbelt was somehow suffocating her. She was in the passenger seat so she took the brunt of the crash. My dad came over and got our blanket that we keep in it. The busted the back winshesld and crawled through the back of the suburban to get to the wife. They then wrapped her in a blacked and cut her loose. I remember them slowly dragging the mom wrapped with the blanket out of the car. The husband sat next to here and wrapped his arms around her. After what felt like an eternity help finally arrived EMS/Fire and state troopers. I remember the emergency workers picking up the mom and putting her on the stretcher. As they passed us to put her on the ambulance I noticed something. She was pregnant. In her late stages of pregnancy to be exact. I remember one of the girls looking at me and my mom asking us. \u201cDo they not know my moms dead\u201d that broke me. The mother was in bad condition. So bad that they had to call in a helicopter to air lift her out which would take more time. I watched these kids watching their mom dying right in front of them. And I couldn\u2019t do anything to help. I just sat there and watched. The EMTs took the kids and put them in another ambulance and they airlifted the mom out. Some hours later we were finally able to go home. The rest of the drive there and that night I did nothing but pray. I prayed that God would spare the life of the mom and unborn child. At least save the child. I prayed and cried the rest of the night. Next day I found out the mother died soon after child birth. A boy. I know I was only I kid back then but I blamed myself for their moms death for years. Literally I believe she died because I thought God was angry at me. I kept on telling myself I could have helped. You\u2019ll never know the heartache of looking at two little girls in the eye. They ask if their moms gonna make it. But you know better so you gotta lie. Like I said before, I blamed myself for years. In JH and high school I became depressed. I went down a long dark road. But one day when I was having flash back of that day I heard a voice. Idk how to explain it but I did. It said \u201cBecause of you that child is alive.\u201d I thought to myself how did I save that child. I did nothing but sit there and watch. Then it said \u201cwho\u2019s idea was it to go to the city?\u201d Then I realized it was mine. It was my idea to go to the city so I could spend my Christmas money. We were at the right place at the right time because of me. Now I don\u2019t go around thinking that I\u2019m the sole reason the child is alive but that voice did give me peace after so many years of blaming myself. Because of that event today I\u2019m a certified EMT and also in the United States Air Force as a cop. I\u2019m continuing to strive to help people. I understand now why God allowed me to go through that experience. It motivated me to become an EMT and to help people. Life\u2019s greatest lessons are learned through pain. God has a reason for everything. ",

            "answer_text": "September 18, 2018. My husband and I had been together almost 8 years, married just over 3. Our son was born almost 1 year prior to this, almost to the day. Sept 24, 2017 was his birthday. I was a stepmom to his daughter since she was 1, and I was 23\u2026she is now 9 , and I am 30. Life before our baby was honestly pretty good. We got along well except the odd fight, but we were best friends. He was a normal , sane person. Our son was planned; we decided together that we wanted a child and agreed that we were ready. And after being together 7 years, living together for 6, and co-parenting another child from a young age, i had no reason to doubt that I was making a well informed choice, and that we were ready to begin the next chapter. Fast forward, our son is born. We were starting to drift apart quickly. People say your relationship changes after a baby, but I didn't expect it to happen like, instantly. I was on mat leave and making half of what I used to. I was under the impression that he was going to be taking care of the bills for the most part and he made more than enough to do so. Things between us had started to go from bad to worse. He didn't help with the baby at all . He was rarely ever home. He was annoyed I couldn't keep up with housework like I used to .didn't care to build my confidence, or make me feel attractive again and would never want to talk to me . He was always a bit of a gambler, but never anything crazy or alarming. Then without warning, it became an addiction seemingly overnight and had already began to spiral completely out of control. I thought being a stepmom gave me an advantage, like getting to test-drive parenthood before taking that leap myself. I got to have a good idea of what kind of father he was before we had a child together\u2026 but I soon realized that it's not the same thing as giving birth to your own baby ; recovering from child birth, the new responsibilities , loss of sleep, etc. When I entered the picture , his daughter already knew how to talk , walk , eat solid food, and truthfully, I wasn't expected to do much regarding her actual care, especially in the early days. Plus, he only had her on weekends, which is not even comparable to having one 7 days a week. So I was brand new. I had no clue what I was doing. If there was ever a time I needed him, it was then. Which coincidentally was the same time my beoved husband .. totally deserted me. He started working 7 days a week , 12 hr shifts plus another 2 or more spent commuting. But as I mentioned, he was just gambling all of the money he was making . When I would confront him, he would become angry, unpredictable, and abusive. This went on for way longer than i care to admit. We were evicted twice. I had no heat at the end of last winter , with a 4 month old baby,but he didn't have to deal with it since he was at work most of the time anyway. Every dollar of my mat leave money went to scraping together what I could for my son. My relationship was falling apart and I was helpless to do anything about it. I was shocked, betrayed, and so unbelievably hurt. The vision of my perfect family that I've had since I was a little girl was shattered. We were facing legit homelessness. I had no job and my ability to do anything was severely limited. Somehow, I pulled off a miracle and found us a place . . It was actually nicer than our old place, but alot more money\u2026 and we got it just in the nick of time ..literally moved in to the new place 1 day before we were supposed to. The day the sheriff was coming to change the locks at the old place. We could afford it, but it would tight. I was at the end of my rope with his gambling. I made so many threats. . Threatened to leave, wrote him pages and pages of letters, carefully went thru banking records with a fine tooth comb , recorded each dollar spent and wrote it all out on paper so he had a visual breakdown of everything.. (it was over $10,000 in 6 months)I wrote up a contract and made him sign it and initial several promises as well as the consequences of not following through.. Demanded access to all accounts, which he gave me. There was a period of time he wasnt allowed to be in possession of his phone unsupervised, which meant it was with me while he was at work. The gambling continued. I gave him an intervention. After all of the domestics and paper trail of his violent temper, we had CAS involvement, and I happened to have a great relationship with our worker. I told him he had 30 mins to call the gambling hotline (number was provided) or else I would be calling our worker, showing them the pictures of the lights he had smashed out with a crowbar in our bathroom earlier that day( because I left the light on,) filing a restraining order, and he would be homeless , unemployed, and without his family \u2026 before he got home from work. He called the hotline but he was gambling again less than 24 hours later. I had enough. At this point we were behind in rent again, by alot. My entire income for a month was $980, and our rent was $1300 plus utilities. I paid 960 toward the rent the month before I left and he paid 0. His income was more than double mine, maybe even triple with the OT. I took my son to a shelter for abused women. We stayed there for 2 months, got lined up with an apartment, and I intended to move there alone, me , my son and my dog . We moved in Sept 1, 2018. But ... old habits die hard. My husband wasn't able to keep up with rent payments and was going to be evicted. Again. I knew he had nowhere else to go, so like an idiot, I caved. I grew up with this guy, he was the father of my child and my legal husband. I knew the person he really was at heart. I couldn't just cold shoulder him knowing he would be homeless. I told him he could come with me, as long as the gambling stopped. He was off work for 2 weeks at this time. He stopped gambling, but the only reason he did was becsuse he had no money. I had gotten my own separate bank account long before this point, so I at least had control of my own money. even though it wasn't much, it was at least safe . Then 18 long days after my measly chq came, I was completely broke. And like the rest of my son's life up til this point, he wasn't contributing at all. Things weren't going well. We were fighting when he was here but most of the time he wasn't .I didn't even have 5$ to buy milk for my son. I asked him for money but he said he had none. So in desperation, I put up an ad looking for cash jobs. ie. Dog walking, house cleaning, babysitting, etc. The ad didn't feature my picture, didn't mention my age/looks, or anything about me at all really. Just hat i was a single mom having a hard time making ends meet and was looking for cash jobs to supplement my income to get back on my feet . I got lots of replies\u2026 mostly to the effect of \u201chow much for a blowjob?\u201d \u201cCan u do porn?\u201d people asked for private lap dances, topless bartender, I was contacted by massage parlors, escort agencies \u2026 I'm sure you get the gist. I received more than 100 replies of that nature (not a single one for babysitting though) I would be lying if I said I didn't consider it. Being so broke you can't even feed your baby is a hell of a desperate place to be. But .. although unhappily, i was still married. I couldn't bring myself to do it. Then I get an email from a guy who offered me $200 to be his 'sex slave' for one hour. I agreed and told him the location details, but I had no intention of having any sexual relations with him at all. I knew my husband had a bb gun that looked like a real gun, in the back of a closet somewhere collecting dust. I told him of my plan and he was adamantly against it. He wanted nothing to do with it. He fought me and tried to convince me it was a dumb idea, but I didn't listen. I told him I need money, he's not helping, so his only choice was to either help me, or accept that it would happen after he left for work when I was alone. Of course the whole plan went totally wrong, the guy saw my husband before he entered the apartment, and the gun. No money was exchanged or even seen. He took off running then my husband came and started losing his mind . the last time I saw him he was kicking me in the head then collecting his things before leaving saying he wouldn't be back. I found out later that he didn't even make it to the parking lot. Meanwhile, I heard the distinct loud knocking that I had heard enough times before to know before I opened the door that it was the cops. \"Oh great , another domestic.. probably not a good forest impression with my new neighbours \"I was crying and quite shaken up. my baby was still in his crib sleeping but woke up to the knocking and started to cry. I opened the door and what I saw was a shock to say the least. 6 cops in full SWAT gear , rifles drawn, and pointed at me. There were dozens more of them scattered through the building and outside, and more blocking all the exits. They had one of those big huge door buster things to knock down my door if I didn't answer. The worst part of it all was that it was right at 3:00 when all the kids were just coming home from school. I expected the usual ; 2 cops with sympathetic voices asking me what happened this time, and asking whether or not i would like to press charges. They treated me like a wanted fugitive. Threw me up against the wall, \"put your hands where we can see them!!!\" I tried to protest... \"My baby! \" But they didn't care. They tore up my apartment, found the \"gun\" which wasn't hard to tell it was fake. I told them everything. How my husband wanted no part in it and I forced him . I said It's my fault not his. They didn't even arrest me. They sent me in a cab to the station , with my baby. At the station, I met with a detective. He said i was free to leave at any time and i didn't have to talk to him if I didn't want to. I told him the same thing I told the cops. It was my fault, my husband didn't want to do it at all but ieft him with no choice. They asked me if I wanted a lawyer and I said no. They called my parents to come get my baby, put me in cuffs, and escorted me to the holding cells. That night I slept on a cold metal bed with no pillow beside a metal toilet, and no idea of how long I would be there. The next morning, I was fingerprinted, had my hands and feet shackled before being loaded in the back of a paddywagon which was headed to the courthouse where my bail hearing would be. I waited there all day. From 9am-5pm. They didn't have time to get to my case so it would have to wait til the next morning. That night I went to \"real \" jail. The next morning was my bail hearing and I was released. I couldn't wait to see my son. I was released 3 days before his first birthday. My husband and i are co-accused and charged with armed robbery.. we have a no contact order \u2026so we are not allowed to communicate in any way, directly or indirectly. And that stipulation is enforced, with an iron fist.. by his bitch of a mother who now thinks I am a prostitute and always have been. Due to priors from more than 10 years ago he didn't get off as easily as me. He spent 2 or 3 weeks in jail, Then was released to his mother on house arrest. He couldn't even go to work. His family blames me has cut off both me and my son ... we are dead to them. They have made it clear that my husband has 2 choices : me or them. his immediate family, or his wife and child. If he stays with me they will disown him. They even dropped hints that they don't believe my husband is the father (which is literally an outrageous allegation- my entire life revolved around him and I was never once unfaithful, and my son is honestly spitting image of him ) Because of that split second decision , he has missed : my son's first birthday, his first steps, his first word, Christmas, my 30ths birthday, New year, and now Valentine's day.. he's missed the chance to bond with my son in a critical stage of his life. He has left me in a worse financial situation then the one that resulted in this whole idea in the first place. It's now February..this happened in sept...we're still going to court and it keeps being remanded. so I'm not sure when it will be over, or what will even happen when it is .. not like we'll be reunited and just live happily ever as a picture perfect family . That day changed both our lives so much, and probably sent my son's on a totally unexpected detour. I have no idea what to expect. I have no clue what my life will look like in 3 months, or even what it will be like in 1 month . Life as I knew it , over. The path I was obliviously walking on without ever second guessing it\u2026 Abruptly ended with no warning, dumping me off at a dead end . in the pitch black. With no resources or clue where i am. With a child to drag with me. And suddenly resposible to lead the way in search of a new path. ",
