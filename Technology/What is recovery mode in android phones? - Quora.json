            "answer_text": "In Android, recovery refers to the dedicated, bootable partition that has the recovery console installed. A combination of key presses (or instructions from a command line) will boot your phone to recovery, where you can find tools to help repair (recover) your installation as well as install official OS uodates. Because Android is open and has the recovery source code available, building a customized version with more and different options is relatively easy as well. Let's look at both options.  Most Android devices are defaulted with a fairly simple recovery mode that can be used to fast boot the device, recover, wipe data and find other info about your device. Just like a lot of other things with Android, even the Recovery Mode can be customized to do more things. The stock recovery is pretty limited by design with the main purpose to delete all user data and files, or to perform system updates. Usually you can do these operations manually by booting into recovery yourself. Like factory reset, recovery is what boots up and erases the files and data. The same goes with official OS update installation. Useful, but it's quite limited.  Custom recovery, otherwise, offers much more. Usually coded for backup and restore functions, selective deletion of data can be quite convenience for you. It is also modified to allow update packages that have not been digitally signed by official sources. And also, you are able to copy files to the SD card without having to remove it or reboot into Android by mounting various partitions. Famous ones are Clockwork or Amon Ra. The extra functionality built in makes Recovery no less important.  ",

            "answer_text": "Recovery mode is used when your phone is unresponsive or frozen (can\u2019t turn off phone, can\u2019t interact, etc.) If you want to boot into Recovery Mode, here are the steps: Turn off your phone. If your phone is frozen, press and hold the Power button until the screen goes blank.Press and hold Volume Up + Power. This step will depend on your phone, but this combo is used on most devices.After Step 2, your phone should now reboot as usual, but instead, it should bring you to another screen that had a lot of options. These options include: Normal RebootReboot to bootloaderFactory Reset (Don\u2019t use this option unless you actually need to reset your phone)Recovery LogsPower off (This shuts off your phone as usual)Surprisingly, Recovery Mode doesn\u2019t start up your OS (Operating System). This makes it useful if you can\u2019t start up your phone without it freezing. ",
