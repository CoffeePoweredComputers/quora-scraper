            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure about that statistic but I agree that it\u2019s very difficult to keep long-distance relationships. Long-distance relationships (LDR\u2019s) can fail for so many reasons. But based on my own personal experience I have noticed the following. Physical connection is a must for some people. Obviously this is going to be difficult and the farther the distance the more rare this can happen between partners. Even if you have all the money to travel, time and energy is the more limiting factor.You can only have calls/video calls so much. Even if you have a regular schedule to call each other, there would be only so much you can talk about. Communication sometimes is not all about words too. Touch and just seeing the person face to face for real is an underrated and important means of communication that calls and video calls can never fulfill.People tend to focus more on themselves since they don\u2019t get to see their partners regularly. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. Yeah, to some it could be, but to most people when they know they won\u2019t need to spend too much time with another person as in dates, movies or any couple activities, they tend to be more reclusive and try to use more of their time for their own needs and development. I have personally experienced this from an ex-girlfriend. And sometimes this is the major reason as most people would get so used to it that it already occupies most of their time and forget that they have partners as well.You become weary from the topics you discuss and since you don\u2019t get to do more adventures as a couple (due to the limited time you have with each other) you run out of stuff to talk about and just stop talking altogether at some point.There are several more experiences that others may add to these, but these are the things I mostly see that are barriers to sustaining LDR\u2019s. Personally, I don\u2019t like LDR\u2019s and I would avoid it as much as I can. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the wonderful things about a long distance relationship is the time you do spend together is more focused on just that being together. Another wonderful thing is the anticipation of a special call or text! The hard part is the trust and not being part of someone\u2019s daily life! You don\u2019t know if they really are where they say they are or if they really are busy or just don\u2019t want to talk. Another hard thing is that all relationships bend and change over time to some degree and it\u2019s harder to feel out what\u2019s going on when you are far away. I\u2019d say if things have changed you need to think about whether or not they are natural progression of a relationship or if you think the other person is losing interest. Honestly, if I thought things were falling apart I\u2019d try to carve out some special time with my long distance partner (face to face if at all possible-but FaceTime works too). During that time I\u2019d try to do or say something to confirm my interest in the relationship and see my partners reaction. If I felt like he were pulling away or less excited about the relationship I\u2019d open up a dialogue about how I was feeling. I\u2019m not suggesting you accuse or put it on the other person but maybe confess that long distance relationships are hard and that you wish it could be different and see if that opens your partner up to the discussion as well. Communication is always key in a long distance relationship so make sure you are being honest but again without any sort of blame! Good luck:-) ",
