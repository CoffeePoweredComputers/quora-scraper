            "answer_text": "In 2016 they had a limited conflict and drones were used very limited by Azerbaijan. This is turning to a full scale war and Azerbaijan has been using drones heavily. Drones are cheap, don't have a pilot and if shot down there is no major loss. Armenia\u2019s defense strategy is air defense, Missiles AA guns, etc. Azeri Strategy is to find them and destroy them via drones as those are hard to find on radar. ",
