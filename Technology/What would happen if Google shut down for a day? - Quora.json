            "answer_text": "Well most of the things that we do are indirectly somehow related to google whether we had reached that website using Google search engine, by clicking on the advertisement on some other websites, by watching videos we got to know something, product of google, and many more. The losses that would occur would be huge as it\u2019s one of the largest and biggest tech companies in the world. Let us take few statistics into accounts: Let\u2019s make the advertising revenues ~$ 80 billion. Doing the math for the single day revenue in single day comes to about ~$217 Million. That\u2019s a lot of money for us to imagine. After excluding the expenses and costs, the net figure comes out to ~$23 billion. 2. Google\u2019s parent company earning\u2019s in the year 2016 was $90.3 billion and revenue growth of 20% year over year. 3. You would be amazed to know that Google\u2019s advertising revenue was $79.383 billion which comes roughly around 87.8% of the total revenue posted in the financial year 2016 which ended in December. That\u2019s a staggering stat. * This doesn\u2019t include the costs and expenses incurred by the company. Imagine if it shutdown in 2016 for a day then it would have realized a loss of $217 million and not just the revenue loss but many things more. People all around the world would go gaga as to why it happened and why such a big company isn\u2019t doing or if it\u2019s doing then why didn\u2019t the operations started.There are 5.5 billion searches on Google everyday, and 1.2 trillion searches each each worldwide according to a research for the year 2016. This means google won\u2019t be able to process 5.5 billion searches a day.Source: Google now handles at least 2 trillion searches per year  This is the data for the year 2016 and for 2017 it would surely be more. 3. Most of the people depend on Google Maps for the location details and it would be bizarre to not have maps as 69% of the estimated user base of Maps use Google Maps. People probably may have to switch to another maps and apparently no Live traffic updates. Source: New survey says Google Maps favored by nearly 70 percent of iPhone users 4.Stock prices would crash and it may see a bigger downfall. 5. Gmail is the most widely used email service and according to report it crossed more than 1 billion in 2016.  Source: Gmail Now Has More Than 1B Monthly Active Users 6. Android users won\u2019t get the support required and won\u2019t be able to use Google Play Store that means a huge revenue loss to the application developers as they earn from downloads and for the company itself. These are some of the things and much more could happen. Hopefully this doesn\u2019t happen!! ",

            "answer_text": "A day is wayyy long. But let's assume that Google shuts down for 30 mins and see the consequences\u2026. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Flashback\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In August 2013, Google and all of its services came down briefly for 2-3 mins. And the whole internet traffic went down by a massive 40%. A similar incident also occurred in May 2009.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Note that it was just for 2 mins. Imagine 30 mins. It\u2019s highly unlikely but here is what I think will happen \u2013 First few mins people will check their internet connection. Some will even call their Service Provider. Some may even check for hardware failures on their side \u2013 which is still more likely than 30 min outage.People will then realise that it\u2019s true. There will be a period of disbelief. People will desperately try to reload google\u2019s homepage.People all around the world will start taking screenshots of the Google Server Error Page. [Likely 500]Your Facebook Newsfeed will be full of \u201cOMG Can\u2019t believe\u201d, \u201cI witnessed something astonishing\u201d along with several images from previous point.People will search for alternate search engine \u2013 but how ? Most of them don\u2019t even know that there are alternate search enginesBing and Yahoo will get huge traffic surge.DuckDuckGo( Page on duckduckgo.com ) will start trending on Twitter. People will realise it\u2019s good. (That\u2019s a search engine that doesn\u2019t track you BTW)Many other internet apps \u2013 that uses Google Services in backend will also come down. Without GMAIL for 30 mins the productivity across the whole world will drop by a huge margin.I can\u2019t even imagine the Revenue Loss \u2013 not just for Google but for all the companies throughout the world that uses Google.Android users will be stranded on the roads and iPhone users will be lost in the lanes if Google Maps stopped working for 30minsAmong all this fiasco Internet life in China will remain unaffected.People at other competitive companies will enjoy and sing songs (Meant to be a joke)After the outage is fixed and services are restored: Google will release their statement to the press \u2013 explaining the cause (may be)Tech Savvy people around the world will try to dig deep in search for the cause of outage.Many will speculate that a group of Hackers are responsible. People will then approach many Hackers regarding their opinionMedia will go crazy. They will call experts and try to analyse situation themselves.Many bloggers will write post about \u201cHow we are too dependent on Google? \u2013 A reality check\u201d. Even Media will do itQuora would be full of questions \u2013 \u201cWhy did it happen ?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you think about the outage ?\u201d, \u201cCan it happen again ?\u201d, \u201cWas my data leaked?\u201d, \u201cIs it true that Google was hacked ?\u201d, etc.A lot of users will switch from Google services to alternates.BuzzFeed and ScoopWhoop will have articles like \u201cGoogle went down for 30 minutes. You won\u2019t believe what happened next.\u201d and \u201c10 things to do when Google goes down the next time\u201d.People will find this answer and realize that many of it is actually happening (Again, meant to be a joke)Time For Indian Version!  Let us first confront the reality that this is a possibility. I am assuming that such a ban will be enforced by the Supreme Court because the government simply cannot do it. I am also assuming that all Google services and Google owned products will be banned with an immediate effect without prior notice. So here is my take on the immediate reaction: Rahul Gandhi will try to blame Modi government for it but will end up trolling himself.Meanwhile some politicians will go on a hunger strike and ask the government to lift the ban.Indecent words will be spoken in Lok Sabha accompanied by loud thumping of tables.Sundar Pichai will receive an enormous amount of media attention. He will probably make a statement. People will ask him to resign.https://duckduckgo.com/ and Bing will receive huge traffic from India and they will be very happy about it.Life of most Indians will be disrupted and almost everyone will suffer.Needless to say Twitter and Facebook will be full of posts about this ban.Porn traffic will decline steeply.Uber, Ola and other services using Google Map service will all stop working. Regular taxi fares will suddenly jump.People won\u2019t know what to do with their computers anymore. Internet Service Providers will receive huge number of false complaints that the customer\u2019s internet is not working.Here is the aftermath : Google will suffer from huge financial loss. They will have to close their Indian offices.AIB will make a video titled \u201cIndia reacts to ban of Google\u201d and that will be funny. But wait where will they upload ? No YouTube. HotStar !Indian Media will go crazy and run reports about conspiracy behind the ban.At least 10 new startups will come up with Indian version of Google. Most CEOs will be ex-Googlers. There might be names like \u201cKhoj\u201d (Hindi for Search), \u201cTehkiqat\u201d (Hindi for Investigation), \u201chttp://gINgle.com\u201c, etc. There will be startups to replicate Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, etc too.\u201cGoogle ban in India\u201d will become the most queried phrase on Google globally.The hype around Google hiring IITians will finally go away.International investors looking for investment in Indian tech scene will pull off.

            "answer_text": "Firstly lets try to overview what has internet contributed in our lives. Basically, faster and wider range of data sharing, communication and providing services. Thus, how the absence of internet would affect a particular person would depend on how is he/she engaged with any of these activities in that particular time frame. Thus, I would prefer drawing up domains called independents, partners and parasites for whom the outcomes could differ. However, anybody could flexibly be part of anyone of them. Starting off with independents, these are the people who would be successful in escaping unaffected from a crisis this concerning. This may include people who might be currently vacationing in some of the remote locations and have decided to stay out and explore may be for a couple of days atleast. There could also be people who may not be decently equipped economically or living in geographically difficult to access places. Thus, it is comparatively less probable for them to experience digitization to such an extent. Thus, a lack of internet may not affect them, atleast directly. Next comes the partners. These are the people who are using internet more or less daily. What all could be done here. social networkinglearningsome youtube streaminggames, music and may be moreAll of the above would come to halt. None of the above that you could do. I would fret the entire time. This could go down in the list of one of the sad days of my life and I am relieved that the question is restricted to a single day only. Some other activities could be pursued like maybe reading a newspaper (if not quora), going outdoors to a park, meeting up with friends and cousins, having a day off and treating it as a holiday. Thus, your happiness quotient would be proportional to the alternatives you could find and undertake the same rather than fretting and cussing the unavailability of internet. Finally, coming to the parasites. As mentioned above about alternatives and a day off , what if a holiday cannot be afforded. Think of the following few among all of possibles. Space programsMilitary and DefenceWorld EconomyHow freaked out an astronaut could become if somehow he realises that he has been virtually exiled from the planet for a day, and what repercussions could him/her not being in the radar, or his/her work not being collected be ? Defence personnel being stranded somewhere between their operation which may be taken advantage of by somebody else. World where stock markets and industries have integrally plugged internet on to themselves would stop. People won\u2019t demand or sell any stock/goods. Thus markets could go in for a free flow which was previously being held by a constant demand and supply. In all, effects does not seem good. I don\u2019t know exactly what part of the program would include internet services but looking at the basic functions of internet, we would definitely be missing a lot. Thus, I decided to place them among parasites. ",

DuckDuckGo follows the same product design principles as Google - a simple search engine.

I just search whatever default engine is there on my browser.There will be a great loss for google in terms of money. I will be very happy to see those companies go bankrupte how has become rich from our money and selling our information.There will be a great loss for many governments and agencies who take information from google for their use.Google play store will be close. Well i never download for play store. I download it from site apk. Let other site flourish too. Why only google.G maps. Well there are many other map services.Cloud storage. Well there are many other services.Google is just another major search engine that are just lucky to be on top. Its lucky that we overrated it. We underestimate the real godfather of search YAHOO. Google is just another money earning greedy site. ",
