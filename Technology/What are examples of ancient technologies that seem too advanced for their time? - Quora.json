            "answer_text": "Leaving aside the topic of \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d completely, more appropriately, the question could be worded thus: \"Stone age civilizations have left behind a plethora of examples of precision workmanship of extremely hard Andecite, a granite material. How were these people able to fashion and manipulate perplexing, durable megalithic stone work of this type?\u201d    Puma Punku in Tiahuanaco, Bolivia \u2022 There are many problems associated with the blocks of stone left strewn about on the high plains of Bolivia and Peru as well as other parts of the world. \u2022 The engineering and planning associated with the fabrication and assembly of these stones is beyond amazing. \u2022 Andean peoples have been proposed by mainstream archaeology as having produced these megalithic constructions about five or six hundred years ago. This, by carbon dating of surrounding soil samples during excavation. \u2022 The objects themselves have been constructed of Andecite and Dolorite, both extremely hard granite. How were these primitive people's able to accomplish these incredible feats? There are many YouTube videos that attempt to answer, without much success, how these blocks were formed. But they generate the right questions. One in particular - I can't remember the title - was a documentary of 3 Russian experts touring the world examining this very same issue, the manufacture of these megalithic blocks. These guys are, I would say, trained materials scientists who also happen to know a lot about the operation of a modern day machine shop. Most of the rest of the YouTube vids are garbage. We should confine ourselves to the objective question at hand. The quarry is located approximately 10 miles from the site. Not only were these stones very difficult to cut, but they are also extremely heavy. Did these people have the ability to move blocks that weighed hundreds of tons, and how were they able to form structures with them once the blocks were moved to the current location? And structures very akin to these are found all over the world. Some of the stones appear to show evidence of the application of grinding wheels. While others seem to show signs of cutting in some advanced manner. Micro analyses reveals no evidence of biturfication, or altered properties resulting from application extreme heat. At this time we have absolutely no way of knowing how these people were able to accomplish this. There are too many questions that require answers. All we can provide are suppositions. As excerpted from Wikipedia: \u201c...In assembling the walls of Pumapunku, each stone was finely cut to interlock with the surrounding stones. The blocks were fit together like a puzzle, forming load-bearing joints without the use of mortar. One common engineering technique involves cutting the top of the lower stone at a certain angle, and placing another stone on top of it which was cut at the same angle. The precision with which these angles have been used to create flush joints is indicative of a highly sophisticated knowledge of stone-cutting and a thorough understanding of descriptive geometry. Many of the joints are so precise that not even a razor blade will fit between the stones. Much of the masonry is characterized by accurately cut rectilinear blocks of such uniformity that they could be interchanged for one another while maintaining a level surface and even joints. However, the blocks do not have the same dimensions, although they are close. The blocks were so precisely cut as to suggest the possibility of prefabrication and mass production, technologies far in advance of the Tiwanaku\u2019s Inca successors hundreds of years later. Some of the stones are in an unfinished state, demonstrating the techniques used to shape them. They were initially pounded by stone hammers, which can still be found in numbers on local andesite quarries, creating depressions, and then slowly ground and polished with flat stones and sand.\u201d The article touches on some of the key questions here but then goes on to say things that are patently ridiculous - like stone tools and ropes and lots of people participating in the movement of the stone blocks from the quarry to the site of the ruins. How were the blocks fabricated?What was the purpose of the whole facility(?) once it was all assembled?What is the actual, true age of fabrication?By what method were employed to manipulate these giant blocks from the quarry to the site? How were the blocks accurately positioned?What was the power source? It has been suggested that some form of sonic frequencies were involved.How were the blocks held securely in position as a workpiece? The precision of the angles and core holes is remarkable.Was there a cataclysm that moved these enormously heavy stones from their upright position and spread them all over? Or a wall of mud emanating from nearby Lake Titicaca?The time frame correlates with the Younger Dryas Event, a theory in which a comet slammed into the North American Ice Sheet releasing massive quantities of water and throwing huge chunks of Ice into the upper atmosphere. Also correlates to the Megafauna Extinction.So what seems to me to be a prime requisite is a complete, thorough and honest study by archaeologists, including materials scientists, which address these particular questions and which may ultimately reveal some techniques that could be very useful in today's manufacturing. I find it surprising that the military has not approached a think tank like the Rand Corporation for a comprehensive study of these theoretical techniques - which could have direct application to military science. (Or they already have\u2026) Perhaps it is a shortcoming in my available search engines, but when I looked up \u201cbiturfication\u201d this was the only reference. Please elaborate? ",

            "answer_text": "Steam power in Syracuse (not by Archimedes before you ask), hanging gardens of babylon (how did they get the water up there?) And of course, Archimedes laser project involving bronze mirrors (which provided it is sunny, and Archimedes notes are followed exactly, does actually work and can light a ship out at sea). These are just to name a few of my favorite mostly unknown outstanding wonders of scientific prowes. May i also suggest archimedes crane that could litrally lift ships out of the ocean? Or what about the fact that leonardo de vinchi had designs for a tank in his notes (slightly more modern, but in his era? I think it should count.  Or what about a certain roman gentalman who utilised steam to power an entire performance of robotic displays? There are a lot of things that seem too advanced, but think of it this way, why build steam engines to power boats in greeko roman times if you have armies of slaves? Why build a complex laser to light a ship at sea if a lit arrow does the same job with less effort?Why lift a boat out if you can ram it and sink it?Why build a slow tank if fast horsemen can carve litreral holes through defence? The reason these acheivements were lost is simple-  they were not needed at the time. And  though the knowledge was there, there were easier ways to a means. Therefore, they were done for a laugh and a show. And once the novilty wore off, they were forgotten, doomed to be consigned to the crumbling pages of ancient history. ",
