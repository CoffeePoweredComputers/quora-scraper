            "answer_text": "Flying cars has always been a big part of the vision of the future because there is a certain freedom to flying but flying isn\u2019t accessible to everyone. Only pilots are currently able to fly aircraft. If a non-pilot wants to fly somewhere he either A-needs to find a pilot or an organization that hires pilots (airlines) that is either willing to take him for free or split the price (private pilot) or who is willing to take money to fly them somewhere (commercial pilot\u2260 Airline pilot there is a difference) or they can learn to be a pilot and fly around themselves. not only that but airplanes and helicopters are very expensive AND they can only operate from select areas (Airports/ Heliports/ Helipads/ Seaplane bases) Flying cars brings the freedom of flying to the masses and democratizes flying which is faster than driving. Airliners and even GA planes are far more complicated than your average car\u2026 that scares people believe it or not. The flying car is meant to be simple, like a car this will make it more understandable and more appealing to consumers. It should also make it affordable. are flying cars possible. Technologically yes. There are some in testing. The ones currently under development still need a pilot and are going to be used as flying buses and taxis more than an actual personal flying car. The ones of the future should be autonomous and therefor not need a pilot in the aircraft. These might be used as actual personal flying cars. These are also supposed to be electric which means no pollution. Flying cars would also ease traffic jams on the ground. More people in the air less cars on the ground. Ambulances wouldn\u2019t have to deal with traffic etc etc\u2026 That\u2019s the idea and the vision behind these flying cars is it possible. Yes but I don\u2019t think we will see this for a while. Services will start in the next decade but it won\u2019t become mainstream for a nice amount of decades. ",

            "answer_text": "Flight is always a part of the future fantasies (ever since the Wright Brothers demonstrated it was actually possible) because it represents a freedom of movement and freedom from the traffic congestion we get on the roads. \u201cThe future has to be better and that means we can fly and avoid the hassles of being stuck on the ground.\u201d Flying cars keep getting closer and closer tobeing reality. In the 1940s the Taylor\u2019s Aerocar was an airplane that could rapidly have its wings folded and thus be manageable on the road. It was unstable on the ground at speed in this configuration among other issues making it impractical. In the 1970s someone figured out how to strap wings and tail planes onto a car with a rear mounted engine bolted to the wing. The car could be connected to or disconnected from the wings in less than an hour.Now you have the stable road vehicle, but the wing had to be stored when the car was on the road and it was inconvenient to make the transition. Connecting up the control systems when attaching the wings meant there were dozens of ways to do it wrong\u2026 Today there are experiments in multirotor vehicles that can fit in a common 1 car garage and take off vertically, avoiding almost all of the road. This is likely the most practical approach.We still need a better, lighter battery technology to make them practical. ",
