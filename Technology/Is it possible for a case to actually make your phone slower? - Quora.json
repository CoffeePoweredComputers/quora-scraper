In 2 ways You could have a case that don't let heat out so easy, so this could affect charging by overheating the battery and forcing the phone to charge slower or it could overheat the chipset and cause it to throttle down and eventually make your phone slower when applied.It could be a case thats of metal or something that blocks cellular connection, though this is very rare as a case is made for expecially the phone its for, but if its a case for another phone it could potentially block the antenna bands and slow down or totally block your cellular connection.Hope this helps you, have a nice day :) ",
