            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a software engineer, and for some people coding is hard to learn, for me is not that hard sometimes. I think learning AI is hard, when you don\u2019t know anything or know few about it, for some people it could be easier, for some with strong mathematical or statistic foundations, but even that I think the human being can learn anything if he/she wants. You have to start in some place or some point, then find it interesting, or try to see what cool things you can do with it like image classification or video generation, something which you find attractive and then dig and dig. At some point you will get frustrated because there many concepts and techniques to learn, but wait you also have to see in retrospective how many techniques and concepts you didn\u2019t know before and now you know. One think I\u2019m doing is to join as many AI communities as I can, follow cool people in Youtube like Siraj Raval, or Lex Fridman, and if you don\u2019t find an active community in your area, found it, as I did in Lima Peru with Machine Learning Lima. It is more fun to learn in group with friends than alone! and once you know something then teach it, you\u2019ll learn even more ;) At some point you will discover that Machine Learning is just the representation of how humans learn and think. How we see and detect objects it reflected in the constitutional neural networks for instance or how our brain is organized and the AI is just the \u201cimperfect\u201d way to emulate it. One advice I give you is: \u201ckeep reading\u201d, \u201ckeep motivated\u201d, \u201ckeep hungry!\u201d because it is a cool subject and either you wanted or not, you work and life in the future (if not now) will be related with AI, as it was the internet 25 years ago, this technology is disruptive and will be with us for centuries. Good luck and have fun learning AI! :D Great book to start with Deep Learning: Deep Learning with Python: Francois Chollet: 9781617294433: Amazon.com: Books ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. Actually it depends upon the individual . Machine learning, Computer Vision , deep learning , NLP etc are nothing but a smart way to implement mathematical formulas . Lets say you ask me ** Conversation ** You: Hi Saurabh , What are you doing in machine learning right now ? Me: Hey XYZ , Nothing much just trying to convert tensors to images . You: In you head ( Tensor!!!!! , sounds cool must be something damn complicated ) ** Reality check ** Tensors are nothing but multidimensional matrices ** Conversation ** You: Great what other operations you have performed ? Me: Nothing exciting , just have added 3 convolutional layers with relu as activation function and Stochastic Gradient Descent as cost function . You: Dude . Killer guy (Damn complicated stuff , definitely not my cup of tea) ** Reality check ** Convolution layers are nothing but a combination of few matrix manipulation operations . Relu is a fancy name for a function which gives output after a threshold value is passed , just like a team chasing a target in cricket , if you hit more than what first team has scored you win , no matter how much more but even if one run less then target and you don\u2019t win. Stochastic Gradient Descent is again a fancy jargon for mathematical formula to find global minima of a provided function in a iterative manner . ** Conversation ** You: I see. But in which project you are doing all this sci-fi things ? Me: Actually I was reading this paper \u201cNeural Algorithm for Artistic style \u201d from one the professor from BCCN Berlin (one of my dream university ). Where they came up with the approach of getting content and style separately from a CNN, its quite cool , so thought to implement the algorithm . You: God Level bro. (Lets play Pokemon Go , this thing is not for me , once AI takes over all the job market , Everyone will end up jobless not only me , so why bother . Lets concentrate on Pikachu ) ** Reality check ** Its just maths ,python, patience and practice that is required to learn AI in general . What about the Artistic Algorithm ? Dude \u2026. one thing I\u2019m dead sure that, its difficult than catching Pokemon Kudos!!:) ",
