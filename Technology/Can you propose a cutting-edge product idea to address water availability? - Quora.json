            "answer_text": "There are five main ideas, the implementation of which are long overdue. I have long proposed an interstate water system, analogous to the interstate highway system. It can be designed to move water from areas of excess (e.g flood zones) to areas of drought. Pipes, valves, drains, and taps, along with sensors and computer controls. Nothing particularly new. Just scaled up.Better local water use, particularly in agriculture. I would ban overhead sprinklers and require the installation of drip irrigation systems, such as that designed and used in Israel.There are wind traps that extract water from the air. They are already in use in some parts of the world.Desalinization of seawater. The efficiency of existing processes would need to be improved, but there is no reason why it could not be made a priority.The reprocessing of so-called \u201cgray water\u201d in areas of drought. The technology used in the space station is a place to start.Update - additions: The rebirth of the local capture and storage of rainwater. Ancient cisterns have been found in desert areas that allowed survival in arid areas. In more recent times, rain barrels were used to capture and store runoff.After a basic per-person allocation, charge more for water use, that is; charge the real total cost of providing water.Discourage the consumption of fruits, nuts, and vegetables that require a lot of water per yield, and/ or breed more drought-tolerant versions.Indian rain dances, prayer, and any other kinds of appeals to supernatural forces (no disrespect intended).As climate change continues to disrupt existing water supplies, one or all of these ideas will be needed.
