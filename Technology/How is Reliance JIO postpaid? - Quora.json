            "answer_text": "Don't go for Jio Postpaid!! Jio's customer executive didn't even know how Jio postpaid system works! I have suffered enough by choosing Jio Postpaid as it was necessary for me to obtain a Postpaid to work it in Jammu (J&K). I bought Jio Postpaid plan of \u20b9303 under Summer Surprise. They charged nothing in that span of 3 months (84 days). As on the last day, they started billing cycle. Now all this happened without informing me. After first billing cycle they emailed me \u20b9303 + 55 taxes = \u20b9358 bill. I thought of it as of 3 months of another plan and I paid that! But to my disappointment, this happened every billing cycle! So it doesn't matter what plan you select, you have to pay what your base plan says every month. So this is what I was paying then! Base Plan - 303 + 55 taxes = \u20b9358 each month Now I contacted customer care, they gave me an idea! They instructed me to recharge with Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan offer of \u20b9459 (1GB/day for 84 days), so that I wouldn't be charged of that base plan. I recharged and activated this plan. But to my disappointment, now both plan was working. I again contacted customer care they told that Base plan is mandatory. The JDDD-459 was additional plan which I opted for, according to them. So what did I got back then, Base Plan : 358 each month Pre on Post : 459 paid once for 84 days Finally I got 1GB/day (from base plan) + 1GB/day (from pre-on-post plan) = 2GB/day Similarly 200 SMS , and twice of unlimited calls (as per Jio, stupid af) Now people, understand how they are fooling you. If you are still adamant to buy a postpaid from Jio then please go ahead, but remember use it for the first 3 or 2 months according to your plan then surrender it before next billing cycle starts!!!! Now about the Jammu Jio Center The biggest Jio center of Jammu accepts only 25 person per day to resolve issues of theirs. Yes, you heard that right! People stand in a long queue as we see in any government work. I went 3 times and still wasn't able to surrender my Jio Postpaid SIM! Now the billing amount has reached over \u20b91000 and I'm not going to pay that amount. ",

            "answer_text": "Postpaid of any company is just a trap to get more money out of customers. Unlike, prepaid where you can decide whom to pay and when to pay. For, other people who like it because it is convenient or their companies pay the bill postpaid make sense. In that, if one compares Jio and Airtel basic plans, for the same 75 GB data Airtel changes Rs 590 with unused data rollover, whereas Jio it will cost almost Rs 1400 both including taxes. Besides these so-called offers by Airtel like Amazon and Netflix etc are gimmicks. Who takes postpaid for that. Might as well be on prepaid and save more. Similarly, how many people with Jio sims make overseas calls and roam overseas. Overseas roaming not only requires money also it requires carrier support for the particular brand of phone you carry. People for whom it matters to make an overseas call or make calls while on roaming abroad very regularly, they really don\u2019t care about the money being charged. Bottom line. Jio has made internet very cheap but their current postpaid plans are a ripoff. They need better and more variety of plans to attract the core postpaid users. ",
