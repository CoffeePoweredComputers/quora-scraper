            "answer_text": "I expect you realize that a technology is not a trend in itself. A technology can amplify the changes a trend represents, or it can kill those changes. What I look for as a futurist is what a technology will enable us to do. For example, wireless phones, enabled new mobility\u2014for people, for work, for devices, and so on. Those changes in mobility are still playing out in society, with the help of new and more sophisticated versions of the technology. Sometimes a technology can enable changes, but those changes are either not significant enough to sustain the technology, or a new and better technology comes along. We know that most successful technologies follow a similar path in enabling new solutions and new behaviors: 1. substitution, 2. addition, and 3., transformation. Cell phones first substituted for fixed line phones, freeing people from having to make all their calls from home or office. Then with apps, and new uses for these phones, people began to add new things they could do, collecting and storing information, managing data, and so on. Then now, in the 3rd stage, phones have changed how and when we work, how we communicate, where we look for information, how we manage our lives, homes, etc. And there\u2019ll be more social transformations ahead. So technologies don\u2019t drive trends, people do\u2014and societies. ",
