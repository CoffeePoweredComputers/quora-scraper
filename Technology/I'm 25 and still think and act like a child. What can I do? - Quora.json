            "answer_text": "You\u2019re going to get a lot of advice to live the rest of your life like a child\u2014how beautiful it is to remain in this state, to embrace chaos, fun, experimentation, and to never become too serious. Just live and let live, it\u2019ll all work out. Indeed, there are aspects of childhood you shouldn\u2019t lose. You should always remain positive, see the best in others, enjoy the beauty and all that is good in life. But it\u2019s critical that you become an adult because your decisions will soon start seriously affecting the rest of your life, the lives of your family members and future children, your country, and the world. So let\u2019s say you remain a child. You allow yourself to childishly fall in love with a man or a woman who is also a child. You go around having \u201cfun\u201d with each other, enjoying life, making impulsive decisions, putting off education and serious careers in pursuit of some ideal state where love and chasing your fleeting desires is all that matters. And then you have a child together. Suddenly your decisions impact not only you, but a young, innocent life. However, you\u2019re both stunted, immature people who haven\u2019t learned to take responsibility for yourselves or others. The stresses of life start to wear on you. Because neither of you chose to learn how to become highly functional adults, you struggle in your careers. You waste money on drinking and partying. Because you\u2019re emotionally immature, you argue, fight, and hurt each other in vindictive, childish ways. Your child watches all this, internalizing all that dysfunction, wondering why her parents hate each other (is it my fault?) Since you don\u2019t care about adult issues, you choose not to vote or get involved with your local government, your apathy and lack of interesting allowing the government to become all the more corrupt and ineffective. You\u2019re poor and uneducated, so you don\u2019t get involved with charities that help lift other people out of poverty, perpetuating the problems all around you. You feel no need to continue your education, so you choose not to read books about economics and science and the great literature about men and women who led exemplary lives that could inspire you to be so much more than a child. Then one day your child comes home and tells you that they were molested by their teacher. What do you do now? Are you going to be an adult about it? Call the police, file reports, get a lawyer and sue the school? That\u2019s all heavy, adult stuff. You see what I\u2019m getting at. Life requires you to be an adult. And if you don\u2019t grow up and learn how to face life\u2019s toughest challenges, you will live an extremely difficult, powerless life. If you want to start learning how to be an adult, start small. Start reading books about all kinds of topics, especially biographies of great people (perhaps read some books about Abraham Lincoln and the Founding Fathers). Keep pursuing your education. Work hard. Ask yourself every day, \u201cHow can I make a difference in the world today? How can I bless other people and improve myself? What can I do to serve my community, my family, my church? How can I face challenges with grace, compassion, kindness, yet strength?\u201d By all means, cling to the good of childhood. Never be afraid to smile, laugh, and enjoy the beauty of life. But learn how to do that while bravely and smartly addressing the serious issues that adult life will most certainly lay on your shoulders. By doing all this, you will begin to have a more global perspective about life and you\u2019ll begin to feel a responsibility to make life better not only for yourself but for everyone around you. It\u2019s that sense of responsibility that will turn you into a highly functional adult that will make this world a better place. Finally, don\u2019t allow other people to define you by calling you \u201ca child.\u201d If you are indeed acting like a child, decide that, today, you will begin to change. If they are unfairly calling you a child, perhaps it\u2019s time to become an adult and politely say to them, \u201cI have started to take responsibility for my life and I do not appreciate being referred to as a child.\u201d If they don\u2019t stop calling you a child, then stop spending time with them. Adults do not put up with such abuse from anyone. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, yet it\u2019s better if you know this right away instead of discovering later on, as it progresses. You\u2019ll never ever be differenter. You\u2019ll grow older, biologically, maybe even have your own kids and so on. What will never change is your maturity: you will forever be a child. Sure, you can act serious/dress smart/do whatever, thinking and acting like a child doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re unintelligent ( quite the opposite, according to some stereotypes/dubious scientific articles eg. really smart people are childlike blabla). The more you\u2019ll act serious, the more you\u2019ll have people believe it, that you\u2019re a serious, responsible person, the more you\u2019ll feel like you need to do something, anything, that\u2019s profoundly idiotic, temperamental and playful. So here\u2019s my suggestion. Act out on your impulses. Go ahead and find a context, CREATE it, in which you can act out on those impulses. There\u2019s a documentary on this (hehehehe, documentary), it\u2019s with the guy from Forrest Gump, and you\u2019ll see what you should do: You\u2019re a kid in an adult\u2019s body, you can do all sorts of things, like buy all the toys etc. Get yourself into the right context to get what you want as a kid. Do you like computer games? Shift to game design. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 25 and majored Biology or whatever. Simply shift to Game design, career changes are a must for a childlike adult like ourselves. Best of luck, tell me how it worked out !   ",
