            "answer_text": " What elements of \"Star Trek\" tech could be made in reality? What \"outside-the-box\" applications could it serve? Cool question. Star Trek is full to the brim with cool sci-fi tech. It's fertile ground, to be sure. From warp drive and defensive shields to medical tricorders and photon torpedoes, the list of fantastic ideas is long\u2026 and fun. Food replicators, synthohol, matter transporters, faster than light \u201csubspace\u201d communications, phasers, medical stasis, AI and androids, holodecks, fusion generators, tractor beams. Wow. Thats just a sample of the \u201cTrek tech\" awesomeness that comes to mind. Collectively, this sci-fi sweetness is likely to remain firmly inside the realm of fantasy for a long long time, if not forever.  There is at least one thing I can think of that may be reality-based. That is the Bussard (pronounced: boo-SARD) ram scoops. You staunch Trekkies may know just what I'm talking about, but for everyone else, let me explain. Many spacecraft in Star Trek have multiple modules or segments, all joined by structural connections. The USS Enterprise (original series) had a disk or \u201csaucer section\" high and forward, mounted on a neck that connected to a more-or-less cylindrical engineering section. It was characterized by a single large parabolic antenna at its front and a shuttle bay at its rear. Perhaps half way back along the engineering section, two bilaterally symmetrical pylons sprouted ouward and at the ends of each were \u201cwarp nacelles\". On the forward facing aspect of these long, slim, roughly cylindrical sections was a brightly lit translucent dome.  These were the Bussard collectors. Their function was to use very strong magnetic fields to funnel the nearly non-existent gas of interstellar space into the collection membranes where the mostly hydrogen, some helium and trace other stuff was concentrated, and condensed into a liquid for storage. Later, it could be drawn upon to fuel the fusion reactors, impulse engines and, presumably the matter component of the matter/antimatter reactor.  Way back in 1960, before Star Trek hit the airwaves, a real-life American physicist and nuclear energy researcher first proposed using a magnetic funnel to collect, and compress the interstellar medium. This man was Robert W. Bussard. His plan coupled such a funnel with a fusion powered ram jet for interstellar propulsion. The Bussard ram collector and the Bussard ram jet of course takes their names from him.  The name stuck and made its way into Star Trek lingo when a similar system was incorporated into the design of the Starship Enterprise. A notable difference was that the actual Bussard ram scoop directly fed the Bussard fusion ram jet, while the Trek design decoupled the scoop from the engine, incorporating an intermediate tanking system for the collected material. By the way, Star Trek was not the only sci-fi franchise to use Bussard's collector/jet arrangement. Larry Niven, Paul Anderson, and Vernor Vinge all riffed on the idea in their novels.  Not to be relegated to the world of sci-fi literature, Bussard's idea was featured by real-science communicator and educator, Carl Sagan in his much loved series, Cosmos.   Since Bussard's first conception of the collector/jet, the interstellar medium around our home star has been found to be much thinner than originally thought. It's a veritable desert out there in the neighborhood, so much so that achieving fusion within the jet is now viewed as unlikely hereabouts, without making use of particularly exotic Carbon Nitrogen Oxygen cycle processes. I may seem to digress, but I know there are one or two readers who will be disappointed if I fail to be complete in this respect. Let us not disappoint. If you are interested, there are several (way more than you might expect) legit scholarly papers on the books. For the sake of veracity, I have shared a link to Bussard's original paper: https://web.archive.org/web/20180417180616if_/http://www.askmar.com:80/Robert%20Bussard/Galactic%20Matter%20and%20Interstellar%20Flight.pdf  Now you asked in your original question whether there might be any \u201coutside-the-box\u201d applications for this real-world \u201cTrek tech\u201d\u2026 as though flying at relativistic velocities to the next star over in our glactic neighborhood on a magnetically fed fusion ram jet wasn't just so everyday ordinary. If you want to call a Bussard collector/ram jet \u201cinside the box\u201d then we would really have to hang it out over the edge to come up with something novel using Bussard as our starting point. Turns out, just for the sake of answering your question, a cool application can, in fact, be devised. How \u2019bout we give it a go, shall we? Let's keep this firmly within the realm of \u201cright-now\" doability. Let's take our cue from Star Trek and decouple the fusion ram jet from the Bussard magnetic collector. Let's use a condenser/tanking system and totally throw away the fusion jet engine. No engine = no forward motion, so what we have now is a \u201cstatic\u201d magnetic collector, condenser and tank system. What could we do with such a thing?  One really cool application is to hang it out into the stream of solar wind and gulp up the solar plasma. For our efforts, we would capture mostly hydrogen and maybe (if memory serves me correctly) around 8% helium, including the precious helium-3. Let's anchor our \u201cWind Catcher\" to something heavy so it doesn't get blown away over time. How about Phobos? That's something heavy, without a doubt.  The Mars settlers would find all sorts of stuff to do with an orbiting tank-farm full of hydrogen and helium-3. Bring back those fusion engines. Mars has a superior position, and gravity well to take advantage of the resources in the asteroid belt. Having a \u201cWind Catcher\" fuel depot for fusion rocket powerplants in orbit at Phobos (and why not Deimos, too - I mean, what the heck, right?!) would provide Martians with yet another tool to transform their austere home into the \u201cgateway to the solar system\u201d, and eventually, an industrial and economic giant.  Wind Catchers may be so successful at tapping the bottomless solar wind that strip-mining the regolith of Earth's moon for He-3 may fall out of favor economically and be seen for the inefficient, anemic, and ugly defacement of nature it truly is. I don't know about you, but I'd prefer my Helium-3\u2026 moondust-free (a little rhymey thing I just came up with)!  As if that wasn't already as \u201cout-of-the-box\" as any real-world Star Trek tech could get, let's take it a little further. Nitrogen is a sparse thing in Mars' already so-thin atmosphere of mostly CO2. Sure, it's a trace component and any Mars settlement will need to scratch together its environmental nitrogen from the very rare air (for its own atmospheric use AND for use in agriculture),  but wouldn't it be nice if some of that Nitrogen could come from our \u201cWind Catchers\". It turns out that nitrogen, and oxygen for that matter, is available as trace components of the solar plasma.   Carl Sagan was right when he said, \u201cWe are all made of star stuff\", but I'm betting even he had no idea the brussel sprouts on a Martian's dinner plate might be in part made from nitrogen that came directly from our very own star.

            "answer_text": "Whilst I admire the scientific mind which can eveluate which aspects of warp drives, dilithium crystals and defensive space shields might be practically possible, the show\u2019s real impact as a forecaster of technological development is much more immediate and earth-changing; and it has already been realised. If you read Gene Roddenberry\u2019s \u2018The Making of Star Trek\u2019 which was written when the show was only a few series old, you\u2019ll be surprised to realise just how long ago that series was conceived, and what currently-commonplace technology we didn\u2019t yet have. Communicators are the most obvious example, probably. I remember in the early episodes, seeing those and thinking what a cool convenient idea they were. Just a little hand-held gadget, which you could talk into and be heard anywhere - like a telephone, or a short-wave radio, but without all the fixed clutter and cables and power supply. It was fantasy, obviously, and completely impossible, but what a neat idea it would be. (The only thing they forgot was that there would still be some need to indicate to whom you wish to speak, which is unexplained.) Another innovation was automatically-opening sliding doors. Roddenberry had department stores contacting him to ask how the doors from the bridge into the lift had been engineered, because they\u2019d like to be able to do that, but detecting the approaching person, and getting a sufficiently rapidly-opening door response, was proving impossible. Roddenberry had to admit they just had a couple of stagehands hidden behind the set, sliding the doors back, and stitched on the \u2018whoosh\u2019 as a sound effect. McCoy\u2019s medical instruments are actually avant-garde designer salt- and pepper-cruets. Scanning and non-invasive or non-contact temperature and pulse-taking was still decades away. And so on. ",
