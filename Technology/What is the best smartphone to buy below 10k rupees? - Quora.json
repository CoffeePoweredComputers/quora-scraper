            "answer_text": "In the past, it could have been pretty difficult to acquire a smartphone that has good features for less than 10k. Times, however, has changed now and one can actually purchase a feature-rich smartphone easily within 10k. Personally, over the period of almost a decade - even I have never had the need to spend more than 10-12k on a smartphone. At the moment, with the constant competition in the smartphone market as well with technological growth - it has become easier than ever to acquire a device within a preferred range of price. I think the best smartphone to purchase below 10k, at the moment, would definitely be the Realme C3. Realme as a brand aspires to provide smartphones which are a combination of style and durability within a reasonable price. Their USP is performance through affordable but advanced technology and stylish designs and the culmination of this aspect is noticeable in the Realme C3. Realme C3 is the successor to the Realme C2. In the aspect of cost, this is an incredibly reasonably priced phone. It is available in two variants and depending on the variant one chooses this phone will cost Rs 6,999 (3GB/32GB) and Rs 7,999 (4GB/64GB). A 4GB RAM phone with an internal storage of 64 GB is a steal deal at the price of 8k especially when numerous contemporary brands provide the 4GB RAM option at around 10k or an above range. The C3 has a decent screen display of 6.5 inches with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. The inclusion of the fingerprint sensor is also a huge plus as it is hardly available in other models of below 10k. It is run by the MediaTek Helio G70 processor. As mentioned before, it has two variants - 3/4 GB RAM + 32/64 GB storage (expandable up to 256 GB) The rear camera is 12MP+2MP dual with LED Flash and the front camera is 5 MP. It is available in Blazing Red and Frozen Blue. The battery power is 5000 mAh and it is run by the Android 10 based colour OS7. The highlight of the C3, however, is the MediaTek Helio G70 processor which is a gaming-focused soc. It was created and designed specifically for elite mobile gamers and the fact that game enthusiasts consumers will be able to procure this at such a low price is a blessing for many. This processor is also equipped to handle long hours of constant gaming by providing reliable performance throughout. It is also the first Realme device to have the Realme User Interface. The G70 chipset will allow the users to indulge in several heavy-duty mobile games like PUBG, Mobile Legends, Asphalt and COD .etc. for long periods of time without facing any issues of latency. Previously, these games could not be played in even mid-range smartphones but with the integration of the G70 chipset - the same are supported with ease in a budget device. Besides, the gaming aspect, the Realme C3 also has other impressive features. It has a very strong battery which would last the users for hours at a time - this battery is capable of withstanding 5-6 hours of continuous gaming sessions without any issues. It is without a doubt - an extremely worthwhile purchase within the range of 10k. A consumer will be able to attain a long list of benefits through a small price with this device. ",
