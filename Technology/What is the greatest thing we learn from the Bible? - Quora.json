            "answer_text": "That heaven is all about a relationship with God, given freely by Jesus, and not about how hard we work to get God\u2019s approval. Society has often painted God to be the taskmasker or gatekeeper who stands at the gate to mark your exam and either pass or fail you for heaven. But this tragically demeans God as purely examiner and arbiter. This image paints God as someone who we only need to let them into heaven, and don\u2019t need otherwise. The Bible says that God is more than a taskmaster and gatekeeper of heaven, but someone who personally created and loved us. This love doesn\u2019t mean he is not just, he loves us too much to leave us the way we are. His love is demonstrated it on the cross where he basically approves us not because we deserved it, but because of his great love and mercy towards sinners. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7\u20138 Approval comes from being accepted as part of his family as his children.  As we know parents love their children and this is independent of what that child does. Sometimes the child will make mistakes but the parent will still care for that child, because of the relationship they have. And when family knock on the door of the house, will they not be let in? The Bible says that those who accept Jesus into their life become a part of the family, and can call God Father and Jesus a friend. This is the reason Christians can say they assuredly have eternal life because of this relationship. They\u2019ve already passed the test. What Jesus has done is imputed onto the person who trusts in him. Jesus invites the repentant sinner to come into God\u2019s house and be part of the family. It means they can enjoy God\u2019s company and goodness in this life and the one to come.   To those seeking God\u2019s approval and hope to reach heaven, let me ask you how much you KNOW God? If not, why should God open his home to you? If you want God\u2019s approval, know that he has already given approval through Jesus. All you need to do is become Jesus\u2019s friend by accepting his death and resurrection and asking him to come into your life, and you will receive not only eternal life, but an eternal and perfect relationship of love. And because you are his friend, you will not only be welcomed but treated as one of family.  ",

            "answer_text": "What is the greatest thing we learn from the Bible? There are many. For example, Satan tricks people into reciting Psalm 23 together, which is exactly how Jesus Christ said not to pray. While Psalm 22 describes how Jesus Christ felt during his Crucifixion and it goes entirely unnoticed. How anyone can read that Psalm after understanding it without crying is beyond me. Also, the Bible proves that it and it alone is the word of God. God gave Moses annual Holy Days and 1,500 years later they began to be fulfilled on their exact days when Jesus Christ came. Also, as countless Rabbis have send for millennia the Messiah must come by the end of 6,000 years to usher in a thousand years of piece. A Sabbath rest. And I discovered that events go forward for 3,500 years and then they repeat in reverse order for 3,500 years. A simply way to see this is that man was immortal and living in paradise forever. He sinned and was kicked out at the beginning of the 6,000 years. At the end of the 6,000 years man`s sins will be forgiven, he will become immortal and live in paradise forever. When I saw a Jewish wedding on TV I wanted to know about the cup they step on and break at the end of the ceremony. And I discovered that it was about the destruction of THE temples in Jerusalem. The temples? It turns out that both temples were destroyed on the same day. I knew that God had a hand in this and that He was giving us a clue that we are to understand. But what does it mean? It took decades of pondering, but after putting this together\u2026. Series of events: The Babylonians destroyed the temple in 586 BC on the 9th of Av. The Jews were taken into captivity for 70 years. The Messiah King Cyrus (written about in scripture before he was born) freed the Jews to build a new temple. The Messiah Jesus Christ warned that the temple would be destroyed. After standing for 586 years the temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD on the 9th of Av. But that is not the kicker. I kept searching and using the very ancient belief of God`s seven thousand year plan I estimated the year between these events and came up with 261 BC. These events had to be repeating and going into reverse order for a reason. I immediately put it into Google and saw the Hebrew Calendar. I went to the site and put in 261 BC and when I saw the results, no joke, I literally almost fell off of my chair: 261 BC = 3500\u20133501 HEBREW CALENDAR But the single greatest surprise I found in the Bible is that GOD is coming to the Earth to live here. 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. - REVELATION 21 For some this may feel like Calculus 3 on the first day of Kindergarten. If so, step back for some days and then come back to think about it. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the greatest thing we learn from the Holy Bible is the depth of unconditional love and how potent service and sacrifice becomes as a result of that. Let\u2019s look at the Scripture that offers us insight on this subject. 1 John 4.16: \u201cSo we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\u201d 1 John 4.18: \u201cThere is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.\u201d 1 Cor 13.6\u20137: \u201cLove does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.\u201d The love we come to understand is not easy to manifest, because it requires us to prove it. Think of love as a valley and in order to get from one side of the valley to the other, you must ride a steed. The steed of the valley of love is pain because as you draw nearer to Him you will suffer more. Now consider this prayer and reflect on it in relation to love being the greatest teaching we learn from the Holy Bible. O Thou Whose tests are a healing medicine to such as are nigh unto Thee, Whose sword is the ardent desire of all them that love Thee, Whose dart is the dearest wish of those hearts that yearn after Thee, Whose decree is the sole hope of them that have recognized Thy truth! I implore Thee, by Thy divine sweetness and by the splendors of the glory of Thy face, to send down upon us from Thy retreats on high that which will enable us to draw nigh unto Thee. Set, then, our feet firm, O my God, in Thy Cause, and enlighten our hearts with the effulgence of Thy knowledge, and illumine our breasts with the brightness of Thy names. - Baha\u2019u\u2019llah If proving the claim of love is a test then it will result in nearness to God.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is the greatest thing we learn from the Bible?\u201d Don\u2019t believe everything you read! And I am not being facetious here - more trouble has been caused by people misunderstanding the biblical text, than for almost any other reason, apart from greed, selfishness and xenophobia. People routinely accept and put into action doctrines that were never meant for them: God\u2019s command, \u2018Go forth and multiply\u2019 was intended for Adam and Eve and their offspring, but God-fearing humans are still reproducing like rabbits and destroying the planetApplying certain verses, products of their milieu to justify racism (Ham was cursed, therefore all people of colour should serve the Semites & Whites!).Xenophobia & racial \u201ccleansing\u201d (Joshua murdered whole communities at God\u2019s command).Repentance (hence the Roman Catholic\u2019s misuse of penance, Magdalene Laundries etc.Discrimination (hence the persecution of Jews, Wiches, Communists, Gays - & non-heterosexual behaviour, and of anyone who is different) .& since Jesus & Paul both accepted slavery, it must be OK, mustn\u2019t it?Read the Bible (or any work of non-fiction, for that matter) in context and be aware of when something was written & whether it really is an eternal truth (\u201cYou shall not murder\u201d), or a cultural one (\u201cWomen must cover their heads in church\u201d) - the former must be obeyed and used as foundations for our lives, the latter can be safely ignored. One just has to learn the difference. A friend of mine, who suffered badly from schizophrenia, tended to apply everything in the Bible literally - I was quietly amused one day when I found him outside a fish & chip shop praying, asking God whether he should have a chicken & mushroom pie, or a steak and kidney one! He was, of course, \u201ctaking everything to the Lord in prayer\u201d! ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is the greatest story ever told. It is one of the most intelligent books ever written. It is the ultimate book of patterns, written by incredibly intelligent people. The Bible speaks about self-healing. When you read the Bible, you get lost in your vanity, looking for who can help you, who can save you, who should you obey. Vanity, vanity, vanity. And you don\u2019t get your head to work. Psychology has also ignored the writings of the Bible because it did not understand them, as it has ignored most introspective knowledge because it claims it cannot prove it well enough. This is the exact reason why it is so behind: personality disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are as of today incurable. Psychometrics have also had the same fate: aside of IQ, some parts of EQ, there is hardly anything there. Personality theories are also very incomplete. The reason is because they see things from the surface, in the wrong way, and with the wrong approach. So what can you learn from the Bible? You can\u2019t learn much. This has been proven, or else what I write would have already been said, but it hasn\u2019t. You are still looking for people up in the clouds to save you. Today people are so stupid they are about to eliminate one of the most intelligent books ever written. If the Bible was not useful for anything else, it is one of the best ways to prove how stupid people are today. Simply ask them: \u201cWhat does the Bible mean to you?\u201d I use the Bible for research. The Bible is one of the best sources of empirical information about how the mind works, and specifically about how self-healing works, obtained using introspection, a done by the best specialists in that area: monks. The main reason I use the Bible is that it is simple. Simple when one understands what it speaks about and how it speaks about it. Neuroscience is mostly useless: it is the development of a whole new language and a whole new set of tools. But all of these add extreme complexity to the problem, that including learning all these languages and tools themselves first. At the same time, it ignores solving the problem. Neuroscientists does nothing new with these tools that people could not do before with respect to the problem. If you can\u2019t even describe the problem, you can\u2019t solve the problem, no matter how many fancy tools you have available. You don\u2019t even know what you are trying to solve. There are many things you can do even with a pen, when you know how to use it. You don\u2019t need a complicated drawing studio. If you don\u2019t know how to draw, both pen and studio are useless. The Bible basically implies the following: People can self-healThere is a process for self-healingWhen that process is activated, a component named \u201cJesus\u201d appears, which travels around the body and cures all the illnesses and disordersWhen I read the Bible, I ask these questions: What if it was possible to activate this process to happen more often? What if it was possible to \u201ccall the wise men\u201d, \u201cgive birth\u201d to \u201cJesus\u201d and let him do his miracles again? And what if it is possible to do it more than once? What if it was possible to call an army of Jesuses, doing miracle cures inside a person\u2019s body and mind? What would that mean? It would mean that a person would be able to heal from any illness automatically! And it could mean eternal life! The more I read the Bible, the more I find that the time is coming where such expectations may not be as impossible. There have been numerous problems in physics, maths and other sciences that were solved before. To decode the Bible and reveal this secret of self-healing, and then reproduce it should not be that hard! And I am already halfway there. But the biggest question of all that you have never thought of is this: If the mind self-heals indeed, then why did it not heal illnesses already? Why do illnesses even exist? Wouldn\u2019t the mind have healed them? So what stopped the mind from self-healing? For one reason, it seems that Jesus does not always appear. What stopped Jesus appearing in some cases, but made Jesus appear in others? The answer is already obvious: You don\u2019t believe in God! And what does that mean? Very simple: God is no other than your mind. You don\u2019t believe in the power of your mind. People are very disconnected from their mind. Your fleshy nature is barbaric. The first step to healing is to realise that every person has inside them a powerful mind, so powerful that it is beyond their conscious, subconscious and unconscious understanding. People are so disconnected from it that all they can do is believe it exists. The mind is something that you can\u2019t own, can\u2019t control, can\u2019t dominate, cannot order. You are not the boss of your mind. Your mind is the boss of you. The first step for healing is to reconnect with your mind, through simply letting go of the arrogance, vanity, and predatory instincts, and submit to the power of your mind, and let it do its work. Self-healing comes when you realise that you are powerless to what comes in your mind. You are only a receiver of what the mind comes up with. You don\u2019t know why you act as you do, and cannot change that. You can only follow it, and it will certainly lead you to what is best for you. As long as you keep going against your mind, you always lose, and you never self-heal. When you realise that and submit to your mind\u2019s power, self-healing comes. So, to put it more clearly: you, other people, and all scientists are looking to find how to heal. You have not understood the problem. You are looking for something that already exists, and trying to take control of it. You are confused. The mind already self-heals, but it doesn't do so because you stop it from doing so, because you are trying to dominate it! How you approach healing is similar to how you try to heal an injured cat. When you try to catch the cat so you can treat its wounds, the cat resists and scratches you, because it is scared, as it governed by its animal instincts. But in this case, you are the aggressive injured cat. The mind always tries to heal you, but you resist, and you constantly fight it away, because of your animal instincts. I am not looking for a way to heal people, but how to let the mind do the work it already knows how to do! Self-healing already exists. It has been proven: The Bible says it. There are numerous cases of people who appeared to have been saved as if by a miracle. It is not a miracle. Self-healing is a human ability. What you are trying to do is weird, and I just keep scratching my head with how science approaches the mind. Science is looking for a miracle. I use these concepts at Neucogni to develop devices that may really cure all disorders and illnesses at once. I think they all have the same root, and that root has already been described in the Bible more than 2 thousand years ago.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion it is that we are sinners, we deserve death and eternal torment. That God loves is so much that he provided a way for us to avoid that through Jesus Christ. That salvation and eternal life is not a process of works, but a true belief in Christ. No works, ordinances, good deeds, or sacraments can you to heaven. You can have salvation and not have read a single word in the Bible. The Gospel is really that simple. Now as a believer you receive the Holy Spirit, who doesn\u2019t cause you to roll on the floor and speak nonsense in tongues, but whose job is to guide you to a relationship with Christ and to guide you to truth. When you receive the Holy Spirit after accepting Christ, the rest will come. That is the cool part works are a result of salvation not a means to salvation. If you had to sum the whole Bible up in 1 verse it would be the iconic John 3:16, but Here are some of my favorite verses. \u201cFor I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d Romans\u202c 8:38-39\u202c  \u201cthat if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.\u201d Romans\u202c 10:9-10\u202c \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\u201d Ephesians\u202c 2:8-9\u202c NASB\u202c\u202c ",

Jesus is our Spitual Big Brother! LITERALLY!! And we can become Heirs of GOD\u2019s Glory!, and Joint Heirs with Christ! It all has to do with your God Given Free Agency. You are free to choose. The New Testament is our guide to the Celestial Kingdom of our GOD(Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ!,two separate Men, one in purpose) it takes conversion by the Holy Ghost,(another GOD!)so the #1 commandment is in Mathew, DO THE WILL OF THE FATHER! The Old Testament has the ground rules of The 10 Comandments as given to Moses . We learn that the God in the Old Testament is Literally Jesus Christ( still a God with a spirit body) and thru the teachings of his Prophets he will be born in to a mortal body to dwell on earth and be our way back to THE FATHER! He organized this Earth under the Guidence of his Father to Glorify Him! He molded the dust to create bodies for our first mortal parents,Adam and Eve. We are spirits in our premortal life in the Kingdom of Heaven,and at our designated time we are quickened to our Mothers Womb at conception! We chose to be born into mortality\u2019s???????,some will not make it!!!some will be born with disabilities\u2026 some will be perfect/imperfect we will have trials to test us in this probation period\u2026. Faith/ loss of faith/ no faith at all/ believers/ non believers/ followers of God? Or the Devil , we are here to be tested, God is a Just GOD! If you die without law he does not judge you and you return back to him( infants, babys, Children befor the age of knowing right from wrong, people who are born challenged,\u2019retarded\u2019 are saved!!) All who died without the gospel of Jesus Christ are given the Gospel in the Spirit world and have their free Agency to accept or reject Christ! In the spirit world we wait to be Resurrected to be reunited with our mortal body and transformed into an Immortal Body such as Our Savior and Our Heavenly Father Have!!! We will have a Tangible Immortal Body Now!! For Eternity! If you are Worthy you Enter the Gates of The Celestial Kingdom! Or you RECIEVE a lesser Glory if you fall short of being worthy, or GO TO BURN IN HELL FOR TIME AND ALL ETERNITY IN A BODY WITH SATAN AND HIS DEMONS!!!\u2026 read the Book of Mormon, it contains the identical teachings and is easier to understand, it was written anciently for our Day!! It is the CAPSTONE OF THE BIBLE!!! ",

            "answer_text": "The single, greatest thing I learned from the Bible is that it is all about God speaking to, directing, pushing, moving, enticing, driving, and inviting humans to listen to Him and follow Him by living our lives with the examples that the Bible records of God doing these things with people just like you and me. God can be a personal friend to us, God can be a Father (a real father, unlike what some people have experienced with their earthly parents), and He gives us wide room and time to learn and explore and love and build and help others. Among my favorite passages in the Bible is one \u201ckeeper\u201d that has been a foundation for my relationship with God: \u201cHe is a rewarder to those who diligently seek Him.\u201d I see such passages as to say that He \u201cknew us\u201d even \u201cbefore the foundations of the earth were laid\u201d, and \u201cin your mother\u2019s womb I knit you\u201d (which so very strongly resonated with me when I studied thc make-up and operation of the genetic code in the DNA of almost every cell of our bodies), and while you have to dig into the Hebrew words behind the English expressions of the \u2018floods\u2019 and \u2018whorls\u2019 that made this world, as one prophet described, this too resonated with our concept of a stars system\u2019s accretion disk, and I see much, much more. But the single greatest thing I\u2019ve found\u2014God is real, immense and powerful beyond comprehension, yet personal and loving and wanting to live with us, even in us, and in all that He has the best interests at heart for each and every individual He has brought life to on this earth. Furthermore, we have a three stage picture of existence: gestation in our mother\u2019s womb, the gestation of a thinking, feeling, human being in this life, and, for those who accept and follow Him, a life unending in the presence of our Creator as members of His family.

I knew a man who was the first to open the 7th scroll of the Nag Hammadi Library (aka The dead Sea Scrolls). It was at my suggestion, that my Professor and Priest, visited the library in Rome where the Roman Tax Scroll, from the Nag Hammadi Library resides. He personally translated the copper scroll and return to Southern California wit the translation. It turned out that the scroll also contained census information provided by Jesus which named his wife and two children. Obviously the information on the scroll contradicts what is contained in the New Testament. Hence, the verification of the fictional account of the life and times of Jesus as found in the New Testament. To truly understand the Bible, one must understand how the New Testament came to be written, and why there are no ancient manuscripts which predate 325 A.D. to support the as published New Testament books! First of all the Roman Emperor required a new religion, of his design, to impose upon the many various pagans of Europe in his planned Romanization and conquest of those several nations. Constantine had prepared for him and outline of the \u2018New Testament\u2019 and when it was to his liking, he provided it to a select few of his prisoners and had them write books which would support the outline. In 325 A.D. Constantine had received the many books and had finally approved them and he held the First Councilof Nicea and imposed it upon all of the various Jesus Churches including the recently created Roman Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Any Church or nation who refused were threatened by war with Rome. Thus Christianity, as we now know it was born of a fictional account of the very amazing Essene Jewish Rabbi, Jesus of Nazareth. This, my friend, is greatest thing we learn from the study and verification of the Bible! I give you My Peace and My Blessings! Storm )O( ",

            "answer_text": "You can learn a whole lot from the bible. It is the only book that has withstood the test of time. The only book that predicts the future 100% of the time. Prophecies foretold hundreds if not thousands of years ago which eventuates exactly as it was predicted all those years ago. It is the only source of which morals and standards of the human race are based on for without it mankind is completely at a loss as evident in the current state of immoral practices throughout the whole world who have chosen to do away with the bible from our schools, families and lives alike. Its teachings have been done away with and the human generations that follow are at a complete loss as far as moral practices and standards portrayed by God the creator himself are lost. As the saying goes\u2026 without the bible, God has been wiped away from our lives and if there is no God, how do you determine what is right and what is not? Without the bible which is the word of God, there is no way of telling whether what you and I do in this world is right or wrong. God clearly wrote his 10 commandments in the bible to guide mankind in the morals of human kind and without the 10 commandments this world is nothing but chaos. Well look around you and what has become of this world. CHAOS and IMMORALITY. Why? The majority of the world have chosen to do away with the bible and the standards that come with it. This is only a fraction of the endless things you can learn from the bible but a crucial lesson nevertheless. So start reading and studying the bible. You will never be the same again. God bless ",

            "answer_text": "Now heres a question that begs the answer, where on earth do I start! Whats the greatest thing we learn from the Bible you say? Ok Tim Im going to opt for \u201cLife\u201d then attempt to explain why. According to both the following scriptures, the Bible as Gods word comes from a source outside of Mankind. 2 Peter 1:20-21 New King James Version (NKJV) 20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, 21 for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. 2 Timothy 3:16 New King James Version (NKJV) 16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. Whats my point you say? Because of the above, I like to call it my \u201cManual for life\u201d Given the complexity of the Universe, theres every reason to believe in there being intelligent design behind it, after all the human eye alone has approximately 2 million moving parts! If there is intelligent design behind both the creation of physical matter and life, then theres every reason to believe that a caring Father which is what God is would leave his children with some means of establishing right from wrong and both explaining our origins and purpose both now and in the here-after. From the Bible I learn about Life on 3 critical levels How Man relates to Man (Man being Mankind)How Mankind relates to GodHow God relates to MankindKnowledge that isn't based on my own perception of reality which can be flawed due to both my limitations and fallen state, enable me to ground my life in the truth and base my decisions around that. Without a manual for life that exists outside of Mankind, each of us are left to our own devices when it comes to establishing absolutes, like Pilate we turn to each other and say \u201cWhat is Truth\u201d The Bible can be likened to a Treasure Trove of principles that remain ageless, principles that we can assimilate, learn from, and put into practice.

            "answer_text": "To answer this, we must go beyond our 21st century thinking and see it from the writer\u2019s point of view. If you do that, you will find some common themes that go right through. The most well known of these is blood but I\u2019ll talk about two others because I\u2019m not convinced about that one really. The first is faith. I mean real faith. Not just the 21st century version but one that changes your life because you depend on the one you have faith in. So you act before you know. This was the greatest sin of \u2018Adam\u2019 - his faith was seriously lacking. He wanted to know before he acted. Therefore he saw the fruit and saw that it looked nice and juicy so he ate. His faith in God didn\u2019t go as far as obeying what God had told him. Noah\u2019s faith trusted that God would keep his word and it made him build a boat. Moses risked his life facing Pharaoh, telling him off, giving him some demands, He then risked a lot of peoples\u2019 lives by leading them into the desert. Very often, he acted before he knew and it changed his own life - and pharaoh\u2019s - and the Egyptians - and the Hebrews. David faced Goliath - long before he knew what would happen. Nathan risked his life by giving David a telling off Elijah faced the prophets of Baal and upset the king and queen. Jeremiah kept telling various kings what was about to happen Daniel risked being thrown to the lions. But I reckon by a miles and miles, the greatest example was Jesus and especially his prayer \u201cNot my will, but yours.\u201d For that put into motion 24 hours of increasing suffering. Arrest, 5 trials (Caiaphas, Annas, Pilate, Herod, Pilate again), all with severe beating. Then an official beating, a crown of thorns (you can try this one at home) and finally a humiliating (naked) excruciating death. Second is love. We don\u2019t touch it today - not like they did. The Hebrew word (or it\u2019s adjective - I\u2019m no linguist) is rather untranslatable but it turns up all through the Hebrew Old Testament and also the Greek New Testament via the Septuagint translation of the Old. In the Old, various versions and various circumstances translate as limitless, loving-kindness, steadfast, faithful, pity, mercy, compassionate, fidelity, covenant, troth, loyalty, pledge, eager, keen, strength and probably others. Into the New Testament it comes out as grace (as do other Hebrew words I think - though I\u2019m not a theologian). I think the broadness of meaning in that word is well known. Think about \u2018covenant love\u2019. It\u2019s a two way thing. Only one side needs to break the covenant and it all goes up in smoke. It\u2019s a promise of fideity and you can\u2019t go go back on it. In those days, you were as good as your word. Whatever you promise, no matter how much it hurts, you keep it. Thus, God did keep his side of the bargain and we then get \u2018steadfast love\u2019. Bacause he was faithful and we were not, we then get \u2018compassionate love\u2019 We talk about love. Ha ha ha - we haven\u2019t a clue. ",

            "answer_text": "I know others have great things to say which are in depth. I am new to the bible and don\u2019t practice it too much. Nevertheless, I can still share with you some new knowledge. Start here Whatever the bible teaches is actually helpful to non religious people. I have been astonished many times at how accurate they are. I will explain it by looking at some of the bible\u2019s 10 commandments with psychological eyes. Do not kill - war veterans will never be able have a good sleep. Maybe they will learn how to cope with it but actually never stop having \u201cthose nightmares\u201d. Killing destroys one\u2019s humanity, at least from what i have heard from serial killers in prison and out. Once a person kills everything becomes boundless. Nothing is as important or joyful. I am talking in terms of criminal activity and not in terms of self defense. Do not steal & cheat (partner) - People who steal will always be worried of other people stealing from them. Same with cheating. The actual cheater will blame the partner constantly for things like \u201c i saw you went here and there for this time, what happened!?\u201d. Nothing may have happened, no single flag but the cheater knows how to cheat and knows how much can happen in 5 minutes. All trust dissolves. Everything that the cheater did, he or she will be afraid of the partner doing it too. Respect your parents - they are a part of you. You are not you by yourself. In better words, they are an extension of you. Whatever you do not like about them you will also do or not like in yourself. If you treat one of them bad, be sure that you will also treat your partner bad. This may depend on the sex of the parent and partner. It is often the case that when a woman disrespects the father, she will also disrespect her boyfriend. Furthermore, parents being an extension of you may also be the cure of your troubles. Whatever you did in your childhood that was wrong can be fixed now in adulthood with your new knowledge. If you fix your relationship with them, whatever it is, it will automatically fix other issues in your life. These issues will be in the same category. If you fix love in your family, your love life will improve. That\u2019s how it goes. Not be jealousy of others - It is often said that in order to improve for the better you must only judge yourself unto who you were yesterday. I think it is well known to everyone how devastating it can be to desire what someone else has. It makes you feel less and makes your life look boring. It also makes you hate what you have and will start to treat it poorly. It hurts your self image and makes you bitter, overall. There are more things that the bible teaches which if explored in depth reveal truths of the human body. No matter how old the bible is, somehow it is still capable to resonate within us. Its as if there are some truths that we will never be able to escape from. Truths that will remain being truth to us, humans. Just the same way that cats do cats stuff, and dogs dog stuff, we humans do human stuff. Our response to certain stimuli, actions and emotions seem to not have changed in 2000 years. To those who are non religions, you may see the bible as a compilation of healthy habits that may leave you to a better life. Bonus: there was this one about tithing. Give 10% of your earnings. There will always be the debate of whether that is a rule anymore but I can tell you something from experience. It hurts giving 10% but it also feels freeing. Its like breaking selfishness by force. Also, it make money feel like nothing. As if money is literary nothing and does not matter. The feeling lasted for a couple of minutes or days, then I had to pay the bills and realized my mistake. Nonetheless, for a moment if felt like the cure to selfishness. ",

They had to memorize it word for word..The religion of Jesus; his 40 commandments, is in authority orderThe first is; \u2018Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\u2019This commandment is supreme in authority above all others..This Commandment 1 makes clear that the vast majority of earthly people are not suitable for Jesus\u2019 religion which we will call \u2018Christianity\u2019 7 : 13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:7: 14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it..It was determined from the creation of your world that Jesus\u2019 religion was for the few, not for the many\u2018Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\u2019It is not for the business person or entrepreneurIt is not for the showman or the extrovert or the outward looking & outgoingIt is not for those naturally brimming with confidenceIt is not for the rich or the wealthy or the successfulJesus\u2019 religion is for slaves..All those people I have just mentioned can, of course, be Christian SupportersIn fact the great majority who call themselves \u2018Christians\u2019 today are not within the religion of Jesus, but are \u2018Christian Supporters\u2019and there is no doubt this will gain them benefit on the other side..But Jesus\u2019 religion is strictly limited and narrowly defined and may only encompass the employee, the subordinate in marriage, the working stiff who will never amount to anything, the drudge, the skivvy, the 9 to 5er whose life appears to go nowhere and never will, the wounded, the ill, the disabled - those so crippled by life they will never rise againJesus religion is for slaves and no-one else gets in..Commandment 1 is supreme in authority.The strutting bantam cocks of Protestantism bellowing out their certainties from the Church lectern, leading by force of personality with mouths of fire are so far outside of Jesus\u2019 religion they will never get in..They must follow Jesus into the lowest Hell and embrace the Lake Of FireThey must look God The Father in the face and account for their attitude and actions throughout their life, minute by minuteHe alone will decide their future and I have no doubt he will be merciful..Best wishes..Blog :-https://www.quora.com/profile/William-E-Milverton/blogs..

            "answer_text": "Dear Tim Webster, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and yours. What is the greatest thing we learn from the Bible? God in the flesh-Jesus the Christ. 1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\u202614The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. So, rather than an unconcern distant God, the Bible message of Christmas is: \u201cI am with you, Immanuel.\u201d Matthew 1:22 \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d John 3:16 I gave myself for you so that you could live forever with me. John 3 Important note: The message that my materialist and atheist friends promote and continually sake to buy into is the hopeless illusion of the \u2018mere appearance\u2019 of design and the Designer that we objectively observe scientifically all around us. Nature selection Richard Dawkins states in- \"What are the five best reasons why there is no god\" | SVT/NRK/Skavlan, shows the appearance of design when it looks like it is designed. Natural selection is Dawkins\u2019 key, the magic bullet that to him dismisses God or any purpose Mind directing existence. This is absolutely against the sciences. Dawkin\u2019s and others make the serious scientific error. Why? Because all existence is information-driven, natural selection produces no required new information, and Dawkins\u2019 uses his mind in the dismissal of God\u2019s Mind is non sequitur argument (a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument or statement). The Designer, God, is the source of the informational language codes that control all of the existence as Dr. Gitt present. \u201cWithout Excuse\u201d by Werner Gitt With his co-authors, information scientist Dr Werner Gitt provides the most rigorous and useful definition of information thus far. He distinguishes this Universal Information (real information) from things often mistakenly called information, and shows how ultimately all biological information comes from God. Gitt's evangelist heart also shines through this academically rigorous work. The author is Werner Gitt, Ph.D., in cooperation with Bob Compton, Ph.D., & Jorge Fernandez, Ph.D. (source, Without Excuse, for education purposes) So, again Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! God has come, given us hope and a future in Jesus. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! This answer is actually really hard. There are many great things that we learn from the Bible, and many are very connected. If I may, I would say that there are three equally great things learned from the Bible. First, man is sinful. Second, God requires death as payment for sin. Third, sacrifice can save us. There will be a TL;DR at the end. Man is Sinful The first is that man is sinful. From the Garden of Eden onward, man just waits for the opportunity to disobey God, to not trust Him, and to follow their own wills. In Genesis 6:5, \u201cThe Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually;\u201d in Genesis 8:21, the Lord promises \u201c\u2018I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth.\u2019\u201d These verses lay it out plainly: men and their hearts are corrupt and evil from their youth. David further noted that this inclination goes all the way back to the womb! Psalm 51:5 records David as saying \u201cI was born in sin, and in iniquity my mother conceived me.\u201d This does not mean that the act of procreation is sinful; if it were, God would not have commanded Adam and Eve to \u201cbe fruitful and multiply\u201d before their sin in the Garden. What else can it mean, then? That man is conceived \u201cin iniquity\u201d and \u201cborn in sin\u201d can only mean that man is born with an inherent, sinful nature. Jeremiah spells it out plainly in 17:9 \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all else and desperately sick. Who can know it?\u201d Isaiah is very descriptive in 64:6 \u201c[A]ll our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.\u201d The Hebrew for \u201cpolluted garment\u201d is ed behged; the phrase is used to refer to used menstrual cloths. Isaiah tells us that our best deeds are like used tampons to God. You may ask: \u201cHow is this great?\u201d The reason this is great is twofold. First, it is great because a difficult truth is always more liberating than a nice lie. Second, it is great because all humans actually want justice, and just punishment is deserved for those who have wronged us. Unfortunately, that means that we will deserve our just punishment. All of this leads us into our next point. God Requires Death as Payment for Sin God is just, and punishes sin justly. From the beginning, He has told us that the just punishment for sin is death. The reason is that sin separates us from God. God is Holy. We tend to think of holy as \u201crighteous\u201d or \u201cgood;\u201d these are certainly part of His character, but they have nothing to do with the word \u201choly\u201d in the Bible. \u201cHoly\u201d in the Bible is the word \u201cqadosh\u201d and comes from \u201cqodesh;\u201d both mean \u201cbeing apart.\u201d Holy, then, means that God is separate, set apart, from us. From the beginning, God bridged that gap between us; we did not. In the Garden, God came and walked with Adam; Adam did not ascend to heaven to be with God. Therefore, separation from God is because of who He is. It is not the only reason, however, that God is set apart from us. Our natural separation from God was twisted and perverted by mankind\u2019s sin. \u201cSin\u201d in Hebrew is \u201cchata\u201d meaning \u201cto miss\u201d or \u201cto go awry.\u201d Man missed God\u2019s standard in Genesis by choosing to disobey Him. From that day, we have been separated by God not only by our nature but by our choices. God is also just. By His nature, He is concerned with justice and righteousness. Here, His righteousness comes into play. As long as Adam kept His command, God could come down to man and be with us. His command, though, came with a penalty for breaking it. That penalty was death. You may ask \u201cWhy death? Why not a more mild punishment, one that fit the crime better?\u201d Because when man is separated from God by sin, God will not bridge that gap unless justice is done; if He did, it would not be just, and therefore He would not be God, and all reality (sustained by Him) would shatter. Separation from God that He will not bridge brings death, decay, and ruin, because it is only by His power that life is sustained. If you cut yourself off from the source of life, then death is the natural consequence. The problem was not eating the fruit. The problem was that eating the fruit constituted voluntary and permanent separation from God; the act of violating God\u2019s command is, in essence, telling God to shove off and leave us alone. God, by His just nature, is willing and able to honor that request. This brings nothing but death. Again, you may ask, why is this great? Well, again, the truth, no matter how distasteful, is more liberating than a lie, no matter how comforting. Now, the third point. God has Allowed Sacrifice to Save Us From the Garden onward, the penalty for sin in the eyes of God was always death of the one who sinned. However, God would, in the case of a repentant person, accept the death of another in their own place. This is known as \u201csubstitutionary sacrifice.\u201d From the first sin, substitution was implemented. Let us observe the Garden of Eden account. God told Adam (who instructed Eve) that they were allowed to eat any fruit and plant that they wanted in the Garden, with one exception. They were not allowed to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. God told them that if they ate of it, on that very day, they would surely die. There were no ifs, ands, or buts about it. They would die. Therefore, when they ate, and God confronted them, their deserved penalty was death. However, they were given a stay of execution, as it were. God instead banished them from the garden. By separating them from the Garden, and the Tree of Life in it, God condemned them to die. Notice, however, what Genesis 3:21 says He did first: \u201cAnd the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.\u201d God clothed them in garments made of skin; this was animal skin, to be precise. Why? Why not let them clothe themselves in hide and leather clothes? Why should God involve Himself in this kind of violent act, clothing them in the skins of the very animals that Adam named and was supposed to care for? Because, the earned payment for sin is, in fact, death. For us to live and draw close to God, something has to die in our place. In other words, there must be a substitutionary sacrifice in order for men to be near to God. Notice the incredibly clear picture at Passover: the angel of death is kept out by a house with the blood of a lamb! \u201cSomething has already died here! There is no need for death in this house!\u201d The soul who sins shall die, but God allows the death of another in their place to fulfill His divine justice. This is great because it gives us hope. We accept the truths of our own sinfulness and God\u2019s holiness; we see exactly how far we are from God. There is nothing that we can do to bridge that gap. However, God has made a way for us to be made close to Him. Christians hold that the sacrifice of animals was intended to foreshadow the Perfect Sacrifice. Enter, Jesus. He was a man; therefore, He knew our sins, our weaknesses, and our temptations first-hand, and He could be the new representative for our race. Adam was the first, and plunged us into sin; Christ was the second, and can now raise us up to God. Moreover, as a man, He could taste death. However, He was also God. This meant that He could do what no other could do: live a perfect and sinless life. His blood could also be effective throughout all of time, both retroactively into the past and forward into the future, for those who trust and have faith in God. Finally, being God meant that He could, in fact, bear the punishment for all sins at all times. No mere human could bear it. As Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians: \u201cHe became sin, who knew no sin, in order that we might become the righteousness of God.\u201d In this way, He fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 53: \u201cBut he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.\u201d TL;DR These three work together to show us that we have no hope in ourselves. God, however, has given us hope. This truth is more liberating than any lie, no matter how comforting. That makes it great. ",

His Word, the Holy Bible, tells us ONE VERY SPECIFIC WAY, to escape satan's power & be reconciled to Him forever! But, secular-religions often claim to be Christian but definitely are NOT & dictates the way to BECOME Christian is through their particular church membership, going through their rituals, attendance to their class on becoming Christian, praying to statues or entities or persons who are not our Creator, tithing 10%, regular church attendance & participation, doing good things for others, etc., etc., etc. KNOW that any church, temple, \u201choly\u201d place or other, IS NOT actual Christian, when, to BECOME Christian, is dependent on \u201cOUR WORKS\u201d or doing, doing, doing, or \u201cperforming good things\u201d or being a \u201cgood person.\u201d There is but \u201cONE VERY SPECIFIC WAY\u201d to become actual Christian, according to our Father-God's Word & it's NEVER-EVER about \u201cour works\u201d or earning it, or \u201ccleaning up our act before going to God,\u201d or us \u201cgetting right with God\u201d or anyother works or doing! And, that ONE VERY SPECIFIC WAY instructs us to go DIRECTLY to Our Father-God, alone & just as we are, sins & all! He knows our every sin & our every thought & the deep-seated desires & intentions of our heart! He knows our every secret & exactly who we are! He knows when we don't want to sin anymore, but long for a new life. He knows if we have DECIDED to trust Him & His Word: that sin has an extreme price we cannot possibly pay, so Jesus, our Lord & Saviour, laid His life down just for us, & died a horrific death in our place, & defeated satan's power over us, was raised from the dead on the third day in His body, healed & perfected and glorified. So now we go to Him TO TALK WITH HIM about these things! And, pour our hearts out to Him, in our own words, \u201cFather-God in heaven, thank You for being the God that You are! I want to talk with You about being reconciled to You: I invite You into my heart to Save me from my every sin; to guide, direct & protect me through my new life with You; bless me with great trust in You & with Your wisdom & understanding! I trust Your Word, that Jesus is my Lord & Saviour; I trust that He died in my place to Save me from my sins, was raised from the dead on the third day in His body, healed & perfected and glorified! I trust Your Word, that I am now Saved & reconciled to You forever! Thank You Lord Jesus! Thank You Father-God! In Jesus name, amen!\u201d That's It! A simple 3 minute talk with our Father-God! Saved by HIS WORKS on the cross & NOT by \u201cour works!\u201d So NOW WHAT? Now \u201cour works\u201d kick-in! Works to accomplish our new life, living as we should & to accomplish our God-send purpose & mission in life, and under His Authority & love-power! ",

However there are great lessons you can learn aswell like forgiveness, staying humble, respecting your parents, loving god before anyone, being faithful to your spouse, woman respecting there husbands while a husband is supposed to protect wife and treat her like something delicate. The bible is a long long book that should bring peace to you and motivate you to be kind and be a servant to others . What you learn from it will be your personal lessons because everyone is different. ",

            "answer_text": "God comes to this world by entering a deserving devotee existing on this earth called as SON OF GOD to become human incarnation of God. The original God is unimaginable, and invisible. Such God enters an energetic form in the upper world and is called FATHER OF HEAVEN. This Father of heaven enters to a deserving devotee existing on the earth to become SON OF GOD or HUMAN INCARNATION OF GOD. Thus Jesus was such SON OF GOD to whom FATHER OF HEAVEN ENTERED for the mission of divine knowledge propagation in this world. Whoever has seen alive Jesus that time had seen Father of heaven only, this is the only way for human beings here, when any human being meeting present SON OF GOD he had seen the Father of heaven. This was the reason why Jesus told to Peter that when he had seen Jesus he had verily seen Father of heaven only. Let us analyse in detail these divine knowledge. The energetic incarnation in which unimaginable God merged is meant by the word \u2018Father\u2019. Son means the human being component selected by Father in which the Father gets merged and such son is called as human incarnation or Son of God. Since the unimaginable God exists in both Father and Son, both are one and the same because anything done by Father and Son must be the same due to the same common unimaginable God. Hence, there is no difference between Father and Son since both are the incarnations of unimaginable God only. Both are like the two hands doing the same work and two legs walking in the same direction. Jesus is the human incarnation like cotton shirt and the divine Father of heaven is the energetic incarnation like silk shirt of the same person called unimaginable God. Jesus says that the Son of God (Himself) will judge the souls and not the Father. The meaning of this statement is that though Father and Son are one and the same, you have to call the mediated unimaginable God by the name of the Son of God only since the Son of God (human incarnation) is relevant to this humanity and not the Father (energetic incarnation), who is relevant to the energetic souls present in the upper world only. When a person staying in the state of Tamilnadu says \u2018our chief minister\u2019, he is only referring the chief minister of the state of Tamilanadu only and not the chief minister of Orissa though both are the same chief ministers only. When you are staying in a state, the chief minister of that state is only relevant to you to approach for any grievance and not the chief minister of other state. This statement reveals only the stress of relevance of human incarnation for the humanity. The human being believing the human incarnation is always blessed by the absolute God, who exists in that very human incarnation only and such devotee crosses over from death to life. Here death means the state in which God is forgotten (Ref.: Sanat Sujitiyam of Mahabharata) and life means the state in which God is always remembered. It is crossing over the worldly bonds to reach bond with God. The believer in the human incarnation participates in the propagation of the knowledge of human incarnation and such a divine servant will not be judged in the upper world since his/her file will be kept inactive in cold storage. Other ordinary souls are judged and dispatched to the concerned upper worlds like heaven and hell as per the judicial inquiry of the file of the soul. Luke\u201414:26 to 27 \u201cIf any one comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple\u2019\u2019. The knowledge is compared to a sword. Bhagavatgita says \u201cChhitva Jnanasinatmanah\u201d. This means that the ignorance should be cut by the knowledge, which is like a sword. The bonds with wife or husband and children are due to ignorance. Such bonds should break when the Lord in human form competes with them to conduct His test. Lord comes in human form in every human generation to preach and give His direct presence. If the Lord comes in only one human generation, God becomes partial to that human generation because other human generations are not blessed with such opportunity. To see, to touch, to talk and to live with the human incarnation, He comes down as per the prayers of the devotees. The Lord comes to preach and so He will not enter the statues or animals or birds. Veda says \u201cNa tasya pratima asti\u2019\u2019 which means that God will not enter the inert statues. Gita says \u201cManusheem tanu masritam\u201d which means that God enters the human body only because the main purpose is to preach the human beings. Gita strongly says that he who worships the inert statues will be born as an inert stone (\u201cBhootani yanti\u201d). The Christians should be commended on this point who are worshipping the Holy Jesus only, who is the most powerful human incarnation of God. Veda says \u201cNa tat samah\u201d which means that nobody and nothing should be equal to the Lord in human incarnation. One should leave everything and everybody for the sake of the Lord in human form. Only the bond with a new human being can break the bond with the human beings. Such new human being must be very powerful who can be only God in human form. A new bond existing with formless God or statues cannot break the human bonds. Only the bond with another living being can cut the bond with the living beings. The bond with formless God is impossible. The bond with inert statue has no use. The above statements of Holy Jesus indicate that one should cut the bonds with his family and with the wealth. In Hindu religion also it is said that God (Datta) cuts all the bonds of family and wealth (\u201cDattam Chinnam\u201d). Even the bond with the body should be cut for the sake of the God. Gita says the same thing as \u201cMat Gata Pranah\u201d. Holy Jesus says that one has to carry his own cross (death) for the sake of the Lord. This means that one has to invite his own death with his own hands for the sake of God. Holy Jesus did like this as an ideal example for others. This means that you have to cut your bonds not only with your family and wealth but also with your life if necessary. Hanuman, a top devotee, tore his heart with his own nails for the sake of the Lord and was blessed by the Lord to be immortal. So when the devotee sacrifices his life, his life gets protected forever. The essence of this gospel is that the love is proved only by the practical sacrifice. Veda says \u201cDhanena Tyage nyke\u2026\u201d which means that sacrifice of money proves the real love. Money is the fruit of the work. So money is another form of work. If it is inconvenient to sacrifice the money, atleast they should sacrifice the other form of money, which is work for the sake of God. Depending on the money all the family members are attached to you. If money is not there all the family will leave you. You are also giving the money to your family only. Therefore if the bond with money is cut and if the money is sacrificed to God, the family bonds are considered as vanished, even though the family exists externally. The work of God in human form is the propagation of His divine gospel. For doing such divine work the family also stands as an obstacle because most of your energy is diverted for the family only. Therefore you do not have any energy to work for the sake of Lord. Hence Holy Jesus wants His disciples to leave their families for the sake of God. The propagation work needs both money and work. Generally every body works to maintain his family. In the name of maintenance, several luxuries are introduced, which look like essential needs and thus there is no end for your work to earn the money for the sake of your body and your family. Your blindness increases and you will be putting more and more efforts to work and earn money for the sake of the family bonds. In such a case you can never even see the human form of God. At least you should remove your blindness by the divine knowledge if not the actual bonds. People of very high devotion only can cut the actual bonds. You are giving money to your family but you are giving words to God by prayers and you are giving mind to God through meditation. You are giving love to your family through your work and money, you are calling the sacrifice of words and sacrifice of mind as love to God and you are fooling the God. Your real love is only with your family and not with the God. Holy Jesus tests your real love to God by these statements. The Christian Pope and fathers and the Hindu Acharya and saints left their families and concentrated completely on the work of God. Such pious souls can only be representatives of God in this world.

Ephesians 2: 1And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 3Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. 4But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.

For God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believe in Him shall not perish, but have Everlasting Life. This verse has everything in the Bible that the basic Christian needs to get started with his faith. \u201cFor God\u2026\u201d God is out there. He is in our lives, and He created everything. \u201c\u2026So loved the World\u2026\u201d God loves us.

It is through belief in God and his Son that earns us our salvation. \u201c\u2026That whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have Everlasting Life.\u201d God has given us a chance to live with him for All of Eternity. We don't have to worry about what is in store for us after death, because if we believe in God and Jesus\u2019 act of love, we will be with God in heaven. This is also a call to action. Call people to Him. Help them believe in God and what Jesus did for us. Evangelize. Be the Light in other people a lives, so that they can see that, in a world full of darkness, things may not be so bleak. We still have an eternity of a perfect heaven to look forward to.

            "answer_text": "A lesson comprised of these essential points: 1.) God is. 2.) God is holy/righteous/good/just/pure. Thus sin is intolerable. 3.) We are none of that and have sin nature. He can\u2019t overlook it, and we can\u2019t knock it off. 4.) Given his nature, which seems rather extreme/immense to us, that paves the way for dreadful consequences. And our souls are thought to be immortal, after the body is gone. 5.) God loved us enough to provide a full payment for our sin debt, that we might choose to come, accept it and be made a part of his family. \u2018Saved,\u2019 reconciled\u2026 6.) It\u2019s the most important choice one can make in life. 7.) It\u2019s not just about a \u2018get out of Hell free\u2019 card. In a parable of a king (representing God) holding a feast for the wedding on his son (representing Christ), when the expected guests (many Jews) wouldn\u2019t come, too tied up with earthly affairs, the invite went out very broadly (the Gentiles). But they were expected to wear a \u2018wedding garment\u2019 (likely provided by the King, since people wouldn\u2019t have been roaming the land in them). A guy didn\u2019t do it, the King was offended and had him bound and cast out (which seems to represent Hell). Sounds like the guy came just to mooch, not participate. There\u2019s also Christ\u2019s warning about diving the sheep and the goats, I think to be considered in light of another Scripture that you will know a tree by its fruit. 8.) A related lesson is that the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and mind, and the second is like it, to love thy neighbor as thyself. I add this because it is very important, and knowing it seems key to pleasing/served God, which is a very good idea to do. So, I\u2019d wrap the most important lesson of the Bible up that way. ",

            "answer_text": "I strongly believe that greatest that we have learned from the scripture and also been able to experience is that the Divine Life and the relationship of Sonship of God lost by Adam resulting into alienation from God can be re-gained because of Jesus Christ. And now, not only that we learned about the above from the scripture alone, but that we can actually have it restored by a absolute reBIRTH in our soul to that point that we begin to experience that HOLY nature of God even here on earth and have a communion with God through His spirit . To the point that for such one that have come into the reality of this knowledge, such is able to not experience communion with God by the Holy Spirit, we are also able to influence every area of our lives with that life which is consistent with the characteristic attribute of God as a spirit. In summary, I think the most important thing I have learned is the revelation of John 1:12; that we can restored from the state of utter perdition through the inherited sinful nature of Adam to inheriting the life of the Sons of God and be reconciled to God such that we are able to be repositioned again into the perfect plan of God for Adam prior to his fall is almost unexplainable; and one that the lifespan of man on earth cannot be enough to explain. This further explains it:But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2Corinthians 3:18 God bless you!

            "answer_text": "The Bible is in fact a great way to learn to be a Christian. The Old Testament gives you an account of how the the world was created and how humanity is separate from all life on earth. The New Testament is the part that the word \u201cChristian\u201d comes from. It\u2019s what separates us from The Jewish Orthodox and other Religions formed from the argued oral history written in the Old Testament. Christ Jesus is of the holy trinity; the Father, son and the Holy Ghost. Jesus is the living embodiment of the creator. He is the bench mark to what we try to emulate; a North Star. The Father is the creator; a uncomprehendable power that needs the Human embodiment \u201cJesus\u201d to be understood. The Spirit is what was given to humanity as a connection to the creator and separates us from all other life. As a Christian, I look to the words in Red as words that challenge me to choose wisely in day to day life and daily choices I make. Jesus gave us first hand accounts and many parables to help guide your steps. We are flawed and can never choose the perfect bracket of life but, and this is the key, if we believe that Christ came to teach us how to live life according to the Creators vision for us and that he is our guiding star that is always true, we will find grace. We also believe that because we are not perfect and will get of course (born sinners) and that on our own we will never find the Creator, in this life or the next, Jesus had to make the ultimate sacrifice so that we could understand that until death, we need to follow him to be in the presence of our creator. The Bible in its entirety, gives us the creation, the struggles of humanity being separated from our creator and the impossible task of finding our way back on our own. It also gives us first hand accounts of a people chosen to represent what life is like when you live in faith of the Creators path and not man kind or nature. We watch as that people shifted from total faith in the Devine and the life that can be had from that, to the slow slip to faith in man. Psalms 118:8. The Bible also gives us a stories of individual people, real historical people and those of parables, and their journeys so we can understand what consequences come from choices we make. I believe that all of our lives are filled with small choices to live with faith in the life our creator has made for us or faith in ourselves in pursuit of what we think is important. Studying the Bible helps choose faith in the creator more times than humanity and being a Christian is that we know we will never choose correctly every time, we trust in the Christ to keep us on the right path. Like following the North Star, it\u2019s not each step that matters because sometimes we choose the step poorly but as long as you have the guiding star dialled in, you will get to your destination.

On 16 December 1967 i and my dear wife Alicia (Scottish for \u201ctruth\u201d, Greek \u2018aletheia\u201d) were sitting at a gathering of some 5,000 people at a religious gathering when the speaker said: \u201cIf the government is right or wrong does not matter:- what matters is that you should trust the government.\u201d A bolt of \u201cspiritual lightning\u201d (because only i could hear it) saying: \u201cdo not trust trust deceiving words\u201d saying - 3xtimes [the Lords will it is] struck me and a became a zombie/robot for 9 days. On 25 December, 2-o\u2019clock the morning, laying asleep on a concrete slab, the family mad at me because i was behaving mad, a voice woke me and said: \u201cI give my peace to my beloved even in the sleep\u201d! Later on i found that the words \u201cdo not trust trust deceiving words\u201d came from the desert prophet Jeremiah. After that i became a desert wanderer, meandering in a desert from one plant and animal to another, studying how they managed to live in such a harsh environment. In total i have covered some 16,000km (10,000mi) in semi and full deserts. One of beauties of a desert is that it is free or clean from human meddling and pollution. That is the second greatest thing that i have learned. The greatest thing which i have learned is to follow an authentic leader to became self one. Being alone in a desert is sheer madness to boast to plants and animals \u201cSee how wonderful i am\u201d. Through the books i have met in spirit some wonderful desert wanderers like Friedrich Ritter, Alfred Lau, Curt Backeberg, Herman Jacobson and John Lavranos. I always wonder what Jesus did from 12 years old (initiation) to his first public appearance (about 30 years). The Judean desert begin some 15 miles from Jerusalem. The Dead Sea with its cliffs of rock on the western side is some 40 miles east (2 days walk). If you can, dear reader, read all which is possible on the Dead Sea scrolls because from them we learn that the bible is not a unreliable story book of people who cannot be trusted. After another 30years of meandering through many university libraries, I have come to the conclusion that religions (and not merely Christianity or Judaism) are our best sources for information and support against the onslaught of people who use money and war to gain control over people. The last openly religious president, formerly an anti-religious communist, was: Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (18 July 1918 \u2013 5 December 2013) With care and best wishes \u2014 At (Adriaan) ",

            "answer_text": "Bible is ready throughout the globe by millions and billions of people over centuries. Biblical religions bases their philosophy and beliefs on this book. Why? Because there are words to encourage people. Same applies to Buddhism. Hundreds of sutras exist. The words of Sakyamuni or Gautama Buddha are passed down with these sutras. God and Buddha, sages and saints are still worshipped by millions and billions of people around the world. In the world of scientific reasoning, these religions may be considered as unevidenced doctrine but its a tendency of the people with education and logic reasoning to rely on supernatural powers because we want to believe such a thing. Then, what is the difference between ancient or primal religions that some of the indigenous people believe and what modern people believe? For example, Christianity and Voodoo? High tier religions have doctrines and supporting philosophies. Low tiers do not have philosophies or doctrines. So what? To the believers, these things do not matter. The common factor among the religions, however, is the words of empowerment. They all encourage people or followers. Bible or Buddha\u2019s sutras, all teach the philosophy or guidelines that enlightens the people with encouragements. They have been the light that guided the lives of millions of people. After having said this, the Bible tells the story of the people who beheld the beliefs overcoming the slanders and achieved the breakthrough of the wall of hardships to reach the goal of life. Strangely enough, similar stories, almost identical, are told in Buddhism. After all, people believe in religions that tell what they want to hear which is the inspiring words of wisdom. As an individual person, there are many things you can learn from the Bible as well as the sutras though I am a Buddhist and I believe in Buddhism. But I attended Catholic school so I am writing whatever I know and think, and I think religion is the facet to enable us to expand our prowess and develop our virtues. Hope this answers ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is a manmade collection of a variety of \u201carticles\u201d written over centuries by many authors with different objectives. Some are simply attempts to record history as perceived by certain authors at certain times. Much of the early content was a revision of pre Christian pagan beliefs. Others are documented attemps by religious leaders to manipulate and indoctrinate followers into their beliefs. Some of this was done with good intentions to improve the lives of followers and some of it was to gain political and other power over followers by sheer brutal fear mongering by claiming divine knowledge over matters of life and death. The Bible has been revised many times in the past to suit the objectives of rulers and religious leaders at the time. Modern versions tend to \u201csanitise\u201d the Bible by removing some of the incredibly cruel and brutal imperatives that followers were expected to adhere to to show that they were loyal followers. Many of the rituals recorded are based on various sacrifices etc that were necessary to prove faith in God including aspects of canabalism such as the Eucharist where wine and bread are consumed as symbols of the body of Christ etc. Modern analysis of the Bible often explains the barbaric and cruel practices recorded in it as being metaphorical or allegorical. To answer the question, I would say that the Bible contains much that we can learn about the history, behaviour and beliefs of humans since pagan times. Much of what is in it explains many of the cultures and traditions and beliefs we see today. ",

            "answer_text": "I am only able to share what I've personally learned from the Bible, through fellowship (friendship) with God; it would dawn on me while reading the New Testament. I had read the gospels several times yet hadn\u2019t yet discovered what I was personally missing, not seeing or grasping. Each time I read them, I would interpret them as how I was personally supposed to feel - as how I was \u2018supposed\u2019 to personally perceive God. It would finally, after many years, dawn on me through Holy Spirit, to pay attention to the words; the gospel \u201caccording\u201d to\u2026 Upon that dawning, for me, my heart went to its knees and wept. It still does, joyfully. All the years I was trying to think, feel, and act (live) like I \u2018thought' I was suppose to \u2018act\u2019 according to what \u2018others\u2019 personally experienced and I would completely ignore my own feelings and experiences and instead try to live and view life exactly as I\u2019d read in the scriptures; along with being \u2018taught\u2019 (by various church members over the decades) that we were all hopeless unworthy sinners, not worthy of God our Father\u2019s (Creator\u2019s) love. I ended up doing this for many long miserable years, living in emotional pain (at times agony), until God Himself opened my eyes, heart and mind. I share objectively without any ill intent or anger. It is one thing to read about God, it is quite another to befriend God and fellowship (friendship) with Him daily - every moment of one's life. It wasn't until I went directly to God on my own that my eyes, heart and mind would be opened and my life would begin for the very first time at 64, and, while living humbly in a van. \u201cWe are all, each and every one, Loved by God.\u201d More is shared on my profile page.",

            "answer_text": "That God is Love. In the Old covenant, there were actions taken that some question, out of ignorance of the reason. When Noah\u2019s flood occurred some question why innocent children were taken. The blood line was polluted by the fallen angels taking wives of the human women, fathering both giants and simply polluted beings that were mixed. In addition, those that were not mixed were offered place on the ark, right up to the closing of the door. God doesn\u2019t just Love, He is love. As Abraham prospered, both in material wealth and spiritual understanding, so God wants us to prosper in like fashion. Abraham was very willing to do whatever God asked of Him, and that is why he is our example of obedience. Obedience is better than sacrifice. But as well He fully appreciates our praise! The Gospel was preached unto those in the Old Covenant and today it means the same; the gospel to the poor is you do not need to be poor anymore. The gospel to the sick or maimed is healing has been bought and paid for, so take it! The gospel to the bound, whether by addiction or simple engrossed in sin, all has been paid for, repent and take your freedom. All care can be given to Christ, by His invitation. By the sacrifice of Jesus and His resurrection, all is available today. Take it, This is the greatest lesson of the Bible. ",

Knowing His Love and everything that comes with it, is beyond anything I can and will know in this life. Having Jesus walk with you daily, come what may\u2026.. He said \u201cNever will I leave you or give up on you.\u201d And He never has because He can see far far more than I can even comprehend with my mortal limits. Love. 1 Corinthians 13 English Standard Version (ESV) The Way of Love 13 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned,[a] but have not love, I gain nothing. 4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;[b] 6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. 13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. This is my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "For me the greatest thing I have learnt from reading The Bible is that God has not given up on mankind even though the majority living in the modern world has given up on Him! God has a plan to redeem mankind, that is what the Gospel teaches. It is the Good News! There is hope in this world for all who put their trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior. When this world comes to the end-time destruction there is a new one all prepared in God\u2019s plan, for those who have put all their trust in Him. Revelation Chapter 21 1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. 2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God. 4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. 5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. 6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. 7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm. What an interesting question. Everything I can think of comes back to one thing: Love. God\u2019s love for us and how He wants us to love each other (And Himself). The trouble is, most of us don\u2019t understand what love is. It\u2019s such a complex thing that the Greek\u2019s had FOUR words for it: Agapeo: Unconditional love; the love of God for mankind. This is an ACTION kind of love, as in \u201cFor God so loved the world\u2026.\u201d John 3:16 It is also a sacrificial type of love, doing whatever is necessary for the best interest of the loved one. Phileo: Love between friends. This answer taken from Greek Agape, Phileo, Eros, Storge It would probably be helpful if phileo were never translated \"love\" in the New Testament, because it refers to a strong liking or a strong friendship. Of course, we see how phileo gets translated \"love,\" because in modern culture we say we \"love\" things that we strongly like: \"I love ice cream,\" \"I love my car,\" \"I love the way your hair looks,\" etc. The word phileo implies a strong emotional connection, and thus is used of the \"love,\" or deep friendship, between friends. You can agape your enemies, but you cannot phileo them. The difference between agape and phileo becomes very clear in John 21:15, but unfortunately it is obscured in almost all English translations. After being raised from the dead, Jesus met Peter. Here is the short version of what they said to each other: Jesus: Simon\u2026do you love (agape) me more than these [fish?]. Peter: Yes, Lord; you know that I love (phileo) you.  Jesus: Simon\u2026do you\u2026love (agape) me?  Peter: Yes, Lord, you know that I love (phileo) you.  Jesus: Simon\u2026do you love (phileo) me?  Peter: [Grieved] \"Lord\u2026you know that I love (phileo) you.\" In this example, you can clearly see how using the simple word \"love\" has obscured the true deeper meaning of their conversation. Eros: The sense of being in love; romantic love The meaning is obvious. Is often mistaken for lust. <wry grin> Been there, done that, especially when a teenager. Storge: Love of family; Parent/child, siblings, cousins, etc. In a very close family, agape is felt as well. Storge can also exist between husbands and wives in strong marriages, helping them survive the slings and arrows of life. So, between the four Greek words for love, we can see all that love can be, and all that we are intended to know of love. And God IS Love. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "What is the greatest thing we can learn from the Bible? Well, lets start with the central point and work our way outwards. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Everything before Christ pointed towards His coming and everything that happened after Christ pointed back to Him. Why is this important? Well lets go back to the garden. God wanted us to have a loving relationship with Him. In order for love to exist there has to be free will and self sacrifice. That is why Adam and Eve were given the choice of whether or not to sin by eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. God foreknew they would sin so He foreordained a redemptive plan. That plan for humanities redemption came through Christ\u2019s birth, life, sacrifice on the cross, and Resurrection. We can learn everything we need to know about God and His attributes by looking at and examining Christ. We have our redemption, grace, mercy, love , and truth all because of this sacrifice God made for us. All of the Bible is important, but it all hinges on Jesus Christ being born according to scripture, living according to scripture, dying according to scripture and being raised from the dead according to scripture.

            "answer_text": "The Bible is a collection of Christian texts that is the result of refinement by men who thought they were led by God to discern his teachings. The early Christian world was diverse and everyone had a different take on the Gospel of Jesus. These disagreements were \u201csettled\u201d in large meetings of high ranking priests called \u201cCouncils.\u201d The Council of Hippo (one of the African Synods) drew up a collection of texts, which is now the Catholic Bible (including a class of texts I as a Protestant would call Apocrypha), in 393 AD. St. Jerome is credited with creating the Old Latin Vulgate, which was the outcome of the African Synods and was used as the Bible for centuries. The Bible is an unreliable authority because it contains numerous contradictions. Logically, if two statements are contradictory, at least one of them is false. The biblical contradictions therefore prove that the book has many false statements and is not infallible. Examples of Old Testament Contradictions The contradictions start in the opening chapters of the Bible, where inconsistent creation stories are told. Genesis chapter 1 says the first man and woman were made at the same time, and after the animals. But Genesis chapter 2 gives a different order of creation: man, then the animals, and then woman. Genesis chapter 1 lists six days of creation, whereas chapter 2 refers to the \u201cday that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\u201d Genesis 1:2-3 claims that God created light and divided it from darkness on the first day; but Genesis 1:14-19 tells us the sun, moon, and stars weren\u2019t made until the fourth day. Chapter 1 reports that the fruit trees were created before the man, while chapter 2 indicates they were made after him. Genesis 1:20 says the fowl were created out of the waters; Genesis 2:19 alleges they were formed from the ground. Contradictions are also seen in the biblical story of a worldwide flood. According to Genesis 6:19-22, God ordered Noah to bring \u201cof every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort . . . into the ark.\u201d Nevertheless, Genesis 7:2-3 relates that the Lord ordered Noah to take into the ark the clean beasts and the birds by sevens, and only the unclean beasts by twos. Genesis 8:4 reports that, as the waters of the flood receded, Noah\u2019s ark rested on the mountains of Ararat in the seventh month. The very next verse, however, says the mountaintops could not be seen until the tenth month. Genesis 8:13 describes the earth as being dry on the first day of the first month. But Genesis 8:14 informs us the earth was not dry until the twenty-seventh day of the second month. The Old Testament contains an interesting contradiction in the story of the census taken by King David and the resulting punishment of the Israelites. God was so angered by the census that he sent a plague that killed 70,000 men. According to II Samuel 24:1, the Lord had caused David to take the census \u2013 which makes the punishment appear even more nonsensical. But an attempt was later made, at I Chronicles 21:1, to improve God\u2019s image by claiming that Satan incited the census. Further, the Old Testament is contradictory as to whether the Lord commanded the Israelites to sacrifice animals to him. At Jeremiah 7:22, God denies he ever gave the Israelites commandments about animal sacrifices. In contrast, Exodus 29:38-42 and many other verses depict God as requiring the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices. Examples of New Testament Contradictions In the New Testament, there are contradictions between the genealogies of Jesus given in the first chapter of Matthew and the third chapter of Luke. Both genealogies begin with Jesus\u2019 father, who is identified as Joseph (which is curious, given that Mary was supposedly impregnated by the Holy Ghost). But Matthew says Joseph\u2019s father was Jacob, while Luke claims he was Heli. Matthew lists 26 generations between Jesus and King David, whereas Luke records 41. Matthew runs Jesus\u2019 line of descent through David\u2019s son Solomon, while Luke has it going through David\u2019s son Nathan. The story of Jesus\u2019 birth is also contradictory. Matthew 2:13-15 depicts Joseph and Mary as fleeing to Egypt with the baby Jesus immediately after the wise men from the east had brought gifts. But Luke 2:22-40 claims that after the birth of Jesus, his parents remained in Bethlehem for the time of Mary\u2019s purification (which was 40 days, under the Mosaic law). Afterwards, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem \u201cto present him to the Lord,\u201d and then returned to their home in Nazareth. Luke mentions no journey into Egypt or visit by wise men from the east. Concerning the death of Judas, the disloyal disciple, Matthew 27:5 states he took the money he had received for betraying Jesus, threw it down in the temple, and \u201cwent and hanged himself.\u201d To the contrary, Acts 1:18 claims Judas used the money to purchase a field and \u201cfalling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.\u201d In describing Jesus being led to his execution, John 19:17 recounts that he carried his own cross. But Mark 15:21-23 disagrees by saying a man called Simon carried the cross. As for the crucifixion, Matthew 27:44 tells us Jesus was taunted by both criminals who were being crucified with him. But Luke 23:39-43 relates that only one of the criminals taunted Jesus, the other criminal rebuked the one who was doing the taunting, and Jesus told the criminal who was defending him, \u201cToday shalt thou be with me in paradise.\u201d Regarding the last words of Jesus while on the cross, Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34 quote Jesus as crying with a loud voice, \u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d Luke 23:46 gives his final words as, \u201cFather, into thy hands I commend my spirit.\u201d John 19:30 alleges the last words were, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d There are even contradictions in the accounts of the resurrection \u2013 the supposed event that is the very foundation of the Christian religion. Mark 16:2 states that on the day of the resurrection, certain women arrived at the tomb at the rising of the sun. But John 20:1 informs us they arrived when it was yet dark. Luke 24:2 describes the tomb as open when the women arrived, whereas Matthew 28:1-2 indicates it was closed. Mark 16:5 declares that the women saw a young man at the tomb, Luke 24:4 says they saw two men, Matthew 28:2 reports they saw an angel, and John 20:11-12 claims they saw two angels. Also in the resurrection stories, there are contradictions as to the identity of the women who came to the tomb,[7] whether the men or angels the women saw were inside or outside the tomb,[8] whether the men or angels were standing or sitting,[9] and whether Mary Magdalene recognized the risen Jesus when he first appeared to her.[10] As a final example of a New Testament contradiction, the conflicting accounts of Paul\u2019s conversion can be cited. Acts 9:7 states that when Jesus called Paul to preach the gospel, the men who were with Paul heard a voice but saw no man. According to Acts 22:9, however, the men saw a light but didn\u2019t hear the voice speaking to Paul. The foregoing examples are just a few of the hundreds of contradictions contained in the Old and New Testaments. Each contradiction is an instance where at least one of the verses is wrong. Thus, hundreds of contradictions mean there are at least hundreds of incorrect statements in the Bible. ",

All the souls upon it were happily learning the Mysteries of God. And things were of a peaceful nature. Then through treachery there was a fall with tremendous impact on the entire solar system. Now we switch to the New Testament. Because of that treachery the makeup of the Earth's Heavens were affected and mankind was being born without any inner sight, incapable of advancing.Then we learn the greatest truth of the Bible. God sacrificed through the wonderous master what was required to defeat satanic influences. This sacrifice is not always understood especially by casual observation. However, God did sacrifice Himself. He could have easily dismantled the Solar System much to the detriment of all the children on Earth. Or He could have righted the Earth resulting in the saving of the advanced souls here, however the intense affect would have annihilated the younger souls, so that didn't happen. So the greatest thing we learn from the Bible is God's love for all mankind. That He made the sacrifice of Himself and mankind was freed inwardly and now able to respond to His calling. ",

Understanding that relationship is foundational to every other truth God has ever revealed in the Bible, The Book of Mormon, or any other book of scripture. It is because God is our Father and we are his children and that he loves us and wants to help us that everything else God has revealed really matters. Why pray? Because God is our Father and we are his children and he loves us and wants to communicate with and help us. Why obey God\u2019s commandments? Because God is our Father and we are his children and he loves us and wants to help us, therefore he gives us commandments and asks us to obey them. Why did God send Jesus Christ to suffer and die for us so we can receive salvation? Because God is our Father and we are his children and he loves us and wants us to be able to return and dwell with him again. It goes on and on. The first thing anyone needs to understand about God is who he is and who we are. Everything else builds on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Start with John 13:34,35. Love is the greatest thing we learn. To love others rather than merely oneself is essential to a fruitful and pleasant life. This love is called Agape in Greek. This is best demonstrated by John 3:16. Agape love is selfless: meaning we treasure the successes and goodness of others. Consider how a mother loves her children throughout their lives. It is also sacrificial as demonstrated by Jesus dying on the Cross as the way of salvation for everyone whether Jew or gentile, regardless of color, culture, nationality or station in life(rich, or poor, king or slave). It is also unconditional as in your mother may discipline you to teach you right frrom wrong, but she forgives your wrongs. It isn\u2019t just about feelings as in other types of love, it requires us to get involved with others in this life and do good towards them. Beyond this is our love of God as enumerated in the first four commandments and our fellow man demonstrated by the last six. Deuteronomy 6:5 (the Shema) commands us to love God with all our heart and soul. All of what the Bible teaches is the importance of being a loving person and by definition doing good. ",

Morality existed prior. A god impregnating a human and creating a demi god existed prior. There is nothing really unique about the Bible as far as religious literature goes. It is a collection of oral stories written down after generations of being told and changed and letters from Paul to various churches telling them what he thinks. Like other religious texts, we learn a little about the cultures of the people involved but we have to weed out the truth from the allegory. It is a history book but like all history books it is told from the perspective of the winners. Do you think the Canaanites would tell the same story about the Israelites for example? Are there some good messages in the Bible? Absolutely but they are not unique to the Bible and there are plenty of bad messages as well ( also not unique to the Bible). ",

            "answer_text": "Besides how gullible people can be I assume. The Bible and those using it had a lot more power then they do today. The reason is that in the earlier centuries few could read so the ability to question what was written was limited. Only select scholars could actually read the original writings. Thus priests were able to get away with their little scam. The true origins of the bible are interesting and anyone can read them if they are interested. What the Bible does offer is a glimpse into the past. As any book does it offers a showing of how people spoke and saw the world around them. There are many literature themes that become popular before fading into the background and the bible contains many stories that show the kind of world that existed then. For example many stories were written when war instead of peace was considered better. This is a side effect of the very limited lifespans that people had. For a more recent example of trends consider how about 100 to 200 years ago there was many books about the center of the world while there being very few new stories about the subject. Many thought the Earth must be secretly hollow but eventually the truth was discovered and these kind of stories faded. The Bible is of times long past. We can learn from the mistakes recorded such as how slavery and war was fought then. However treating it as a holy document is no longer a good thing because the morality of today is far past what it was during the time that the Bible was written. ",

It details his continued love even after the rebellion in Eden. [1] He did this by making provisions for the future end to the corruption and a freeing of the children of Adam to the curse he took upon himself at his rebellion. In the last book, Revelation, there is a scene where those in heaven honor Jehovah God. (Revelation 4:11) 11\u202f\u201cYou are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.\u201dIt was because of his love that he began creating, expanding the number of beings that could enjoy, first to the realm of the spiritual heavens, then for those who would enjoy life in the physical realms.

We rob ourselves if we get overly focused on His omnipotence/omniscience/omnipresence/etc or if we decide that He can only be perfect if everything in reality is perfect. Instead the Bible tells an incredible story of a God that creates everything in this world: but then makes two beings, powered by something He models on Himself (which by His design is something in the universe completely outside of His control), an eternal soul.and then hands these two new immortals 100% ownership of this planet and it\u2019s contents, with no expectations or strings attached but a warning that one tree on it has fruit that can kill them.and also makes a habit of coming down to the planet in relatable form to spend time with them every afternoon.When those two beings decide that the Creator that has given them absolutely everything can\u2019t be trusted and they eat the fruit, God does an amazing thing. He doesn\u2019t stop them. He doesn\u2019t wipe them out of existence and memory and start again. He doesn\u2019t rewind time and override their choice with a correction. Nor does He lower His standards to shrug aside the reality that greed, mistrust, fear, deceit, shame and guilt has just been born in that paradise. Instead He sticks with them. He not only lives with their self-poisoning decision that leads to planetary rebellion over the generations that follow, but also commits to personally providing a remedy. So later He steps down onto the planet in an unrecognisably diminished form, to allow Himself to be treated by these descendants in exactly the way He has every right to treat them, executed as a blasphemer and a traitor. ** So the question that numbs the mind of the sincere reader is Why? Why would the Creator of the Universe with infinite options choose to take on personal loss just for the chance that human beings would trust in Him? Seriously, what\u2019s in it for Him? I know I\u2019d like to pretend I\u2019m so bleeping special, but why would God? Even if God had the equivalent of bowling buddies to point them to that tiny little speck in the corner of the universe and say \u201cyou know those dumb little critters down there? Some of them think I\u2019m awesome and are going to live at My home for eternity\u201d, those buddies would have every right to shrug that tiny boast away and then look at the cost of the holes in His hands and feet and tell Him it\u2019s the dumbest purchase they\u2019ve ever heard of. So God doesn\u2019t even get an enhanced reputation among equals out of it. He gets nothing but us. And I\u2019m forever numb that it was enough.  ",

Matthew 22:37-40 Jesus replied: \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d As if to reiterrate, in the Gospel of John He said, John13:34-35 \u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\u201d My interpretation of these scriptures is Love God with everything we have, above everything else, love our neighbors as we do ourselves, and love everyone. God allowed His only son, Jesus, to be sacrificed and Jesus allowed himself to be offered up as a sacrifice to cover everyone's sin, so we may have eternal life. John3:16 for God so loved the world He gave up His only begotten son so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but shall life everlasting. My conclusion is Love is the greatest lesson from the Bible. ",

Look at Jesus\u2019 life as it\u2019s recorded, he taught people how to give and obtain love from God, and he served others even until his death. He taught us to do the same, he said we must die of ourselves so we can be filled with God in the end (Matthew 10:39). He dedicated his live to showing us how to give our time for others, for example. In this passage (Matthew 6:24\u201334) Jesus talks about how we need to pick who we\u2019re going to serve, it\u2019s either God or money/material things. If we choose money we will spend our lives stuck at 9\u20135\u2019s working for paychecks so we can buy things that we can\u2019t even take when we die. If we choose to give up our evil desires and work for God instead we will have plenty of time share God\u2019s teachings with people and simply just give some love and care, letting God provide for us instead of relying on a paycheck. But in this world it\u2019s hard to find people who even want to try to do that. Yeah we\u2019re humans and we will make mistakes, but the least we can do is try. ",

In spite of all that, He chose to be up there on that cross so that we could all have at last that answer to the question mankind had been asking since the commandment to love your neighbor was first given, \u201cWho is my neighbor and how far do I have to go in loving them as myself?\u201d His answer was the cross. His answer was as far as we can go, until our last drop of blood and life are given. ",

These things will happen by means of his Kingdom in the hands of his Son Jesus Christ. (1 John 4:8; 1 Peter 1:16; Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 83:18; Revelation 4:11; Matthew 4:10; Isaiah 55:11; Matthew 6:9; Psalm 37:10, 11, 29) When God first made everything it was very good, perfect. Man was given a beautiful home and the prospect of living forever. When an angel and then man rebelled and the world was plunged into sin and death, God immediately set forth a remedy, because his purpose cannot be thwarted, it will come true. (Genesis 1:31; 2:8, 9; Genesis 3:1-15) We are now living in the last days of this system of things and the blessings under the Kingdom of God are soon coming to this earth. (2 Timothy 3:1; Matthew 6:10; Revelation 21:3, 4) Jesus said all who learn about him and his Father and exercise faith in what they say will live forever. (John 3:16; 17:3) So how can we do that?

All believers look forward to the time when they are in heaven and God recreates the natural world, Earth. This described in Revelation 21. So far it\u2019s a good thing, right? But just before this, in Revelation 19:11 through chapter 20, two events are described. First is quite literally, the end of the world in the great battle between God and the remaining world population. It is the Battle of Armageddon. Everyone dies. After this great battle comes the final judgment. All non-believers are cast into the Lake of Fire. Then comes the New heaven and new Earth. Only after the slaughter of all unbelievers and after they are cast into the Lake of Fire for eternity do believers get to enjoy heavenly bliss. So they look forward to this great battle and the final judgment for only by passing through these horrible days will they arrive at their heavenly reward. The end of humanity and the judgment become good things. This what we learn from the Bible. We learn that the fanatical belief of believers can cause them to relish the end of the world by war, just because it leads to their eternal bliss. How psychologically twisted is that? ",

            "answer_text": "Whether you believe that God is real or not, the Bible is full of moral values and wisdom that can improve everyone\u2019s life if applied correctly. A good place to start is with the 7 deadly sins, these are: Lust - If you chase these feelings you devalue sexual relationships and you end up treating people as objects to fulfil your own selfish feelings. Love is sacred, enjoy it in the compassionate way!Gluttony - Over-indulging and being a pig, it\u2019s when someone can\u2019t control their feelings and they eat for comfort. If you can\u2019t control yourself and be healthy then you aren\u2019t as fit to serve others.Greed - Constantly wanting more and more, you will never be happy with what you actually have. You will also cause suffering to those who are less fortunate. Sharing and giving to others is compassionate and improves the lives of people around you.Sloth - Being lazy and wanting to live a relaxing life. People suffered so that our lives could be better, we should strive to make things better for the next generation, we should carry our own suffering too!Wrath - Seeking revenge, regardless of who is right/wrong. By seeking revenge and doing horrible things you escalate the problem and make it worse, they may even get revenge back on you and this vicious cycle continues until it\u2019s fatal. Forgive people and be at peace.Envy - To be jealous and want what others have. When this feeling progresses you will want to beat everyone and have everything for yourself, you may even do nasty things to get there. Help others rather than trying to overtake them!Pride - To feel as if you are better than everyone else. When this progresses you will delude yourself into thinking you\u2019re the best. You become ignorant. You will also get huge feelings of shame and anger when someone proves you wrong. This can lead down a very dark path. Be humble and of service to others, lift other people up instead of inflating your own ego and lies.I hope this can be useful to someone, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wisdom found in the Bible. I used to be an atheist but then realised how true the lessons in the Bible are. The Bible is my moral compass. Remember, the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom! (being afraid of breaking the values within the Bible) ",

            "answer_text": "One can learn so many things but hopefully one doesn\u2019t miss the whole purpose for which the Bible was given to us: First John 5: 11 \u201cAnd this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son (Jesus). 12Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.\u201d Also, John 3:17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 19And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. If one reads and studies the Bible, but doesn\u2019t get this basic reason for which the Word was given to us, one has wasted all that time and will wind up in Hell, wondering what happened. How about you? Have you missed this all important truth in the Bible? Want to know more? Read John Chapter 3, and then Read the whole book of John, all the while asking God to reveal to you himself and an understanding of the Word He has given us. I wish you many, many blessings! ",

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 1 John 4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. Matthew 22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. John 13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. John 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. Romans 5:5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Romans 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. 9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Hebrews 13:1 Let brotherly love continue. 2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. ",

To complicate those issues, these books have been copied from different languages and recopied, edited, redacted, expanded and expounded upon. But, this is all rather academic. The true test is, does this book come from a god? Thus, do gods exist? We do not know if the Abrahamic God exists, then how can we know if these words in the Bible are his words? Trying to prove the existence of the Abrahamic God is far more difficult than trying to describe the beginning of the Universe, of which we have a far better description of. If one values truth and honor in one\u2019s life, then no one should accept the Bible or any other religious doctrine as a guide for that life. Be a skeptic. Question everything in your life and what you think you know. Use the bywords of Honor, Truth, Reason, and Logic in your life and you will be much happier and more fulfilled for doing so.

The Bible are so full of false claims, faulty facts, contradictions, downright dangerous advice and childish and far fetched stories that it really does not contribute anything to the life of men on Earth. See it for what it is; the stories and imagination of illiterate people who thought things up to either control others or who tried to explain those things that they did not understand. From the first chapter that tells about the so-called creation, through the childish story of a man and a sample of all the animals on Earth who survived on a wooden boat for more than a year to the miracles of a god\u2019s son who was raised from the dead it is quite evident that no one should really use the Bible as a guide or a book to learn anything. The bizarre and bad behaviour of the Bible god is obvious the imagination of people who though that an almighty being would act like that, things like killing people for the most trivial things, ordering the killings of children and animals etc, a god that wants people to constantly praise and tell him how good he is, people that must constantly pray and ask him for favours but who let then understand that his will and ways are the best and that everything will happen according to his plans etc. All that we can learn from the Bible is to never trust anything just because it is written down and never to trust something just because you are told it is holy.

So I\u2019d say Matthew 6:1 -6:5 6Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them\u2026 6:2So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do\u2026 6:5 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing\u2026on the street corners to be seen by others\u2026 I\u2019m no New Testament scholar, but it sure sounds like you can talk about your religion until you are blue in the face. That part doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s especially gross if you talk about how great you are and how much you care about your religion (any religion) or preach to others publicly if you\u2019re not actually ethical. What matters is being a good person and doing good things. That doesn\u2019t even require a religion, does it? Actions speak louder than words. ",

            "answer_text": "You can be God\u2019s friend and that this current world will change back to what God originally purposed for it at Genesis 1:27, 28 when God\u2019s Kingdom (His government ruled by Jesus His Son-a \u2018Theocracy\u2019) on Earth. At James 4:8 it says in part, \u201cDraw close to God and he will draw close to you\u2026\u201d Jesus further described how to do this in John 17:3 \u201cThis means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.\u201d We get another huge clue from the Lord\u2019s (or \u201cour Father\u201d or \u201cModel\u201d) prayer in Matthew 6:9 \u201cYou must pray, then, this way: \u201c\u2018Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified\u2026\u201d To know someone, draw close and be an individual\u2019s friend you must know their NAME. You must also learn why God\u2019s name (or reputation) needs to be sanctified. Sanctified from what? The name, as found over 7000 times in the earliest manuscripts of the Scriptures is (when anglicized), Jehovah. In fact Jesus\u2019 name is actually closer to Joshua or Jehoshua, which means \u201cJehovah is Salvation\u201d. To sanctify something is to make sacred, Holy, bless or purify. Sanctify from what? From all the lies Satan and his world empire of false religion has heaped upon God. Lies like God takes children to heaven because he needs another angel\u2026(God is love- this is diametrically opposed to his Will), that he is some unknowable or mysterious triune god or that he allows people to be tortured in hell. The issue started in the garden of Eden when Satan told the first lie insinuating that Humans could rule themselves and that God was withholding good from his creation. (Genesis 3) This issue will be settled at Armageddon, when all opposed to Jehovah\u2019s way of ruling are removed from the Earth. A peaceful group of His friends will remain. (Revelation 7:9). This group, and all humankind going forward will enjoy what is described in prophecy at Isaiah 65:17\u201325 \u201c17 For look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth; And the former things will not be called to mind,Nor will they come up into the heart. 18 So exult and be joyful forever in what I am creating.For look! I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joy And her people a cause for exultation. 19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and exult in my people; No more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or a cry of distress.\u201d 20 \u201cNo more will there be an infant from that place who lives but a few days,Nor an old man who fails to live out his days.For anyone who dies at a hundred will be considered a mere boy,And the sinner will be cursed, even though he is a hundred years of age. 21 They will build houses and live in them, And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. 22 They will not build for someone else to inhabit,Nor will they plant for others to eat.For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, And the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full. 23 They will not toil for nothing, Nor will they bear children for distress,Because they are the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah, And their descendants with them. 24 Even before they call out, I will answer;While they are yet speaking, I will hear. 25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together,The lion will eat straw just like the bull, And the serpent\u2019s food will be dust.They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,\u201d says Jehovah. I hope this helps. ",

When I think about Psalm 103, there are foolish things and willful sinful things that I have committed against God and others, yet God does not repay me according to my sins. He does not store up his anger against me even at times I hold grudges against others. He is slow to anger and abundant in love for me, while I am quick to anger and abundant in thinking or wishing evil on that person. God does not treat me as I have treated others. I am thankful that I live under grace and not under Law. I can never pay for all my sins but I am thankful that Jesus Christ paid for my sins. To me, that was the greatest thing that I learned from the Bible. God really does love me and loves me very much. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible is in two parts, the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, and the Christian Bible or New Testament. Each should be understood as an ecletic set of documents which happened to have survived and have been put together by committees. The Hebrew Bible gives us a rare insight into Bronze age people beyond many of the official records. We actually know the names and family relationships of many early people, along with their myths and many of their cultural practices. A lot of what we learn is not pleasant by today\u2019s moral standards, but probably was typical of other peoples of the time. They boast of their achievements and whine of their defeats, attributing victories to moral superiority (as is usual throughout history) and explaining losses as the action of supernatural forces. It actually represents a remarkable survival of oral history and some later written documents. The discipline of the Jewish scribes in copying is breathtaking. They had systems for counting letters in order to check, and thus made relatively few changes considering the number of times that documents have been copied. Their care in transcribing things which they did not understand is only occasionally broken by someone deciding \u201cthat can\u2019t be right\u201d and \u201ccorrecting it\u201d. For example, Methuselah was given a lifetime of a thousand years (i.e. a very approximate value, and most probably meaning a very long time) later corrected to 969 years by someone doing sums and deciding that he could not have survived the flood. (The great ages and some apparent contradictions come from a misunderstanding of the two early counting systems.) Modern translations may also include \u201ccorrections\u201d by people who honestly think they know better than earlier translators and are trying to make the story more acceptable to current audiences. In reading it is important to recognise the inherent bias. For example we have no documents from the Philistines, who would probably have spoken badly of the Jews. Nevertheless it is difficult for a modern person to sympathize with Hebrew justification of genocide and praise for murder of innocents on a grand scale, whether Egyptians or Canaanites. It may be helpful to understand that there were once two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, which probably had slightly different collections of historical and religious scrolls, which have been combined. Thus many accounts (starting with Adam and Eve) appear twice with contradictions. Where the scholars who combined them could not decide which was more reliable, they have included both. This is the source of many \u201cBible contradictions\u201d which are not a problem if you treat them like the variations we find in accounts of events in other histories. It should be obvious that these people had little idea of the size of the world and only connection with a limited area, so could not possibly know if (for example) a flood was worldwide. Indicating both bias and limited view, we can look at the account of the crossing of the Reed Sea (not Red Sea). It is plausible that the Egyptians sent a small detachment of cavalry after runaway slaves who had helped themselves to items of value on the way out, and got stuck in some mud. It is less likely that they were given treasure as they claim and that \u201call the armies of the Egyptians\u201d perished in crossing the Reed Sea, as this would be likely to appear in the historical record. By the way, it is likely that the word currently translated as \u201cthousand\u201d in accounts of the Exodus meant \u201ctent group\u201d or the leader of a family which would camp together, as observed by the great Egyptologist Flinders Petrie long ago, and rediscovered by several scholars since. It is generally accepted that \u201cforty\u201d was commonly a figure of speech for \u201cmany\u201d and therefore should not be used for precise calculations of the historical record. The Christian New Testament again gives an insight into the work of committees with a bias and limited view selecting documents to promote their agenda. It is if anything less reliable than the Hebrew Bible, as much of it was written and edited very much later than the events described and in the context of particular interpretations. The Gospel of Matthew has in fact been made up of cutting and pasting together many variants, and early versions do not have a virgin birth. The purported early life of Jesus is best understood in terms of its mythic context and fitting in with other traditions. Michael Ramsey (Archbishop of Canterbury) said that these stories were not essential to the messages of Christianity, but had probably helped in marketing (my word, not his). I pesonally think the most important lesson from this part of the Bible is that what is called Christianity is in fact Paulism. That is, most of the rules commonly given as \u201cChristian teaching\u201d come from the letters of St Paul (plus convenient selections from the Hebrew Bible, generally omitting the nasty bits). There are relatively few direct instructions from Jesus, even if you trust the text. ",

Second greatest thing in the Bible is the proclamation of the fact that \u2018 All humans are sinners\u2019, which rest of all the religious books fail to state.

            "answer_text": "What is the greatest thing we learn from the Bible? Well, you can learn about how a group of Hebrew nationalists collected different traditions of Egypt, Babylon and Canaan and rewrote them to provide a more or less coherent national identity to their people. Also you can learn about the worldviews of the Hebrews in their different historical stages and the political struggles within their society. More obscure but still evident is the evidence of the evolution of their religion, from polytheist to monotheist, with the intermediate stages of henotheism and monolatry. You can learn a lot about how religions are ongoing cultural creations if you pay enough attention to this. But if you mean what we can learn morally or philosophically then the answer is \u201cnot much\u201d. The moral in the Bible is either outdated, immoral or universally human and philosophically it goes (generally speaking) from mediocre to poor. It gets its higher point in Ecclesiastes but even this book is not competition to Greek and Chinese philosophers of Antiquity.  The Bible as a moral guideWho wrote the Bible, and why are there so many different books in the Bible?On languages, Babel and how the Bible was writtenHow much of the Bible actually happened?",

            "answer_text": "Are you sure you want to ask me this question? I'd want to say something like the New Testament, the Gospels, but they are not all represented. The story of Jesus I believe, in what is there, is also incomplete and misrepresented. He was also written about at least seventy years after his life. What I'd actually say is that the Bible teaches us how by tampering with ancient texts you can actually authenticate a mythology (e.g., virgin birth, son of God) for power and political gain. A mythology that people, even today, buy into without question. What was done to Origen\u2019s perspective highlights the problem. From my perspective, the Abrahamic religions need to update to the truth, or be swept away as surely they will in time. It would be better if we began again. Start with, we all sons and daughters of God, all souls on a journey to awakening. We need no formalised religion to do that for us. Our God lives within us. That said, I still recommend that people read the Bible as one of many books to study - check out this Twelve Inspirational Life Books article for example. I hope this helps answer your question. What do you think \u201cis the greatest thing we learn from the Bible?\u201d ",

The important thing is that we should confess our sins and repent of them. Bible tells us that we should not tell lies, spread rumors, steal other people's stuff, abuse drugs, insatiable longing for material gain etc. If we did, we should correct ourselves and do not do these bad stuff again. It is the Holly Spirit that addresses our common behaviours, help us to control ourselves and discipline this society that no law can reach against. Bible brings us the standards of happiness, peacefulness, kindness, love, faithfulness, patience and gentleness to this society. It tells us to be content, no compare with others, be generous, love those who mistreat you, treat others as we wish to be treated and teach children discipline. It advocates tranquility, harmony, inner peace, respect, courtesy, patience, tolerance, self-control and other traits that are definitely needed nowadays. Bible also explains the real meaning of life, reveals us the secrets to success and happiness, and teaches us not to be afraid of death. I love Bible and I hope to read it from beginning to end again. ",

Progress in science, philosophy and metaphysics (due to Spinoza, Einstein, Hawking etc. applying exceptional IQ) has now proved that the word \u201cGod\u201d means \u201ccause of genesis of the universe\u201d. Causes are timeless in circular rather than just linear logic. A cause is not the same concept as a creator,designer, entity, person or living being with an intent or will.

So \u201cI am who am\u201d in the bible was an ancient recognition of the fact that literally everything including time, the \u201cBig Bang\u201d, black holes, logic,nature, life, humanity, energy ,quants and even illusion is a self-contained circle and literally everything creates itself.

And not only the texts vary, their interpretation varies, too. Who's to say any one of them is correct? Especially considering that even of the old texts that were agreed upon ages ago, there are several translations,different in more than just nuances. Ultimately, the most basic thing about Christian beliefs isn't basic at all either. Which really SHOULD tell Christians to be modest about their religion, not propagating it for its hard to believe veracity, but for its good values, like universal love and pacifism. These are much easier to believe in than that one time god killed a woman for turning around. Or ordered a genocide. ",

            "answer_text": "Q; What is the greatest thing we learn from the bible? A; After reading some of the answers I thought it best to address some of these answers. It is true that heaven is on earth but not until after antichrist appears and the true Christ returns and the 2nd advent transpires.After Christ appears the millennium takes place and the white throne judgement has taken place than this earth shall be rejuvenated and God and his throne shall descend from heaven to setup heaven on earth for the eternity.. I think what we learn most from the bible is that God has alot of patience and he loves his children very much. We read of God\u2019s patience in 2nd Peter. 2nd Peter 3 vs 9; The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. God doesnt want any of His children to go to the lake of fire and be destroyed so he waits patiently for his children to ask for forgiveness and accept Jesus Christ as Lord and saviour. Another thing we learn from God\u2019s precious word is that, Gods word is more valuable than fine gold, as Psalms 19 so declares. Psalms 19 vs 7- 10; The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. Vs 8: The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. Vs 9; The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. Vs 10; More to be desired are they than gold, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey or the honeycomb. The greatest thing in one word to sum our Father is LOVE. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, the greatest thing about the Bible is Jesus. He has a message of love. that needs to be applied more today than ever before. Jesus, or Yeshua, is known throughout the world as a spiritual leader, messiah, divine, prophet, Jewish preacher, religious leader, son of man, son of God and even God. Jesus said in Luke 12:49-53 \u201cI have come to set the world on fire.\u201d Indeed he has; in all facets of our beliefs and understanding. The New Testament does not tell us much about Jesus as a child, but early on he was learning that he had a power within and had to learn to control it. In some stories found in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, omitted from the Bible, presents Jesus as an amazing divine child: He makes sparrows out of clay and then brings to life. He raises people from the dead and heals his brother James when he is bitten by a snake. Other stories present young Jesus as something of a holy terror: When a boy uses a tree branch to ruin some pools of water that Jesus has made, Jesus tells him to wither up like a tree and he does. When another boy runs into Jesus\u2019s shoulder, Jesus curses him and the boy dies. At one point, Joseph says, \u201cpeople who make him angry die\u201d. Scholars have tried to make sense of this text but always don\u2019t agree on how to understand it. Jesus studied and understood the Jewish Bible as well as the Rabbi\u2019s and may have been one himself. His purpose was to correct the teachings of the Jewish Bible. The Pharisees and other Jewish leaders saw Jesus as a threat to their teaching. In one instance he was confronted by a group of Jews who wanted to stone him. They told Jesus \u201cWe are not stoning you for any good work,\u201d they replied, \u201cbut for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claiming to be God.\u201d Jesus answered them, \u201cIs it not written in your Law, \u2018I have said you are \u201cgods\u201d\u202f . Jesus was referring to Psalm 82.6 I said, \u2018You are \u201cgods\u201d; you are all sons of the Most High.\u2019 That was one of many esoteric sayings Jesus presents in the New Testament. Another one is in Matthew 6:22, when Jesus said \u201cThe eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light. Did he mean the third eye; the Sixth Chakra taught by the eastern religions? Science refers to the third eye as the Pineal Gland and that may have much to do with what Christians call salvation. In John 14:12, Jesus tells us we can do the same works as him when he said, \u201cVery truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.\u201d Another time in Luke 17:6 The apostles said to the Lord, \u201cIncrease our faith!\u201d He replied, \"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, Be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it will obey you.\u201d Whoever has faith in God and practices what Jesus was trying to tell us, his true message, will be able to do the same works as Jesus. Jesus learned of this power at an early age and spent years studying and learning how to control this power within . In Luke 17:21 Jesus said, Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d For the first time we have access to an apocrypha Jesus, hidden or secret teachings. In 1945, original gnostic documents were found and is believed to be one of the most important archaeological finds in the 20th century. Thirteen ancient texts of Gnostic works called \u201ccodices\u201d found in caves in Upper Egypt untouched by scribes, can be found in the Nag Hammadi Library . Thirteen ancient texts of Gnostic works called \u201ccodices\u201d found in caves in Upper Egypt untouched by scribes. Among the manuscripts was the discovery of a complete copy of 114 secret sayings of Jesus , known as Gospel of Thomas, thought to be constructed in the 1st or 2nd century A.D. Some of the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas can be found in the New Testament and some believe even used to write some of verses in the New Testament. The discovery in 1945 provides a new and refreshing school of thought about spirituality and Jesus message. The discovery also came at a time when it could be shared with the world and not suppressed as it was for the last twenty centuries. It is understandable why the Church fathers omitted the Gospel of Thomas from the New Testament. In saying three, Jesus said: If those who lead you say to you: See, the kingdom is in heaven, then the birds of the heaven will go before you; if they say to you: It is in the sea, then the fish will go before you. But the kingdom is within you, and it is outside of you. When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will know that you are the sons of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you are in poverty, and you are poverty. The greatest part of the Bible was Jesus true message of Love and Enlightenment, not sin and repentance as the church fathers have taught.  ",

John 3:16-21 New Living Translation (NLT) 16 \u201cFor this is how God loved the world: He gave[a] his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. 17 God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him. 18 \u201cThere is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God\u2019s one and only Son. 19 And the judgment is based on this fact: God\u2019s light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil. 20 All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed. 21 But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants.[b]\u201d 33 Anyone who accepts his testimony can affirm that God is true. 34 For he is sent by God. He speaks God\u2019s words, for God gives him the Spirit without limit. 35 The Father loves his Son and has put everything into his hands. 36 And anyone who believes in God\u2019s Son has eternal life. Anyone who doesn\u2019t obey the Son will never experience eternal life but remains under God\u2019s angry judgment.\u201d ",

Next He will remove the Holy Spirit and bring tribulation to call out His faithful in sharp relief to the world system, followed by a thousand years\u2019 benevolent reign here on earth. Still mankind will rebel, and Satan will rage again until God finally shakes the wicked and unredeemed from the earth. God is sovereign. His goodness reigns forever. We can align ourselves with Him through the sacrifice of Jesus, who paid our sin debt so we could go free. Not everyone, sadly, will accept this. But this is the epic message of the Bible. ",

Metal spikes were driven into Jesus\u2019 hands and feet, and He had to slide His mangled body up against the wood of the cross in order to catch His breath.

They will be given a chance to prove their respect and love for what is right. Those who refuse will not be able to stay and corrupt things back to the way it is now. They will have to go also. It's after Armageddon that people will gradually be restored to perfection as long as they are practicing what is right. That will take 1000 years. Its at the end of those 1000 years humans in a perfect state will be allowed to be tested by Satan once more a short time and then he and his demons will be destroyed forever and mankind will live forever in true peace and security worshipping God forever on Earth.

Noah displayed obedience by building the ark, etc. Jonah LEARNED obedience and carried out his preaching assignment. We learn PATIENCE. Almighty God sure displays patience today by tolerating the level of wickedness we see rampant in the earth before he steps in by means of his warrior son and the mighty angels. (Revelation 11:18.) We learn FAITH\u2026. and HOPE\u2026\u2026,. but the greatest bible lesson to me is LOVE! Romans 13:8, Galations 5:14, John 13:35, 15: 9, 12,13,17, 1 Peter 1:22, 2 Peter 1:5\u20138, 1 Thessalonians 4:9&10, 1 Timothy 1:5. All these scriptures, Tim, well illustrate the fine superiority of imitating God's love for us, (John 3:16), Jesus' love for his father AND for us, and the opportunity they both have given US to return that love to them and to one another forever and a day.

Then God sends His only Son, to take all our sins, and He (Lord Jesus) gets punished for our sins. His blood was shed, to wipe out all our sins. This means our righteousness got restored. God sees us as new creations, sinless as we repent in Jesus Name. Then, in deep love for our Savior, our character begins to recreate. We know were forgiven and saved. Its the biggest gift ever, as it determines where and Who we live with when we die. My life on earth is temporary, but after I die, my eternal home is ensured by Whom i belong to, and Who I served while I was on earth. If you study how Christ died on the Cross, its terribly gruesome. Christ taking our penalty is truly the greatest love ever. ",

First of all, you probably shouldn't look towards the Bible for moral lessons, as it was written in a VERY unfamiliar(by modern standards) time, and was based upon even older(and more alien) oral traditions dating back to the Bronze Age(and probably earlier). If you used the Bible as your moral compass, to guide your actions, you would almost immediately be jailed for life. That being said, there are tidbits in there that are by no means exclusive to the faith, as they were first recorded much earlier in the Laws of Hammurabi, and have been featured in most religions. Don\u2019t murder or steal(from your tribe, at least), and treat others as you, yourself, would want to be treated. Granted, the Bible is full of instances where even these simple lessons were ignored. You can\u2019t win them all. ",

God loves the world (John 3:16; 1 John 3:16; 4:10). If not, He would have destroyed it, completely, during the Flood (Genesis 6:5\u20137; 18:20), but God still saw hope in Man (Genesis 6:8; 18:26, 29, 32). According to John 3:16, He loved the world so much that He allowed His own son to come down to Earth and die for our sins (Matthew 26:28; 1 Corinthians 15:3; Galatians 1:4; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14; Hebrews 9:28; 10:12; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18; 1 John 2:2; 3:5; 4:10; Revelation 1:5). The Bible, in general, is all about love. The love of God, the love of Christ, the love of the Holy Spirit and the love of Man towards his fellow man (John 13:34, 35; 15:12, 17; Romans 12:10; 13:8; Galatians 5:13; Ephesians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 3:12; 4:9; Hebrews 10:24; 1 Peter 1:22; 3:8; 1 John 3:11, 23; 4:7, 11, 12; 2 John 1:5). If you see only the bad things recorded in the Bible (wars, infirmities, sin in general), then you\u2019re missing the point. If you see the solutions for those things, then you\u2019ll see God\u2019s love. ",

For me, there are two main lessons I have learned concerning life, from Scripture: Gratitude. Job was the most affluent man of his day, and lost it all in a matter of days. Yet despite this, he praised Elohim for granting him what he had. Job 1:21\u201322 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. As a pastor said, donkeys were the Cadillacs of those days. Job had 500 of them and lost all of it in one go\u2026 and we moan and groan when some little thing goes wrong with us. I have not been officially jobless or homeless (I have read your bio, and I have much respect for you, after what you have been through). But after turning around just before bankruptcy, I thank YHWH for every meal I am allowed to enjoy. People you need to avoid. For this, I merely reference Proverbs. Ample guidance about how to choose friends and who to avoid. As for women, I reference Genesis 2 and Proverbs 31. A woman who does not conform to this, is not worth having in your life. Gen 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. The help submits to the one who receives help; unless requested, the help gives no commands, orders or suggestions. Woman was created to be a help for Man. ",

In this one verse we learn that: A.) God still loves the world. Despite all the depravity it\u2019s filled with, and the horrible atrocities we\u2019ve brought about, He still loves us, B.) not only does He love us, but He\u2019s willing to send His only Son in person to save us from our sins, and C.) that simply through belief in Him we can be rescued from our sins and granted eternal life. I don\u2019t know about you, but I find all this pretty freaking amazing. It\u2019s not all of the amazing things the Bible has to say about God, but it\u2019s quite a few of them all in one verse.

Additionally, Jesus is the walking, talking Word of God. He is what we worship, not words on a page. He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. He is where we go to see how scripture ought to be played out in our lives. - He is where we go to see how it is to be lived. Because there are translations today that are not faithful enough to the original writings to be considered treasures\u2026 that is another reason why we must lean heavily on God's Spirit and look intently into the life of Christ when reading and studying the bible. Because, again, Jesus is the walking, talking Word of God. ",

This G-d created Man in His image, ie with an ability to choose between good and evil. Yet man needed guidance, so G-d revealed His Will and Ethical Life schedule to an extended family called Israel at Mt Sinai with the Directive that as a nation this group of Jews would represent G-d as His chosen emissaries to teach their brother nations G-d's Will as a light unto the nations Being chosen by G-d was not a privilege but rather a responsibility and certainly not a sign of superiority. Mankind was instructed that moral behavior would be rewarded and evil would definitely be punished in a Heaven and Hell. But in simple words, we're not alone, G-d's watching and He even grants requests when we ask nicely. ",

I believe there are many great things we can learn from the Bible\u2026 one great theme throughout the Bible is the purpose of creation and of our place as humans in creation: the Kingdom of God. This was the focus of the promises in the Old Testament and of the teaching of Jesus and the apostles in the New. However, for me the greatest thing we can learn from the Bible, is getting to know God through Jesus. To have the separations between us and God broken down and to get to know Him personally. I cannot think of any greater privilege than this. ",

In salvation, we see that God know us, that we need saving, and that He is supremely generous in providing us with a simple and easy way to enter into heaven.

It is understandable that ancient people, who did not have the tools to see what caused the many natural phenomena would assign God, god or gods to those things they could not understand. And of course as the stories spread they became embellished as they got retold, until somebody wrote them down, which eventually became the bible. The interesting thing about it though is that people in the 21st century still take the bible at face value and believe it is a good book to base one's life on. The bible should only be taken as ancient literature nothing else. There is nothing devine or special about the bible. ",

So the bible is devoted to people and it addresses people, it offers salvation as the solution to all of man kinds troubles no matter what they are. I am sorry if you wanted a certain passage instead I briefed the entire bible. Thank you for you A2A. ",

He provided for his entire family and welcomed them into Egypt as a sanctuary against famine, after discovering that they had truly repented for selling him years earlier. But after all this kindness from Joseph they still had doubts. The lesson we learn is that people who forgive are blessed by God more than those who seek personal vengeance. But the criterion is sincere remorse and repentance in behavior. ",

He told Jeremiah \u2018Be not afraid of their rank; I am with you to deliver you\u2019. The overarching message to all who will serve him is to be fearless.
