            "answer_text": "Unfortunately I do not feel like I am being prepared for college at all, nor will I be prepared for college. As per most people college is a huge wake up call in actually learning things. Here is my schedule this year and I will analyze how effective each class is at college readiness (I finish junior year next week!):  Period 1: AP PhysicsPeriod 2: FrenchPeriod 3: AP US HistoryPeriod 4: HealthPeriod 5: English Period 6: Pre-Calculus AP Physics: This class gave me a pretty good idea of how the remedial physics classes in college will be, but the work assigned and labs was nothing. We had homework every night but it could take five minutes (write a bunch of crap down and voila!) or it could take you an hour and you would sort of know the material. The homework questions were not always the material we needed to know, but something like it. I think the teacher was too lazy to make his own homework. We had quizzes every Friday, but the teacher did not believe in tests. The final first semester was not all what he said would be on it (and he told us to not study other stuff). I ended up with a semester C and a B both quarters. The final screwed me. Is that college preparation? You can probably decide. I don't feel prepared by that class.  French: We do minimal work and are hardly required to memorize anything. We did a couple small projects all year and the final in comprehensive (all multiple choice). Our verbal final was five questions. I could not even say this any what prepared me for college.  AP US History: This class most closely prepared me for college, but not in the same way a college works. We took a ridiculous amount of Cornell notes every night on material the teacher kind of covered the following day. We had tests about once a week (we covered about 33 chapters plus a couple of chapters that were split in the span of this one school year). The only way this prepared me was by showing us that we needed to be on top of the material at all times. Falling behind would be devastating to your grade. Everything was worth the same amount of points in the grade book so you could pad your grade with homework. This class was beneficial in that it actually required studying, but the work pressed on us was (what I know of) not equivalent to the little amount of homework you have to do in college. We did so much work at points I could do nothing other in the day but do the homework.  Health: We don't do shit in that class. I am sorry for the profanity but it really is the most sad class ever. I can't even tell you it would remotely prepare me for college. As an idea, the final project was a poster of a controversial topic. I just wrote a bunch of crap and typed it up and glued it on the poster board. I got an A.  English: We have written two papers all year, and there is an aid in the class to help the number of kids who hardly speak English. If I would have taken AP English I would have failed like all the other kids because the teacher believes that she is the only teacher who you should do homework for. Like half of the kids in every single one of her classes dropped first semester and she hardly gives an A, even when deserved. I couldn't tell you either of these classes well prepare someone for college.  Pre-Calculus: This class is the closest I have to what being in college is like. The tests are worth 90% of the grade so if you don't want to do the work and just study your ass off then you can still get an A. Albeit the material is not too difficult I still think it has showed me the most of how college will treat me.  As far as the rest of my high school career (prior to this year) it was all just a bunch of bullshit classes that prepared one close to none for the difficulty college brings.  A good metaphor: you are forced to learn cursive in the 4th grade because \"you will always have to use it in high school\" when in fact you never are required to write in cursive.  Any questions about anything and just leave a comment. I hope my analyzation of my classes has helped you decipher whether or not high school really helps for college. Kind of an important side note: I go to school in Central California. ",

I procrastinated heavily in high school, barely studied for anything and managed to scrape an A in every class, did projects the night before, and was busy working 3 jobs. My real world skills/experiences come from being a taekwondo instructor, babysitting, teaching piano, and being a front desk receptionist. I have learned more about public speaking, respect, customer service, and responsibility than anything my high school could have taught me. But high school has taught me a few life lessons. Like that not everyone you meet are nice people and that it doesn\u2019t hurt to be kind anyways. Sometimes, your teachers won\u2019t like you, no matter how hard you try. And that some teachers are awful at teaching, so you have to end up teaching the material to yourself. And for gods sakes, bring your own lunch. The most important lesson I\u2019ve taken away from the past 4 years is the value of perseverance. If I didn\u2019t get a fair grade on an assignment that I worked my butt off on, I would ask my teacher if there was a way to make up for it. I would do test corrections, even if my test grade was sitting at an 80. I made sure to never give up on achieving A\u2019s, no matter if I was exhausted from work and just wanted to sleep. Even after all the life lessons that I\u2019ve learned, I still don\u2019t know how to cook, file taxes, or balance a checkbook. ",

            "answer_text": "I certainly don't feel like high school is preparing me for college. Any sort of college or \"real world\" preparation comes from my hobbies, and experiences outside of school.       Public high schools don't seem to care about the future of their students. I can't say the same for all teachers, but the schools as a whole shows little effort. My school in Connecticut spends 2 years preparing you for their state exam while spending absolutely no time on SATs. This is because the state exams affect the budget of the school as well as its reputation, while SAT only seems to hurt the students.       I take all honors courses as of junior year and 1 AP course (AP US History). My AP course is probably the worst of all. I cannot recall more than 2 lectures through out the entire year. The rest of the year was filled with videos and book work. To top it all off, I'm paying $180 to take this course while it's also bringing down my GPA.      Schools should provide much more internship opportunities. There's absolutely no other way to gain real world experience. Additionally, teachers play a huge role in this. I've had from the most passionate teachers to the teachers that know nothing about their subject and only give work twice a week IN CLASS. I've learned more about web design in one weekend than in my entire year long web design course at school. How exactly is high school preparing me for college? It isn't.  I've had more college experience in middle school just based on the fact that we were able to leave school and go to a local restaurant for lunch.      My school has something called the 7 C's. It's basically what the state imposed on schools to embed in students minds to \"prepare\" the for college. The funny thing is, I can't even name 2 of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, high school prepares me for college. But not in the way you would expect. I'm currently finishing junior year of high school in the US. However, I am an international student here and I've been around for 6 months. Before this I used to live in Panama. Panama has one of the worst school systems in the world in my opinion. The US doesn't have an extraordinary system either but it's at least 100 times ( I'm literally saying it's a hundred, it's not a random number) better than Panama's , as far as academics go. So, why do I think high school in Panama genuinely prepared me for college? Well, because I had to take FULL responsiblity for my education. I couldn't rely on school to prepare for me college from the beggining. It was a nuisance to attend school. I had covered all the material for high school in the 7th grade. The sad thing is I think that isn't really impressive. It was THAT easy.  So, I became an avid book reader at first. I read hundreds of books every year. I taught myself many things over the internet and I did lots of extracurricular activities. I started out with entrepreneurship, speech, debate and physics. I wasn't much of a sports or music type but I tried a lot of that too. Then, I was invited to participate in the math olympiad in my country , I didn't win ( the first time,that changed :) ) but I was invited to the math olympiad program . I have done that since late 2009 to present and it has been the defining thing in my high school experience. It became my passion and I thoroughly enjoy this. Later on , I became involved in my community through several clubs and activities. Most of the time I just volunteered to help rather than hold actual club memberships if there were any. I really liked interacting with different groups of people that were doing good things and helping them out, while keeping myself committed to only a few clubs and activities. I also pursued much intellectual discussion with my peers, taught and tutored people of all ages ,in a lot of topics , both for profit and for free throughout this time. I enjoyed a healthy and active social life. I made a lot of mistakes . I learned from my mistakes most of the time.I became a lot more responsible and hard working too. The main point here is that high school simply had nothing to do with it. High school wasn't expected to prepare for anything and so I took action on my own. The only thing high school did teach me was how to work with different people, with different perspectives and different skills in a ridiculous amount and variety of group projects. It also allowed me to take part in this valuable experiences outside of the classroom and while my academic development may be significantly less than what I would have accomplished if I had been in a place like the US, I was still able to place and do well in AP classes when I got here. I think no amount of those 'rigurous' work loads would have prepared me and given me the indepence I enjoy now. ",
