            "answer_text": "As I understand from the question, you are talking about networking in general and not mobile communication technologies like 3G/4G, LTE, Bluetooth, NFC, Satellite Communication etc. The Cisco defines Wireless network as follows:- Wireless Network A wireless local-area network (LAN) uses radio waves to connect devices such as laptops to the Internet and to your business network and its applications. When you connect a laptop to a WiFi hotspot at a cafe, hotel, airport lounge, or other public place, you're connecting to that business's wireless network. Wireless Network vs Wired Network A wired network connects devices to the Internet or other network using cables. The most common wired networks use cables connected to Ethernet ports on the network router on one end and to a computer or other device on the cable's opposite end. Basically, Wireless uses Radio Frequency spectrum to create a network in place of physical cables like Ethernet. The  standards are laid down as IEEE 802.11 a,b,g,n,ac, ad etc. IEEE 802.11 is a set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing wireless local area network(WLAN) computer communication in the 2.4, 3.6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands. Theoretically, the Wireless speed used to be slower than the most popular Ethernet standards,  but with 802.11 ac & ad, the speed is going to be in very high (802.11 ad is designed for over 6Gbps with limited reach, 802.11 ac is close to 700-800 Mbps).

            "answer_text": "Wireless network, in general we call it mobile network, has been developed for a long time. LTE, what we call 4G, is widely used now and will continue to support the customer and market needs. But we find that 4G is far from enough. The data rate is to low so that we cannot watch videos smoothly. There has no signals in remote rural area and the latency is too high, making the quality of communication really bad. In this condition we develop 5G, the fifth generation communication. What can 5G bring to us? Broadband access in dense areas Broadband access everywhere High user mobility Extreme real-time communications Ultra-reliable communicationsThere are some critical technologies in 5G: C-RAN(Cloud Radio Access Network) CoMP(Coordinated MultiPoints)  SDN(Software define network)Well, what I talk above is about new technologies in the future and they still are immature. If you want to know something about current technologies applied now, you can ask me and I will try me best to give you some information. ",

            "answer_text": "Wireless networks are formed using the radio spectrum for connection between the transmitter and received without involving any wires. There are different types of wireless networks which can be broadly classified into Wide area Networks - eg. GSM - Mobile communication systems (long range)Local Area Networks - eg. Wi-Fi (medium range)Personal Area Networks - Bluetooth (short range)Each of these networks have a different strategy and set of protocols defined to provide connectivity. Most of these networks provide last mile connection to end user on wireless but still they rely heavily on their wired counterparts which mostly act as their backhaul. With more and more advancements in hardware, radio chips and antenna design, the once fragile and untrustworthy wireless media has now become very reliable and most popular communication technology.

            "answer_text": "A wireless LAN (or WLAN, for wireless local area network, sometimes referred to as LAWN, for local area wireless network) is one in which a mobile user can connect to a local area network (LAN) through a wireless (radio) connection. The IEEE 802.11 group of standards specify the technologies for wireless LANs.  Types of Wireless Networks WLANS: Wireless Local Area Networks WLANS allow users in a local area, such as a university campus or library, to form a network or gain access to the internet. A temporary network can be formed by a small number of users without the need of an access point; given that they do not need access to network resources. WPANS: Wireless Personal Area Networks The two current technologies for wireless personal area networks are Infra Red (IR) and Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15). These will allow the connectivity of personal devices within an area of about 30 feet. However, IR requires a direct line of site and the range is less. WMANS: Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks This technology allows the connection of multiple networks in a metropolitan area such as different buildings in a city, which can be an alternative or backup to laying copper or fiber cabling.

Typically you think of WiFi and maybe even Bluetooth, but there are also frequently used technologies such as NFC (Near Field Communication) and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). They each have their own protocols (rules) that they use to connect and transfer data.   I hope this general answer helps you refine your question so that you can get a more specific answer. ",

The wireless network includes both global voice and data networks that allow users to establish long-range wireless connections, as well as infrared and RF technologies optimized for short-range wireless connections, much like the use of wired networks. The biggest difference is the difference in transmission media. By using radio technology to replace the network cable, it can be backed up with the wired network. ",
