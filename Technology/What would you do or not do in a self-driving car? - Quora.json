            "answer_text": "Today, or in the future? I have a Tesla Model 3 with the Full Self-Driving Capability option, including the FSD computer. What I would not do today is take my eyes off the road for more than about 10 seconds, less on rural roads. I think that will give the reader a long list of other things I wouldn\u2019t do by implication. If I don\u2019t have to take my eyes off the road for more than 10 seconds, I am capable of interacting with the vehicle controls and it\u2019s legal, then I would likely do it. I was driving on an interstate highway a couple of days ago when the car in in front of me suddenly braked and swerved. As they swerved, I saw the reason, a large part of a tire in the middle of the lane. I responded immediately, and I don\u2019t think the car would have missed the tire on its own. It couldn\u2019t have seen it coming. Unexpected things happen, and the human driver has to be prepared to take over. As for the future, I\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I believe in principle that a self-driving car will be safer than a human-driven car, and I\u2019ll be able to take a nap while the car drives. Until then I firmly believe that the combination of me and my self-driving car is safer than either alone. ",

And I have been driving for 40 years and only 1 accident many years ago. I don't need a car to tell me how to drive!!!! ",
