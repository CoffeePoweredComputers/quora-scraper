For example, the supposed \u201cAge of Enlightenment,\u201d a time of skepticism, is supposed to have lasted through the 18th century, as shown through the American Revolution and the lives of Franklin and Voltaire.

Some events do mark a definitive ending of dominant trends. For example, the First World War closed a dynastic age. Before it, much national power was associated with dynastic royalty and nobility, and expressed through colonialism.
