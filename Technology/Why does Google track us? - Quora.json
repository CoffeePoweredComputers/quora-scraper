            "answer_text": "Google knows more about you than you might think. Here's how to keep it from tracking your location, web browsing, and more.  when you search on Google, they keep your search history forever? That means they know every search you\u2019ve ever done on Google. That alone is pretty scary, but it\u2019s just the shallow end of the very pool of data that they try to collect on people. What most people don\u2019t realize is that even if you don\u2019t use any Google products directly, they\u2019re still trying to track as much as they can about you. Google trackers have been found on 75% of the top million websites. This means they're also trying to track most everywhere you go on the internet, trying to slurp up your browsing history! Most people also don\u2019t know that Google runs most of the ads you see across the internet and in apps \u2013 you know those ones that follow you around everywhere? Yup, that\u2019s Google, too. They aren\u2019t really a search company anymore \u2013 they\u2019re a tracking company. They are tracking as much as they can for these annoying and intrusive ads, including recording every time you see them, where you saw them, if you clicked on them, etc. If You Use Google Products If you do use Google products, they try to track even more. In addition to tracking everything you\u2019ve ever searched for on Google (e.g. \u201cweird rash\u201d), Google also tracks every video you\u2019ve ever watched on YouTube. Many people actually don\u2019t know that google own youtube; now you know. And if you use Android (yeah, Google owns that too), then Google is also usually tracking: Every place you\u2019ve been via Google Location Services.How often you use your apps, when you use them, where you use them, and who you use them to interact with. (This is just excessive by any measure.)All of your text messages, which unlike on iOS, are not encrypted by default.Your photos (even in same cases theones you've deleted).If you use Gmail, they of course also have all your emails. If you use Google Calendar, they know all your schedule. There\u2019s a pattern here: For all Google products (Hangouts, Music, Drive, etc.), you can expect the same level of tracking; that is, pretty much anything they can track, they will. Essentially, if you allow them to, they\u2019ll track pretty close to, well, everything you do on the internet. In fact, even if you tell them to stop tracking you, Google has been known to not really listen, for example with location history. The Myth of \u201cNothing to Hide\u201d Some may argue that they have \u201cnothing to hide,\u201d so they are not concerned with the amount of information Google has collected and stored on them, but that argument is fundamentally flawed for many reasons. Everyone has information they want to keep private: Do you close the door when you go to the bathroom? Privacy is about control over your personal information. You don\u2019t want it in the hands of everyone, and certainly don\u2019t want people profiting on it without your consent or participation. In addition, privacy is essential to democratic institutions like voting and everyday situations such as getting medical care and performing financial transactions. Without it, there can be significant harms. On an individual level, lack of privacy leads to putting you into a filter bubble getting manipulated by ads, discrimination, fraud, and identity theft. On a societal level, it can lead to deepened polarization and societal manipulation like we\u2019ve unfortunately been seeing multiply in recent years. Image:- Google ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they do. But it\u2019s not sinister at all - they just want to make more money. Google will track the sorts of things you search for or the things click on from search. They will track where you are, and what keywords you use in your gmail messages. They use this to improve the search engine results for you, so you keep using it, They also use it to tailor the ads to you, so you are more likely to click on them - which is how they get paid. And that\u2019s the main goal - get more click on ads. So Google will track your location. Again, it\u2019s not sinister, but if they can show you an advert for a shop that\u2019s 3km away from you, and not show you an ad for a shop that\u2019s 300km away, they are more likely to get a click. If you are interested in cars, visit sites about cars and attend car events, you are much more likely to click on an advert about cars than one about crosstitch patterns. If you have bought plane tickets to Hawaii (using a gmail account), then you might be interested in ads for hotels in Hawaii. Google\u2019s entire reason for existence as a business is to make money, and they make more money by tracking the users. In return, they have realised by giving away stuff for free, like Google search, Gmail and Android, they can get better tracking (and more users). No-one at goolge particularly cares about you personally - but they love that you are in the marketing group of \u2018car driver in Austin, Texas, 30\u201335 years old, likes watches, football and country music\u201d, because then advertisers can write ads that target any one of those things, and you just might click on it.

            "answer_text": "Nobody is actually tracking people, so Google doesn't do that either. The subject of tracking is people's behaviour online, not people itself. Nobody is tracking you personally, but Google, Facebook, and other sites might be interested in how much time do you spend on their sites daily and in what period of the day, what ads do you click the most, what is your favorite content etc. But they're not interested about you as an individual but how their sites are performing generally, how to improve the services they are offering etc. To get this data they must to track what is going on on their sites and to make some conclusions by using this statistics to get better results in what they want this better results to be achieved. If 68% of people are watching the news videos, they will offer more news videos, perhaps diversified - as simple as that. Of course, you can say that you don't want anyone to track your behavior online, but the only way to achieve this is to not get going online. This is the same like you would like to go to somebody's birthday party but don't want to be seen. Don't go there then. Or put the mask on your face and take a long black coat. This sites are owned by some individuals like M.Zuckerberg or more people representing the board and this is what makes the sites to be a private property. They have legal right to control their property by using legal ways to do that. Legal and ethical are not the same often. This is something we use to forget but we shouldn't. ",

I understand though that Google is now using that data to also tell you if a restaurant or bar is busy.  I believe (if I read it right) that Google is basically scanning to see how many people are in that location and what they are really reading is the data on the Google Location settings on the cell phones in that location.
