            "answer_text": "Actually, most people are surprised that despite Netflix having developed its own streaming tech, they could not scale fast enough for demand at the time. So, they bit the bullet, and to this day, the entirety of Netflix's operation, is actually in the hands of one of its largest competitors: Amazon Studios.  That's right, Netflix is sitting atop a gigantic AWS (Amazon Web Services) setup! It is certainly a weird situation to be in, and I cannot speak for either company about it, but they're both making money, and they both have their own original content creation now -- which helps to differentiate their service offerings.  So, with Amazon making money 2X over, I don't really see them rocking the boat for a client as huge as Netflix (not to mention the bad press they would get, it would be murder on their stock -- they are painted into a corner too!). As for Netflix, with its current size, setting up its own infrastructure to support its titanic size and furious growth, would be a huge cost (which, honestly, it could afford to do).  However, it is a far wiser decision, IMHO, to spend just a portion of that, on creating more new and unique content. Why? Simply because the more original content you own, and can make rather inexpensively, provides the service the leverage to offer more fragmented, niche programming. As a result, they acquire and retain customers. This equals growth, which equals profit, and Netflix, Amazon, and the Consumers are happy. Everyone wins.  Cheers. ",
