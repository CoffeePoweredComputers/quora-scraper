            "answer_text": "As other answers have said, WLAN can be any wireless technology for a LAN. There have been others: propriatary ones (I worked on chips for Motorola WLAN or Buffalo WLAN) or other standards eg ETSI HiperLAN But today the 802.11 series of protocols are universal. WiFi is usually used as a synonym for 802.11 BUT pedantically it is not quite the same 802.11 is a series of standards, with many options WiFi is a brand name for the WiFi Alliance that defines a subset of those protocols, tests interoperatability, promotes common operation etc In theory, one could probably have an 802.11 WLAN that was not WiFi and was not interoperable with WiFi. It would be very difficult, and in the real world impractical, but you could maybe do it. So WLAN describes the concept802.11 is the near-universal technology standardWiFi is near universal implementationOne oddity: 802.11 has different version (b, g, n, ac etc) and we still use those but even though WiFi refers to them all ",

            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wireless Local Area Networks Alliance (WLANA). It is actually not a standard and only ensures that products using this trademark can interoperate with each other. As most Wi-Fi products use the IEEE 802.11b standard, Wi-Fi usually refers to 802.11b. Wi-Fi is a new technology that uses the WLAN protocol. Wi-Fi can provide wireless coverage in an area with a radius of up to 90 m (300 inches), while the WLAN can provide wireless coverage in an area with a radius of 5 km (with antennas used). The biggest advantage of Wi-Fi is its high transmission speed (up to 11 Mbit/s). Wi-Fi is a short-distance wireless transmission technology applicable to offices and households.
