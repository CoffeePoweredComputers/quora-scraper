            "answer_text": "Consumer drones can only be controlled to about 500 feet, maybe somewhat further if there isn't radio interference, such as other drones flying nearby. Oh sure. It'll keep flying beyond that. Continuing far out of reach. Hopefully your drone has an \u201cauto return feature\u201d when it loses the control signal. Military drones are controlled by satellite signals relaying controls from the pilots back home in the U.S. Predators can fly for 24 hours straight, taking off from a base anywhere in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the transmitter and receiver. There is a new design out there that works with a SIM card which allows for basically unlimited range - or at least as far as the batteries will allow. If you\u2019re speaking of consumer drones like the DJI Phantom series, I\u2019ve been able to get them as far as 9 miles with a range booster and I\u2019m very flat and obstruction free conditions. That is the extreme though. For the most part, three to five miles is average for that type of drone; however, the FAA requires you to keep the drone within visual line of sight and a small craft like that would be hard to see at even a quarter mile soooo\u2026 take that for what it\u2019s worth.
