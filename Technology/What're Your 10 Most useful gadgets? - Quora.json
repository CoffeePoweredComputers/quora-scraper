            "answer_text": "Leatherman. The Charge Ti model. I use it every day for many different things. From opening the latest Amazon delivery to needing a screwdriver or cutting a stray thread, it is the go-to tool for a quick job. Heck, I\u2019ve used it to file down a hangnail! Other people might like the Gerber or other multitool, but I like the Letherman.Bicycle. OK not really a gadget, but it is in a way. Bicycle technology is constantly evolving and a lot of personal transportation advances are tested on bikes first. Not to mention all the various sensor packages that have come about in the last decade or so, from GPS driven cyclometers, heart rate monitors, watt meters and cadence sensors. More than enough for a data junkie to chew on.Raspberry Pi (several) useful for so many projects.iPhone (7). Still does what I need, so no need to upgrade yet.Apple Watch - great to have all my various digital alerts in one spot. Siri on my wrist. Remote for iTunes, Apple TV, home automation. And of course fitness tracking. Probably a big reason why I don\u2019t feel it necessary to upgrade my iPhone too.Apple TV. Don\u2019t watch much traditional TV anymore, and a big reason is because of the Apple TV. Nothing all that special about Apple TV, I think any of the streaming devices and smart TVs are probably good enough.MacBook Pro. Specifically the built in dictionary and auto-correcting text. When I use the PC at work I\u2019m forever correcting typos. That doesn\u2019t happen with my MacBook because of autocorrect. I figure that adds at least 5 words per minute to my typing speed. The fact that it is just part of the OS means it happens in every text box and I don\u2019t have to think about it. Also the dictionary means I can highlight any word on the screen and get a definition and link to a Wiki page if one exists. This is extremely handy.Bunn coffee maker. Keeps hot water in a reservoir, which means it can get the water up to the proper temperature. Most drip coffee makers heat water in a copper tube and it never gets hot enough to properly brew the beans. Downside is that it heats water all day, so I added a smart switch to turn it on when I wake up.Ubiquiti network components. When I upgraded to gigabit Internet service I noticed I wasn\u2019t getting the thoughput I expected. So I upgraded to a pretty complex (for a home network) setup with 3 802.11ac access points, new switches and higher performance gateway. Very easy to set up using their UniFI network controller software (they have a device called a \u201ccloud key\u201d but you can run their Java based controller on a Raspberry Pi or, as I have done, an old Intel NUC running Windows 10. This makes network setup pretty much point and click, and tell you more about your network than you\u2019ll ever need to know. You can even set up guest networks and isolate your visitors from you main network.Ham radio(s). Again, more than one. Actually came in handy a few weeks ago when I was out on a back road and high-centered on a snowdrift. I was able to call out on the local repeater and got a friend to come out and pull me out. I probably could have done the same thing with my phone, as I had some service, but instead of having to make one call to a bunch of people I would have had to call each person individually. And nice to have roundtable discussions with others, kind of like a conference call but not as formal.",

            "answer_text": "Gadget implies a small tool with moving parts or electronic device. So I would say for me they are: Smart phone with Tasker automationI use my phone for navigation and entertainment while driving, communication, entertainment, light administration of my various devices at home, and controlling my home automation. A smart phone is about as close as we can come to the magical Star Trek Tricorder. In a decade it may become as useful as Dr. Who\u2019s Sonic Screwdriver. 2. Bluetooth Audio Adapter for the car I have a ten year old car without BT audio support. This combined with 1 let\u2019s me get my music or podcasts going in the car automatically. 3. Raspberry Pis (of various flavors) Media servers, interaction with sensors and actuators, and other DIY electronics, particularly useful for home automation in my case. 4. ESP8266s (NodeMCU is the easiest to work with) Sometimes a RPi is overkill in some situations. An ESP8266 is a microcontroller compatible with Arduino code but with built in WiFi. They are great for DIY sensors or actuators to scatter throughout the house. 5. Instant Pot Replaced an egg cooker, yogurt maker, and crock pot with one device. 6. Google Home hub The ability to start music hands free, ask questions, control the home automation and walk through recipes has been surprisingly useful in our home. 7. Chromebook Over the years the power and utility of these cheap laptops and tablets has reached a point where they are more than sufficient for pretty much all of the computing tasks I need from coding to casual games. 8. Streaming Devices (Roku, Chromecast) If you are a cord cutter and want to watch TV or movies you gotta have these. 9. USB Zwave controller/Zigbee coordinator These are the two big home automation protocols. I\u2019m into home automation so this gadget is very useful to me for controlling some lights and other stuff. 10. Nest Hello We have a big porch theft problem and our doorbell is not loud enough. This gadget helps us solve two problems with one device. ",
