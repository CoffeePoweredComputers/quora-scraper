            "answer_text": "Oh..the two times the size question.. English is not my first language and thus I understand this question in 2 different ways: The mass of the planet is twice that of the Earth..The diameter of the planet is twice that of the Earth..In order to avoid complicating the question even further I would assume the same density as Earth's. The massIn this case, considering that the density is mass divided by volume and that the volume of a sphere (let's keep it simple) is 4/3*pi*R\u00b3, it follows that the radius of our planet is: Rp\u00b3=2*Re\u00b3->Rp=SQRT\u00b3(2*Re\u00b3) = 8027 km The escape velocity of our planet is: v= SQRT(2GMp/Rp)= SQRT(4GMe/Rp) = 14.1 Km/s Compare this with Earth's escape velocity of 11.19 km/s or with our fastest launch, that of the New Horizons spacecraft of 16.26 km/s and you may conclude that it wouldn't be impossible or really that hard for the aliens in this scenario 2. Twice the diameter Well, the mass of the planet in this case would be 8 times that of the Earth because, remember that R\u00b3 from previous point? (2*R)\u00b3=8R, thus the volume would be 8 times larger. In this case the escape velocity would be around 22.32 km/s which would need a more powerful rocker engine than what we have built so far but not quite unfeasible from technological point of view.

            "answer_text": " A terrestrial planet two times as big as the Earth would have, according to the above graph of mass/radius relationship, a mass of 20 Earth masses (solid red line). Its surface gravity would be therefore 5 times greater than the Earth\u2019s. I doubt it would support any kind of intelligent terrestrial life, but large marine inhabitants are possible, like plesiosaurs of the Earth\u2019s past. Next, the density and composition of such a planet\u2019s atmosphere could be discussed - is it possible to make a spacecraft with enough fuel to lift from the ground at 5g initial burden, and to penetrate successfully through very thick atmosphere to space? Maybe they could use some kind of baloons to assist the lift to the top layers of the atmosphere. And finally, will such a planet offer the natural \u201cfossil\u201d fuels for a technological revolution and rocket launch? Too many questions for which I have no answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The bigger the planet, the smaller are the humanoids. One has to know how life is implanted on a planet. Before implanting life on a planet, the life carriers (sons of Christ Michael in our case) have visited our planet to see if that was possible. When they decide so, they make lots of experiments in designing the appropriate DNA, so that humanoids to be born on this planet can live with the conditions offered by this planet like gravity, variation of temperature, gases in the atmospheres, and all the other characteristics. These life carriers cannot give life, this is the prerogative of the Holy Spirit, He gives life to this DNA that contains all the necessaries so that a humanoid (a couple) could acquire a free will. These are the first inhabitants. On earth this process took 550,000,000 years .And this is Creation through Evolution. ",

With bigger rockets and smaller payloads, or something like Orion rockets or orbital tethers. For prior discussion, please see: If we lived on a more massive super Earth type exoplanet, could we reach orbit with chemical rockets? How could aliens on Super-Earths ever get into space (much more than twice the gravity, our fueled rockets wouldn't work)? ",

This would make chemical engines extremely difficult to work with\u2026 I think very small probes could be brought to orbit with very large rocket carriers. Nuclear thermal rocket would be better solution. The technology would need to be on high level for them to make such engine very light weight compared to what we are able to engineer right now. Zero gravity would make even more adverse problems to physiology of such aliens. ",
