            "answer_text": "A solid-state drive (SSD, also known as a solid-state disk although it contains neither an actual disk nor a drive motor to spin a disk) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. SSD technology primarily uses electronic interfaces compatible with traditional block input/output (I/O) hard disk drives, which permit simple replacements in common applications. Additionally, new I/O interfaces, like SATA Express, have been designed to address specific requirements of the SSD technology. SSDs have no moving (mechanical) components. This distinguishes them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or floppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads.Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, have lower access time, and lower latency.[6] However, while the price of SSDs has continued to decline over time, consumer-grade SSDs are (as of 2016) still roughly four times more expensive per unit of storage than consumer-grade HDDs.

            "answer_text": "SSD - Solid State Drive (Device) It is meant to store data akin to what an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) has been doing over the years. Key benefits of SSD over HDD Speed - As in 300% or more faster, depending on the taskPower Efficient - Uses atleast 30% less powerCooler - Stays atleast 20% coolerWeight - Weighs 50% lesserDurable - Resistant to higher levels of shock and damageMajor Draw back Very high COST % mentioned above are rough and or approximate.
