            "answer_text": "Thanks a lot Chandrima BhattacharyaThis one is a wonderful question which takes me back to the past, makes me relive my memories, rack my brains and recollect what made me this today. It also gives me an opportunity to appreciate the efforts of all my teachers in making me what I am today:   There isn't just one but many teachers who have come into my life. Each one has taught me something  and all their teachings are combined into a single large binded book, which is my treasure for life!    My book of LIFE!  So here they are:  My father: set goals and achieve them. My mother: Keep going , all is not lost My aunt: Karmayoga , sincerity in every task at hand My grandmother : cooking , thin chapatis like paper , be independent My spouse: patience My daughter : new technologies, now apps and new worthwhile websites My teacher 1: sincerity, discipline in every task, achieve goals My teacher 2: handle team , how to sort out issues, leadership skills My close friend 1: clarity of thoughts My close friend 2: respect, value and feel good about yourself, self esteem  My boss 1: leave some issues , time will sort them out My boss 2 : get tasks done aggressively because deadlines have to be met My boss 3: people management My students: keep on learning, keep me young My school norms and school culture: reading is a joy,  punctuality, honesty, extracurriculars  are importantMy competitors, my colleagues who could not see me rise in higher ranks: set higher goals and achieve them My colleagues who wanted to grow: enhanced my mentoring and coaching skills My colleagues who did not want to move out of comfort zone and change for the betterment of the organization: patience, perseverance, polished my interpersonal skills, people management, mentoring My books:  by authors like Shiv Khera, Rhonda Byrne, Stephen Covey, John Maxwell , Paul Coelho, Charles Dickens, Shakespeare,  Warren Buffet, Jack Canfield, etc: made me think differently and grow professionally I would like to close this answer with this quote:    Happy Teaching and Learning!

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I have 2 Teacher that greatly impact my life. Middle School The first is My Math Teacher from my middle school. Her name is Mrs. Sri (I forgot his last name) or \"'Bu Sri\" in my mother tongue. She is the one who makes me really loves Math. She never ask us to remember formula, or the method of solving a problem. Instead she taught us to analyze the problem, and use any approach we think we can use to solve it. At that time, I didn't really think she is that 'special'. Only when I was in high school, did I realize how her teaching method is different than other teacher (I realize this from talking with friends from other middle school). Because of her, I never really have any trouble understanding Math, especially the Line/Curve Equation. Something that is considered a nightmare for most people.  It is also her who encourage me to take part in a Regional Math Competition (for My City). Being a competitive person I am, I happily join the competition, and surprisingly I won 1st rank. What is funny though (and I still remember it clearly), I never though I will win, because I didn't really have experience at Math competition. That was literally my first competition ever. So at the day of announcement, I choose to stay at school instead of going to the announcement location. Bu Sri go there as my representative. When the school ends that day, She excitedly come to me and gave me a huge trophy, and congratulate me. I am shocked, surprised, and at the same time feeling proud. The trophy was very huge. It is about 3/4 of my height (I am a short kid during my middle school). And then she ask me to gave back the trophy for my formal announcement during school's ceremony (my school always have flag ceremony every monday morning). High School The second is My Physics Teacher from High School, Mr. Anwar Farid, or usually called as Mr.Pongki (he looks like a famous singer named Pongki). Different from Bu Sri, it's not his teaching method that greatly helps me, but his mentoring method. He is like my second father during my high school. He is very friendly and open to his students. The students consider him as their friend (he is a young teacher back then), and jokes around with him. He also very supportive to  his students and encourage them to achieve for the best. I remember when he invite some students to go to astronomy seminar. He drove us there, and drove us back home, all at his own expense, just for the sake of us learning and having a good experience. What an amazing guy he is. During my third year at high school, I and some other students join National Science Olympiad. Luckily I passed the regional elimination, and have to take part on intensive study for next phase. This means I have to skip school for about 2 week. And then somehow the School Headmaster tells me that I can go to that intensive study and skip school. All my study subject will guaranteed to pass the minimum grade. I am not sure why the headmaster suddenly do that, but I suspect that Mr. Farid is the one who suggest it to him (since he is the handler for the competition). After the intensive study, I luckily pass another elimination, and became 1 of 10 person who represent my province, we then go to the final phase in Semarang, Central Java. To my surprise, Mr. Farid also go to Semarang just to cheer me up before the final event. At that time, he also told me that he goes there using his own expense, and hope that the school will somehow reimburse the expense. I was really moved by his action and determined to win. I eventually got bronze medal at the final (the luck really on my side). He is the one who gave me an idea to be someone like him. I always want to be someone who greatly inspire other people, and give impact to their life. ",
