            "answer_text": "Amazon has gotten worse. The more they expand and grow and upsell, the less useful the site is. In what now seems like the old days, it used to be a $25 order created free shipping. But now they want you to buy prime and pay for faster free shipping. And certain items can only ship on certain orders. So Making an order is like putting together a puzzle. And that's about the time I discovered that eBay was a better place to buy things due to freer price controls and greater used selection. Amazon is a logistics company. But I don't really see the benefit of being a member of their club. If I need something now, immediately, I have many stores locally, mainly several Walmarts, most open 24/7. I could buy stuff from within 3 miles at 3am on a Wednesday if I wanted to. Amazon can't compete with that. If I don't need it now, I can wait 3\u20135 days. I won't wait 5\u20137 days so Amazon can work their warehouse magic. Instead I can just order what I need ad hoc from eBay. ",

            "answer_text": "Worse. As an employee, I can say that standardized work and best practices with regard to safety and warehouse SOP has gotten extremely convoluted due to the rapid expansion. No one knows what the standard and BPs are, as it varies from facility to facility, department to department and manager to manager. Quality has hit an all-time low, and managers are pushing associates to rates that are impossible to hit, causing write ups and terminations. Due to this, customer experience has sunk to a new low, there is no sense that the company takes any time at all with shipments (or cares), and makes decisions in its own interest (saving money) rather than \u2018the customer.\u2019 Over time, there have been more damaged products, damaged boxes, wrong products shipped, open/empty boxes and bags, mis sorts resulting in huge delays. A lot of this is due to errors in the robotics and technology and not human error\u2014oh wait, the workers are rushed past a greater speed than the technology can handle. They have conditioned their workers to take an anti-union stance which ironically would help them with these terrible conditions. \u2018Union\u2019 is about the only curse word you can say at the company. It\u2019s not even a terminable offense to walk into the General Manager\u2019s office, shout \u2018F*CK YOU!\u2019 and then leave. In fact, they may even think it\u2019s funny. I have never seen a company as disorganized as this and why I am planning my leave after four years. ",
