            "answer_text": "Feedback system (or feedback loop) is the part of a system in which some portion (or all) of the system's output is used as input for future operations. As an example, let\u2019s take Customer feedback loop that stands for the process of the ongoing improvement of product or business based on the customers\u2019 insights. Each feedback loop has a minimum of four stages. During the first stage, input is created. During the second stage, input is captured and stored. During the third stage, input is analyzed and during the fourth stage, the insight gained from analysis is used to make decisions.  Customer feedback loop should be a constant cycle of mutual interaction between the client and the company where feedback is received and implemented. Accordingly, the changes applied affect the customers, who provide new feedback and the loop repeats.  If you want to learn more details about each stage of customer feedback loop, I\u2019d recommend to check out this article: Customer Feedback Loop. How to Close It Right ",
