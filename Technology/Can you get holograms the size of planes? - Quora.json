            "answer_text": "Yes - that is\u2026if you can find a plane to use as a model for a hologram. First you have to catch one. Some are attracted to bird-seed, so a good method would be spread bird-seed on your lawn\u2026in the hopes one might come there for your hologram. If that dosnt work\u2026go to an airport, jump over the fence, and get a sample for your hologram that way. Be sure you pick the right side hologram for the right size airplane. ",
