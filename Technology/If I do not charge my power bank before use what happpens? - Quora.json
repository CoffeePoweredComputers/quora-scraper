Constant recharging is not good for battery lifetime, but if you need to take a long trip without recharging your bank, then you probably want to charge it to 100% before leaving. You need to decide how many power bank batteries you want to buy every 2-3 years, versus how many long trips you will take with no mains power for recharging your phone. Constant recharging of your bank might knock off 6-12 months of lifetime off your bank. Is that worth it to yo to be able to recharge your phone every time? Personally, I recharge my 16 Ah bank when it gets down to 50%. I can afford new power banks, but hate to have a dead phone. 50% bank charge will recharge my phone several times, so this works fine for 1-2 day trips. I only take short trips, so this woks for me. You have to decide what *you* can afford. ",

            "answer_text": "I think what you mean is before the first initial use like right when you bought it. Since technology has greatly advanced most likely nothing. If anything does happen it'll be so minor you wouldn't be able to tell. The powerbank\u2019s life depends on how you maintain the charge not from the initial box opening. If you keep charging your bank constantly after charging your phone for a little bit then it's gonna lose function sooner. Keeping Lithium ion batteries between 20\u201380 percent is ideal for maximum lifetime so doing that overtime is going to be crucial ",
