            "answer_text": "I completed my CS degree from this college back in 2010, so what I mention here may not completely be true now. Please use your discretion. Unfortunately, the college was terrible in most ways. Poor quality of teaching, lot of unqualified staff (they even had a few people with backlogs in their final year working as lecturers), mindless rules and regulations, and an overall depressing vibe. And to add insult to injury, there were quite a few lecturers who extracted \u2018revenge\u2019 on students they did not like, by deliberately giving them poor scores in internal assessments. Conversely, all the so-called teachers\u2019 pets almost always got perfect scores. Yes, people say that quality of teaching is not important in engineering because it is all about self studies. But I am not in favour of this argument. When I pay through my nose for tuitions at a college, I expect to be taught at least decently. I have heard, from a few sources, that this institute is now much better than it was during the years I studied. But I can\u2019t personally vouch for it. ",

            "answer_text": "I also completed my B.E (CSE) from DBIT. College: It is situated in Kumbalgodu which is far away from Central Bengaluru. So your travelling time may increase. So search college near by your place. In DBIT there is no strict rules about dressing and attendence compared to other colleges. Campus is well maintained. Teaching/Teachers: In engineering teaching hardly mattets. But in DBIT they teach well. They are friendly. Placements: This is the area where DBIT should improve. Overall it is good college. Don't worry about the college, just focus on internals and programming skills. If you want more information about college, ping me personally. Cheers! ",
