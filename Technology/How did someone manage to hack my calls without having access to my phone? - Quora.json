            "answer_text": "If by hacking you mean listening to your calls, this can be done in two ways: By using some cellular network features that should be normally available only to telecom operators and law enforcement agencies.by forcing you, or remotely forcing your phone, to install a spyware.In the first case there is really nothing you can do other than stop using a cellular phone that connects to a cellular networks (there are phones that do not connect to cellular networks) In the second case you may try to reset your phone but you have no guarantee you may get rid of the spyware. How this can be done, depends on your phone, model/brand, etc. 50% of the times it is done by delivering to you a text message with a link in it that you clicked on, inadvertently, thinking it was a legitimate link coming from a legitimate source. Other times it is done using some other software vulnerabilities. For example both Google and Apple are able to install apps on your phone without your prior authorization. if someone hacked into your Google or Apple account they could easily force your phone to install whatever they want. This is just an example. There are tons of other ways this may have happened. ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly, this very well may not be an irrational fear if you have gotten yourself on someone\u2019s bad side. If I remember correctly, there\u2019s a special device called an iMSI catcher, and it essentially functions like a cellphone tower. By tricking your phone into thinking it\u2019s connecting to a real network, you now have the ability to monitor the phone. While I don\u2019t actually own one yet, I believe that while they can\u2019t actually listen in on the call, they could monitor the metadata, but I could be wrong on that. HOWEVER, chances are that this is probably just a slightly irrational fear. ",
