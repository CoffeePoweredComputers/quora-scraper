            "answer_text": "Lube. Lube is your friend. Lube will not do you wrong. Go buy some. She is probably very tense making it harder to penetrate. Females seek security. Reassure her you won\u2019t hurt her. Kiss her deeply. Tell her how beautiful she is. Kiss her deeply. Tell her how lucky you are to have her. Kiss her even more deeply and passionately. Run your fingers lightly up and down the inside of her thigh and bleow her belly button. Suck lightly on her nipples then a bit firmer. Kiss her deeply. Run your tongue from her mouth to her nipples then continue down south till you reach the magic bean, the clitoris. Become friends with her clit. Be nice to her clit. Spend lots of time with her clit. If you want to know if she is turned on, the clit will tell you. You want that clit to get as hard as possible. In a way, the clit is the female version of a boner. The way to get it hard is with foreplay. Lots of foreplay. Get her so aroused she begs you to get inside her. Tease her more by inserting your tongue in her vagina. Then enter slowly with a finger (make sure your hands are clean, under the nails as well and make sure your nails are neatly trimmed). Make love to her vagina with your finger for a while then start at the top agsin. Check back with the clit. Grab her chin, look her in the eyes, and try to penetrate again. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of sites that can give you much more detailed suggestions, but here are some suggestions: Make sure that you use *plenty* of lube.  Different women will have different preferences--experiment until you find one she likes.  Too much is rarely a problem, so use it generously.  Start by pleasuring her using your fingers.  Insert one, and if that is comfortable, keep using that method a few times.  Keep in mind that intercourse is only one of hundreds of ways of making love, so don't overemphasize penetration, and don't be goal-oriented about it.   If you don't  penetrate her in any particular lovemaking session, it is critical that she not feel that she has \"failed\" you.  Once she is comfortable and responding pleasurably to one-finger lovemaking (this may take several sessions), try using two fingers.  Done carefully, this can be a *very* slow transition in size.  You can then go to three fingers, etc. If you are unable to penetrate her with one finger even with lots of lube and after she had been stimulated clitorally, there may be a medical condition that needs checking, or there may be an emotional blockage that needs to be explored--especially if she has had gynecological exams without difficulty.
