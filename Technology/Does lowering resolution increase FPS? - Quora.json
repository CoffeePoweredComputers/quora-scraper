            "answer_text": "Yes it will, it is the only factor that affects fps more than graphics settings. For example, changing the graphics settings from very low to ultra will about double your fps but changing resolution can x8 your fps. For gaming people tend to play these common 16:9 resolutions 720p(720 * 1280), 900p(900 * 1600), 1080p(most common 1080 * 1920), 1440p (1440 * 2560), and finally the glorious 4k (2160 * 3820). (I knew all of those of the top of my head btw) Anyways I personally recommend to never play at a resolution under 1080p because any resolution under and the game starts to look fuzzy. Only play at a lower resolution if you are playing on a very low end machine. Also, they dont sell 720p and 900p monitors anymore so playing at these resolutions on a 1080p monitor will look weird. Anyways back to fps: the more total pixels the lower fps you will get. For example 720 * 1280 = 920,000 while 1080 * 1920 = 2,000,000 so this means since 1080p has about twice as many pixels as 720p downgrading from 1080p to 720p will about double your fps ex: 30fps -> 60fps. Meanwhile I would say the bare minimum playable resolution is 900p and since 900 * 1600 = 1,400,000 downgrading from 1080p (2,000,000 pixels) will about x1.5 your fps ex: 30fps -> 45fps. Anyways enough details here are the raw numbers: 1440p is twice as many pixels as 1080p and 4k is twice as many pixels as 1440p so the fps will change respectivley. (This means 4k is 4 timmes as many pixels as 1080p so 1080p is 4x higher fps ex: 30fps -> 120fps) I hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "In short\u2026yes it does. You could see anywhere from a 5\u201315fps boost if you turn down your resolution However lowering the resolution wouldn\u2019t be the first thing I would go to since it makes the game feel muddy and your visibility is smaller. Try turning down your effects, texture or Anti aliasing. You could also get software, such as Razer cortex that boosts fps by putting the computer in a \u201cgame mode\u201d. My games usually get more stable with Razer Cortex, along with a 5fps boost. ",
