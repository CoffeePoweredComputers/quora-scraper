            "answer_text": "Each has its advantages and strengths. The correct answer to your question is- it depends on several factors. The factor that is perhaps most significant tends to be the one most often overlooked - and that is how much of your field of vision is filled by your screen. Think of the angle that is formed by the left edge of your screen, the bridge of your nose (as the vertex of the angle) and the right edge of your screen. Like all angles, that angle is measured in degrees. This angle (often referred to as FOV for Field Of View) increases as the width of the screen increases and decreases as the screen width decreases. Likewise, the closer you sit to the screen, your field of view (or rather the portion of it filled by your screen) grows larger, while the further you are, the smaller the FOV. In the end, neither your seating distance nor your screen width is critical; it\u2019s the ratio between them, and the aforementioned angle that really matters. There are two main reasons why the FOV matters\u2026 The first has to do with something called the \u201cimmersion effect\u201d or \u201cinduction effect\u201d. Effectively, this is when your brain is \u201ctricked\u201d into regarding what\u2019s happening on the screen as reality (as opposed to \u201cjust a movie\u201d). If you\u2019ve ever jumped in your seat when something on the screen startled you, or cried when something really sad happened, then you\u2019ve experienced the immersion effect. If you\u2019d been watching the same movie on a much smaller screen, you would have been far less likely to have been startled because you wouldn\u2019t have been so immersed in the movie. (Note that although I refer to movies throughout this answer, all of this applies equally to TV shows, sporting events and video games.) There are several factors to the immersion effect but a field of view that is at least 30 degrees is a big one. Consider a 50\u2033 TV (which seems to be the average/standard these days - at least for U.S. consumers)\u2026 if you\u2019re sitting 7 feet away, your FOV is less than 30 degrees. (6.8 feet would be the maximum seating distance in order to have at least a 30 degree FOV with a 50\u2033 screen.) The second reason that your field of view is critical has to do with visual acuity \u2014 your eye\u2019s (finite) ability to see detail in an image. Consider two palm trees\u2026 from a mile away they may look like a single palm tree to your eyes. Likewise, two blades of grass from 100 yards away. Just like those two palm trees or blades of grass, a pair of vertical lines on a screen will look like a single line beyond a certain distance. To fully resolve all the detail in a 1080p image \u2014 to be able to distinguish 2 lines (one pixel wide, right next to each other) among 1920 of them on a 1080p image, someone with 20/20 (or corrected 20/20) vision, will need a screen that fills at least 32 degrees of their field of view. (That\u2019s 6.3 feet from a 50\u2033 TV.) Any added detail (e.g. UHD/\u201c4K\u201d) is imperceptible if your FOV is less than 32 degrees, so if you\u2019re sitting more than 6\u2032 4\u2033 from a 50\u2033 UHD TV, you better have vision that\u2019s better than 20/20 if you want to benefit from the increased resold a 4K image. As your FOV increases beyond 32 degrees, (whether because your screen is larger or because you\u2019re sitting closer,) you will experience at least some benefit from a UHD/4K image. Someone with 20/20 vision will need an enormous 64 degree FOV to fully resolve all the detail in a UHD image - and that\u2019s actually so wide as to be detrimental to the immersion effect! Both SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) and THX have recommended minimum, maximum and optimal seating distances for a given screen width. They are all based on FOV. If a movie theater wants to be \u201cTHX Certified\u201d, someone seated in the front row of seats can have no more than a 70 degree FOV, while someone sitting in the furthest row of seats can have no less than a 26 degree FOV. There are other factors in THX certification but those two rules cannot be violated. One nice thing about the THX optimal recommendation (40 degree FOV) is that the math gets pretty easy. Assuming a screen aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (the ATSC/HDTV standard), you simply take your seating distance in feet and multiply by 10 to get the optimal screen size in inches (measured diagonally). If you sit 8\u2032 away, you\u2019ll want an 80\u2033 screen. Going the other way, you divide by 10 so if you have a 55\u2033 TV, the optimal seating distance is 5.5 feet. It\u2019s here that we get to the crux of things. If you sit 10\u2032 away (and want to continue to do so), then a 100\u2033 screen is required \u2014 but a very good projector and screen will cost a fraction of what you\u2019d pay for a 100\u2033 TV. So budgetary factors and optimal FOV will often favor a projector and screen over a TV \u2014 but only if you have sufficient light control for a projected image. As other answers have indicated, it doesn\u2019t take much light for a projected image to look \u201cwashed out\u201d (even with a very bright projector) \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing immersive about a washed out picture. Of course, there are screens that do a much better job (presenting an image that is not washed out) with fairly high levels of ambient room light, but they\u2019re expensive. Depending on your budget and/or your ability to darken the room, the best solution may simply be to move the sofa 5\u2032 away from your 50\u2033 screen. Unless someone else in the house is unwilling to have the furniture arranged that way\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Is a Projector or TV right for you? A projector is good for optimizing the price of your screen, building an immersive experience, and having the appeal of jaw-dropping size. A TV is brighter, and has a simple input/output situation, and also doesn\u2019t have any bulbs to burn out. But you\u2019ll need to understand several other things, about resolutions, the physical requirements of using a projector (spacing), and what the ease of use looks like for projectors before you can make a call. Projector vs TV: Screen Size in Relation to Price  First and foremost: are home theater projectors worth it? To do a quick pass at this, I\u2019ll pull the best selling TVs at 3 diagonal-size price points, and two representative projectors from the high and low end of the market, all from Amazon, and see how the price-per-diagonal-inch shakes out:  Okay, so, there\u2019s definitely some interesting things going on here. First, observe that huge jump in the 55, to 65, to 75 inch Television panels. There\u2019s the price-point island I was talking about: from 55\u201d to 65\u201d the price increases more than 130%. And what are you getting for that? A big panel, sure, but note that both projectors are capable of 120\u201d. Literally more than double 55\u201d. Report this ad Projectors, like TVs, have high and low price points. Because of that, you\u2019ll be able to find a TV or Projector to fit your budget no matter how large it is. But think about the high end projector for a moment. It\u2019s obvious that, at 120\u201d diagonal, it costs much less per diagonal inch than the 75\u201d Television panel. But what about if we restricted the high end projector to projecting a 75\u201d screen\u2013hold it to the same standard as the 75\u201d panel\u2013and ran the numbers that way? You can see in the table that, even the higher end projector setup to project a 75\u201d screen is more cost effective than the 75\u201d Television What about the low end projector? If the high end projector is cost-effective, even when projecting 75\u201d, we know the low end projector will be. But what about if we compare the low end projector maximum projection size to the high end Televisions? If you look at the price per diagonal inch, when comparing the low end projector to either the 65\u201d or the 75\u201d panel, we can say the following: when compared to budget projectors, best-selling Televisions tend to cost double for half as much screen.

In any case, as most other electronic devices, computerized projectors also have their own arrangement of points of interest and impediments. It is beneficial to examine these before you select a projector that will best match your needs and prerequisites. Favorable circumstances of Projectors Piqo Projector: Enormous Sized Picture: Digital projectors can be utilized to make amazingly huge measured pictures much the same as those found in a film lobby. In spite of the fact that a film projector with huge light yield can create pictures of up to 300\", even generally accessible advanced projectors are equipped for delivering sharp pictures as large as 120\". Bit of leeway While Creating Small Images: Even if the projector is utilized to deliver littler examined pictures of to 60\", it can in any case spare you a great deal of cash when contrasted with a LCD TV of a similar size. In addition, the image at this size is exceptionally splendid and can even be utilized with a couple of lights on. Saves money on Space: A roof mount projector does not consume any space on the floor and remains for the most part inconspicuous when not being used. Indeed, even a retractable screen can be put far out when not being used, which is superior to anything a cumbersome TV that is hard to move as often as possible. As I would like to think, the best minimized projector is: This projector offers a distinctive picture at an extraordinarily short separation from the projection surface. Set it to just 5 crawls to get 60-inch full picture full picture and full picture, or go more remote to get pictures up to 100 inches. Simplicity of Installation: Other than roof mount projectors that need a specialist for establishment, an ordinary projector is anything but difficult to arrangement and should be possible absent much exertion. Impediments of Projectors Light Can Play Spoilsport: A projector works best when worked in low light conditions as the photos delivered are more clear and more splendid. This can frequently demonstrate to be a drawback when you are tending to a gathering where your group of spectators needs to record highlights. Exorbitant Maintenance: The support cost of home theater projectors is frequently on the higher side than that of a LCD TV. The light of a projector should be supplanted once in a while, contingent upon your use and the projector model. ",

            "answer_text": "It completely depends on your choice of use and your budget to invest on. If you have a good space at home or even looking for a device in office for presentation purpose, then a projector is the best option to go for. Projector and screen for a larger audience in open space is the best option than TV.  With a projector, you will have the advantage of a large-sized picture, saves a lot of money than TV, no special space required and also easy to maintain. TV, on the other hand, are upgraded with the times changing. TVs are now available in a wider size and high-end features that make the viewing experience more luxury. However, it does take your space is far costlier than a projector.Before you invest in projector screen or TV you need to have a good technical knowledge and understanding of the specification. Compare the brands, prices, and features of the respective devices that make your investment easier and long term. ",

            "answer_text": "(This answer has primary relevance in the Indian market, however it may be a similar case elsewhere too) This is one of the big inequities in the Home electronics market currently, in our opinion. A decent 55\u2033 HD TV can cost anywhere from 60\u201370k and above. Once you get down to serious sizes (anything over 90\u2013100\u2033) the costs of a HD TV are prohibitive, often costing over 2 Lakhs. And there is a natural limit to how big the TVs screen size can get. On the other hand, a HD projector from any world class brand (Epson/BenQ) is available in the 70k-1.1L range, along with a high grade screen (that can be from 90\u2033 going all the way to 200\u2033) costing around 20\u201340k, you will be able to create a great HD viewing experience for as low as 1\u20131.5L.
