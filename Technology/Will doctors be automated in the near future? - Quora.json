            "answer_text": "I very much appreciate this question . Yes, for the the poor with certain results and probably the sooner the better. This will be a fabulous test of Dr. AI's ability in lessening healthcare costs. I am sure the following of coattails will lead to mental health exams, counseling and HUMAN review boards. Hopefully with a remote power source connection because of course, we think we have it all covered. Also, some people just want somebody to talk to, this could be the best placebo of the mental health care system global. Thomas Edison said the doctor of the future will prevent illness. Savings upon savings could be the norm. A real plus to this 21st century approach will be a properly trained attendant to escort the patient through the healthcare visit at appropriate points of examination and treatment. ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion: I doubt it. AI will help the doctor to make an intelligent decision, remote surgery looks promising with 5G, and diagnostics will be automated. For example, your blood test is already automated so that your report is available the next day. Another promising application is the use of QR codes to identify you, track you, and automatically give you reports etc. Bottom line, AI is making the doctor\u2019s job easier by doing most of the mundane things. Think of this as a pilot. He can put the plane on auto-pilot, but he can override the auto-pilot. If anything, it will reduce the support staff, especially the clerical end. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Will doctors be automated in the near future? Doctors were automated in the recent past, if you start with automation of work doctors used to do. Billing, lab tests, record keeping, diagnosis, patient communication were all things a country doctor would do just a few generations ago. Now the work is automated, supporting clinical and administrative healthcare workers including doctors. And many of the instruments doctors use to treat patients are automated. ",
