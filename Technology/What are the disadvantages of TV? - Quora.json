            "answer_text": "TV can be an important information source but it can also be tremendously misinforming also. I like Mark Twain\u2019s quote about newspapers; If you don\u2019t read the papers you are uninformed. And if you do read the papers you are misinformed. TV is the same. Only 6 large corporations own 95% of all the media companies in this country. That includes newspapers, Radio and Television. Since they are so large and since all our politicians can be bought by the highest bidder the news can be skewed to show a viewpoint which is then made to seem to be the mainstream thought in society but is really a minority opinion. This presents a real problem especially in a democracy. A democracy depends upon the majority of voting public to know what they are voting about. It relies on the majority top have a grasp and comprehension about the issues. But if the public does not get the correct information. Or if the correct information is too difficult to find then all the wrong decisions will be made. How many people have the time to sift thru all the different media outlets and then weight all the conflicting information? Worse still is when the information is not covered at all. Fox news takes a lot of heat for covering issues that the other media channels do not speak about. But did anyone else notice that many of the issues that they covered have become very large important issues today? And then they get excoriated by those other channels for even mentioning the topic. This seems to be a blatant attempt to control the populations thought on these subjects. And we used to think that Russian propaganda was extreme! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the major disadvantages of TV is that shows lack the quality they used to have.  It was always fun watching MASH or The Red Green Show and seeing what would happen to the characters in the next episode.   The worst part of TV these days would have to be the \"reality\" shows that are currently popular, such as the Kardashians or the Real Housewives.  You don't learn anything from these shows and the people featured are rather unintelligent with lapsed morals.  The vote-off shows are just as bad because they can get boring after a while, plus they are basically just people humiliating themselves by doing things they would never do in real life.  The sitcoms that are currently on TV don't last long because, to tell the truth, they aren't that funny.  They may start off funny but it seems at some point the writers just run out of material. I have found myself watching shows that have been on many years like \"The Simpsons\" and reruns of older shows because, aside from \"The Middle\", I can't stand most of the shows on TV these days.
