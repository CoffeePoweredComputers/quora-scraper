            "answer_text": "Since a fugitive would never answer this question on Quora, being a lawyer with brief practice in criminal defence, I think I can attempt to answer this question.  There are three kinds of fugitives: Those who fear that they will be caught any moment Those who get caught the moment their godfather takes their influence from themThose who know that they are too powerful for law to put them behind barsI've been interested in criminal law and criminal defence ever since I enrolled in legal education or maybe way before that, always wondering why people become criminals. I used to meet people affiliated to local gangs in a hope to make a career helping criminals escape the large and long claws of the justice system. Here is how it works: you get to know that someone you know has contacts with someone who is indulged in illegal activities or a part of a gang involved in organised crime. You, with aspirations for career in criminal law want to meet and make contacts with as many deviants as possible somehow manage to contact people who know criminals and you get introduced. In the process, I happened to meet several people who were fugitives falling in the second category mentioned above. After all, meeting a fugitive is not a crime and that too when you have a license to practice law.  1. Those who know they would be caught any moment: legal procedures involve combing through every possible place where a fugitive could take shelter and at little later stage attachment of all his properties. This kind of fugitive usually contacts unrelated friends and finds a place far away to avoid getting caught. With passage of time, they start a new profession if they are not habitual criminals and live a normal life. Habitual criminals usually keep their criminal activities wherever they go.Life as a fugitive may not be easy for a person who is not a habitual criminal. He has to find a new place, he has to sever all contact with family and friends, he has to find a place and he has to strictly stay away from any law enforcement officers. Such people usually make news whenever caught and are Google-able. One such case I remember stumbling upon during my case studies was the case of Hanna Foster's murder. Hanna Foster, a 17-year-old girl, was abducted, raped, and murdered by a truck driver named Maninder Pal Singh Kohli in the United Kingdom. He became a fugitive when he ran away from the UK to India and lived in Punjab for a while before marrying a Nepali women in the Indian city of Dargeeling in the state of West Bengal. How he managed all this and how he managed to run away from Interpol and law enforcement authorities of two countries with a reward of $100,000 is an interesting story and can be found on the Internet. 2. Those who get caught the moment their godfather takes their influence from them: Such people usually live an enslaved life in which their masters practically order them to lead a life in a manner they want. They live where their masters want them to live and do whatever their masters order, because they know that if ever they will disobey, they will be killed or caught by the police. Nevertheless they do get their money, allowances and freedom to do criminal acts in the interest of their gang leader or master. This is how a organised criminal gang operates.  3.Those who know that they are too powerful for law to put behind bars: These are the gang leaders with enough influence in politics and administration that they are fugitives in the eyes of the law but are usually untouched by the justice system. These are the kinds of people portrayed in movies like The Godfather. Some who are not so powerful build their influence by periodically paying police. P.S. I've recently left criminal defence practice. ",

            "answer_text": "Its hard bruh. You cant get a decent 9\u20135 job because the man can come in and arrest you. You better not go home to your family or friends because they are being watched. You have to run all the time and start over somewhere far away. I prefer Mexico but then they can always get the federales to arrest you here and take you to the border and hand you over like a sack of potatos. you are always afraid of being caught by somebody or snicthed out by a MF wanting to get the reward. Thats the worst part. That you probably wont be able to find out who did it so you can beat their ass. Stitches for Snitches! ",
