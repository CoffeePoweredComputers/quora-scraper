            "answer_text": "Despite the simplicity of the interface, Airbnb is a complex platform that combines numerous features. There are three types of profiles: guest, host, and admin. The functionality of the guest and host profiles is created according to their needs. So, I\u2019ve just checked with Wappalyzer to know which technologies Airbnb uses.  As you can see, the main programming language is Ruby. The web framework is Ruby on Rails. JS framework is React. JavaScript Libraries - Moment.js. So, if you want to create a similar website to Airbnb, keep in mind the following programming languages that should be used: Technology Stack server-side: ElasticSearch, Grape, I18N [2 languages], PostgreSQL, Rack, Rails, Ruby, Sidekiqclient-side: CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, React.jstools (hosting, monitoring, etc.): Airbrake, AWS S3, BrowserStack, Codeship, Confluence, GitHub, Heroku, Slack, Swagger, Testrail, Youtrackintegrations: Intercom, Loco - Translation Management System, Pexip, SendGrid, Stripe, TwilioI hope I covered your question That\u2019s it for now, folks) Check out: > How Much Does It Cost To Build A Website Like Airbnb?
