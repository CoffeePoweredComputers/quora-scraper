Some ecommerce businesses sell physical products which means that the business has actual tangible products that they ship to their customers, and when their customers open the shipping package there will be a physical product they can touch, feel and see. Digital products, on the other hand, are something ecommerce businesses can sell online but they\u2019re not an actual physical product that can be shipped to their customers. Oftentimes, once a digital product is purchased online a customer can download the digital files straight away with no need for the business to actually ship anything to the customer. Businesses can also provide digital or in-person services that their customers can purchase online. These services can include anything from design services or streaming services (both are digital services) to home improvement services or dog-walking services (which are in-person services). Any business that provides a service, rather than a physical or digital product, can be included in this category.
