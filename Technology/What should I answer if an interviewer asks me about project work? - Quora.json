My main role was backend development with PHP, Laravel 5 , MySQL, and AWS services. I was mostly working on the REST API and was in charge of integrating the OAuth 2.0 server into the project, but I collaborated on some specific frontend modules when needed, since I know some AngularJS and HTML as well. The best part (technical, at least) about this project is that I got to learn a lot about ElasticSearch, which I was really curious about. We were able to deploy the first version in 4 months and then continued to improve upon it with feedback from the AB Testing and digital marketing team the client had. Hope this helps! :) ",
