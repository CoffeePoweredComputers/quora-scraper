            "answer_text": "Hacking is mostly a collection of things you do with your computer (or in a broad sense, your phone or other stuff) in a way the maker didn\u2019t design it to. If you mean security, get started by buying a cheap old wireless router, set it to WEP, download Kali and attempt to break into WEP. Don\u2019t just follow the guides and tutorials, and make sure you understand what each and every step means. This is very important. WEP is by far the easiest and most insecure wifi protection ever commercially available. But, during your journey you will learn how to operate and navigate around a primarily Linux environment, and hopefully how basic concepts of encryption work as well as awareness of, WEP or WPA2, how (in)secure the world around you is. Contrary to what the movies portray however, hacking doesn\u2019t really involve that much of networking (as in IP stuff) and \u201cdefeating encryption with Matrix-like insta-toolkits\u201d. It\u2019s usually a lot of commands after commands in the shell that results in you defeating security, combined with some degree of observation of the target\u2019s behavior. Even in modern websites, you would go into JavaScript terminal and do things like trying to interfere with how your browser talks to the server to get the information you need. Sometimes this can lead you to interesting results, like how you can use JavaScript to expand your \u201czoom\u201d in some browser games so you can see more enemies, or manually unplug the network cable to stall down your \u201cattack\u201d commands and make them stack, so that when you re-plug the cable and they are sent to the server, you instantly combo your enemy to death without allowing him to heal. It\u2019s only the money that counts, right? Your ethics don\u2019t matter, even in a supposedly \u201cfair\u201d duel! Things like automatically fetching your friends\u2019 class registration data (usually private, but some schools let it loose because you can repeat and modify HTTP requests, basically all from a single Chrome plugin, and some school websites don\u2019t protect against this) would also constitute hacking, to a lesser degree. You can use it to find out how your friends and classmates are avoiding a particular professor, or you can combine a hot chick\u2019s (or dude) class data with the class schedule, along with her Facebook check ins, to see precisely where she goes in a day. You can then \u201cbump into\u201d her more often. The rest is up to you, young man (or woman). Now that\u2019s stalking, right? But, after all I\u2019ve learned about security, network, and information over the years, I\u2019m just saying this: protect your data. That hot chick could be you. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to read and you need to practice. You need to understand how hardware works and why. The same goes with software, you need to understand how it works and why. Hardware and software vary by type so you need to understand each class and find out the reason behind their specialization or generic use (for example, Operating Systems, business applications, utilities, and databases). You must know how data is created, stored, and used by people or machines. You also must need to know and understand how they communicate and of course, their limitations and weaknesses. You also need to read the basics of how your government works, its legal system and check if it it has some data privacy act, cybercrime, ad security laws in place. Ignorance of the law excuses no one. Stupid pranks, touching other people\u2019s stuff and/or learning about other people\u2019s lives can cost you your freedom. That\u2019s a lot of information to learn just the basics. You need to dedicate two to three years of your life to learning. Two to three years of practice. The point of all these torture is to turn you into an Engineer or an innovator like Leonardo Da Vinci. Once you learn the basics, you specialize because you cannot learn everything. Now since you\u2019re learning it all by yourself, the learning curve is steep. You\u2019ll end up spending more time than usual because you don\u2019t have a mentor. Without a mentor, you\u2019ll probably have to add two more years to your effort. Five years of dedicated learning will suffice. Five years is a long time. Five years and still not sure if you learned the right stuff because by that time, the technology you\u2019re using now has changed and a lot of things you learned has become obsolete. You don\u2019t stop learning. You don\u2019t stop trying. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear, There\u2019s a caveat that I have to share before diving into these sites. Hacking isn\u2019t a single subject that anyone can pick up overnight. In the title of this article, I mention hacking like a pro. This can not be accomplished after reading one article and visiting a few of these sites \u2013 the phrase is used to imply that in time and with lots of practice, you can in fact learn to hack like a pro. For our many readers that are already at that expert-hacker level, a few of these sites may not be for you. They may feel to simple and basic \u2013 for \u201cscript-kiddies\u201d as some might say. The truth is, we all had to start somewhere, and these websites are offered as a starting point for those people just embarking down the wrote toward hackerdom. Your intention for learning how to hack is completely your own. I do not judge. However, it should be noted that there are two forms of hacking \u2013 \u201cwhite hat\u201d and \u201cblack hat\u201d. White hat hackers call themselves \u201cethical hackers\u201d, in that they find vulnerabilities simply to make systems and applications more secure for everyone. However, there\u2019s a whole other community of hackers \u2013 the black hats \u2013 who find vulnerabilities only to exploit them as much as possible. Now that you know what sort of community you may be entering, let\u2019s get on with the list of top sites where you can learn to hack. #1 \u2013 Hacking Tutorial: Tech Tips and Hacking Tricks Sometimes, perfect English isn\u2019t everything. Hacking Tutorial is an example of when the writing skill of the author doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to the quality of his or her technical knowledge. This is actually the case over at Hacking Tutorial, where the author offers articles like \u201cClient Side Attack Using Adobe PDF Escape EXE Social Engineering\u201d, \u201cExploiting MS11_003 Internet Explorer Vulnerability\u201d, and \u201cHacking Using BeeF XSS Framework\u201d.  The articles are usually short, but actually offer highly technical, step-by-step instructions on how to do the task at hand, and the tricks and tweets absolutely work, unless the exploit has been patched. It\u2019s a small blog, but it\u2019s a good one for the volume of technical tricks that you\u2019ll find there. #2 \u2013 EvilZone Hacking Forums While the name, EvilZone, isn\u2019t exactly the most inviting \u2013 it is easily one of the largest forum communities that you\u2019ll find on the subject of hacking. With over 13,042 members and over 50,000 posts (and counting), this community likely has the skills and knowledge to answer any programming question you could possibly have. Just be careful about coming across as a \u201cnoob\u201d \u2013 these guys don\u2019t handle newcomers with kid gloves, so be careful.  You\u2019d definitely be best off working through the programming and encyclopedia sections first, where you\u2019ll find areas with projects, tutorials and a lot more that will help you become educated and well-versed in hacking techniques and terminology. #3 \u2013 Hack a Day While I certainly don\u2019t want to offer a nod to any blogs that may be considered competition, you really have to give credit where credit is due when it comes to a particular niche like hacking \u2013 and Hack a Day definitely offers an amazing library of information for anyone looking for specific categories like cellphones, GPS or digital cameras. Over the years, Hack A Day has transformed the site into a fairly popular blog.  More than any other site, this particular \u201chacking\u201d site is very much hardware based, and they redefine the meaning of the word hacking by helping you learn how to hack up electronic devices like a Gameboy or a digital camera and completely modifying it, or building electronics for the sole purpose of hacking other commercial devices. You\u2019ll also find a popular and busy forum section as well \u2013 a high point of the site.  While I personally don\u2019t find the articles themselves very detailed (as an EE, I like schematics and elaborate descriptions), the site makes up for it with video demonstrations throughout. #4 \u2013 Hack In The Box Hack In The Box has really change significantly through the years. It is rebranded as HITB, and the site is completely transformed into what looks like a WordPressed-based platform. Still, today Hack In The Box remains focused on security and ethical hacking. However, it has obviously shifted gears at some point and changed to a more content-focused approach with a greater volume of news, and fewer in-depth articles with detailed hacks.  This transition makes it less of a place to go for actually technical hacking tips, and more of a daily spot to get your latest fix of hacking news. The site is updated frequently, and of course you can also go for the print version of the HITB-branded magazine if you want.  Clearly, HITB has gone very commercialized, but it is a great resource for news for anyone interested in the latest gossip throughout the hacking community. #5 \u2013 Hack This Site! As always, saving the best for last \u2013 I\u2019d like to introduce Hack This Site! This website is one of the coolest, free programmer training sites where you can learn how to hack accepting one of the challenges along the left navigation pane of the main page.  The site designers offer various \u201cmissions,\u201d where you need to figure out the vulnerability of a site and then attempt to use your new-found hacking skills (you\u2019ve carefully studied all of the articles on the site, right?) to hack the web page. Missions include Basic, Realistic, Application, Programming and many others.  If you\u2019re able to figure out how to properly hack any of the most difficult missions on this site, then you\u2019ve definitely earned the title of professional hacker. Have you ever tried any of the tips offered at any of these websites and do they work? Do you have any good resources of your own for readers to learn how to hack like the pros?

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s great if you want to learn hacking. The world\u2019s software is currently not very secure. We need many hackers who will hunt for software vulnerabilities so that the owners of the systems can fix the vulnerabilities. Start by creating your own hacker account on HackerOne (Bug Bounty, Vulnerability Coordination). This will give you access to vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs on which you can test and hone your skills. As you make progress and improve your hacker score, you will get invited to more demanding bug bounty programs. To learn, read everything on the topic you can find. Perhaps the greatest learning comes from vulnerability reports submitted by other white hat hackers. You find them on the Hacktivity list (Latest Security Vulnerabilities Found, Rewarded, or Disclosed). HackerOne also publishes blog postings (Latest Updates and Insights About HackerOne) with tips and techniques for hackers. Many white hats have Twitter accounts and blogs, sharing their learnings with the world. Read and study as much and as often as you can. If you prefer video over written text, go here: HackerOne. A great book to read is Web Hacking 101 by Peter Yaworski (Web Hacking 101 by Peter Yaworski [Leanpub PDF/iPad/Kindle]). Another excellent resource is Google\u2019s Bug Hunter University: Bughunter University. Starting from the first vulnerability report you submit to a program, you are helping to make the internet more secure. Happy hacking! P.S. I also recommend the answers here on Quora by a famous hacker: Jobert Abma ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what you want to hack. Hacking websites and hacking WiFi are two completely different things. Exploiting software and exploiting iOS are two completely different things. There are many different categories. So first, pick something you want to hack. Let\u2019s say you pick websites, then learn loads of web development. Make sure to build full-stack client-server or network-based web applications. Doing so will get you the most crucial knowledge you need to start hacking web apps. Then, you also need to know operating systems and computer networking. You should know computer networking, Linux, and Windows regardless of what you pick as your area. But you also need programming knowledge. To do it right, once you have the knowledge of how stuff works, then you can find a hacking book or tutorial for beginners and learn. elearn security has some good stuff. the broken web app is great if you want something free. There\u2019s a lot of free places but a lot of high quality places to pay to learn. Although take that last bit with a grain of salt as there are also a lot of crappy places that could rip you off. That\u2019s how hackers get good is by knowing how stuff works. Once you know that, you can learn to hack properly. Not before. Remember that being a hacker is about going for the answers that no one is is willing to go for and finding them. ",

            "answer_text": "What Is Hacking? The \u201chacking\u201d we'll be talking about in this document is exploratory programming in an open-source environment. If you think \u201chacking\u201d has anything to do with computer crime or security breaking and came here to learn that, you can go away now. There's nothing for you here. Hacking is primarily[1] a style of programming, and following the recommendations in this document can be an effective way to acquire general-purpose programming skills. This path is not guaranteed to work for everybody; it appears to work best for those who start with an above-average talent for programming and a fair degree of mental flexibility. People who successfully learn this style tend to become generalists with skills that are not strongly tied to a particular application domain or language. Note that one can be doing hacking without being a hacker. \u201cHacking\u201d, broadly speaking, is a description of a method and style; \u201chacker\u201d implies that you hack, and are also attached to a particular culture or historical tradition that uses this method. Properly, \u201chacker\u201d is an honorific bestowed by other hackers. Hacking doesn't have enough formal apparatus to be a full-fledged methodology in the way the term is used in software engineering, but it does have some characteristics that tend to set it apart from other styles of programming. Hacking is done on open source. Today, hacking skills are the individual micro-level of what is called \u201copen source development\u201d at the social macro-level. [2] A programmer working in the hacking style expects and readily uses peer review of source code by others to supplement and amplify his or her individual ability.Hacking is lightweight and exploratory. Rigid procedures and elaborate a-priori specifications have no place in hacking; instead, the tendency is try-it-and-find-out with a rapid release tempo.Hacking places a high value on modularity and reuse. In the hacking style, you try hard never to write a piece of code that can only be used once. You bias towards making general tools or libraries that can be specialized into what you want by freezing some arguments/variables or supplying a context.Hacking favors scrap-and-rebuild over patch-and-extend. An essential part of hacking is ruthlessly throwing away code that has become overcomplicated or crufty, no matter how much time you have invested in it.The hacking style has been closely associated with the technical tradition of the Unix operating system[3] Recently it has become evident that hacking blends well with the \u201cagile programming\u201d style. Agile techniques such as pair programming and feature stories adapt readily to hacking and vice-versa. In part this is because the early thought leaders of agile were influenced by the open source community. But there has since been traffic in the other direction as well, with open-source projects increasingly adopting techniques such as test-driven development. Stages of Learning How To Hack Learning to compose music has three stages. First, you have to learn the basic mechanical technique of an instrument \u2014 fingering and how to play scales. Then you have to train your ear to understand musical patterns. Finally, you must learn how to recombine musical patterns into original creations. Hacking is similar. The hacking equivalent of fingering is learning the capabilities of programming languages, and the mechanics of using tools like editors, interpreters, and compilers. (If you don't understand these terms, see The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO.) We won't cover those mechanics here as they vary too much according to what language you're using. Tutorials for all the languages you might want to use are available on the Web; use a search engine. The equivalent of playing scales is writing small programs, alone. Unfortunately, playing scales (a) doesn't teach you anything about music, and (b) is boring as hell. Similarly, writing toy programs doesn't tend to teach you much about hacking, and (b) will tend to de-motivate you unless the program immediately solves a problem you care about. Most formal programming instruction gets to playing scales and stops. Thus, it tends to produce coders who are poor at collaborating with each other and have the equivalent of no ear for music \u2014 a poor feel for software design and architecture. The Incremental-Hacking Cycle There is a better way to learn. I call it the incremental-hacking cycle. First, pick a program that does something you are interested in. Ideally, it should be a program you use regularly and have opinions about. The next best thing is a program you don't normally use, but that does something you think is interesting. For this learning method to work, you should avoid trying to hack on code that bores you.The program you choose doesn't have to do anything serious. Many programmers have honed their skills by improving games that they enjoyed. The only drawback to this is that modern games are often quite large and complicated, and may be beyond the grasp of a raw beginner. For this reason, you may want to investigate one of the classic text-oriented games that still survive; nethack is a prime example, and there are many others.If you don't already know the program, learn how to use it. Read the documentation. Develop a mental model of how it works.Pick a small feature to change or add.Search the code until you find the part you need to modify.Note: you should specifically not try to read the entire program. You will just exhaust and frustrate yourself if you do that. Instead, use the module structure of the code to zero in on just the part you need to understand. Along the way, you will learn things about how the whole program fits http://together.It's a good exercise to add explanatory comments and notes to the code as you figure out things about it. This will help your memory, and will help you organize your thoughts as well.Make, test, debug, and document your change.Documenting your change is important. If you develop the habit of doing this early, you'll produce much higher-quality work.Send your change as a patch to the program maintainers. See the Software Release Practice HOWTO for tips on how to do this in an effective and polite way.I originally described this as an optional step; a wise friend pointed out that probably I shouldn't have. Solitary noodling on your instrument is all very well for practice, but music is completed and validated when the creativity in it is heard by other people. Solitary noodling on your computer is similarly good for practice, but hacking is completed when other people use what you wrote. That real-world test is important.Sometimes (oftener when you are just starting) your patches will be rejected. You need to learn to cope with this. It doesn't mean you're doomed to fail in your quest; usually what it does mean is that you have not read the code carefully enough, or (just as usually) you have missed something important aboout the culture and practices of the developmemt group you are trying to contribute to. These mistakes can be repaired.Now, ask yourself: do I understand this entire program?If yes, you're done. If no, go back to step 3. This time, pick a different and perhaps slightly more difficult thing to change.The point of this exercise is to learn how to sneak up on the problem of understanding a program, rather than trying to tackle all of the complexity at once. As you go through this loop several times, you will gradually develop a more complete representation in your mind of the way the whole program fits together. At some point you will reach a threshold where you understand it all \u2014 or anyway enough of it for whatever your final purpose is. Developing Your Design Sense To train yourself, start small. If possible, first do the incremental-hacking cycle as an exercise on very small programs or scripts, 10-50 lines. These may be hard to find, as most programs of any use are larger than this. Most programs this small are scripts in shell, Perl, Python, or Tcl; that's a trait to look for when trawling the Web for them. When you have done the incremental-hacking cycle on several very small programs (or if you are unlucky enough to not find any suitable very small ones), try it on slightly larger programs. Look for codebases in the range of 100-500 lines. When you master that level, go to the order of magnitude, 1000-5000 lines. By the time you master the 1K-5K level, you will have entered the bottom end of the capability range of what is usually considered a skilled programmer. At or before the 1K-5K level, you should occasionally begin to notice that you are having itches to change the structure or organization of a program, not just its features. You may find yourself thinking \u201cThis code is ugly\u201d and having feelings about making it prettier and cleaner. When this happens, pay attention. This is your design sense trying to wake up. Don't rush to patch in another feature. Instead, start to explore the program that gives you this itch at a higher level. Now might be a good time to try to read all the code, but don't be too concerned if you can't; most programs are just too big and messy for gulping them down all at once to work. Just try to get a grip on what you need to know to clean things up. You are now entering the intermediate portion of learning to hack. This involves not merely changing surface-visible features but doing what is called \u201crefactoring\u201d \u2014 reorganizing the code internally so that it is cleaner and has better architecture (better hiding of data, narrower interfaces between different parts, more functional separation among modules). Once your design sense (your equivalent of musical ear) is activated, you'll often find that you start refactoring each program you work on as rapidly as the third or fourth time around the incremental-hacking cycle. In fact, this is exactly how skilled hackers normally approach learning the code of large programs \u2014 by tinkering and refactoring and rewriting until they grok what is going on. You make small changes in order to learn how to make large ones. If you successfully refactor three or four large systems, you will not just develop strong programming skills, you will be on your way to something much more rare and powerful: becoming a software architect, one who can do original design of large software systems. This is the only way I know of for fledgling software architects to train their design sense. It may be the only way there is. Being original In my analogy with music, I said that you eventually need to learn how to recombine musical patterns (which you have learned by listening to music and practicing performance) into original compositions. I chose that way of describing creativity carefully, because it applies to software even more than it does to music. Before you have read and absorbed the lessons of a lot of code, you will probably not have in your head the pattern library you need to be creative on scales larger than very small ones. One purpose of doing the incremental-hacking cycle is to immerse yourself in a lot of code \u2014 at increasing complexity scales \u2014 under circumstances that provide you with motivation to keep reading. Eventually you will lead group projects and do entirely original work. Do not feel you have to rush this or force it; if you give your skills time to mature, your first original composition will be better for it. By contributing effectively to existing open-source projects you will learn the skills (including the communications skills) that you need to run your own projects.  [1] It is certainly possible to hack things other than software, and people in the maker culture do it. But the term \u201chacking\u201d originated among people who tinkered with software and still radiates out from there. Besides, the author is not really qualified to write about learning other kinds. [2] In former times, people hacked on closed source, when they could, because there was no alternative. Things have changed for the better. [3] Before 1983 or so the association between hacking and Unix was less strong, but the details of how that changed are now mainly relevant only to historians. ",

In order to learn hacking you must first start with learning a programming language. I suggest you to learn Python programming language because it's independent from others. A good hacker must have knowledge of more than one programming language HTML, Java, C++ , C . First you start with learning correct concepts of Hacker, Cracker , Networking etc. There are three types of Hacker white hat, Black hat, grey hat. You must know about all these.Operating system you must prefer is Ubuntu because it's light and easy to customize. You must start with basic knowledge about networking and Working at MS-DOS . You can prefer some books like :-1) The Hacker Playbook 2.2) Hacking: The Art of Exploitation.3) CompTIA Security+ 4) The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing.5)Hacking: Beginner's Guide to Expert Hacking6) Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide.

            "answer_text": "There are many resources available. For example I can recommend Hacking: The art of exploitation - great book. Now, hacking is a pretty broad subject. The definition of hacking is pretty much to use something in a way it was not intended to be used - and of course you\u2019re doing that to get a better, faster result. Even though it\u2019s a completely different topic, I\u2019m going to refer to a Ted Talk, where Logan LaPlante say it very accurately in his talk about hack schooling.  In his talk, he talks a lot about how we need to be happy and healthy. He really likes to ski, so in the video he at some point say the following: \u201cShane McConkey is my hero. I loved him because he was the worldst best skier. But then one day I realized what I really loved about Shane. He was a hacker. Not a computer hacker, he hacked skiing. His creativity, and inventions, made skiing what it is today, and why I love to ski. A lot of people think of hackers as geeky computer nerds who live in their parents basement and spread computer viruses. But I don\u2019t see it that way. Hackers are innovators. Hackers are people who challenge and change the systems to make them work differently, to make them work better. It\u2019s just how they think, it\u2019s a mindset.\u201d In there, you see what hacking really is all about. Now, do hackers create computer viruses? Yeah, some do. Most don\u2019t. If you take a computer hacker there are generally 3 categories. White hat, black hat and grey hat. White hat hackers are people who hack in to stuff after having gotten permission from the people or company in question who own the systems they\u2019re breaking into. Why would a company ever grant permission to do that? To become more secure. If that hacker finds a way in, things can get fixed, and that way in isn\u2019t there anymore. In the physical world, you could get a friend you really trust and regularly ask him or her - if you wanted to break into my house, how would you do it. Chances are that when you think about it - and actually do something about it, you\u2019re going to have a much more secure home than even the best alarm system on the market can provide. Grey hat hackers are people, who, like white hat hackers want to make sure security holes are fixed by reporting whatever they find to the company in question in a responsible manner. However, these people have not asked for permission! Permission is important to have because that way everyone is on the same page about it. Trust me, it\u2019s much more fun for everyone involved to spend that time beforehand asking for permission than it is paying expensive lawyers afterwards because of misunderstandings. Black hat hackers are basically people who are in it to try to scam people - one way or another. Those are the people you don\u2019t wanna be, and that people typically think of as hackers. ",

Bandit, the first one, isn\u2019t really \u201chacking,\u201d it\u2019s about gaining familiarity with general Linux commands, but the next ones are closer to \u201chacking\u201d, as they involve finding security vulnerabilities. The first one that\u2019s closer to real-life software exploits is Narnia, but that one is very tricky, and requires knowledge of C. In general, you should learn how to program if you want to learn about cybersecurity topics. There are many possible ways you could go about doing that. ",

Most of the books and free resources on the Internet are only meant for those who already have a considerable amount of knowledge on the subject, they fail to teach hacking for beginners.  Learn Basics: Beginners who have little or no knowledge of hacking it is always better to start with basics. Start exploring more about topics such as computer networks, network ports, firewalls, common network protocols like IP address, HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP etc. along with how each of those stuffs work.Computer Networking Playlist: Computer Networking Playlist - YouTube Start using Kali Linux. Knowledge in linux is essential in the field of hacking. The more you learn about the basics, the more easy it is to find vulnerabilities and device exploits. Once you develop a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts in Linux, you will be in a position to easily understand various hacking techniques that are in practice.Linux Tutorial for Beginners Playlist: Linux Tutorial for Beginners Playlist - YouTube  You can start learning hacking WiFi's as a start. Learn Brute Forcing and it's applications. WiFi Wireless Security Tutorials Playlist: WiFi Wireless Security Tutorials Playlist - YouTube Learn Programming ( Optional ): If you want to take your hacking skills one step ahead, programming is something that you can\u2019t skip down. Although you can easily find a lot of ready made tools and programs that let you hack with ease, it is always better to have some basic knowledge of programming languages like PHP and JavsScript so that you will be in a position to develop your own tools and exploit codes. However, if you do not wish to learn programming you can skip this step and still be a good hacker. PHP Programming Tutorials: PHP Programming Tutorials - YouTube JavaScript Tutorials Playlist: JavaScript Tutorials Playlist - YouTube Hacking is not something that can be mastered overnight, you should never be in a hurry to get going. It requires knowledge, skills, creativity, dedication and of course the time. Depending upon the amount of effort and dedication you put, it can take up anywhere between a few months to few years to develop all the the necessary skills. A good source of knowledge will always be helpful. Try finding a good book suitable for you. Thanks. ",

You should start questioning everything. If you don\u2019t like to question why this is working like that, and how can I mend it to suit my needs, then you are missing on the hacking part and just using tools. A hacker is a person that can mend something to suit his own needs. For example, for pen-testing, you can search for online CTF (Capture the flag). For web pen-testing, you can use Damn Vulnerable Web Application I hope you enjoy your journey. Don\u2019t get overwhelmed by all the news and the exploits, there are just so many to keep track of.

            "answer_text": "Hacking may not be bad for reasons but for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s assume that a hacker is like a thief. What a thief does before breaking into a building? He spies on building, look for entry and exit points. He spies on target, when he\u2019s home and when not. He looks for any surveillance system installed there. He estimates how much he may find once he breaks into house. In short, he fully understands the environment in which he has to successfully steal. That\u2019s what a hacker needs to do. He must understand how computers work and communicate and what possible security flaws could be in storing data or communicating it. Hacking could be as simple as copying data on a USB drive in someone\u2019s absence or as difficult as breaking into firewalls sitting thousands of miles away from the target over internet. You may not have to invent the wheel as many hacking literature, tools and techniques are already available there but you still have the room to invent your own. ",

For example, if you are interested in WiFi and WiFi Networks, then study the subject, the ins and outs, how it works, the historical successful hacks and the measures taken to counter the hacks. As you develop the necessary knowledge and know how, hopefully your passion for the topic will grow accordingly. Once you are confident on the subject, look for the appropriate forums where you are able to keep up to date with the latest security measures and hacks. Because there are so many areas that are hackable, from networks, to devices, to websites, choose your favourite area, and pursue it to the end. There will be times where the subject matter may be confusing, or hard to grasp, but you need to persevere. Depending on your area of expertise, join a community, like a Bug Bounty program, or Hack This Site scenario. The more you interact with others, the more you will learn. Good luck, and happy hacking.

In order to engage the sort of person who would be in a position to help / mentor you towards your goal in any meaningful way (and for the avoidance of doubt,  I'm not him),  you'll need to demonstrate those kind of qualities - e.g. by showing that you've invested an appropriate amount of your own time researching the basics before seeking help.

You can start with some basics such as SQL injection , Http injection , Metasploit , Beef Framework , these things will be a good starter , in the process of using these tools you'll get acquainted with some basic commands . Now the next step is to explore Kali Linux and find tools under certain category and search about it on the internet , there are many forums to help you with . One thing to remember learning hacking takes time , its not as often depicted - \u201cpress a button and VOILA ! Machine hacked\u201d hacking is an art and every person does it in a different way ! If you stick with it in the long run , you'll love it more and would actually recognise how unsafe computers are ! ",

I recommend setting up a mini workstation environment to get comfortable with how domains work since the people that need protecting most are businesses, not individuals. Then read everything you can get your hands on about both offensive and defensive security. The two disciplines complement one another. Most of the books available won't teach you how to hack anything difficult. They teach you how to hack into a brick wall. Unfortunately, you'll probably need to get a virus while searching for info that will allow you to get past that brick wall. For the most part, look for the most up to date sources possible. New hacks are created everyday. Also, if you want to become a serious hacker, learn defense. Every time I study defense I learn about things the best hackers did with their code that made them difficult to deal with. Use a vm when researching hacking or a public computer. Note: I'm not a very good hacker and I don't like to help other people become good hackers. If you learn about certain things that seem scary, don't talk about it. Certain attacks are extremely difficult to prevent. ",

And am in progress.You have programming skills, that's great,  as others have pointed, you need to make up your attitude to begin hacking. I tell you mine, believe me every software is exploitable, easily or with efforts one can do it. Keep an attitude that by hook or crook you need to break in. And it will happen because ultimately It has been written by people like you and me.Apart from attitude other basic thing is the domain knowledge,See, exploit-db.org site to see how different types of vulnerabilities are exploited. Look into OWASP, testing guide, latest version 4.. And also you must know what you are hacking into, collect as much information as you can,  about the target, now a days it's quite easy due to wide spread of social networking.Install kali linux, and understand atleast one in each type,  Information gathering, Vulnerability analysis Wireless attacks Reverse engineering Etc... Tutorials about this is easily available online, or else simply read man pages,  and try it your self. This can go on and on, with huge list of todos,Get comfortable with a scripting language.Think out of box,....... As I said it looks fascinating, but involves a lot of hard work and expertise,  hours of fruitless efforts.Best luck, happy hacking... ",

Hacking is not as glamorous as its portrayed. - You will have to spend hours and hours trying to figure out how to go through a hurdle. You need to have the determination and focus to do so. I agree with Simon Hayes .. cultivate the attitude.. skill can be learned. Once you have the attitude and skills, NOTHING gives the rush and satisfaction of solving the problems that you will encounter as a hacker. It will be worth it. ",

It is also the weakest link as well. Many organisations make the mistake of securing data outside the organisations network but not in the internal systems. And that is often responsible for their fall as well. Learn the basics of networks, how they operate and how/which format they send the data in.

It's the difference between \u201chow can I figure how this thing work\u201d vs \u201chow can I make this thing work this way\u201d, if that makes any sense. With that being said, real hacking would be just having a extraordinary curiously and willingness to try unconventional methods. Where you learn it comes from anywhere. It could be computer hacking (trying to make software work differently than it was built to do), electrical hacking (Nikola Tesla figuring out how to use AC in a world where it was primarily DC), life hacks, etc. ",

Get hold of a stable release(this makes sure you dont have to think too much about platform and version dependencies) of a basic app you so often use, could be anything. Compile it yourself(hmmm... not always happy startings and only after 2-3 or more hands we get a success, dont drop out on this part) for your platform and try your hand on it. Later you can have few not so successful hacks ;) (create a plugin or basic Hello YourName :) from inside when you start) of yourself on it(I am trying the same on vlc currently :) and they have good docs to begin also). These small compilations give lot to start with, as in knowledge about autotools, packaging, libraries, what is where, etc... This way we get to know about what we use. Use opensource software(now most easily available on all platforms, thumbs up) and get it up, not necessarily in one go(took a week to get mocp(latest version) up and running on OSx). Now add bits of code, library and docs with proper examples will be there under development section of app. Your part for them should be helping them with docs or file a bug you identified, or solve particular etc.Next ofcourse is the Linux kernel. Choose any stable release again(very important) and compile it :) ",

Learned the new 'BASIC' language, and was having fun with graphics and simple game programming. Computers and computer languages are now more powerful then anyone's wildest fantasies back then, but I think learning to hack ( program ) has become harder and somewhat frustrating. To find out if you want to pursue this, I recommend trying to do some programming in BASIC on your Android smartphone. Get a few BASICs from the play store and pick the one that appeals to you. If you don't enjoy yourself, just give it up. If you like it, buy a Raspberry Pi 3 for around $50. It comes with all the software and support you need to become the world's best hacker. I'd try SCRATCH from MIT first, a modern approach for beginners, hackers and children. If you understand and like that, you can try Python, Java and JavaScript. Learn Java and a little about LINUX and you're ready for your first Play Store app. Good luck, Ken ( successful hacker, now a music teacher ) ",

Hacking in every area is more about learning new thinks then about anythink else. You need, therefore, learn how to find what you want and how to think about what you've found. It seems quite easy, but there are lot of people who are asking a lot of question they can easily find with a little effort. Then just learn. Understanding a technology needs some time and effort. The bad way is just want to learn some tricks, you need you deeply understand the technology which is really demanding process. Moreover this process never ends, so it's life commitment about endless learning. And one more think: learn English first. You probably can speak English, but if not, do it first. Because almost every material about computer i written in English and you need to understand in order to learn from it. It's obvious. Have fun and I hope you'll not sneak in my computer one day :D ",
