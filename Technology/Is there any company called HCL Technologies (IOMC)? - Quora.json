            "answer_text": "Hi, On papers, maybe no, in functional perspective yes. Note: Information mentioned below is best of my knowledge and can not be considered as Lawfully correct. Globally, HCL conducts its business through two companies. \u201cHCL Technologies\u201d under which comes all the Software and infrastructure support business and \u201cHCL Infotect\u201d under which comes all the BPO and KPO business. While, in India, HCL has broken down this further more to define which business is handled by which entity. So, all the infrastructure support business comes under entity which is know by multiple names like \u201cHCL Technologies (IOMC)\u201d or \u201cHCL Technologies (ISD)\u201d or \u201cHCL Comnet\u201d. These names may or may not be on paper legally. Hope this is the answer that you were looking for. ",
