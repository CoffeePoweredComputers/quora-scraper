When I was a child I had a little box that was a record player it played one song at a time and another box that held the records, I was the happiest kid on the block as I could take my music with me anywhere there was a plug.  We had an updated phone and a seven digit phone number which my mother said meant that the world was getting pretty populated where we lived that they had to add numbers and we didn\u2019t need to speak with an operator.  when I was a kid my parents got me a polaroid camera.  We did not have a computer till I was in my thirties and it cost us $2,200 and it was a dial up. We thought we were tech savvy. Now I have this.  Who knows what will happen next. ",
