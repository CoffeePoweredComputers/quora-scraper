            "answer_text": "I use a BlackBerry Classic with its 10 OS it is very user friendly. Typing is accurate. Emails are easy to read. I like the programmable keyboard that allows custom shortcut keys to be set for any instant operation you prefer. The 9930 was my daily driver for 5 years. I really enjoyed the small size and speed of use. The universal search feature was one of its best and fastest attributes. It's worth a try to switch. Dare to be different. ",

I also have my BlackBerry bold but I don't use it , currently I am using BlackBerry z10. Android is on the rise so use of java and other systems is not favourable. everyone is shifting to android be it a labourer, student, senior citizen. ",
