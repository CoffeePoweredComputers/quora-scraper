            "answer_text": "Until consumer electronics figure out the proper paradigm to use with wearable devices, this product category will never be broadly adopted by consumers. Until the release of the iPhone in 2007, consumer electronics companies kept trying to build wearable devices that used the paradigm of a desktop computer and a cursor. With its multi touch display, Apple found a way to use a device with fingers, and competitors were quick to follow their lead. At the moment, no one has yet created the \u201ciPhone\u201d of wrist computers. Companies are trying to build wrist devices that use the paradigm of a multi touch display, but for practical reasons the screen size of wrist computers has to be small.
