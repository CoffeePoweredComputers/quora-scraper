            "answer_text": "The four most important factors are, distance, font size, brightness and time. The smartphone should not be held too close to the eyes. Otherwise the eye muscles will strain more. The elbow joint should not be flexed more than 90 degrees. At the reading distance, each character should, at least, subtended an angle of 5\u2032 of an arc. Roughly they should be of the size of a newspaper print. When we set the brightness it should be at per with the background illumination of the surrounding. If the surrounding is bright, the screen should also be bright and vice versa. It is not good to see the smartphone in the dark. Even if we keep all these factors optimum, still prolonged use can strain the eye muscles and cause headache. So after using the phone for some time (may be half an hour), one should take little rest. Read mode may be helpful. It changes the colour and contrast so that the blue spectrum is suppressed. It may be beneficial but still it does not take care of all the above factors. So even if you always have read mode on still the eyes may hurt if you see too long and too close. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know what kind of phone you have or what \u201cread mode\u201d entails on it. If you have a \u201cblue shade\u201d mode, or can set your screen to more of a beige or tan color and not the glaring blue-white, that helps some. Use a bigger screen when you can, look away from your screen at least every 20 minutes, use artificial tears if your eyes feel dry or scratchy. Do not use eye drops that say \u201crelieves redness\u201d, unless you have got an interview or something. They make your eyes burn more and don't improve your vision. Wear sunglasses when driving or outside if it is at all sunny. Did you know smoking is bad for your eyes? ",
