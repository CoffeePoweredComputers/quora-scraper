            "answer_text": "What is the difference between a new phone and a used phone? First of all, the new phone is naturally new in appearance, new in packaging, new in accessories. In short, all aspects are new, there are no scratches and no wear marks, and the new Apple iPhone has a one-year warranty service. For users with cleanliness, this is very good choice. But the cost given at the same time is expensive.  What is the used Apple iPhone? The price is low, there is no configuration, there is a wear scar, and there is a high probability that there is no warranty service, but the price is also relatively low. Take Apple iPhone X, the new iPhone is up to $950, You can find the price at CellphoneAge. And in the second-hand market, the price is almost halved, the appearance may be a little more expensive, but almost half the price to buy Apple iPhone X is a more cost-effective. Whether it is worth buying a used phone is entirely based on personal choice. As far as I am concerned, I don\u2019t have any obstacles in buying used mobile phones, so I think it is a really cost-effective choice to buy a used phone. ",
