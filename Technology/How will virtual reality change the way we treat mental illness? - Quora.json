            "answer_text": "Virtual reality is already changing the way surgery is done. And not by using expensive oculus rift headsets but by using cheaper alternatives such as Google cardboard. Here is an example :Story by CNN Google Cardboard saves baby Story highlights Teegan Lexcen was born with a heart and lung defect so unusual that doctors had never seen it beforeHer parents say their doctors in Minnesota told them there was nothing they could do to save Teegan's lifeBut surgery on Teegan's birth defect was made possible by a $20 piece of virtual reality technology(CNN)A toy-like cardboard contraption that sells for less than $20 online has helped save the life of a baby who was so sick that doctors told her parents to take her home to die. Google Cardboard looks like a set of big square goggles. Stick your iPhone inside and with the right app, you can see images in three-dimensional virtual reality.Doctors at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami used the device to map out an operation they say they couldn't have envisioned otherwise.On Wednesday, four weeks after her surgery, baby Teegan was taken off a ventilator and is breathing on her own. Doctors expect her to go home within the next two weeks and make a full recovery.\"It was mind-blowing,\" says Cassidy Lexcen, the baby's mother. \"To see this little cardboard box and a phone, and to think this is what saved our daughter's life.\"Thus I believe that google cardboard would definitely change the way we treat mental illnesses.

            "answer_text": "I don't believe virtual reality will change the way we treat mental illness in any significant fashion.   There have been experiments in the past. VR was helpful at the small-scale experiment level, but not so useful that it was funded for everyday clinical use.  Examples include: Exposure therapy, to help get over phobias. For example, showing virtual spiders to someone afraid of spiders, providing the experience of flying or standing on a building edge for people afraid of those things.Social environments. Some people who are afraid of going out (e.g. agorophobic) were able to meet with others, both for group therapy and for general socialization using VR as a social environment.These things aren't new. It could be that higher quality, cheaper experiences will make it more common to use, but I still expect adoption to be niche rather than commonplace. Virtual reality therapy  ",
