            "answer_text": "Tons & tons of it. Too much & of every kind, all over the place - to the point that it can be difficult to pin it down in one neat bundle. Lets start with the fact no insurance firm in the world will insure cell phone companies against legal claims resulting from damage to anyone\u2019s health. Regardless of how much they are willing to pay (there is hardly an upper limit to what the cell phone co.\u2019s can pay). The manufacturers apparently agree, putting in their manuals that the phone needs to be held a specific minimum distance away from the head when used. Also it should not be carried on your body. All of it for stated health reasons. The majority of studies indicating harm are funded by independent laboratories whereas the majority of cell phone industry studies go in the opposite direction. There have been large magnificently done studies that showed a 7 to 8% increase in inner ear cancers. The trouble is such large studies cannot always be easily replicated because the larger the study, random elements can sometimes produce less then conclusive results. The odd one seem to indicate no special problem many experts think for that reason. Certainly the World Heath Organization (& others just as respected) are convinced enough by the overall data to definitely & unambiguously recommend in the strongest terms that cell phones not be used by any children because they feel it certainly affects growing brains negatively. Then there\u2019s what we know definitely occurs to the brain after one call only (10 to 15 minutes or so). Irradiating the brain with cellphone energy for that period of time always but always measurably changes brain behavior. It\u2019s something thing virtually everyone agrees on. Cell phone advocates insist that does not constitute firm proof that it is bad for you. I\u2019ve even heard some say (depending on how one reads the data) that it may even improve your mental performance in certain, narrow parameters. It would be safe to call that point of view an outlier. What are the chances that irradiating the brain in random unintended ways that definitely change brain performance as a direct result of minimal use - are good for you? That\u2019s the question there is growing, negative consensus concerning. The World Health Organization & many others are only the proverbial tip of the iceberg here. The National Cancer Institute & American Cancer Society are very concerned devoting much of their site to their concerns & explaining how studies are having troubles pinning it down due to methodology issues that are difficult to get exactly right, but the evidence tends to point in the direction of certain sub groups & heavy users being at greater risk & encountering more harm - at a minimum. They say that what we know in general about the way the body responds to radiation of various types (including some Lab results with animals) could easily lead to negative outcomes not fully proven as of yet. I think it needs to be pointed out, warning people away from cell phones any more directly & officially could easily potentially result in litigious results from the makers of these devices. One has to ask how much more direct they would be in their warnings otherwise. Individual scientists studying the issue are often very forthright indeed in expressing reservations when not speaking on behalf of larger entities. There have been stories in the press of scientists agnostic about their effects at the beginning of studies using their cell phones in ways much more safely (assuming the radiation is harmful) by the end of them. When they do so & publicly criticize the industry, it must be said, it does not ingratiate them to an industry they may more easily get funding from in the absence of such comments/actions. There\u2019s the famous story of someone having his app turned down by Apple that told the user how much radiation the iPhone gave off minute to minute. This person was a friend of Steve Jobs & when he asked him to look into it & Jobs did, emailing him back some time later, \u201cSorry can\u2019t do it.\u201d - w/o further commentary. There are case manufacturers who do extensive, independent laboratory testing to shield the user from radiation. Safesleeve is one of the best. Let the words in bold above be your starting point in looking into this further. ",

            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s world, having and using a phone is a norm. But some real dangers come into play when we use it too much. Some people spend every spare moment of their day on it that end up wasting a lot of time. Also, living your life through your phone makes you asocial and hurts your communicational skills. This is because communication through the phone is very simple compared to communication in real life. When you\u2019re interacting with another person, you need to pay attention to things like eye contact, body language, and facial expressions. It requires a whole different skill set, and sadly those skills can\u2019t be experienced through the screen. We just can\u2019t put them down as they are highly addictive, and they are designed this way. It doesn\u2019t allow us to be with our thoughts even a second, and all this mindless phone browsing is harming us in one of the worst ways possible. What we\u2019re doing is destroying our ability to focus and pay attention. A growing amount of research tells us that if you spend your time breaking up your attention to take a glance and just quickly look at Instagram, this can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration. Though there are many tips to get rid of this problem and one of the most useful is to consider deleting all the social media apps from your phone. A lot of our phone usage is unconscious behavior. That\u2019s because we are only one click away from mindlessly scrolling through our social platforms. By removing the apps, there is no way you\u2019ll check it spontaneously; it will be a conscious decision and not an impulsive choice. ",

            "answer_text": " How dangerous a Mobile phone/Smartphone is ? Mobile phones/Smartphones basically emit Electromagnetic radiation(EMR) when they connect with Network towers or WiFi devices.Espouser to EMR creates several serious health issues like Headache, dizziness, learning and memory problems, hearing challenges, altered sleep, brain cancer, tumor and lower sperm counts etc.How to protect yourself? Keep your cell phone away from your body when you are not using it.Do not sleep with your cell phone near your bed.Use a headset or speakerphone when making callsLimit your cell phone use when the signals are weak, as your phone puts out greater than normal levels of radiofrequency energy during those timesLimit exposure to downloading or uploading large files or streaming audio or video, as these situations are associated with higher than normal levels of radiation.Text rather than call when possible.Thanks for Reading!!!
