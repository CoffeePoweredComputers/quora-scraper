            "answer_text": "If the disc has been burned and it doesn\u2019t play on the player, there\u2019s nothing to do anymore at that point. Some players (usually older ones) simply don\u2019t play burned discs. The other option is that the disc hasn\u2019t been burned with correct settings and file structure. Usually the burner software has options for what kind of disc you\u2019re creating; in this case, you\u2019d need to choose the option referring to video DVD. Just creating the disc like a data DVD, with just files or folders included, might lead to using wrong file system, or to some other issues. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Is it because the disc wasn\u2019t authored correctly (wrong filesystem type, files in wrong places on disc, etc.) or because the player can\u2019t read the disc? You\u2019d have to figure out what it is. CSS, while required for pressed discs, is not required for burned media, so assuming it was authored correctly for DVD-Video (was it?), it should work, unless: The player is particularly old (the DVD readers in some old drives didn\u2019t deal well with lower reflectivity, which is common with recordable media)You uses DVD+R or DVD+RW media in a player that doesn\u2019t comprehend the + media variantsYou used a DVD-RW in a drive that doesn\u2019t work with -RW mediaI\u2019ve authored DVDs myself in the past that worked with every DVD player I ever tried, so I know it can work.
