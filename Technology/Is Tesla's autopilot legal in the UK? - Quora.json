            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not expressly prohibited, so you can use it. You retain the full responsibilities of any other driver, though, so if it fucks up, it\u2019s you who will be penalised, and you need to be sober, paying due care and attention, etc. etc. Exactly the same legally as using old fashioned cruise control. Allowing the machine to screw up is the operator\u2019s fault. To the best of my knowledge there are no legal precedents over things that would necessarily differ from driving a fully manual car (where, for example, taking your hands off the steering wheel in motion would pretty much automatically be grounds for a careless driving charge), but I would expect this to be handled on a common sense basis (you need to be capable of taking control instantly at any moment). Incidentally, how well does autopilot deal with a front wheel puncture that might wrench the steering wheel out of an unwary driver\u2019s hands? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve used it for over 3 years so I hope so! Bear in mind that at this stage, despite the name, it\u2019s just land guidance + traffic aware cruise control, which actually a lot of other cars have had for a while too. There seems to be a general impression that Autopilot means self driving which it certainly doesn\u2019t right now. So it\u2019s just holding you in lane and keeping the distance from the car in front. Just advanced cruise control really. You\u2019re still fully responsible for the car - it\u2019s still you driving - so there\u2019s nothing extra risky here to make illegal. ",
