            "answer_text": "No. I don't think there's anyone in the entire world who hasn't experienced sexism (or racism, or ageism, etc). Sexism simply means prejudice, discrimination, or stereotyping on the grounds of sex. If you're a woman, have you ever had someone -- anyone -- assume that you're a bit emotional? Or be surprised that you're interested in technology? Or expect that you wear makeup? Maybe you've had a cop let you off a ticket -- are you sure your gender wasn't a factor there? Or perhaps you've had people be surprised that you didn't take more time off after your kid was born? If you're a man, have you ever had someone assume that you know more than your sister about technology or cars? Or had someone tease you (or even a male friend) for being a bit emotional? Or perhaps you've had a girl assume that you should pay on a date? Or you've assumed that you won't be a stay-at-home parent? Even babies are subjected to sexism! Mothers say more words to their baby girls than to their baby boys (see The Power of Talking to Your Baby). Fathers say more to their boys. This is sexism either way. In fact, I can see sexism in how people treat my 9 month old son. I am nearly certain that, had he been a girl, he would have received as gifts fewer sports-related clothing items. I've also had a number of people tell me that boys are more active. Does assuming that a baby is more active affect treatment? Probably. There will probably always be some differences between genders. As long as this is the case, those differences will lead to a bit of stereotyping -- and, therefore, sexism. ",

Some time ago Project Ada started a hashtag #techsexism to see what women had to say and share. Well, this is one of them: \"too pretty to code\" Join the conversation on Twitter by following that hashtag and see what's up for yourself.  I think that you've heard about gender pay gap, one of the top professions is actually in the tech industry.  I honestly think that there are women who are perfectly happy and respected, while being a programmer, but this does not mean that we need to disregard those that are not. It is not weather you are a boy or a girl, all people need to be respected!   Recently, I wrote an article, where you can find information about real-life cases of sexism, links to different organizations that empower women in the tech field and a link to that gender pay gap that I've mentioned earlier: How to Be Taken Seriously When You're a Woman in Tech ",

I don't even know what form it would take, or whether it's something that only manifests later on in a woman's career (when she decides to have children, for example). The way I see it is, if a man is going to make sexist remarks to a woman, it says a huge deal about his character and how insecure he must be if he feels the need to say it. Most men I know are intelligent enough not to make gross generalisations about a woman's ability in technology, and to recognise talent when they see it, be it from a man or a woman. If it is the case that a woman is passed over for a job promotion because of her gender, when in fact she is very capable of doing the job, then it's the employer's loss. Simple. If it's the case that she's not capable, then that is the issue, not her gender, so it should not be seen as a case of sexism. ",

It is different in various countries and frankly I've experienced more racism (esp from other senior females) more so than sexism when it comes to job recruitment ( this was in the US though)  ...but more so in regular biz tech industry than in science or med research or clinical practice.  Come to think of it I've never had that much of a problem with most guys. If they perceive you as competent, smart, kind and sociable you will not have much of a problem. Sometimes I have seen the green eyed monster rear its ugly head but more so  with females than with males. Females in tech can either be really nice to you or they can the ambitious type who will do anything to get to the top and that includes backstabbing males (my friends have  experienced this).  I do my best to be kind and courteous to everyone so hopefully we can all be nice to each other to stop all this discrimination.   ",

Because there are times where women are held back by other women as often as by men, they don't identify the bias or cultural stereotypes for what they are until it's  too late and they are leaving the industry.
