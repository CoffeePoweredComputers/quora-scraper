            "answer_text": "Intuition is a peculiar thing-it just works when it works. You cannot command it. You either have it or you do not. It either works in a particular point in time or it does not. Women seem to be more endowed with it than men, but that may be due to the fact that males are taught that being sensitive to emotions and outside stimuli is less than 'masculine' and therefore to be avoided. Most of the men that I have encountered that had developed their intuitive gifts were in healthcare, artistic in some way, religious, and/or not heterosexual. That is not a derogatory statement-rather it is merely an observation.  There are exceptions, of course. I've met some master clinicians in natural horsemanship that possess a world of intuition. They have developed it into a skill to work with both horses and people. To watch it in action, there is a movie called simply \"Buck\".  Sixth sense is an ability to \"see\" through all of the masks that other creatures try to put in our way to see the true meaning or course of events. You may be able to know that someone needs you desperately before they even call you-and they are 1000's of miles away, that person standing across the room is going to try to kill someone (and they have made no move and look harmless), you need to do something for someone else and do-then find out much later that it saved them much inconvenience, or see the intent of someone's seemingly smooth words and turn down an attractive offer-to find out later that acceptance would have meant your ruin.  It is real. It cannot be acquired by effort. It can only be recognized.  ",

            "answer_text": "The sixth sense and its works are intuitive, its literal i.e the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning. In our day to day lives we all are able to act or act for a reason, the reason may be belief or factual understanding of the intricacies involved in the action, but there is a reason for all actions. It may not be conducive to what is being thought as in relation with our actions of life, where one sometimes says there was an intuitive feeling on which one acted without thinking, but this sixth sense is not that . That action which is without thinking is as being thought to be intuitive is to do with the higher will at work .The sixth sense is that which is termed as the word understanding or BUDDHI in action, our intelligence quotient if is seen is a natural instinct , its an innate, typically fixed pattern of behavior in animals in response to certain stimuli, and this can be seen in all animate beings. In human forms this instinct is what is the response of this sixth sense which behaves in that fixed pattern of behavior of its own intellectual formation , which is as diverse or is diverse through and through in the physical form of which we are only aware as is there manifested in color, size , shape etc. In meditation when the endeavor is to gather the thoughts or the objectively involved intellect into the form of self, that is the reason of the quotient being neutralized in there, irrespective of the quality of its objective behavior. That is why there are examples of a robber or thief neutralizing all sins when the truth is realized in mythological stories. In essence this is nothing but neutralization of this pattern or behavior of the understanding or the sixth sense in response to the stimuli , then may that response be good or bad in relative terms . Gita insists on this neutralized behavior for that reason only . When so ever the understanding touches base, it realizes its own reality in being, its that which is termed as absolution. ",
