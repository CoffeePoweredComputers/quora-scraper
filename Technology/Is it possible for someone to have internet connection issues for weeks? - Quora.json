            "answer_text": "Absolutely. When I first moved away from home and got my own internet, the first official phoneline to be put into the new little building, the connection was as bad as it is at my parents (where it has been bad for over a decade now probably simply due to location, 2 megabits download and basically nothing upload. And this is the FASTEST we\u2019ve had it with upgrading it to this point) and mine ended up constantly turning off. After over a month we got someone out, and they found that my phone line itself which is outside a completely different door with others, was literally being choked. So yes, it\u2019s very possible. Whether they can be fixed or improved is another thing altogether. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible for someone to have internet connection issues for weeks? Connection issues for weeks \u2014 being the same internet connection issue, or continuous issues? With noisy lines I could see having intermittent connection issues that linger for months if not years. In my case, there was a breech in the buried line that was not discovered for quite a while, but whenever it would rain... The best way, IMO, to have your wiring, your infrastructure ruled out is to directly connect your computer to the modem and document outages with date/time stamps. If you can document an outage with a directly connected computer, and then document other outages that should help. And, of course, if you can find other customers that are in your same boat, e.g. neighbors, that will help amplify the issue if it is not something within your infrastructure. Would setting up a powershell script to append ping results to a file every 5\u201310\u201320 minutes be reasonable? Good luck ",
