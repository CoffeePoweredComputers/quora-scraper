            "answer_text": "Either Samsung or LG: All iPhones with LCD screens: made by LG iPhone X (OLED screen): Samsung iPhone XS (OLED screen): LG iPhone 11 (LCD screen): LG iPhone 11 Pro (OLED screen): Samsung iPhone 11 Pro Max (OLED screen): LG and Samsung iPhone 12 (upcoming iPhone): LG and Samsung 1st Gen Apple Watch: Samsung Current Gen Apple Watches: LG Also for fun: LG makes the OLED screen for the Google Pixel 2 XL, and also the Pixel 3 and 4 series iPhone 12 (upcoming): both Samsung and LG (Apple is placing orders from both companies for their upcoming iPhone 12) Samsung makes the screen for the iPhone X.. they are the only ones that make the \u201cSuper AMOLED\u201d display which is Samsung's technology.. it combines the digitizer and screen together instead of having 2 layers.. thus why it's thinner and brighter. Samsung also provided the Apple Watch AMOLED screens (on their first gen Apple Watch) as well. Apple is making Samsung really rich, Samsung makes much more money selling Apple parts than they do selling their own phones. LG has provided the LCD screens for Apple's phones with LCD technology, and now has created OLED screens for some of their high end iPhones. Apple does NOT manufacture anything whatsoever.. they only make the software and design, but I'm sure they own some patents for some of their technologies.. they buy parts from Asian countries and put together a phone and package it.. just like Google's Pixel is made from and by different Asian companies in China, Taiwan, or South Korea. LG is actually the OLED SUPPLIER of Apple\u2019s iPhone XS and XS Max, plus the newer gen Apple Watches.. and also they provide OLED screens for the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max OLED screens. There's nothing special about Apple's iPhone X display.. it's the same screen as Samsung's Galaxy series.. matter of fact, Samsung actually RESERVES the best supply for themselves and sell other companies a slightly different version. For example, the iPhone X AMOLED screen has a 458ppi pixel density and the Galaxy S9 has a 570ppi pixel density making it much shaper despite both phones being a 5.8\u2032 inch screen.. and you can even tell if you look at it side by side. Another reason is because SAMSUNG DOES VR and they need the highest pixel density on their screen so they reserve the best for themselves.. Apple doesn't really need it so Samsung reduced the cost by having a lower ppi (pixel per inch) display. The \u201cwide color gaumut\u201d is nothing special and just is a marketing gimmick just like the retina display.. you can tweak the screen display in your Samsung phone and customize it to your liking. What you're looking at on the iPhone X as XS or XS Max are Samsung AMOLED screens and LG OLED screens and there's nothing \u201cbetter\u201d because Apple doesn't manufacturer anything, so how can it be \u201cbetter\u201d if they didn't even make it? All they can do is tweak the software and market the product. I think Apple didn't like the branding of Samsung's \u201cSuper AMOLED\u201d screens so they went with LG and they were able to rename it Super Retina OLED XDR or something fancy like that.. but it's actually just LG's OLED screen. Only Samsung and LG makes OLED screens for smartphones, other companies simply just purchase it from them. Samsung does manufacturer some their own parts.. the LCD or Super AMOLED display, sometimes SSD storage, RAM, and sometimes the camera sensor (or sometimes they use Sony). Update: Apple placed an order on their new displays for their upcoming iPhone 12 and their supplier will be both Samsung and LG.. Apple may call their screens OLED XDR Retina display or something like that but it\u2019s really a Samsung or LG panel. Seems like they are back ordering from Samsung again. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s simple if it is an OLED screen the answer is Samsung. Until Apple can find another source of good Quality OLED screens Samsung have a strangle hold over them. This is one of the reasons that some of Apples new cameras have been delayed, shortage of OLED screens. Samsung on the other hand cannot sell all the OLED screens they manufacture to Apple because they also need them for their own range of cameras. I am sure Apple will resolve this situation in the future one way or another. Nano technology springs to mind, but I do not know if that is even possible. Nano technology however is starting to penetrate many different markets and it has enormous potential. ",
