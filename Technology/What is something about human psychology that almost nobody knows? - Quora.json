            "answer_text": "Hello Jerry Tan Why it\u2019s me your favorite? :D Anyway, thank you \"again\" for this question. :D Human psychology/behaviour is just one of the most interesting to study about. Knowing some of the facts will get you ahead of the crowd. It\u2019s also entertaining once you start knowing them. Here we go. If you are in total darkness for more than three days, you can become permanently blind.When someone misses you, there is an 80% chance that they will appear in your dream.70% of people lay in bed at night remembering past conversations, imagining what they should have said instead.You have no sense of smell when you are asleep.You want more choices and information than you can actually process.What people look at on a picture or screen depends on what you say to them. To clarify this point, let us take an example. Look at the picture below: What did you see? It\u2019s just a picture of a group of friends right? Did you notice anything strange? No? What if I say that there's something strange in the picture. You did pay a second look right? And you are now concentrating to see what is the strange thing I\u2019ve said. Have you now noticed that there's No seat or bench?. They are sitting in the air! Yes, you finally see the picture very well now. But why didn\u2019t you notice it before? It\u2019s because I\u2019ve put the picture without telling you what to look out for. So when I said that there is no seat, only then you noticed it. Cool isn\u2019t it? :D Ever wonder why our gut instincts are so strong and why things sometimes work out better when we follow it? That\u2019s because our subconscious mind often knows what\u2019s better for us much before our conscious mind understands it.When you become really close to someone, you can hear their voice in your head when you read their texts.It would take about 1000 years to watch all the videos on youtube.The average woman will pack about 26 items in her suitcase that she\u2019ll never need. Studies found that children who are better liars, tend to become more succesful adults.Worrying about getting sick can actually make you sick.People who get embarrassed easily, tend to be more trustworthy, loyal, honest and generous.People who tend to daydream more are better at solving problems and tend to be more creative. Are you a daydreamer? :DPeople are so jealous of their neighbours that they don\u2019t feel satisfied and successful until they are superior than them.Your mind can sense someone staring at you even while you are asleep. It\u2019s impossible to remain angry at someone you truly love. Anger lasting for more than three days indicates that you are not inlove.Psychologically, it is impossible to be just friends with someone you have fallen in love with.We do not realize how much we love something until we lose it.When a guy really likes a girl, he can\u2019t help but tell his friends about her.According to study, if you are always the one to text a person first, there's a 90% chance that this person isn\u2019t interested in you.Couples who meet online often end up marrying.People with a dominant or charismatic personality can easily affect crowd opinions and manipulate groups into doing their bidding. I\u2019m not talking about Christian Grey. Am I? :D    Some of us are actually afraid of being too happy because of the fear that something tragic might happen next.People text faster to someone they like most.Psychological study found that men often find funny women intimidating.When a person dies, their sense of hearing is the last to go. Be careful what to say about the corpse :DThe higher your IQ, the more you dream.It takes 4 seconds for the silence to be awkward.Men can love 2 to 4 girls at the same time. Woman can\u2019t. Who\u2019s loyal now? :DGuy seek advice from a girl, not from a guy.Cursing when you are hurt helps to reduce the pain.Hearing someone call out your name when nobody has actually called out your name, is a sign of healthy mind.Sleep deprived men are more likely to assume that women want to have sex with them.According to study, some women have ended a relationship because their significant other was too busy playing video games.A man can like you for a moment and forget you later on.Smiling is contagious. Do it more often :)Thanks for scrolling. I\u2019m Bella Have a great day ahead world ;) ",
