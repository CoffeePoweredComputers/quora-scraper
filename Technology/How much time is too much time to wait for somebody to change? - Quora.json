            "answer_text": "People are reluctant even phobc abou change until they feel loss and pain strong enough to stop and change. If you want to help this person, quit on him or her until their change is complete. Then you can be supportive again, if the change was real. So, in every relationship a bad person takes that one step and goes too far. You know when that happens, if they did this, they will do much worse. That\u2019s the moment when the waiting stops. Time for the bad person to feel what it\u2019s like to go too far and lose someone who used to care. Many bad people have to play their cards a were dealt. They still hang on to the notion that they can double down, lie some more, live without, and prove us wrong. Let them lose their friend, get divorced, lo a job, cost their children, and go to jail. These are all typical results from acting badly when it is easier to reform. Prisons are filled with people that lose everything before they find jailhouse religion. Why take that ride down the escalator with them? You just predict where the escalator spills out and send a note. Good luck, Mac ",

            "answer_text": "I think you know. Whatever is working for that other person, whatever is motivating them to stay the way they are, is not your concern. You may influence and demonstrate change in your own life, but you cannot make another person change. This is something you must change in yourself. Consider how hard it is to make this change. Ask yourself, How is my mindset is working for me? What is my motivation for not changing? Now is the time. Consider your choice - You can continue to resist what you must change and keep asking yourself the above question, or make the change and move on with your life. Either way, no matter how much you care, the other person will only change if they choose to do so. ",
