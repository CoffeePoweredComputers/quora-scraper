            "answer_text": "A2A Can I turn my cell phone into a satellite phone? No. 30 years ago it wasn\u2019t impossible that some \u201cgenius\u201d could take a radio apart and reassemble the parts into something else. 50 years ago you could re-tune a radio to a different band by rewinding a coil. Now, modern electronics is so integrated that you can\u2019t really do anything without special equipment, and mobile phones are among the most highly integrated and dense devices there are. If you can\u2019t do it in software you can\u2019t do it, and it\u2019s not possible to reprogram the radio chips as far as I know. There\u2019s something called Software-defined radio but I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t use that on a phone to communicate with a satellite. How can I use my mobile phone to connect via satellite? I have an older Garmin inReach satellite communicator. That lets me send texts via a clunky ABCD soft keyboard one letter at a time. It also has a Bluetooth interface, and with an app on my phone I can use the phone QWERTY keyboard to send messages a bit easier, and read them on a bigger screen than the tiny one on the inReach. It\u2019s not a real internet connection so I can\u2019t use a web browser, though, and the message charges are hugely more than on a phone. Per Starlink (satellite constellation) - Wikipedia the upcoming internet satellites won\u2019t communicate directly with mobile phones; you\u2019d have a satellite transceiver and a wifi router the same as you have at home.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve personally come across a number of people who think that their mobile phone is interacting with satellites in space, and therefore I imagine that it must be quite a widely held belief.  I am afraid that this is untrue. Mobile phones communicate with ground-based cell towers that are probably 100 to 1000 metres away from where you are standing. When the cell tower receives the signal from your phone, it then sends the voice signals onward to other phones (and other phone companies) through wires.  Perhaps if you make an international call, then at some point your signal gets bounced via a satellite, although there are many undersea cables crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. If your call gets sent via satellite, this has nothing directly to do with your mobile phone; it is only to do with a decision by the phone company about how they will route their voice traffic. Your mobile phone has no ability (either in its hardware or software) to send and receive signals directly to/from a satellite in space. ",
