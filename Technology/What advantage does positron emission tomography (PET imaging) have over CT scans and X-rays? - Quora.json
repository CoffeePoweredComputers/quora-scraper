Depending on the the radiopharmaceutical that is used they can show oxygen metabolism, blood flow, glucose metabolism, dopamine utilisation, dopamine reuptake, plaque accumulation in Alzheimers disease and many other processes.

            "answer_text": "It is metabolic imaging. When combined with CT or MRI which is common place and represents a single scan it is awesome combining anatomic and metabolic imaging. Just a brief example of a complex topic. Let us as you have cancer, and CT and MRI show normal sized lymph nodes. But F18DG activity is increased in a normal node, that would be suspicious for cancer and knowing which node it is can be biopsied to see if your cancer was understaged. This affects treatment. There are many different PET agents now available, diagnosing dementia, infection, specific for prostate cancer, etc. Changes in metabolism can be used to monitor response to therapy. ",
