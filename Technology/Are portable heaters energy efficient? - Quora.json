            "answer_text": "Yes. But this is more complex than it appears. Electric ones are 100% efficient. So this means 100% of the energy you put in comes out as heat, which is the desired product. None becomes any other form of undesirable energy, such as motion or sound, although maybe a tiny a bit of light but less than 1%. However, when it comes to heating efficiency isn't really the only metric. What you might mean rather than efficient, are portable heaters cheap to run? No. They aren't, as electricity per kWh is quite a bit more expensive than coal, wood, gas and other heating fuels. Some of these might be less efficient, as some heat goes up the flue or chimney, but the fuel is much cheaper between 4 and 10 times cheaper. Heat pumps - air or ground sourced can achieve 200\u2013400% \u201cefficiency\u201d by using electricity to pump heat from outside to inside, not by actually heating. These are a better choice than a portable electric heater, but they are much less portable and much more expensive. ",
