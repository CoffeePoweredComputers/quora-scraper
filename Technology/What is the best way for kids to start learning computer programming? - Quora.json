            "answer_text": "Introducing your children to the world of coding can be a bit of a challenge, particularly for parents who themselves have no idea about how codes work. In today\u2019s era where the digital world has largely taken over our tasks and routines, it is essential to learn the fundamentals of coding. Not only it is an enjoyable and productive activity to involve your children in, coding also helps in developing problem-solving skills, polishes creativity and logic, and boosts technical competency. If you are lost on how to begin teaching your kids the basics of coding, here are some of the best ways to get them started! 1. Hands-On Play for Budding Coders The art of coding is not limited to computers and software. Introduce your young child to technical toys that allow them to test their creativity and logical thinking. They will not even know they are actually coding! For instance, LittleBits offers a range of innovative toys that teach children about circuits, electronics, magnets, and bubbles! They have a fun learning tool by the name of Crawly Creatures that will even leave the geek in you fascinated. Suitable for ages 8 +, the toy has little parts including dimmer, pulse and power that encourages the child to learn how circuits work.  2. Let Them Play with Applications Screen-time is usually frowned upon but as we are raising a generation who is surrounded by smartphones and laptops 24/7, it is not feasible to completely ban screens in their lives. Instead, utilize the gadgets in a productive way with some limitations. One of the best resources to enlighten your little engineer to the world of coding and programming are coding applications.
