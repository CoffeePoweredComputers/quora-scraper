That includes, notably: QuoraDiscordThe Microsoft suite of applicationsDuckDuckGoQuemuse and related infrastructureInstagramya know, all the other thingsAnd thanks to a wonderful invention called COPPA, I have been, and will be banned, one by one, by most of the sites above. Discord sent me an email saying my account had been terminated under suspicion that I was under the age of 13. I have no way to appeal this without essentially giving my identification documents for life. Which I can\u2019t do. Bye, Discord.Quemuse decided that they should do so too, based on the Discord debacle, and so all my accounts were terminated. How do I appeal? Well, I need Discord to let me back into my account for that to happen. Which can\u2019t happen.Quora is an independent soul, but will have no problem in banning me when it realizes that I turn 13 in two months. How do I appeal? Send them ID. Which I can\u2019t. How come these sites need no ID to block you, but require it to let you back? I have been using web services since the age of 4, when I made a website. Thanks to a foreign government (the US\u2019s) , I will be banned from all of the above sites sooner-than-later. And despite my status as a very-near-teen, I\u2019ll have no way to appeal. I have 3 things to say. Goodbye, you lot.How come they only block me mere months before I can legally use them? Like, why?Whoever the dude was who reported me on Discord, I lost all of my chat history, my server ownership, all of the above. Go and die in a hole, please, and thank you. I\u2019ve made mistakes online. I\u2019ve lost friends.  I\u2019ve done it all. But I\u2019m so annoyed with this constant war on the twelve-and-five-sixths-ies. Coulda been born in February. Coulda even been born in 2006. Doesn\u2019t change. I don\u2019t change. I look exactly like I did as a six-year-old, except maybe a little skinnier. I appreciate that COPPA tries to protect my innocence, but mate, if you really wanted to do that, you woulda blocked me back in 2011. I think I can self-regulate like the 99 other kids in my grade who are exempt from your dumbass ruling. You\u2019re 9 years too late. And I\u2019m two months too early. Sayonara, my friends. And for quite possibly the last time, in its most literal sense, Quid pro quo ",

            "answer_text": "In 2003, a cascade of events caused an aging power grid to crash, leaving people across the northeast US without electrical power. Northeast blackout of 2003 - Wikipedia. A person in the 1990\u2019s, if asked \u201ccould we live without electrical power\u201d would have answered in the affirmative. After all, systematic electricification of the US did not happen until the Roosevelt administration. But there are millions of people who live or work in very tall buildings in New York City. These buildings were designed assuming that electrical power is continuously available. When power went out in that blackout, elevators got stuck. Ventillation failed. These problems put people in these buildings at very immediate risk of death. When power fails in places like Texas during 100F heat spells, people die of heat exhaustion. With electrical power we know that it is possible to live without it, so long as we are adapted to do so. The problem with electrical outages is that we have adapted to live with elecrical power being cheap, abundant, ubiquitous, and continuously available. When it is not there, sometimes we actually cannot live without it. Our adaptation to the internet is not so advanced as our adaptation to electrical power. But one of the consequences of internet commerce is that goods (other than fresh produce and milk) are stocked further and further from their points of use. So it is imagineable that at some point in the future a total failure of the internet would make most goods unavailable almost everywhere. But more scary than this that we rapidly approach a point in time when essentially all commerce is carried out electronically using the internet. When I was a child, it was assumed that refrigerated water was a universal free public good and water fountains proliferated in public places. Today, however, with the ascendency of water as a business, failure of the internet could keep one from buying even a bottle of water. So in the case of the internet, we have begun adapting to it. There are good reasons for this adaptation; it reduces transaction costs. But the risk is that it is only a matter of time until we will find that when it is not there for very long, we actually cannot live without it. ",
