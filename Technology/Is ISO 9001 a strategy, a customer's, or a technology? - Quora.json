            "answer_text": "ISO 9001 is a standard for implementing total quality management in an organization. It\u2019s PDCA-Plan, Do, Check, Act in the extreme and becomes embedded in the culture of organizations committed to it. To get ISO 9001 certification an organization needs a culture with commitment to quality and the procedures and systems to carry it through whatever products or services are made or provided. ISO 9001 Mandatory Requirements \u2014 Documents and Records Monitoring and measuring equipment calibration recordsRecords of training, skills, experience and qualificationsProduct/service requirements review recordsRecord about design and development outputs reviewRecord about design and development inputsRecords of design and development controlsRecords of design and development outputsDesign and development changes recordsCharacteristics of product to be produced and service to be providedRecords about customer propertyProduction/service provision change control recordsRecord of conformity of product/service with acceptance criteriaRecord of nonconforming outputsMonitoring measurement resultsInternal audit programResults of internal auditsResults of the management reviewResults of corrective actionsThe best systems I ever worked on were for organizations with ISO 9001 certification that had Quality Managers that were able to make all this stuff transparent so the entire organization was involved in quality. An organization seeking certification needs to show how they do all the above to maintain high standards of quality. Quality managers are familiar with these requirements and know how to make systems and procedures to collect data and provide the feedback to meet them. That list of 18 criteria comes from the top result of a google search on \u2018iso 9001\u2019 and if you search on that and similar terms you\u2019ll find lots of articles like this: ISO 9001 Requirements There are several allied standards, like COBIT-Control Objectives for Information Technology or ITIL-Information Technology Infrastructure Library where quality management is applied to a particular activity like information systems or infrastructure management. SOX-Sarbanes-Oxley is COBIT with the force of law and extends into the accounting systems of publicly traded companies. The popular term is TQM-Total Quality Management and ISO9001 is a certificate that shows that an organization can actually do it, and does. It is not \u2018a technology\u2019 it\u2019s a \u2018culture\u2019, and customers seeking high quality look to ISO9001 certifications as an indicator that they\u2019ll get it. From what I\u2019ve seen over decades of working in large and small organizations, including lots of crooks and shysters who don\u2019t want to account for anything, working in an organization that practices TQM is the best place to work.
