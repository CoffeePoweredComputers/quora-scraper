            "answer_text": "Wastewater treatment in general has several steps, some intrinsically more expensive than others. 1. Removing Debris2. Removing Suspended Organic Molecules3. Disinfection4. Removing other chemicals (optional, depends on region and regulations) Here is my best guess at a cheap option for each of the first 3 steps.1. Removing debris: usually done by a mesh screen. Afterwards settling tanks allow dense material (sludge) to settle and light material (scum) to rise and be skimmed off the top of the water. These can either be incinerated (cheap, polluting, can produce power), landfilled (kind of expensive), or used as feedstock for gasificiation (high capital costs, \"clean\" efficient power generation capabilities);2. Removing suspended organics: After the solids have been removed the WW goes to aeration basins where activated sludge breaks down suspended organic molecules. Areation is energy intensive.3. Disinfection is accomplished either through chlorination (medium-high maintenance, possibly dangerous) or UV (safe, high maintenance).4. Removing other chemicals such as ammonia tend to involve more areation basins, and can cost roughly equal to the original aeration. That being said, wastewater treatment is generally a pretty expensive, albeit important, enterprise. It requires a great amount of infrastructure, capital, and oganization. Depending on the actual implementation, costs for certain things (such as chlorination, landfilling, energy prices) can vary widely. At the same time there is a certain physically/technologically attainable minimum energy cost that is hard to get past.

            "answer_text": "The principle behind the wastewater treatment techniques remained same since the early ages.The concept is very simple \u2014 Initially remove the particulates in an orderly fashion (First remove floating solids, then large debris followed by settlement of inorganic matter, then sedimentation of settle-able organic matter). After removing all the settle-able solids, treat the sewage for dissolved organics using microbial organisms. This process is still in use for treatment of domestic wastewater (Of course with higher efficiency)Ze\u2019ev Fisher, Mapal\u2019s vice president for business development and international marketing once said\u2014 We\u2019re not reinventing the wheel here. We just developed a technology that\u2019s more effective and more efficient  Now coming back to the question: What are the cheapest wastewater treatment technologies? \u2192 The word cheapest means the sum of money sent should be minimum. Commonly used cheap treatment techniques for sustainable and cost-effective sanitation and wastewater management are\u2014 Anaerobic Tanks (as the rate of monetary returns are high. Hence Cheapest);Phytodepuration and Constructed/Natural Wetlands; Waste stabilization pond system (Natural pond-age i.e., facultative pond followed by maturation pond); Lagooning (Anaerobic ponds);Cheap treatment techniques for specific purposes\u2014 For Nutrient removal: Wetlands;For Heavy Metal removal: Acclimatized bio-remediation or Phyto-remediation or wetlands or passing wastewater through adsorbing material like sawdust etc;For treatment at small communities: Imhoff tank followed by wetlands;Reduce acidity: Passing the wastewater over limestone slabs;Pathogen Removal: Sand filtration pits or chlorination.Note: These methods are the cheapest but not the ones at the top of the efficiency pyramid.
