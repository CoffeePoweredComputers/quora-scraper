            "answer_text": "This is by far the closest we have come to a Iron Man style suit.  Kuratas the Japanese Robot Mecha heralds in the Gundam Era for real This was done by a Japanese company for the fun of it. Also because Gundam and Gaint Mechanized Robots piloted by humans is a big thing over there. It is the closest we came to mechanized infantry. The robot pictured above is by no means designed for real world combat. It is basically shows what can be done with what we have to work with. It is cool as hell too I included a link of the product demo. Now we have military contractors designing exoskeletons for variable suits. These exoskeletons are the building block of any real world equivilant of an iron man suit. After that you just add the variable parts based on the scenario and you have a real world flightless iron man suit. Also any iron man suit made that can fly will not have thrusters on the feet. I mean Tony Stark showed what happened during the hilarious tests in the first Iron Man movie. ",
