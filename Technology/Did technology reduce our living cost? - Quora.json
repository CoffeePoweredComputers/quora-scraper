            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Technology works best when it causes deflation. The cost of keeping horses vs the cost of keeping a motor vehicle. Sending letters vs sending a fax vs email. Fireplaces vs boilers vs heat pumps. All these advances happened because technology made it much less expensive to accomplish a task. A fun way to start a discussion about technology is to ask someone if they\u2019d rather live as a king in the 1600s or a poor person today. Even the poorest households in the United States own microwave ovens, TVs and phones, plumbing and usually an automobile. Their homes have wall-to-wall carpeting (thanks to the vacuum cleaner and electricity), are well lit at night, and heated in the winter. The Palace of Versailles didn\u2019t even have flush toilets! The Palace serves as a good example of just how much technology has improved our lives in general, since it had no electricity and lighting was via candles and windows. Sounds romantic, but the candle budget had to be in the equivalent of thousands of dollars a month in material alone, never mind all the labor that went into maintaining the lights. Today with a flip of a switch anyone can have light any time for a few dollars a year. If you wanted to travel there from downtown Paris it might take hours or even all day since it was originally a hunting villa, implying it was out in the sticks. Today it is just a short bike ride (on modern, paved roads) from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, or a 30 minute drive via car. When you finally got to the palace there would be no shower to clean up, just a wash basin with some non-potable water. And this in one of the most luxurious homes in Europe! ",

            "answer_text": "Dramatically. In 1900 nearly 40% of the US workforce was engaged on the farm to feed ~75M people. Today only 1% of workers are employed on the farm and they feed over 360M people in addition to a massive export market. Due to applications of technology - tractors, harvesters, satellites, bio-engineered seed and pesticides the cost of food as a percentage of the average workers budget has dropped similarly. Transportation has seen similar gains, compute to develop the technology and diffuse it economically across the globe has been on a virtuous cycle for decades. Computers used to be the rare province of governments or multi-national global businesses. Now any farmer in Africa with a cellphone has more computer and communications tools than we used to get ot the moon and back. ",

            "answer_text": "That is actually a very hard question to answer as, for example, we work more the the peasants of medieval Europe (in terms of hours worked) but we have a higher standard of living. Technology and mass production allegedly made things cheaper but most of the negative effects of technology i.e. deforestation, climate change, pollution etc are not factored into the price of goods. It is hard to say but more research is needed into this question. ",
