            "answer_text": "The service of this company is worst. It usually puts the transactions on hold. After continuos mails and calls also, it does not pay heed. Merchants really have to fight hard against company to get the amount back. It usually put the call on hold for more than 30 minutes or one hour when you call regarding hold transaction. At last merchant have to disconnect the call. Many customers including me are regretting after purchaing the machine of MSWIPE TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD. ",
