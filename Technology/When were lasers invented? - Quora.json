            "answer_text": "First a guy named Albert Einstein worked on emission and absorption of light. And he realized that for a quantum system there are four possible configurations. Ground state, no light. (Apparently nothing happens.)Ground state, light. (Absorption is possible.)Excited state, no light. (Emission is possible\u2026.)Excited state, light. From his calculations it showed that such combination is basically the same as absorption. But instead of one photon, two identical photons (as they are bosons) leave.So we had absorption, emission, and stimulated emission. As with all theories. It seemed correct and the question was to build an experiment that would DISPROVE the theory. Or\u2026 show that it seems it works. The thing is, the longer the wavelegnth (smaller energy of transition) the easier it is to realize such experiment. So in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2033s scientists build MASER (microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation). Based on masers, Thomas Maiman created in 60\u2019s first LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emision of Radiation.) Which was basically just maser shifted to visible range. (As I told before, the shorter the wavelenght the more difficult is to create laser. X-Ray or gamma lasers are really, really hard.) ",
