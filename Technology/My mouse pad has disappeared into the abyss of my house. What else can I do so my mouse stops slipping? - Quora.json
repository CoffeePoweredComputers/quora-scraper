            "answer_text": "My mouse pad has disappeared into the abyss of my house. What else can I do so my mouse stops slipping? Modern mice no longer need a mouse pad. Only very old, mechanical mice need a pad to guarantee traction with the mouse \u201cball\". In prehistoric times mice used mechanical sensors to detect the rotation of the mouse ball and hence movement of the mouse across the table or mouse pad. Newer mice (the last 10 or 15 years or so) use a tiny camera to detect markings and imperfections in your desktop to sense movement. No friction pad is necessary. Buy a new mouse. They cost about the same as one fast food meal. ",

With a laptop, when I am sitting on a sofa, I often run my mouse on my thigh. In a caf\u00e9, if the table is polished, I have used the menu or a piece of paper. An upturned table mat, with a cork backing, works very well with a ball mouse. ",
