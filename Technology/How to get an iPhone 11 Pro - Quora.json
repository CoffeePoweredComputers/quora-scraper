You can buy it on Apple\u2019s website or the Apple Store app and you might get deals on iPhones if you buy through eBay or Amazon. Pretty darn easy right?

If you are buying used, you can get it at really great deals on Amazon/eBay nowadays. I did some YouTube unboxing and review videos on them and how I got it cheap (link in my profile if you are interested). ",
