            "answer_text": "Firstly your source video needs to have a high bit rate.  Assuming you recorded video in mts format with a HD video camera then you need to convert the file to the highest bit rate that DVD supports. Some file converters output DVD at 8000 kbits/s. This will give you a HD quality DVD. It is much better to simply store all your raw mts files on a portable USB3 drive. They can be played back on Windows 8 pcs, PS3 and X-Box. ",
