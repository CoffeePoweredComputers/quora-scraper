            "answer_text": "Not sure of the perspective of this question, if you mean how is it as an Icon, what users think of it, or if it satisfies the persona of the Behemoth Apple. So I\u2019ll crack at it from a bit of each. First, it was designed by world renowned British Architect Sir Norman Foster who was hand selected by Jobs himself. Given Jobs\u2019 exquisite taste in design and knack for human experience, he chose the perfect candidate to build the headquarters. Foster\u2019s background entails large structures across the globe from NYC to China that include other headquarters (HSBC, McLaren Automotive and a vast array of projects) for large corporations.   Jobs was quite the architecture enthusiast, known to drive the design behind the Apple stores with his vision, and the headquarters was no exceptions. As for the structure expression I believe that the beauty and simplicity of how and what Apple designs is captured in the most basic form of a circle. Heavy, yet elegant and dominate yet smooth quite Applesque. I mean c\u2019mon it looks like it\u2019s going to take off any minute and land on Mars! One of the key elements we try to embody in an architectural design is the personality of the owner. This is a near flawless execution of one of architecture\u2019s pinnacle principals. You could put that building anywhere and if you know Apple you would say, yup thats theirs, not Google, Facebook, or Amazon, just Apple!
