            "answer_text": "The field is very broad, it depends on what position you are applying for. Choose your class, developer, sysadmin, researcher or hardware engineer. Developer He is the one who builds. Developers know multiple programming languages and frameworks and often specialize in a language or a developing for a platform. By far the most requested professional figure. Java, Python or C++ as general purpose programmingHTML, CSS, JavaScript for web developmentSQL and noSQL databasesBackground knowledge of algorithms and software patternsUI and UX paradigmsVersion control and working in a team.Math as needed.Sysadmin The one which creates new systems and maintain infrastructure. Sysadmin can give you the pro and cons of hardware architectures, oversee multiple computers and prevent security breaches. Deep knowledge of operating systems, Windows, MacOS and LinuxNetworking, HTTP, SSH, VNC and other acronyms.Math, operations research and logicKnowledge of back end web development.Estimating costs and managing communication with users.Researcher The one who extract insights out of big data, make nice reports and can find trends as they evolve. Basics in general programming, Python.Sector specific languages and framework, Mathematica, R, NumPyMachine learning, neural networks.Data structure and algorithms.Math, statistic, logic, calculus,physicsMaking presentations, latex and office software.Hardware engineer The EE focus on the hardware side of IT. IoT has made this field popular, and growing even tough it is not needed as much as developers. General purpose programming, C++Strong math knowledge, calculus, logic and some statistics.Physics, electronics and magnetismCAD, PCB design.Soldering and troubleshooting hardware. Use diagnostic struments like oscilloscope and thermal camera. These are the branches of IT. Names may vary, and they are not mutually exclusive. A developer may learn to be an electronic engineer and the opposite, but specialization is more rewarding. In startups jack of all trades are more requested, but in big companies highly specialized employees are better treated. In a self employment scenario, developer and researcher are the best choices as system administration and hardware development require more trust and are less scalable. If in doubt all professions need a strong mathematical backgroundcold and critical thinkingmanaging expectations from customers and employersprogramming, scripting, searching how to dothe art of not complicating work more than necessary.",

            "answer_text": "Depending on the job category you will like in Information field, your study field will vary accordingly. All the same, emphasis should be laid on the skills and not on the score (though score will get you to the interview) . Contribute whenever possible to technology either through open source projects or at least develop projects on your own and publish them. The only way to ascertain you know something is by doing it. Also, by doing you get to learn alot. If your dream job will be working alongside staff of different fields (non-IT firm) other studies like communication skills and etiquette will get you far and you will interact well with colleagues. The key point is to know at least something in anything and much in the area you specialize. Finally try to be the best in what you do. For a more specific answer, it would have helped had you provided an area of study you wish to specialize in. Good Luck ",
