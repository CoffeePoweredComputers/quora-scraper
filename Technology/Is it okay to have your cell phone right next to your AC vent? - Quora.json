            "answer_text": "Yes, it actually is. I had been thinking about this for a few days and I finally tried this out. I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, which comes with an in-built battery manager and status display in MIUI 8. I noted the rate at which the phone was being charged at 43 \u00b0C. After that I cooled the phone down to 26 \u00b0C by keeping it in front of an AC vent, and noted the rate at which the phone was being charged. The difference in the speeds of charging was clearly noticeable which varied in the range of 20% - 25%, the latter condition showing better results than the former. Even during discharging, the phone discharged slowly when it was cooled as compared to when it was hot. So, I will surely advise you to keep you phone next to an AC vent\u2026;-) ",

If you turn the heat on, however, you may overheat it. So don\u2019t put your phone by the A/C vents if you are going to pump hot air out of them. ",
