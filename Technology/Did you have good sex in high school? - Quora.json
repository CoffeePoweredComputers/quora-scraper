            "answer_text": "Sometimes. I had some boring, fumbling, why-are-we-even-doing-this sex. But I also had some wonderful sex. One was a girl I had a long-term relationship with and we had some good sex here and there. Not always and it wasn't like we had a lot of it given our age. But I can recall specific times where it really all came together [pun intended]. It was good enough that years later we hooked up again once 'just for sex'. Another was a girl totally out of my league, as the saying goes. A girl who I never in a million years would have guessed would be interested in me in any way shape or form... much less wanting to have mind-blowing sex with me. Ho-ly crap was it good. I can still remember one particular instance pretty vividly. It didn't hurt that I was so incredibly sexually attracted to her. She was smart, funny and oh-dear-god was she beautiful.  To this day if I told some of the people who knew us both back then, \"Hey, did you know that J*** and I were a thing for a while and had crazy, passionate sex all the time?\", they would call me a liar; Both over the idea of our dating and the idea that J**** would have sex with anyone back then. But she did. And it was great. Oh! I almost forgot. A****. I met her at the beach one summer and let me tell you, that girl knew how to $#%&! We did our best to meet up again subsequent summers and, when we did we would go at it like rabbits. How could I forget you, A****? You were amazing... Since I mention elsewhere that I'm bisexual, I should note here that I never really had any true sexual experiences with guys in high school. I just didn't really date many guys then. And most, but not all, of the girls I knew who were having sex with guys in high school (again 'most', not all), weren't really enjoying it. High school boys are still kind of... under-cooked and over-served at that age. You know the old saw about how girls mature faster. I think it's true in this regard. Oh my god... now I've got to call my sister and find out whatever happened to J****... ",

It lasted about 20 minutes from start to finish, which isn't bad for that age.  We had sex VERY regularly for many years, all through high school and into college, and it was not just good, but VERY good sex.  We had sex at least a couple times a day for years, sometimes hitting up to 6 times in a 9 hour period.  We were not shy and we experimented more than most kids at that age.  We had both quickies while her Mom took out the dog, or garbage, and also spent hours having fun and varied sex.  We would try and get the other person to cum often, seeing how worn out we could make each other.  I would have to say I was a very lucky teen. ",

We were young, and naive, but what we lacked in experience we more than made up for in enthusiasm. We broke in my first year of university, although we kept having sex for about five years after that. I've had better sex since, but it will always have a special place in my heart. ",

The first times I got a hand job, blow job, fingered, groped and fucked were each a little awkward for both.  But, once one gets the hang of stuff, no going back and sex gets a lot better.  No anal or BDSM stuff in high school, though, the girls were pretty vanilla and most were virgins, too.  Maybe if I'd met a hot and horny and experienced one, we'd have partied!  ",
