Instead I start my search on Google and use the following to perform the search (for this example remove the square brackets, but keep the formatting as is): [model descripion] +obj +3ds +download that search should return a pretty strong hit on the pages of model repositories with the matching subject model you are looking for, you may have to go through the top dozen or so google results to actually find one. Additionally, if you aren\u2019t inclined to pay for 3d models you can add +free at the end. Eventually you\u2019ll find there are 3 or 4 major sites which provide 3d model downloads and you\u2019ll become familiar with their designs and their own search functions. ",
