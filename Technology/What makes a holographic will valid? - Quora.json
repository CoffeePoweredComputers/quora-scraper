            "answer_text": "A holographic will has NOTHING to do with a hologram. i.e.,the 3-D security image on money. i.e., the fancy-dandy laser generated image of Leia at the beginning of the original Star Wars. \u201cHelp me, oh, Obi Wan Kenobe. How do I write a will.?\u201d That thought remove you should. An holographic will is very simply entirely hand-written. All of it is handwritten and signed by the testator; no typing allowed. Then the testator (the person making the will) signs it. And dates it. Done. Except in some states you don\u2019t need a witness. Or you may need more than one. Sounds pretty simple so far.? But suppose a beneficiary or non-beneficiary who is angry about what they did or didn\u2019t get contests the will. Now your estate not only runs up lawyer fees; somebody also has to pay for handwriting analysis and verification (a good reason to have it witnessed and notarized even if they\u2019re not required.) Analysed by an expert who is not your brother-in-law. By the time that mess gets settled; everybody is angry about how much of the estate has disappeared. That\u2019s nothing against lawyers and the handwriting analyst. It is squarely on the head of the amateur who tried to do an end around the legal system and get by on the cheap for cost of just paper and a pen. And don\u2019t forget that what you write down might be legal gibberish subject to more legal arguments and more legal fees. If real estate property is involved there is another level of complexity and cost. If your goal is to avoid probate and lawyers fees; get a living trust. Probate and estate lawyers make their money on the back end when your estate goes through probate. First they get paid for writing the will; then paid again for probate. With a living trust your lawyer is paid up front and for less than what it would cost for the same estate to go through probate. There are ins and outs with trusts; just like everything else. Rich people use them all the time to pass on their wealth relatively unscathed by legal fees; and it seems to be working rather well for them. If it\u2019s good enough for them, it\u2019s good enough for me. Time for me to shut up. I am not a lawyer. Everything I know about trusts is because I have one. When I die, who gets what is stated in the trust. The deed to my house already has my heirs\u2019 names attached to it; but I remain in full control. Upon my death, all a lawyer has to do is file a quit claim deed removing my name from the existing deed; finalizing the transfer. A couple hundred dollars. No probate. No probate fees. My trust cost $2000 to set up ten years ago. Costs may vary depending on inflation, complexity and location. My heirs pay nothing to go through probate; because probate isn\u2019t involved. See a lawyer. Please. Maybe your situation is such that you truly cannot afford any kind of lawyer and that is your reason for looking into a holographic will. In that case your estate is probably small enough that a holographic will to suffice. But if you can\u2019t fit all your bequests on a single sheet of wide-spaced notebook paper; you need a lawyer. Remember: 100% handwritten. sign it and date it in front of a witness and a notary public (free at any bank, although you may need to have an open account there) Keep it in a safe place. ",

            "answer_text": "A holographic will is a real roll of the dice, even if the few jurisdictions willing even to consider such a thing. One of the purposes of the safeguards surrounding wills is to provide a court with evidence that the will actually is the true expression of the decedent\u2019s wishes. How would that work considering the ease with whichh a person\u2019s head and shoulders can be forged? While the original forgery might show traces of the forgery, what happens when an \u201coriginal\u201d is created? That becomes the original thereafter. What safeguards might be created? Would having a few people swear that they witnessed the creation of the holographic will be sufficient? How would they know that details were not later altered and a new and different \u201coriginal\u201d created? How would the witnesses be able to say under oath that they are sure that the holographic will in court i, in all points, identical to the one they think they witnessed? The possibilities are fascinating from a technical viewpoint, but who wants to be the person whose will becomes the precedent? Cute idea, but absent clear evidence of the testator\u2019s intent and the content of the holographic will, there are so many equally easy ways to do the job without the substantial risk involved in verifying the accuracy of the holograph once the primary participant is removed from the scene.
