FruitCo used to replace borked bugs for free. just ask the Genius. not anymore. newer Apple white wired. the bugs with the pokey bit making it look like a tiny space ship. sound better than AWW. these are still one size first most. so my ears hurt after a session. better bass. I\u2019m bugged about the WHITE cable. feels like advertising. Sony MDRE9LP. SEVEN BUCKS! compared the FruitCo offering these bugs are 75% better. the sound is more rounded. enough bass. and the treble punches. this became my goto for gym rocking. who cares if it got wet, crushed, forgotten, or just stopped working. Panasonic RP-HJE125. comes in all the colors. has a rubber form for your ear in 3 sizes (included). sound better than the cheap Sony. cost twice as much. $14. cheap. KZ ATE. one dollar more than the Panasonic. and this the end of the story. possibly the BEST ear bugs you can buy on the price performance curve. sure, you can spend $250 for BOSE but I will tell you, it is really hard to hear the difference between $235. maybe you are trained in hearing audio. it takes a while to learn. and you must have a controlled room to really tell the betweens. wireless has three problems. compression, compression, and uptime based on a charged battery. do I want to rock anytime or do I want to manage another thing that eats power? rock. which is why I have a penchant for all things with wires. if you must wireless go with as cheap as possible. the LETSCOM Bluetooth Headphones IPX fit the bill for 2o bucks. spending more will not get you much more. do a try out and if you do not like them gift them away. AirPods\u2026 simply cost too much considering my environment. maybe if I talked on a phone or FaceTime I would find value. doubtful. plus, I can buy 10 of the wired bugs for the same cost. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what airpods are in your opinion. If they are just some bluetooth stereo headsets for you, then there are \u201cn\u201d number of better alternatives available in the market. One that comes first to my mind is Bose. BUT Let me elaborate what airpods are to me in my opinion. They are handsfree device for driving as you can even use one of them at a time coz both sets have their own micThey are awesome for taking calls and meetings because they are not noise cancelling earphones. I don't like speaking when I can't hear myself speak due to noise cancellationThey are good stereo earpieces for listening to music - better than many good quality earphonesThey are truly wireless earphones. All other bluetooth earphones have wires so you can not call them wireless IMHOThey have a charging dock which makes them go on for many hours without the need of charging themI can go on with a few more points. In my opinion nothing is better than airpods as a whole and considering that, they aren't expensive as well. Here are they:  Not sure if there are others who would agree with me. ",

If you\u2019re into high end audio, you want to listen o quality recordings and get the best possible fidelity, then I would say that most wired headphones are probably going to be better. If you want a headphone that is going to be a constant companion, be used for phone calls while driving, music for working out, and you use an Apple device, they may be the best. Supposedly the PowerBeats Pros, another Apple product, are very good too though. ",

Ergonomic and looks good.Connection, if you have an iphone or ipad, it will seamlessly connect once you take it out of the case. Then each time after, it auto connects. Really convenient and easy.Latency, other buds have this, but airpods have the lowest latency of the bunch, which means they are better than most for watching tv or movies with them. Less out of sync talking.Quick independent play, just put one in the case and have to other out, start playing music. You don't have to switch on a separate mode, or go into an app. It just works..At this point they are actually cheaper than most others options like the jabra elite 65t, bose soundsport free, sony wf1000xm3, beats Powerbeats pro.

I never wanted to buy them because for $160 I couldn\u2019t imagine them sounding much different than the $30 wires version. I\u2019m literally sitting on my flight now waiting. To take off listening to Steely Dan on my AirPods. They do sound noticabley better than the wired EarPods. Bass is more controlled and deeper and the mods are a bit more open. Highs are smoother. Is it a significant improvement over the EarPods, no. Is it it a noticeable improvement, yes. And I don\u2019t even need to do an AB comparison. And they are damn smart headphones. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy going wireless this much. ",

And then when you answer your phone and you realize you\u2019re going to be on for more than a minute or two, you pop them out of the case, put one in your ear, and bang. The call has been transferred to them. Other wireless Bluetooth headphones do not work this seamlessly. It may seem like a small thing, but I have 2\u20133 other wireless headsets around my apartment. They\u2019re all sitting in drawers full of junk with dead batteries because they just weren\u2019t that practical to use. AirPods are game changers in this regard. ",

For me, there is a big difference in audio quality between the two. The bitrate is significantly lower on AirPods and they just don\u2019t provide the immersive sound that the EarPods do. It\u2019s expensive because of the custom Apple-designed chip that allows you to pair it easily without going through a traditional Bluetooth pairing process. You\u2019re paying for an Apple experience, not audio quality. It is top notch though, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad for being a Bluetooth pair of headphones. It\u2019s among the best when comparing to other Bluetooth earphones, but no where near the wired EarPods when it comes to audio quality. ",

However we can rescue this question by pretending you are talking about the EarPods v. AirPods. Before I got mine I assumed they would sound the same, but actually the bass sounds a little better, but the rest is about the same. I have multiple other better sounding headphones, but the AirPods are my daily use headphones because they are super lightweight & convenient to use. I have for real gone to look for my AirPods only to find them already in my ears! That doesn\u2019t happen with my etymotics. Ever. ",
