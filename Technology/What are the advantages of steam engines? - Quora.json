            "answer_text": "TL;DR: Because it changed everything, forever. Today, the steam engine as you probably think of it is not hugely important on a global scale. In the developed world, they have been almost entirely replaced by newer (mostly) petroleum-fuelled engines. In the developing world, they may be used more often for various reasons; Usually because it\u2019s cheaper to maintain an existing steam engine than upgrade, or the fuel supply may not be available/significantly more expensive for a new engine. That being said, at one point the steam engine was probably the single most important invention ever, with effects that have left a permanent mark on the planet and the direction of human civilization. In very broad strokes: The steam engine enabled massive improvements in the scale of production. Farmers no longer had to rely on horse power to do everything. Steam tractors could plow, tow, harvest and more. They arguably require less overhead and constant upkeep than horses, and provide more power. Engines in factories allowed mass production of every kind of good you can imagine. If a steam-powered machine could do it, you didn\u2019t need to train a worker, pay a worker, and the machine always produces the same product. For the first time, ship were no longer wholly dependant on wind and tide for movement. This allowed proper scheduled transport on a global scale, the very beginnings of what is now the global supply chain, and \u2018Just-in-time\u2019 inventory management. They could also be made larger and faster, allowing more goods to be transported. My favourite steam innovation, the locomotive, allowed efficient overland travel. The previous method of transporting large quantities of goods overland (where no rivers were within easy reach) were canals. Canals were expensive to build, and canal barges were slow, only as fast as a mule could be encouraged to plod along. Railways also crossed entire continents, bridging nations. Look at the importance of trans-continental railways in the formation of Canada and the U.S. Steam pumps could move huge amounts of water. This helped in many areas as well, for example in mines and in land reclamation. Mines could be expanded deeper, accessing larger deposits of minerals. The Dutch expanded in a huge way on their existing reclamation projects to greatly increase the size of the country. These innovations changed the way humans lived. Less people were required to work the land to produce resources, so many came to work in cities. Despite less people producing food, more food could be produced and much higher populations could be supported. The global population started a dramatic rise, which has not stopped to this day. The \u2018middle class\u2019 slowly became a thing. People no longer needed to work all day, every day, just to support themselves. People could afford to spend more money/time on leisure. More entertainment goods and services developed. Travelling for holidays/vacations became a thing. Also, vacations became a thing. It\u2019s not all good news, however. Coal began to be burned in huge quantities, beginning global climate change. Easier access to better machining meant countries could keep larger, more deadly armies which increased the size and severity of wars. The greater concentration of people in cities increased the prevalence of mass disease; many epidemics are reported in large cities around the time of the early industrial revolution. I hope this answers your question. It is not nearly everything that could be said, this question is basically impossible to answer completely, but it should be enough to at least get thinking about the impact the steam engine had and still has.

            "answer_text": "Advantages include the following: Wide fuel capacity. Anything that can be burned in a controlled way may be used as fuel. Furthermore, concentrated solar energy or waste heat from industrial processes may be used.Complete combustion can be approached with a relatively simple furnace design. By contrast, internal combustion engines require sophisticated emissions controls systems.Steam is an efficient heat transfer medium. Furthermore, the vast majority of the otherwise wasted heat from a steam engine system is available at the condenser and in the right setting could be put to efficient use in a combined heat and power system.Compared to other external combustion engine designs, a steam engine system is often simpler and with better power density.I am aware of three steam engine systems under development that I consider interesting and promising for some settings: (1) Terrajoule: This company is developing medium scale and modular solar thermal power plants with exceptionally low cost thermal storage systems. The cost for storage is approximately $60 per KWh electrical for a system that lasts 30 years without capacity degradation. The overall efficiency is surprisingly high. However, the relevant consideration for solar energy is not efficiency but COST - especially the cost for energy storage. The video is a brief introduction. They have since adopted the steam piston engines constructed by Spilling Technologies (Steam Engines).  (2) Uniflow Power: This company is developing small scale combined heat and power systems designed to be fueled by biomass.  (3) Village Industrial Power: This company is developing a product similar in scope as the previous, but with design differences that include a oil-less engine and somewhat higher operating pressure and power. The emphasis also is combined heat and power with special focus on micro scale agricultural operations that provide crop residues for fuel and can make productive use of the heat in food processing operations.
