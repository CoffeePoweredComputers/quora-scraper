            "answer_text": "LG V60, it has on average 2 day battery life (which can be more depending how you use it). It has a huge 5000mAh battery but most importantly, the software is highly optimized so the battery lasts very long and currently is the king of battery in terms of flagship phones. I'm sure there are many other Chinese phones that may have all sorts of crazy features and extreme battery life (there's a phone with a gigantic battery but it's super thick).. but the V60 is a top of the line mainstream flagship that currently has the best battery life of all phones in 2020. Sometimes it's not really about battery capacity that makes a phone have excellent battery life (though it is partly the reason why).. but the main focus is really on power efficiency (the hardware, usually the CPU) and software optimization which determines the battery life moreso than simply the battery capacitor. You can have a phone with a 5000mAh (like the ASUS Zenfone 6), but if the phone is not optimized correctly, then having a big battery is pointless because the phone is not efficient and will drain battery more quickly. The ASUS Zenfone 6 has a 5000mAh battery, but everyone was very disappointed with the battery life as it felt like it actually had a 4000mAh because the phone software was not optimized. LG has improved their software and it's incredibly battery efficient, more than before (beginning with the LG V40). ",
