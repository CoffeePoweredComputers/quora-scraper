            "answer_text": "An MIS executive would be any position within a company that has responsibility for the computer systems, processes and services. Executives are usually in charge of budgets and several layers of management, who have the direct report employees doing the actual work. Examples would be CIO, Director, Information Systems, or Manager, Information Systems. There are many other executive positions in the IT field, from operations to development to financial. Post secondary education can open up doors for those opportunities. Thanks, Will England ",
