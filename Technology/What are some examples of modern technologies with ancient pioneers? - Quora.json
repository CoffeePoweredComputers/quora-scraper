            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology- A recent technology which consists in the development of structures at a nano scale. However, this technology is much older than one could imagine. The first example of nanotechnology is a 1,600-year-old Roman Chalice found in the Smithsonian.  Know as the Lycurgus Cup, the chalice appears green when lit from the front but red when lit from behind. The reason behind this mysterious colour change remained a secret until 1990 British scientists used a microscope to do analysis of the glass, discovering that Romans did indeed used nanotechnology : They\u2019d impregnated the glass with particles of silver and gold, ground down until they were as small as 50 nanometers in diameter, less than one-thousandth the size of a grain of table salt. The exact mixture of the precious metals suggests the Romans knew what they were doing From This 1,600-Year-Old Goblet Shows that the Romans Were Nanotechnology Pioneers If you want to check how it changes colours check the link above.

            "answer_text": " \u201cIf I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\u201d Sir Isaac Newton wrote that many years ago, and it\u2019s stuck with me as a masterful testament to his dignity and humility. More than being humble, it\u2019s also a genuine truism: Isaac Newton accomplished truly great feats of scientific discovery, but he wouldn\u2019t have been able to make those achievements without a scientific framework to build upon. Modern technology is the much the same: today\u2019s computer chip owes its existence to the discovery of fire millenia ago, albeit in a long, disconnected sort of way with a lot of steps in between. Without fire, there would be no mining or metalworking, no semiconductor manufacturing, no electrical grid, and ultimately not enough human population to use the device even if it miraculously appeared out of nowhere. Ultimately, human technology is just like human DNA: a long line of advancement dating back to times so distant we don\u2019t even remember them now. The progress isn\u2019t always linear, the advances aren\u2019t always unbroken - but over time, it all moves forward from ancient technology to what we currently use. Perhaps, someday in the distant future, someone will another post just like this comparing their highly advanced technologies of the future with our technologies today - that would be truly humbling.
