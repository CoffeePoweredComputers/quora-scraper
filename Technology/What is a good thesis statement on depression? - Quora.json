            "answer_text": "Let's define what a \u201cthesis statement\u201d is: A thesis statement is a sentence that states the topic and purpose of your paper. We\u2019re talking about a single sentence that ties together the main idea of any argument. Whether you\u2019re writing an argumentative paper or an informative essay, you need a thesis. For example, in the context of your essay, a good thesis statement will summarize your topic (Depression) and will declare your position on it. This sentence will tell the reader whether your essay is something they want to read. How do you write a Thesis Statement? There are different types of essays out there, thus different types of thesis statements. The kind of statement you\u2019ll write will depend on the type of paper you are writing. An argumentative thesis statement affirms the topic of your paper, your position on the topic, and the reasons you have for taking that position.An analytical thesis statement specifies the topic of your paper, what specifically you analyzed, and the conclusion(s) you reached as a result of that analysis.An expository thesis statement states the topic of your paper and lists the key aspects of your topic that will be discussed in the paper.Examples: Depression is a mental health condition which can affect thinking, energy, feelings and behaviour. Depression is a very common condition which affects 1 in 10 people at any one time. It is possible to minimise the impact of depression by accessing information and support and finding ways to manage the condition. Depression is one of the most common mental health illnesses in the United States, affecting about 27% of adults.  The qualities of a good thesis statement: Position: Your thesis should be stated somewhere in the opening paragraphs of your paper, most often as the last sentence of the introduction. Length: You should aim for a single sentence that is at least two lines, or about 30 to 40 words long. It should contain at least two clauses, usually an independent clause (the opinion) and a dependent clause (the reasons). Strength: A strong thesis needs to tell your reader what the paper is about and also help guide your writing and keep your argument focused. If you found this answer helpful, please leave an upvote.

            "answer_text": "A thesis is basically a summary of your idea or main point you will make in your paper. Examples could be about: Depression\u2019s effect on relationshipsCorrelations between depression and ______.Effective alternative treatments to depressionI personally went through a major depressive episode, based on the diagnosis of \u201csevere adjustment depression\u201d when my entire immediate world I knew changed within a few months. During this time, I ignored many warning signs, thinking I\u2019d look like a \u201cpansy\u201d if I went for counseling for \u201cminor issues\u201d as I thought they were (largely based on others\u2019 opinions anyway). Eventually, my therapist had suggested I may not have needed medication if I had come in for counseling and support sooner. So I would be intrigued to know if there was any correlation to the severity of depression and the time spent before treatment. I would also want to know if the necessity of medication to treat depression was higher, lower, or the same, in those who sought help early and those who waited. This would need some heavy research, but the results would allow me to construct my thesis - \u201cEarly diagnosis of depression suggests a lesser need for drug-based intervention\u201d (provided my research showed this). I would then defend this statement by offering examples and proof of this claim, as well as offering potential counter-claims and how I\u2019ve addressed them. I hope this helps you, as a thesis (especially one for a dissertation) has to be one you believe in, otherwise your panel will know. ",
