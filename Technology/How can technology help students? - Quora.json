            "answer_text": "Globalization When schools in different parts of the state, country or world connect, students can \"meet\" their counterparts through video conferencing without leaving the classroom. Some sites, such as Glovico, are used to help students learn foreign languages online by pairing a group of students with a teacher from another country. Educational Games In younger grades, teachers expose children to computers through educational games. Instead of playing board games that focus on education, students can learn the basics of spelling, counting and other early educational lessons through computer games that make learning fun. Because many schools have at least one computer in each classroom, the teacher can make that computer a vital part of learning for young students. Distant Education In the past, students could take distance or continuing education classes, also called \"correspondence courses,\" at community colleges and universities. After enrolling in a course of this style, a student would receive course documents in the mail and would be required to mail assignments to his teacher at the educational institution. The process could be long and complicated. Thanks to technology, continuing education students can take courses over the Internet at their convenience. Increase in Education & Learning Process Classrooms are equipped with smart boards, computers and laptops which help the students to learn in a smart way. Research If a school's library is outdated or lacking in a selection of titles, a student might find it difficult to compile the necessary research for an essay or research paper. As long as the school has a computer lab, students are able to use the Internet and digital encyclopedias to obtain the research they need. While students should be wary of the legitimacy of some of the content they read online, many schools use software like the Encyclopedia Britannica to help students do research. ",

            "answer_text": "Great! I up-vote your question because usually people blame students for using internet because they could use it for negatives\u2026 To get into the answer\u2026 1.First and far most\u2026 Students are able to find and learn so many things related to their academics and interests as PPTs, YouTube Videos, PDFs etc., 2. Students are able to build their programming knowledge so well using websites like W3 Schools, Cpdecademy, Codewars, khan Academy etc., 3. They practice for IIT, JEE, GMAT, CAT, TANCET etc., exams online. Soooooooooo boring of just reading about only Education stuffs\u2026isn\u2019t? Well\u2026\u2026!!! 4. Students learn their passion via Google - I mean they google about the things that they are so much passionated about - Arts, Drawings, Dance, Singing, Coding, Speaking Skills etc., and make them well versed in the same. 5. In the fast moving world many students don\u2019t find time to read Newspapers\u2026 So they are using Play Store Apps like THE HINDU, TOI, DailyHunt, BBC News etc., to keep them updated! 6. There are plenty of mind games available online like BrainTeasers, MindBlockers, UnblockMe, LogicMasters, etc., for them to relax in a purposeful manner. 7. Students who stay away from home and do their studies are equally concerned about their health. So, they cook food and eat. And the obvious adviser for those people is online cooking websites like ABasicCook, AllRecipes, FineCooking, Delish, ManjulasKitchecn etc., which also relishes their taste buds. 8. So many UG and PG students are now interested in Stocks and eCommerce. And their asylum is Google and the related sites like MSN Money, Investor Guide, Investopedia, WooCommerce, Alibaba, eBay etc., 9. Last before but not the least thing\u2026 Fitness and Diets\u2026 People follow Facebook and Instagram pages of the related websites and are keeping them fit and healthy. 10. Most interesting of all! Online Shopping!! Students explore so many Books, Study Materials, Project Work - Base Products, etc., online in websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc., Hope I have convinced enough for you to accept that Technology does so many positives in a student life :) ",

            "answer_text": "This is my personal opinion, and in no way should be taken as a universal answer. I feel that in education, the most important aspect is for students to learn the skills required to further their knowledge on any specific topic. With this in mind, remember also that some skills, such as deductive reasoning and scientific experimentation, are pretty much eternal. What technology can do, is to enhance and encourage the development and understanding of a student in these skills. What it cannot do and should not do (and this is equally important) is to replace the skill set. An article in The Guardian, titled \u201cCrash\u201d, talks about how higher proficiency and abilities are required when deploying technology, not because those are required to operate it, but because when technology fails, greater levels of proficiency are required to mitigate the effects. I think what technology can do, is to overcome human limitations in learning, but cannot do the learning for the student. It is for this reason that I always tell my students that \u201cfor all the advanced Engineering and mathematical software available out there, the ones who will be the best at what they do are the ones who can do it with pen and paper. Technology is only a tool, which you have to know how to operate, before it can help you\u201d. That being said, technology can and has overcome multiple limitations - physical, geographical, even psychological and mental. But technology without the means to guide it is\u2026well, think Skynet.
