            "answer_text": "Let me preface this by saying that almost every startup success is unlikely. For every startup that gets even 100 users there are 9 others that didn\u2019t even finish a product. For every startup that gets to 10,000 users, there are 99 others that didn\u2019t finish the product or got stuck somewhere between 100\u201310,000 users. \u201cMassive\u201d startup successes are exceedingly rare and for every company that I\u2019m about to list, there are a million others who fizzled out. However, the following companies often discovered an anomaly in the market at just the right time and executed on it to perfection to make some of the most unlikely success stories. On the topic of users, let\u2019s start with: Twitter - If you\u2019ve read the book \u201cHatching Twitter\u201d, you will appreciate just how unlikely Twitter\u2019s success was. At first, it shared the same limitations as texting because they were a \u201cmobile\u201d company long before smartphones had become what they are today. On top of that, there was constant internal bickering among its leadership team. At one point Twitter went through three or four CEOs within an 18-month period. At another point they had hundreds of theousands of users with no database backups. It was around this time that the Fail Whale became one of the first internet\u2019s memes thanks to Twitter\u2019sservers constantly crashing. All of these sound like huge problems, but the market wants what the market gets, and Twitter was (and still is) the only social networking platform that captured the raw, unfiltered essence of the internet and restricted the number of characters in which people could communicate. Truly real time information. Just brilliant.Google - At the time google was starting out, several VCs rejected the idea just because of the number of search engine companies that already existed (AskJeeves, AltaVista, and Yahoo). Based on the sheer number of competitors alone and Google being a late entrant into the market, it seemed highly unlikely. Yet, the right partnerships and technology combined with a focus on a good user experience made google the largest online advertising company in the world. Now they own the most popular search engine and also the second most popular search engine (YouTube)Airbnb - This is one of my personal favorites because it shows how much determination has to play a role in success. Airbnb was also unlike most companies. It was started right before the recession and the founders believed they could convince people to sleep on their couches. With very little technology knowledge, their first iteration was just a blog where they posted their own air bed for rent and it came with free breakfast. When times got tough because of the recession, they funded their company by selling Obama O\u2019s and McCain Crunch cereal and living off the leftovers. True scrappiness at its finest.There are several other companies I can write about (PayPal, SpaceX, Instagram, etc.) but these three companies capture three unique markets with unique approaches that the leadership team took to achieve success that was highly unlikely.

            "answer_text": "The founders started by renting out blow up mattresses in their living room. There was a conference in town and all the hotels were sold out. Somehow people were willing to rent these air mattresses in their house. At one point, the founders thought they\u2019d make money by creating their own brand of air mattresses and selling them to people looking to make side money by renting them in their homes. They were originally turned down by 99% of the VCs they pitched. Their first round was raised at a $1.6m pre-money cap. They went on to become one of the fastest growing startups in the world, enabling anyone to rent a spare room or couch in their home. Airbnb was a wild concept. Who would have thought people would become comfortable renting a spare space to stay in their house? My whole life my parents cautioned me not to even get in a strangers car. Now this business was trying to get me to sleep in a strangers home. The success of Airbnb has to be one of the most incredible.  ^One of the apartments I\u2019ve rented on Airbnb! ",
