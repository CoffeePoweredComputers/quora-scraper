            "answer_text": "I am Estonian and have grown up together with e-Estonia. Because of that, I only learnt later in life that proper WiFi in the middle of nowhere is actually not a basic human right and not everyone gets to do their taxes online within 5 minutes during your morning coffee break. Just as the lack of hassle and smooth operations in official business is in most parts true, so is, unfortunately, some of the negative parts in the country. I completely agree that the educational system could sure use a boost - why not learn from Finland, when it comes to this area, THEY are the country of the future. And while we\u2019re at it, teachers, health care workers, firemen etc should get double what they\u2019re making now. There\u2019s still tension and prejudice at work from both sides between the Estonian and Russian communities, as well as a subtle, lingering racism; the latter, I believe, just as is the case often elsewhere in the world, has its roots in the \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d rather than anything else. The casual alcoholism, as well as the embarrassing pay gap between men and women are well known tar drops in the sweet honey pot of the e-country. However, the digital and the e-everything is something where Estonia really is in the forefront. Even if not yet fully there with all the solutions and practices, the right way of thinking is there. And because I believe this deserves so much more attention, this is the main reason why: e-Visas. It\u2019s not there yet, but in the works. Digital nomadry is here, and on the rise. I do genuinely think it is the future of the world - an Earth without borders, allowing free movement to everyone. Estonia understanding this and working on supporting such lifestyle is the reason I think Estonia is the country of the future. Someone\u2019s got to roll up their sleeves and get it started, and I\u2019m proud Estonia is doing just that. If nothing else, it maybe gets others thinking, joining in or trying to beat Estonia to it. Which is obviously great for the nomads. Digital nomads can soon \u2018make it official\u2019 with a new visa from Estonia ",

            "answer_text": "Whenever I travel to Estonia, I\u2019m left with the impression that there\u2019s a lot there that represents \u201cthe future\u201d. The almost frictionless bureaucracy, Wi-Fi everywhere, nearly cashless society and digital just-about-everything is what a lot of the world seems to be marching towards. Even the trains were more futuristic the last time I was there (a shame, actually, since I have a soft spot for the old ones). That said, Estonia really only represents one vision of the future. There are quite important social problems stemming from government investment (or lack thereof) in certain sectors which aren\u2019t what I would like the future to look like. Additionally, many of the buildings on the outskirts of the larger towns and cities - what my wife refers to as \u201cSoviet leftovers\u201d - are in increasingly poor condition. While they still have a slightly \u201cretro-futuristic\u201d sense to them, something will need to be done about them going forwards. ",
