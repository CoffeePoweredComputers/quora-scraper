            "answer_text": "It has affected me in a positive way. You see, clearly technology has improved our way of living. You can now access all type of information in a single click, you can connect with friends all across the world in a single click, you can travel much easily and can also educate yourself in a way that wasn\u2019t possible before, via distance learning, Mooc\u2019s, \u2026 For me it was more the fact that teachers saw in the use of technology in classroom, a way to captivate our attention and speak to us in a way that makes sense to us youngsters. I truly saw a difference in attention and engagement in classes that used online response systems. One tool that was really fun and easy to get by with was Wooclap, the initiative wasn\u2019t that difficult to take for teachers because it is really super simple to use. It was an online voting system that enabled the teachers to integrate questions in their powerpoint presentation, and the questions would pop up on our smartphones, tablet or computers. We simply had to answer the live polling during class and the results were then analysed in real-time by our teacher. It would really lead to an increase in interactivity and participation coming from the audiences side. It would also force us to pay attention to the class better to respond correctly to the questions and just helped us anchoring better the information we were collecting during the class. Bottom line, I don\u2019t think there has to be a drastic change in education in the sense that we should totally bring robots and AI in every classroom, but there is I think a certain mindset that needs to be taken into consideration by educators and teachers all across the world: We are surrounded by technology today and most of the young kids growing up now were basically born with a phone in there hand, so instead of fighting this reality, let\u2019s just embrace it, even in classroom, because this is the reality that speaks to all the youngsters out there today.

            "answer_text": "I think all of us can only truly speak for ourselves. From my perspective, I think that technology enhances how far we can expand on a topic. Technology allows us to gain more information and make discoveries without having to actually know and understand every detail of the subject. It allows us to quickly get up to speed on the discoveries made by men before us without having to actually learn the proofs. Example: If you had a problem you wanted to solve, that required complicated math to solve but was not necessarily a math problem, you could use Wolframalpha to solve the problem, get the answer and begin to use that acquired data without actually understanding why the answer to the math problem was 32. Once you've made a discovery with this data (and proven it as fact), someone else can simply google your findings and use them to make their own discovery without understanding how you derived your answer. I think this example is seen often when using simulation software. Somebody somewhere learned and proved why/how \"y=mx+b\" is the equation of a line. I don't really care why or how. The other day I used that equation in a program to make something work. We use technology every day. We don't each understand how these devices fully work, but we don't need to in order to use them to solve problems. That is the paradigm technology introduced. Learning no longer means memorizing information. I think Learning means today, piecing together already existing findings into conclusions. Just my two cents though. ",
