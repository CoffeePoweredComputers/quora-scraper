            "answer_text": "Reasons to choose SEAS Reason 1: If you want to be in a university which focuses only on the branch which you choose, then you should opt for AU. From the very first semester AU teaches courses which are strictly in the domain of ICT. In the first 2 semesters each, You'll be taught a course in electronics and a course in programming. PDPU, like any other GTU affiliated institute within Gujarat, will assign you with courses from all the other branches of engineering. Frankly, you'll have to study chemistry, physics and elements of other branches in the first couple of semesters. First semester at SEAS ICT will have these courses:- 1. Calculus and Differential Equations (Engineering Mathematics) 2. Basic Electronics or Electronic Systems and Design (The PBL version of Basic Electronics) 3. Introduction to computer programming (C programming) 4. User Centered Design (A non technical course, Google it! ) 5. Communication Skills (Please check the exam time table thoroughly and make sure you appear for this course. I mistook the timings that year) Second semester at SEAS will have these courses:- 1. Discrete Mathematics (Previously before this course was taught, it was converted into a PBL) 2. Digital Design (THE perfect course for those who aspire to do electronics thoroughly ) 3. Object Oriented Programming (Java programming, in a nutshell) 4. Electromagnetic Theory (I bet, this is the only course here which sucks) 5. Environmental Studies (Since this course is mandatory for all institutes) Clearly, most of these courses are in the domain of ICT and those which aren't are either mandatory or very light courses. Reason 2: PDPU has never had its placements for ICT and Computer Engineering, since these branches were introduced a year ago. We have had two placements till now, and the packages have been good too. Reason 3: One of the biggest reasons why people don\u2019t prefer PDPU: You have to pay more than 2 lacs per annum to study there. It is located way far away from Ahmedabad which makes it particularly inconvenient for city students. Students end up opting for bus facility which is not cheap (Believe me, it\u2019s not). Reason 4: Apart from a well maintained campus, we have all the facilites which PDPU students get. Free WiFi, lecture halls are centrally Air-Conditioned. The multi-disciplinary lab at our campus is something to check for, it is something which our PDPU counterparts are bereft of. Reason 5: This university has never looked back since it was established 5 years ago. We are here only to improve. JOIN US FOR GLORY! ",

            "answer_text": "If you compare PDPU with Ahmedabad University(AU) then certainly PDPU is better than AU in terms of rankings and it\u2019s foundation. But as you\u2019ve specifically asked about ICT. I\u2019d recommend Ahmedabad University due to following reasons. PDPU has started ICT from last year and their main stream is petroleum engineering. Whereas AU is teaching ICT for past 5 years(No college in gujarat has more experience than AU in ICT except DAIICT) and the main stream of AU is ICT.I don\u2019t know teaching procedure of PDPU but one can face issues with faculty availability and their teaching process as PDPU\u2019s ICT is still new and they would be finding good faculties and a quality curriculum.How you\u2019ll learn in college will be very much different from how you\u2019ve learnt in school. your seniors plays an important role in learning as they give you lots of advice about what to learn,where to learn and how to learn. you\u2019ll not get this advantage in PDPU.You will not get any information about placements in PDPU(ICT) as they don\u2019t have any passout batches yet. On the other side 2nd batch of AU has just passed out and 2 students out of 60 got appointed as SDE(Software Development Engineer) intern in amazon. that itself is a great achievement and university is expecting many more from upcoming batches.In conclusion i\u2019d like to say that if you have passion for computer,circuits or electronics then even goverment college is satisfying. But if you talk about this 2 colleges. You should take admission in PDPU provided that you have a known source from PDPU who can give you the information about their ICT faculty and their course structure. Otherwise Ahmedabad University is Best for you. At last, If you\u2019re asking about this 2 quite well-known and well-established colleges, You must have got some good grades. Don\u2019t forget to give me treat if you take admission in AU(as i\u2019d be your senior) . Cheers.  ",
