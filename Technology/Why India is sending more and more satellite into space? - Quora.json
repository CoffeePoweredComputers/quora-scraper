            "answer_text": "India's space agency ISRO offers the cheapest satellite launches; so cheap, that even SpaceX can't match the price. ISRO technology is very very stable and ISRO hasn't yet had a single crash for he past 32 launches or so which it makes it very reliable. ISRO sent a probe (satellite-types) to Mars on the first attempt, something which noone has been able to do, not even NASA, the agency with a $18 Billion budget. Maybe ISRO makes things so cheap because hey are Indians and we are experts at Jugaad ( quirky hacks) ! :-) Jokes apart, the cost of materials and labour is quite low in India which is why we are able I launch satellites into space for dirt cheap prices. This also helps us earn dollars and keeps our Forex reserves a little more full. Plus ISRO often tests new technology during these launches and indirectly, foreign agencies and companies are paying for ISRO's research. Credit must be given to ISRO for achieving milestone after milestone on a shoestring budget. Advancement in Space research is crucial for a country to stay ahead of the curve and bring out revolutionary technology. I mean come on, who made the GPS? The Internet? The Americans right? Why ? Because they had support from the government and they believed R&D is important. But now ISRO has beaten NASA In quite a few departments and will continue to do so. After all it's an Indian Agency and Indians are the world's most intelligent humans. Even NASA is full of Indians. All the top CEOs of the world are Indians. So these multiple launches will help ISRO test new technology and eventually establish India's own Manned Space program! ISRO recently launched about 22 satellites at once and on another mission it was able to send multiple satellites to multiple orbits! https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.isro.gov.in/update/22-jun-2016/pslv-c34-successfully-launches-20-satellites-single-flight&ved=0ahUKEwiwm5jx3cfPAhUEwI8KHSv3ApkQFggbMAA&usg=AFQjCNHJ5ODMdV75PcBbXsMBGStgwPCmvghttps://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-takes-a-shot-at-history-isro-to-launch-eight-satellites-in-longest-mission/story-swiWyQgArSuWvNM08MFZnM.html&ved=0ahUKEwj5k4i_3sfPAhUISo8KHZvgDkoQFgglMAM&usg=AFQjCNG0KkH6u4JwGyEwJ4D052eddmOEgwhttps://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/live-track-isros-20-satellite-launch-from-satish-dhawan-space-centre-in-sriharikota-2868290/&ved=0ahUKEwiwm5jx3cfPAhUEwI8KHSv3ApkQFghFMAM&usg=AFQjCNEBzKdraTZtFynENEpeoTcuhe9ATQIn case you are reading my answers for the first time, Hello!
