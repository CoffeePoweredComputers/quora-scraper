            "answer_text": "The internet is very skewed in the information available. A lot of information is surprisingly \u201cmissing\u201d or requires very deep search methods. Some of it is censored. Some of it just does not have the interest. Some is trade secret material. Some of it is very labour intensive to add, and costly to host for no commercial benefit. A good rule of thumb is if they are not allowed to show it on \u201cMythbusters\u201d, then it will be hard to find. (Explosives and rocket fuel sping to mind). Some government sites have a policy of removing all non-current information. (Australian Taxation Office). Others seem to make a point of not providing any useful information at all. Circular references and few answers. Others are just gone one day. Good luck finding any useful data on your eBay purchases from 10 years ago. Some sites just do a very bad job of keeping up maintenance (IBM). In an arbitrary Australian state, family court records are available for the public to view, but are not on the internet. The local council cannot provide development approvals online older than 5 years. This is information we notice is missing, because it greatly inconveniences us to not have it, but within living memory we had to travel to get it. Then there is fake news, fake search results. Bad but accepted answers on forums. ",

            "answer_text": "The Internet provides access to an unfathomable amount of information, so much that it\u2019s reasonable to say that the Internet has too much information. Still, this is only a tiny amount compared to how much information is not accessible through the Internet. Consider all the things written before computers were available. While Google has done a commendable job of scanning books, their collection is a tiny percentage of all the books in the world. That information is simply unavailable digitally. Even if you just include digital information, there are reams of data collected in government repositories that are not connected to the Internet for security reasons, untold petabytes of data in membership/subscription databases that Google cannot index, and who knows how much information that\u2019s slowly decaying on old floppy disks and tape drives. Is this too much information? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s more than what you can get to by using Google. ",
