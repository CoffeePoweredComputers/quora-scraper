            "answer_text": "The types of optical fibers depend on the refractive index, materials used, and mode of propagation of light. The classification based on the refractive index is as follows: Step Index Fibers: It consists of a core surrounded by cladding, which has a single uniform index of refraction. Graded Index Fibers: The refractive index of the optical fiber decreases as the radial distance from the fiber axis increases. The classification based on the materials used is as follows: Plastic Optical Fibers: The polymethylmethacrylate is used as a core material for the transmission of the light. Glass Fibers: It consists of extremely fine glass fibers. The classification based on the mode of propagation of light is as follows: Single-Mode Fibers: These fibers are used for long-distance transmission of signals. Multimode Fibers: These fibers are used for short-distance transmission of signals. The mode of propagation and refractive index of the core is used to form four combination types of optic fibers as follows: Step index-single mode fibers Graded index-Single mode fibers Step index-Multimode fibers Graded index-Multimode fibers ",

            "answer_text": "An optical fibre is a thin cylinder of dielectric material able to transport light. The beam launched into the fibre is propagated by total internal reflection. A simple thin cylinder of glass acts as an optical fibre, however it is extreme fragile and breaks easily by applying a small bend. A way to reduce this fragility is to coat the rod with a smooth material like acrylic, silicon or polyimide. The fibre is now much more robust and flexible. However, the light cannot anymore transmit inside the fibre since these protective layers have similar or higher refraction index than the rod and therefore no more internal reflection occurs! To solve this problem, the rod (it will become the core of the fibre) is surrounded by a layer of glass (called cladding) with a small refraction index to permit total internal reflection. The refraction index difference between the core and the clad defines the angle (numerical aperture) at which the light can enter into the fibre. The core diameter ranges from few microns up to few millimetres. There are several kinds of optical fibres. Types of optical fibres ",
