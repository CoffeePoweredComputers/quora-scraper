            "answer_text": "On large ships and some land based platforms, we have been playing around with directed energy weapons for quite some time now.  Lasers that shoot down incoming aircraft are slowly coming online.  We are at the baby steps currently but evidence suggests that we will be crawling and maybe walking soon.  We canceled the airborne laser program few years ago, but it was was promising.  It's a huge learning curve but one we are attempting and if it all works out, it will be a game changer if we can master it.  Some of our newest ships have massive capacity to generate more electric power in anticipation of these new weapons becoming a reality. ",
