            "answer_text": "My kids are just starting with Tynker. My son loved the tutorials and before I paid for the premium package I did a search to see what my options were. Tynker is based on Scratch, which is free, and the Scratch community apparently wasn\u2019t happy (their forum has little nice to say about Tynker). I played around with Scratch but it is more of a sandbox than a course. It requires someone to curate and guide. Tynker provides a bunch of courses that walk a kid through it in a fun way. I will say that though there was content that was interesting to my 6 year old, she was more interested in the movie/drawing creation and that is not easy enough for my 6 year old to do by herself. Part of that is her age, and part is that the UI for that stuff isn\u2019t very intuitive on a tablet. The content for my 8 year old was great and he is eating it up without guidance (on the PC). The organization and packaging of the content is what you get for the somewhat pricey $8 per month ($4 for the second child, and only with a year subscription, it is twice is much for two months at a time).

            "answer_text": "Tynker is basically a programming platform for kids that makes use of Block Coding and is based on Scratch by MIT. Kids can create games, programs etc. on it. Kids can drag and drop blocks of code and build things. It has been used by many kids. There are other options as well for coding for kids like Blockly and Thunkable. You could speak to the student counsellors at Coding Elements for a structured learning plan for the child. Based on the comfort level of the child as well as his aptitude, they will come up with a useful syllabus and learning path. Coding Elements has 1:1 LIVE Online sessions in coding for kids that can be taken from home. There is a dedicated mentor allocated for each child. Apart from just learning coding concepts, they also let the child do a lot of activities and projects that keep him engaged. These projects also help him develop his creative thinking as well as problem-solving skills. Here I am adding the link for the website of coding elements in case you want to go to there website to have a look at the courses offered by Coding Elements.
