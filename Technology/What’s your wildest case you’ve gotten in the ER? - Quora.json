            "answer_text": "Tough call! So many choices. There was the time I physically removed a man from the ER, through the waiting room and into the parking lot because he was dangerous, but the police refused to get involved. Another time I tackled a mentally unstable man and tossed him into a stretcher and sedated him. Another time we were treating 2 people who were shot by the same man. We learned later that the shooter was in the ER that night. Another time a man called us and threatened to kill all of us. The police walked through the ER and left us unprotected. I got my \u201cBilly Bob beat down stick out of the truck and sat in front of the glass ambulance bay doors until daylight. At the time I was told that those doors were bulletproof. My favorite story was another gunshot wound. These people often present by private vehicle with tires screeching, horns honking, doors slamming, shouts and fists pounding on our doors. Such was the case one peaceful night. My team started to run for the door to help these people. I shouted for them to step around the corner, out of the line of sight of the door, so that we could pull on some gloves while the security officer opened the door. There was shouting and obscenities and \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d as they pounded our door. Just as we were about to open the door, about 10 seconds after their arrival, they succeeded in kicking the doors open, and then they threw a black guy face down and bleeding on the rug. As we were pulling the stretcher into position, his black \u201cfriends\u201d who had thrown him through the doors, began to kick him in the ribs, yelling, \u201cGet up N, get up N!\u201d Of course they were shouting the complete \u201cN\u201d word. And that\u2019s when I realized that our doors weren\u2019t bulletproof. They weren\u2019t even boot proof! It was a few moments of chaos, confusion, pushing and shoving as we attempted to protect this gunshot wound patient from further assault. But the assailants actually were his friends who thought they were helping. These were the people who brought him to us for help, kicked down our doors and threw him inside for treatment. Apparently, in their minds, it was a good idea to kick their buddy in the ribs after he had been shot in the chest! ",

            "answer_text": "It was in the 90s. I had been training to occasionally float to the emergency room of the children\u2019s hospital I worked at in Washington, D.C.. One night I was pulled away from my shift on another floor to assist with a Code coming in via ambulance. It was a 15 year old male who had been been sideswiped by a truck (by his dealer). He appeared awake and alert with no obvious signs of trauma, fully clothed, so the doctor asked me to cut off his clothes\u2026now that meant heavy duty jeans and I remarked, wasn\u2019t it faster to pull them off? I was so naive! The doctor wanted this guy to be punished of his expensive designer jeans. He let us pull them off anyway. It was quickly determined the guy didn\u2019t have a scratch on him and I returned to my floor. I was then off for a day and when I was returned I was assigned to the step-down ICU. And assigned the same kid\u2026with a bullet wound. My first thought was\u2026had we missed a bullet wound????? NO\u2026he had been released and the dealer had tried to kill him, again. Concerned, I asked the big nurse (my boss!) what was to keep them from coming into the hospital to try and finish him off? I was scared. They had not \u201cjohn doe\u2019d\u201d him\u2026.that was not done in those days. She took me seriously, went off, and came back with an answer. She said \u201cthe word on the street is Children\u2019s is off-limits\u201d\u2026which was no comfort at all. Of course, now they are \u201cjohn and jane doe\u2019d\u201d automatically. The guy was fine BTW. ",
