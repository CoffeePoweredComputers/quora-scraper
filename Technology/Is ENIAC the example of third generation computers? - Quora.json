            "answer_text": "No, ENIAC was one of the first generation computers (early 1940\u2019s to mid-1950\u2019s), which used vacuum tubes. It is considered the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. There were others before it, e.g. Z3, which used relays instead of vacuum tubes, and the Colossus, which was special-purpose. Other first generation computers included the the UNIVAC I, IBM 650 and IBM 701. ",
