            "answer_text": "Apple\u2019s software. Apple has used Sony IMX camera modules in every one of their iPhones. About the only stand-out thing you can say about Apple\u2019s choice of Sony module versus most other smartphone manufacturers: they\u2019re small. Apple used 1/3.2\u2033 sensors through the iPhone 5, 1/3\u2033 sensors in most of their other phones, and 1/2.9\u2033 sensors in the iPhone X and perhaps other more recent phones. The average premium smartphone uses 1/2.6\u2033 sensors, Sony\u2019s been using 1/2.3\u2033 for a long time, and Huawei just came out with a phone using a 1/1.7\u2033 sensor. And in fact, if you have a higher-end smartphone, there\u2019s a really good chance that your phone, too, has a Sony sensor. Sony sells around 40% of all the camera sensors that go into any kind of digital camera these days. Some Canon and Panasonic P&S cameras have them. Several of my Olympus mirrorless cameras do as well, as do a number of Nikon DSLRs. The job of making a good image on a phone is a pretty daunting one\u2026 so much of it\u2019s software. First of all, you need to trick the novice user, a person quite often with no knowledge of photography, into taking a good photo. Every P&S camera, every smartphone, etc. have some kind of \u201cintelligent\u201d shooting mode that\u2019s designed to let you literally \u201cpoint and shoot\u201d and yet still get a good image capture. Apple\u2019s got theirs, Samsung\u2019s got theirs, LG\u2019s got theirs, etc. They\u2019re all a bit different, and one reason is that the camera in your phone is considered by every manufacturer as a key point of product differentiation. Since about 2011, they have all worked pretty hard to deliver really good performance, given the terrible constraints of a smartphone. Once the shot is taken, there\u2019s image processing. Sometimes way too much of it, but some of it really necessary. There\u2019s \u201ccolor science\u201d \u2014 how the software converts the actual image captured into something that delivers accurate or pleasing color\u2026 there\u2019s plenty of artistic license here. There\u2019s also filtering applied, particularly in low light\u2026 software to soften an image to reduce visible noise. There are many ways to achieve this. Then there\u2019s sharpening\u2026 software applied to make the image look better without making it look artificial. Apple\u2019s got their own particular spin on these things. All software. Two cameras with the same sensor do not necessarily deliver the same image. And finally, these days, we have \u201ccomputational photography,\u201d the idea of applying even more image processing to change some fundamentals of an image. Apple does in this portrait mode. They\u2019re image processing the shot, isolating your subject, and apply blurring effects to the area outside of the subject mask. Since a phone is basically your camera and your computer at the same time, this kind of thing is just beginning.

            "answer_text": "TLDR: iPhone\u2019s camera is different from any smartphone camera in that it is extremely limited, less color accurate than any smartphone I could think of at any price point, it doesnt allow you to disable HDR, and it doesnt let you genuinely lock exposure. If we are talking about iPhone XR and up, the difference is Apple\u2019s post processing, their color science, and Smart HDR. Those are 3 basic things that all make iPhone\u2019s camera an iPhone camera. Now I\u2019m a long time iPhone photographer so I have been studying iPhone\u2019s camera since iPhone 4. By far, iPhone has the worst camera of any smartphone in its price range. So the difference is how badly it takes photos compared to other cameras. Now I\u2019m going to explain just how since a lot of people are blinded by the Apple logo. Sheepism is the reason why nobody is complaining about the worlds most popular camera. If Apple says it is good, it must be good. It is not. And I\u2019m one of the biggest Apple fanboys in the world. Trust me when I say that. So in any photo, you need contrast to see depth. The contrast between shadows and light is what allows you to picture a 3D environment based on a 2D image. But also the bokeh can provide that depth too. iPhone\u2019s Smart HDR is good in that it captures HDR images but it is far too extreme and unnatural looking for people. There is also no way to disable it. It is ingrained into the camera system. So in a portrait photo, the area of the face that should be darker is brightened up, and the areas that should be bright are darkened. This is because HDR squeezes the contrasting shades of light and so it takes away that element of a photo that provides depth. In a way, this also eliminates detail - color detail. So the subtle differences of color change in any specific area is completely eliminated. What I mean is when you take a photo of a bright red bucket, for example, it should have a light shade of red on top and a darker shade of red on the inside where there is no direct sunlight. But iPhone\u2019s camera squeezes the light and shadows together so the bucket taken on an iPhone will appear to have almost consistent lighting throughout the inside and outside - not realistic. Another thing that makes iPhone\u2019s camera different is its color science. It has a unique color capture that is not very close to reality, and is exaggerated many of times. If you take a photo of green grass on iPhone XS or 11, it will be a lot more green than reality. iPhone tends to take out the yellow in greens, so grass comes out looking more like a neon green color than in real life. Red is also extremely exaggerated and oversaturated. iPhone cannot capture colors accurately.  On the left is how the newer iPhones take photos. Gone are the days of iPhone being great at cameras. In this photo uploaded by Macrumors, you can see how flat the new iPhones take photos. Green is no longer as accurate in the new iPhone. And there is less contrasting in trees for example, giving it less definition. If you\u2019re taking a photo of a person, iPhone flattens the look of the person, making it look like there is a Paper Mario effect turned on, but iPhone also tends to make light skin tones look more orange than in reality. So flat and orange faces is what you get, compared to any other smartphone camera. Another thing that makes iPhone different is the fact that it is the only smartphone camera that doesnt allow you to lock its exposure. Even when you use a third party camera, to lock exposure, iPhone\u2019s sensor still has a reaction to light changes when you are panning across a scene with contrasting light. It gives you very limited control of exposure and dynamic range. And it lies to you many times with its placebo buttons.  David Hopkins on YouTube has a very detailed video that shows you the difference of iPhone\u2019s camera vs any other camera. How the HDR button doesn\u2019t actually do much. And how incorrect the color reproduction is on iPhone. The difference is that iPhone has a really stupid camera in its own unique way. The Pixel in this video represents any other camera because all other cameras have these characteristics of the Pixel phone. That is\u2026 Options.  ",
