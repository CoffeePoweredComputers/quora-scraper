            "answer_text": "It depends on your personal situation a bit. However, I\u2019d strongly caution you to pay off the balance each month, and not run up balances, even at lower interest rates. Don\u2019t spend, or if you must, use a line of credit. For credit cards, my favorites are: Fidelity: they have several cards that offer 2% back, and the money goes to 529 accounts or your brokerage account (but you can withdraw it). 2% on all purchases, not bad.American Express Cash Builder: 1% on all purchases refunded. 3% at gas stations and department stores. 6% at grocery stores (up to $6,000 per year). Use this one only at gas stations, department stores or grocery stores.Chase Freedom: 5% rebates on a few categories each quarter. It can be restaurants, gas stations, department stores, Amazon, Walmart, etc. There\u2019s usually two or three categories per quarter. Useful only for the categories, otherwise you get 1%.Now, while I travel some for business, I go to places where I can\u2019t always take the same airline. So frequent flyer miles or Starwood points aren\u2019t that useful for me. I\u2019d rather have the cash back. But if you live in Atlanta and fly a lot for business, might make sense to get a Delta Skymiles Visa card (or whatever it\u2019s called). The miles might be better than cash back for you. Sometimes there are Visa or Mastercards tied to a single merchant where you get 3% back at that store. I don\u2019t bother because it\u2019s not really worth the effort to remember to pay it because I use those so infrequently. I get 2% minimum with the fidelity card, so that 1% on $150 purchased a year just isn\u2019t worth the effort. But if you shop at that store a lot, might be worth it. For a while, car companies offered x% back for a new car purchase. If you knew you were going to buy one of those cars (and a new car), might be worth it. I don\u2019t work for a credit card company, and never have. This is just based on my use of the cards. Biggest thing to remember: don\u2019t carry a balance. ",

            "answer_text": "Credit card companies are the financial institutions (in most cases, banks) that issue credit cards to consumers and service their accounts. American Express is also known for being the world\u2019s largest issuer of charge cards and for targeting its products to high-income individuals with strong credit scores. As a result, Amex is a great source of lucrative rewards credit cards, but is not heavily involved in the credit improvement space. It is interesting to note, however, that Amex has in recent years partnered with Walmart to introduce the Bluebird Prepaid Card, the company\u2019s first foray into the growing prepaid card market and seemingly an attempt to expand its consumer reach. Bank of America is not only one of the largest financial institutions in the world, but one of the largest companies as well. Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, the banking behemoth now has nearly 300,000 full-time employees and does $100+ billion in annual revenue. Barclaycard, the payment card business of London-based banking giant Barclays, was the first UK credit card program when it was introduced in 1966. Barclaycard US was established in 2004, when Barclays purchased U.S.-based Juniper Financial Corporation. Capital One is the 5th largest U.S. credit card company in terms of both outstanding balances and purchase volume. The company, established in 1995, is based in McLean, VA and has around 1,000 branch locations in the District of Columbia, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Texas, and Virginia. In addition to credit cards, Capital One is known for offering everyday banking products, personal loans, and auto loans. As we have numerous companies who offers credit cards with different rewards program as well as with cash back offers some time we get confused like which credit cards is best for us, to know this, firstly we have to decide our credit score like we have bad credit score, excellent credit score or no credit history. Second thing which card is beneficial for us why we need like for travel points, student or a business purpose. For this you also get online site which helps you to get the best credit card, but I recommend Lowcards Which will compare credit cards and also suggest you the best credit card according to your credit score and need.

These cards can carry high annual fees but also offer travel credits and higher points on travel and spending. AmEx Blue Cash offers great return for groceries and Visa Amazon Prime for Amazon / Whole Foods spenders. Other cards, such as the Citi Double Cash offers 2x the points for general purchases and more benefits for Mets fans. ",

            "answer_text": "You do not necessarily need a credit card to build credit. Credit is actually \u201clines of credit\u201d and payments made over a period of time. Therefore, it is simply your management of debt and how well you can manage your finances according to pre-defined rules. You can begin by going to a bank and establishing a bank account if you have not already done so. Once completed, ask to open a secured line of credit, which is simply a credit card, issues from the funds in your actual bank account. Since the banks are establishing a credit line, they are required to report this information, as well as because they make a profit from this. You can do this as many times as you want. Rule of thumb, use only 10% or less of the balance on the card per month. So if you have a phone bill of $50, you will need $500 in credit to keep things at a 10% maximum use. Do this with 4\u20137 cards and in 2 years you will have close to an 800 score or possibly even go over the 800 mark which is excellent credit. This is provided that you are not behind on other obligations like loans, etc. You can also get loans that you pay off over time, like a deferred payment plan on laptops, furniture, etc. The reason I suggest your own line of credit is also the fact that it\u2019s your money so if you spend it all, there\u2019s no debt to repay. You simply have nothing left in your account. Good luck. ",
