            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways that makes each of us individuals. People have answered about our talents, our intelligence, about the ways we motivate ourselves, and what excites us, but there are also values and aesthetics. To begin with, we have our values. In our attempts to fit in or to be accepted, we might believe that our values are common. We might begin with certain takes on morality and ethics, but we each have our own style of expressing and honoring those values. For example, you might believe that teaching a person how to budget their money is more helpful than paying for a semester of college. You might find that \u201cbeing a man\u201d depends on having a job and a place to call your own, while another person may believe that \u201cbeing a man\u201d results from a ritual and a ceremony after demonstrating specific knowledge and skills. There are many examples where people believe they share common place beliefs but actually don\u2019t when given enough time to compare specific beliefs. Another way is how we approach problem solving: some people need to solve problems with their hands. Others need time to study and research. We also differ in aesthetics. We are \u201cdefensive\u201d from certain kinds of sensations. Some people don\u2019t like to feel cold things like metal or sheets. Some people don\u2019t like certain textures in what they eat. Some people cringe from polyester. I can\u2019t stand the squeaking of wet sneakers against a naked floor. I hate the squeaking of balloons as well. Flavors are also sensations. Some people hate the taste of cilantro or the taste of mint-chocolate chip ice cream. There\u2019s a certain level of fun talking with friends about the kinds of foods they can\u2019t stand. This also true about sensations we like or even crave. How do you like your steak? well? well-done? medium-rare? bloody? Do you even like red meat? Do you like salty foods or savory? What foods do you prefer cold? which ones do you prefer hot? warm? There are people who actually like warm beer. There are also people who love cold coffee which is different from iced coffee. Certain fabrics feel better than others. We each have our favorite \u201ccomfort foods\u201d, preferred snacks, desserts, and breakfast cereals. Sometimes, we might find there are themes to what we like; other times, we can\u2019t make sense of it all. There are also preferred ways to express our feelings. Some people express love by what they are willing to sacrifice or give up. Others do this by buying gifts. Still others verbally express their love. It is the same with confrontation and disagreement. We have our ways. Always remember that each of our values and aesthetics manifest along a spectrum. Sharing a dislike for coca cola doesn\u2019t mean we both hate root beer. And we might both like root beer, but I might dislike natural root beer, preferring the processed, highly artificial root beer. Or I may prefer one brand over another. I might like spicy seasonings at a certain Scoville scale score lower than someone else who enjoys higher scoville scale scores. We both love hot foods but I might be seen as a lightweight compared to another\u2019s taste for spiciness. All of these together might describe how we are unique because, with all of these preferences and styles of expression and habits added up, we find that each attribute makes us less like many others.

            "answer_text": "Here is a list of characteristics, unique or not is subject to one's opinion, which have played a part in the evolutionary success of homo sapiens aka humans ->  OUR BRAIN (yeah, I know, its a no brainer :P) -  Brain was/is the ace that human possess. There is a misconception that we have the biggest brain relative to our body size. No, we do not. Neither do we have the biggest brain (sperm whale wins the top prize in this category). But we do have the larger cerebral cortex relative to the brain than any other species on the planet. This part is involved in cognition, language and information processing. The best thing it did was that we were able to retain and pass the information that we collected during our lifetime. This resulted in an unprecedented growth of our capabilities.  Language - A corollary to the evolution of brain was language. Communication through complex language is something that is unique to humans. Other primates can use sign language to some extent, but, a well developed process of vocal communication and interpretation is something unique to humans.Body Posture and Shedding of Body Hair - The upright body posture for locomotion is something unique to humans when compared with other primates. What this did was it freed our arms to do other useful work which helped in our survival. For ex-> use of tools, hunting and gathering food ( and in typing this answer :P ). We were able to run long distances compared to other animals. Now, running posed a different challenge. It increased our body temperature. To cope up with this we slowly lost our body hair. This resulted in cooling down of body through sweating. This helped the humans in savannahs of Africa during the infancy of human evolution. Formation of Social Groups - Parental care and social bonds , a result of complex and enhanced cognitive abilities ( courtesy - our brain :P ), resulted in enhanced rate of survival and to this day plays the most significant role in our life.Well, the assumption, and I am almost positive  that you have not assumed this ( because the question was tagged in \"Biology\" and not in philosophy, religion etc.), that only humans have unique characteristics and other species dont is fraught with a solipsism. Other species also have unique characteristics that we dont. The fact that we and the other species have survived this long is in itself a unique thing.",
