            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to disagree with Mark Toole\u2019s answer here (and I often don\u2019t) for reasons of generalization. We\u2019re a helpdesk, live chat, and customer messaging platform and have integrations with VOIP platforms like Aircall, RingCentral, JustCall, and many others soon. Over the past year, we\u2019ve placed higher priority on integrating call center software due to rising demand across our user base. The reason for this high demand is fueled by the growth of B2C eCommerce and DNVBs. eCommerce companies both small, medium, and large are jumping on board implementing a call center to increase the reputation and trustworthiness of their business. Call center software can be implemented in a variety of ways now that actually tie into the idea of conversational commerce. There doesn\u2019t need to necessarily hav PBX or IVR just because it\u2019s a call center. Modern call centers can support integrations like direct logging of customer data into a helpdesk (like Re:amaze via RingCentral), data tracking, in-app call recordings, that can actually boost customer satisfaction. If there\u2019s one thing that might kill off call centers, it\u2019s chatbots. But from where I stand, customers still like calling just for a peace of mind and to see if a business is large enough to actually have support personnel for phone calls. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Ashton! Honestly, I don\u2019t think call centers will be ever put out of business. Chatbots may sound like a threat, but they\u2019re still in their infant stage and they won\u2019t replace contacting a real person. Of course, there are many communications channels - email, instant messengers, social media, etc. but still, the majority of customers prefer to call a real sales rep to solve their issue.  Nevertheless, tech trends have been changing the way call centers operate and they will likely shape their future. Here are a few trends to give you the idea: Cloud. The call center doesn\u2019t have to be a huge and costly project. With a cloud-based solution, such as CloudTalk, it\u2019s possible to set it up and integrate within a few clicks.IVR. An interactive voice response system helps to automate the process by routing the call to the right agent or providing simple information like an address or working hours.Emotion recognition. Some modern call center solutions, such as already mentioned CloudTalk, offer emotion recognitions thanks to which agents can use scripts that work better with furious or confused customers.I hope it helped!

            "answer_text": "Technology trends are sexy. But how about\u2026  The fact that people HATE phone calls. The last phone call I actually answered was over 2 weeks ago. From my wife. And it lasted less than 1 minute. And I actually LIKE her! Calling a business for any kind of customer service issue is fucking MISERABLE. Phone rings half a time and then INSANELY LOUD BEEP IN YOUR EAR. Silly music Spanish talking. Press 47 for English. Silly voice recording menu that pretends to be a person and makes you talk back to it. I\u201dM SORRY I DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND Eventually you get some overworked script reading NPC who asks you a bunch of pointless \u201cverification\u201d questions before telling you things you already knew and tried. Occasionally, you eventually get your problem solved. But every time, precious minutes and hours of your life are sucked away, never to return. In the olden days, phone calls were the best way to solve customer problems. The alternative was writing a letter and waiting several days, or longer, to maybe receive a response, that MAYBE would actually be helpful or correct. Those days are past. People used to expect to have to talk to customer service. They expected regular issues, problems, etc, and that someone would have to fix it. And they expected to have to call on the phone to make it happen. Not anymore. If I buy something and it doesn\u2019t work correctly, I am UPSET. I feel cheated. You sold me a thing that didn\u2019t deliver on your promises! I need it fixed NOW. And I don\u2019t want to pick up the phone and chat with the lowest ranking guy at your company about it. Prevent customer problems before they happen.Offer support via channels that respect people\u2019s time.Email and live chat are both great options. Remember, customer service is what happens after you screw up. It\u2019s you fixing your mistakes and making things right for the customers affected by them. Forcing me to pick up a phone and go through automation hell to fix a simple thing that shouldn\u2019t have been broken in the first place is just fucking primitive. I write more about how businesses can get it right here. ",

Even on mobile if you don\u2019t have to leave the browser I prefer live chat over calling. Chat bots which are constantly updated and have a lot of data to offer may take some load off call centers. Max 30% load off. But it is a big number if you consider the total. Initially more jobs for coders but in long run cheaper solution. ",
