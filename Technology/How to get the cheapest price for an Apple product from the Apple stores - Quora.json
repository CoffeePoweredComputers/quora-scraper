            "answer_text": "A2A. You asked: How do I get the cheapest price for an Apple product from the Apple stores? There are several ways, in decreasing order of discount: Buy a refurbished instead of a new product. The main difference is they come in a white box; you get a lower price, the same warranty, the same ability to buy AppleCare.Be a student or a teacher with official ID identifying you as such. Often the educational discount is higher than the employee discount.Be an Employee, and use your employee discount.Have an Employee use their employee discount, and buy it for you; technically, they are not supposed to resell it within a year, but Apple will look the other way for immediate family/spouse/children.Have an employee get you the \u201cfriends and family\u201d discount. This is less than the employee discount, but more than no discount.Get the partner discount. Apple employees get discounts on partner products; for example, car companies who put iPod/iPhone docking ports or dock software in their on board entertainments systems, hook in steering wheel controls, etc.. The deals are usually reciprocal, meaning you also get the deal with Apple. Check your company\u2019s internal web site for details, or contact your HR department. These deals are typically the same as the friends and family discount.Other than that: Apple doesn\u2019t really negotiate prices. It\u2019s not like going into a consumer electronics store, like Best Buy, where they can move on the price, if they are willing to lost their percentage commission on the amount the move down. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Prices at Apple Stores are set by Apple. Apple provides the following discounts: Education (must have student ID or teacher\u2019s credentials)Military (must have military ID)Business (must have federal tax ID number)If you have the necessary credentials, you can get a discount of about 5%. Otherwise, there is no haggling and no other way to get a cheaper price at an Apple Store. What I do is buy from Apple online. I almost always buy refurbished. That\u2019s the best way to get a discount. ",
