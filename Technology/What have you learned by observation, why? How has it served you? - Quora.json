I understand people as I\u2019ve studied them all my life. \u201cWhat have you learned by observation?\u201d I learned how people behave when they feel understood, and how they behave when they feel misunderstood. When they\u2019re understood, they attach themselves closer. They trust me because they feel familiarity, that I could know or understand them at a deep level. When they feel misunderstood, they withdraw, or they\u2019ll try to explain themselves for clarity. They want to escape, run away from the pang of feeling misunderstood, because everyone wants to be understood. Donna Thompson ",

            "answer_text": "Only impartial self observation has any value, and no one is born with this skill, it must be learned and it cannot be learned via words so the best that books and lectures can provide is a kind of stimulus to our curiosity about this matter. When you learn this skill, one of the first things that becomes crystal clear is that everything, all of life, is completely automatic. We do nothing (except observe, and only when we remember to observe actively, not what passes for observation in conversations about it). It is all done, and done by the cosmos, not us. We get to witness what the cosmos does when it becomes a human body, but only when we are free of the attention trap, the contents of the thought stream. ",
