            "answer_text": "When you want to become a digital nomad it is good to start with looking at your skills and profession. How do you stand out in the crowd of other freelancers trying to make a living while traveling. The next step is how much money do you need to make to be a nomad. do you need to pay income taxesvisa coststravel costsmedicalsavings for a rainy dayyour lifestyle (what do you need to be happy)and last but maybe the most important: your business costs: gear internet ont he road etc.The step after that is to see in which country you can live on that money. I moved to the Philippines where the cost of living is affordable to cheap. Now I consider moving to another country and I seriously look into the daily expenses I need int hat country before I move on. I know not many nomads talk about their lives this way, most of them work and than travel, I see many stranded, selling bracelets to make it for the next plane, or violate their visa by working in a bar or a resort to make some extra money. I think that should not be the case. You should be able to provide and have some spare money for just in case. It is tough to make it in the world of digital nomads but not impossible. You have to have a plan and a financial overview. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean, can you make enough money to live off it, the answer is yes - sometimes. There are a lot of wannabe entrepreneurs living in bottom-of-the-barrel hostels in Thailand, watching their savings dwindle as their dreams of \u2018making it big\u2019 as a travel blogger or drop-shipper slowly crumble away through lack of dedication or perseverance. I make a very good living as a freelance copywriter http://www.thejetsaettingcopywriter.com/my-ebooks\u2026 (I made $16,000 last month alone), which pays me enough to only have to work about 7 months a year (I travel the rest) and gives me plenty of freedom. But work is still work, no matter where you do it from. ",
