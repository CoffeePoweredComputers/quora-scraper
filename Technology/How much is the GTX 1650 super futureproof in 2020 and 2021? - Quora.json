Even though it\u2019s overall faster the 1650s only has 4gb of ram which hurts it for me in 2020 vs the rx 850 with 8gb. Both will play the more demanding games at 1080p 60ish fps (assuming half decent cpu)if your willing to drop settings to low/med. The problem is future proof. For 2020\u201321 you should be fine though upcoming cyberpunk 2077 will likely push the requirement envelop. Gameplay on ultra with ryzen 5 3600  ",

            "answer_text": "the gtx 1600 series are not future proof and if you happen to have one expect to be upgrading around 2022 to 2024. while they will remain usable for many years beyond then, the power and feature set of the newer cards will require you to upgrade. I\u2019m still using cards as old as the gtx 560 ti, gt 640 and gtx 770 cards on my non gamer machines. why because they still work are paid for and provide the functionality i need to put an image on a monitor. some games still work well on the old tech others suffer from to low a frame rate to be worth the time. i only need 40 fps to play a game with modest settings. for more serious play i switch over to my primary gaming box ",
