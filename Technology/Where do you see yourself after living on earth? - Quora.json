            "answer_text": "After living on Earth, I see my body dissociating back into the individual atoms of which it was composed. I see those atoms returning to the planet and ultimately the universe where they originated - to be incorporated in countless other materials living and non-living. This is what they have been doing since they were synthesized in the death throes of stars and what they will continue to do until the end of the universe. I am eternal and so are we all. ",

After I\u2019m dead, there will be no more of \u201cme\u201d than there was before I was conceived. Whatever happens to my body and its constituent atoms is no concern of mine\u2026 because there will be no me to be concerned. When the brain stops, self ends. That\u2019s as true for you as it is for me. ",
