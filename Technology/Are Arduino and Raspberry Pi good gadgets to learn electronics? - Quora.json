            "answer_text": "\u201cAre Arduino and Raspberry Pi good gadgets to learn electronics?\u201d Absolutely not. You\u2019ll learn a bit about logic and programming but very little about electronics. I began (at age 10) by building a crystal-set radio. I expanded that with a transistor amplifier driving first earphones then a loudspeaker. I built various simple test circuits to flash lights and to create audio tones. Then I built a full superheterodyne valve (vacuum tube) radio. Then a transistor superhet radio. Then various other devices including a guitar amplifier (valves), record-player amplifier (hybrid), oscilloscope (all valve). Most of these were built to designs found in books and magazines. I expanded my knowledge of components (resistors, diodes, transistors, valves, transformers, capacitors, inductors, Integrated Circuits, etc.) as I progressed. That\u2019s how I began to learn about electronics. I followed it with a university course. After this I began to repair CB radios. I also designed my own circuits to go inside the radios to change frequency bands and improve filtering. I also repaired TV sets. Also, I repaired satellite TV receivers and designed various kits for modifying and repairing them. You can have great fun with pre-made devices such as \u201cArduino\u201d and \u201cRaspberry Pi\u201d but they won\u2019t teach you much about electronics. Frankly, I would suggest starting with something much more basic (and analogue), using discrete components, before progressing to micro-controllers and similar. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr: for prototyping and rapid engineering, arduino and RPi are one of the best components you can have. long read: To learn electronics? NO. However, if you want to just learn building and prototyping working systems as fast as possible. Then the answer is YES. With arduino (AD) and RPi you will learn only few basic electronics. Like how to connect circuits. Then after burning one or two ADs you will learn the power capabilities of the devices. Then you will learn power management a bit. By then, probably you will still be unaware of pull-up resistors and many other things that you would\u2019ve been forced to learn if you were using an actual ucontroller. If you are doing communication engineering work, you will learn to do communication using arduino in few minutes. But you still may be unaware of the protocols and handshakes that are going on behind the curtain. In a deep dive, you will be unaware of the circuits that power up these protocols. So, largely it depends what you think of learning electronics. With arduino and RPi what you will basically be doing is programming using standard board and devices. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, until you reach a certain point. Arduino will help you get started with micro-controllers. The code was made easy on purpose so beginners can start a few projects very quickly. With Arduino you will discover some communication protocols : UART, SPI, I2C. You\u2019ll also see how to read/write on analog/digital PINS, and how to set up a PWM. Raspberry Pi will allow you to do the same with GPIOs pins, however those pins are limited in speed and functionalities, compared to Arduino. If you want to learn electronics, and you have to choose between Arduino and Raspberry Pi, maybe go first with Arduino. Raspberry Pi will teach you something about 90% software - 10% hardware, and this board is more suitable for projects that need higher level of control, so basically more computation power and more software. So, let\u2019s go back to Arduino. What\u2019s cool with Arduino is that you\u2019ll be able to try a bit of everything, and you won\u2019t spend days reading a datasheet to understand how to set a bit in a register. It\u2019s more rewarding for beginners, and you can do many small electronics projects with just the very basics. However, at this point, well\u2026 \u201cYou know nothing\u201d. You\u2019ll have to go deeper, to learn how protocols are working under the hood. For example, take an oscilloscope, and learn how to debug a SPI signal between 2 Arduinos. Then go in the code behind the \u201cArduino friendly code\u201d, and try to see what\u2019s really going on. You\u2019ll also have to start learning how to read a datasheet, because at the end, datasheets will be your best friends. Oh, and don\u2019t forget about pull-up/pull-down resistors ! Well there are so many things to learn, and I can tell you that even I know more than a standard Arduino user, I still know almost nothing. Arduino (and Raspberry Pi) can be a good way to get started for beginners. It will open your mind and let you discover many different things. After you get some basics, you\u2019ll know better what to search for and where to learn more, so you can truly learn electronics.  I write more about how to program robots with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and ROS here. ",

They are both very capable pieces of kit, however they are meant for slightly different things. If you are learning electronics as a complete beginner, I would suggest you try without any microcontroller (that is, the pi or arduino) first as it is only an added complication. Familiarise yourself with basic components (resistors, diodes, transistors, logic gates etc.) and try some simple circuits to understand how they work. After that you can use an arduino or pi to make your projects more advanced. Some of the advantages the arduino offers are the following: - Analogue inputs (the pi is digital only) - Hardware PWM, pi is software only - More flexible options, there's a wider choice of arduinos with more pins or different functionalities. - Requires very little set up and is much simpler to use.  Arduino code is written is 'Wiring' (similar to C) whilst the pi is usually written in Python (other languages are available). Both are easy to learn and write for beginners. Good luck. ",

You can find a huge amount of projects on the INTERNET that are done by using Arduino. For testing and initial designing of an embedded system; you can easily use an Arduino to do so. And Raspberry Pi is an awesome Single Board Computer. If you want to add some processing power in your electronic projects then learning RPi is a must! You can do image processing, signal processing, machine learning or artificial intelligent projects using RPi. However, you can do almost everything that an Arduino can do by using RPi. But to my opinion using RPi for GPIO purpose which is a board having that much high processing power is completely not worthy. So don\u2019t wait for anything. First start learning about Arduino and do some hands on projects using it. Then learn RPi; it\u2019ll not be a tough ask for you if you have background knowledge about programming and microcontrollers. Hope you\u2019ll enjoy the journey; Enjoy! ",

What will force you to learn some electronics is when you start connecting them to external circuitry, especially if you need to build that circuitry or part of it. Depending on the complexity, you might have to learn quite a bit or only a little. In any case it is very worthwhile to start with some basic knowledge beforehand so you aren't as likely to damage something. Also, the scope of your learning will be quite narrow, not that that should discourage you however. ",
