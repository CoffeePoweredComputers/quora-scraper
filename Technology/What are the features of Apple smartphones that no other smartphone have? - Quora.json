            "answer_text": "Let me start by saying that I like Android phones. I love the variety of hardware and myriad software customization options. Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Note 8 are especially compelling for those who want the sexiest designs and most exciting special features. But when most friends and family ask me what phone to buy, I tend to recommend the iPhone over Android. 1. Much, much faster 2. The best cameras Samsung held the camera phone crown for nearly two years, but Apple has vaulted to the top spot, thanks to the cameras inside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. (The iPhone X will have a dual-lens setup similar to the iPhone 8 Plus'.) 3. Better Design With a few exceptions, like the gorgeous HTC One and Xiaomi Mi Note, there aren't many great-looking Android phones out there. Many are chunky and plasticky. The iPhone consistently has had a better design than Android phones. 4. No Android can match Apple\u2019s Fingerprint Sensor Some Android phone makers like Samsung and HTC have tried adding fingerprint sensors to their phones, but none of them are as useful and accurate as the TouchID sensor on the iPhone. A few years ago, Apple bought a company called Authentec that makes the best fingerprint sensors for mobile devices. No one else has been able to beat TouchID since. 5. Soon, you'll be able to control a lot of stuff in your home with your iPhone Apple's smart-home platform HomeKit will become more prominent this year as device makers start making new gizmos that work with it. HomeKit is a platform that will let you control stuff like lights and other appliances from your iPhone or iPad. Expect to see a bunch of HomeKit-approved gadgets later this year. All in-house Another element of Apple\u2019s success with the iPhone is that it\u2019s built entirely in-house. Software and hardware are designed together simultaneously to create an experience that\u2019s refined. The fact that it can design its own processors, displays and connectors goes a long way to ensuring the all-round experience is first class. A small, but obvious, example is the Lightning connector. It\u2019s durable, easy to use, and because it\u2019s got an authentication chip built in, it\u2019s hard to copy without the iPhone/iPad picking up that you\u2019re using a fake/Chinese clone. ",
