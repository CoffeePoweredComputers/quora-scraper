            "answer_text": "Whenever an American company wanted to do something in China, it\u2019s all about free market. Whenever a Chinese company wanted to do somthing in the US, it\u2019s all about national security. It\u2019s just an execuse, both the free market and national security.  Comparing to the national security, would you agree that the national emergency sound worse? According to the List of national emergencies in the United States - Wikipedia: Between the enactment of the National Emergencies Act in 1976 through March 13, 2020, 61 emergencies have been declared; 27 have expired while 34 are currently in effect, each having been renewed annually by the president. The US is under 34 different national emergencies right now. It\u2019s just a big toy only for US president and not a big deal.  Everyone knows the importance of holding the right to make standards. For example, the recent mask business between China and the US: The US firstly say that they\u2019d provide certificate for Chinese masks.Then Chinese company shipped the masks to the US.Once they have arrived, US government just altered the standard and declare all masks not fitting the US standard.Not just the Chinese company has received only 25% payment. It\u2019s now facing a lawsuit with huge amount of penalty, about 500 million USD.If the US mask standard were made by say France, then the US government wouldn\u2019t be able to alter the standard to not paying the rest of the payment while gaining another huge amount of income.  So why Huawei? Well, it has nothing to do with Huawei\u2019s smartphones. The real target is Huawei\u2019s telecom devices.     By company, by country, or by revenue share, China is at the leading position in 5G and telecom. China is de facto challenging the domination of the United States, regardless whatever the intention of China has. The US government is trying everything to re-gain the control of the communication industry.  After all, without American equipments being installed everywhere, how could CIA spying on people? No one knows backdoors better than the US, and no one dares to question an US spying. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they are aggressive as a company, they provide superbly good customer service, fast response and lead time and very value for money products (personal experiences) but never a National Security threat. As HuaWei culture they are not accustomed to losing battles or war, they also can go to the extreme, very focus and can withstand great pain and hardship once their mind are made up \u2026. Especially after getting wrongly accused, attacked, targeted, played, kidnapped etc.(personal experiences from competing with HuaWei before and without all these trump dirty tactics\u2026 these have become very personal now and will make them even more aggressive) Dirty trump political smear campaign against HuaWei and China is forcing all Chinese and American companies to break all partnerships and alliances. Google is wrong to remove HuaWei from accessing android and google play platform\u2026. Hopefully google and trump will live to regret it. HuaWei was already planning for this eventually after ZTE\u2026. Currently all android running in China are open source and not google (no Google, YouTube or Google Map\u2026. Replaced by Tencent and Baidu). HuaWei mobile sold in China are all China android and not Google Android. If all China mobile manufacturers could work together with tencent and baidu to come out with a third platform\u2026.. google might be forced out of the Mobile OS market like Microsoft (Top 5 android manufacturers beside Samsung are all Chinese) Personally I was lucky to get my hands on HuaWei China android mobile and I find the user experience more fulfilling because of richer applications and also free movies and music (need to see advertisements, pay then can bypass advertisements) New HuaWei phone would not be running Android Mobile OS in the future release. Even if Trump or google reverse their decision HuaWei and most probably all Chinese mobile manufacturers (maybe even Samsung will take opportunity to dump google android mobile OS) will support a third non-American mobile OS system (Beside Samsung and Apple \u2026 the rest of the mobile phone manufacturers are all Chinese) Also these events by trump shows to Chinese technology companies that they need to be self reliant and would start to create a non American eco-system. Currently HuaWei is starting to mass produce together with other Chinese and Taiwanese chips sets that will replace Qualcomm, Intel, Broadcom and others Thus in the future Chinese companies would be forced to produce mass quantities of chips and OS and software and unless American companies can compete and replace against low cost, high flexibility manufacturing of infrastructure intense China connected to the world, American would gradually be replaced by the Chinese. Most probably American would start their steep demise against the world starting from 5G deployment onwards (HuaWei is about 2 years ahead of her competitors, 1/3 the prices, full of features and applications and high customer services. Case in point \u2026. Australia who ban Chinese technologies in NBN (fibre broadband), Singapore (both countries have about the same costing \u2026. Source : Singtel and Optus) \u2026Australia: 50 Mbps cost about $60-$70, pay as you use digital line and no free applications. Singapore uses Chinese technologies: 500 Mbps cost $29, free unlimited talk time on digital line, a lot of free applications . Thus USA would follow the scenario \u2026 more expensive and lower quality 5G network\u2026 US consumers and corporations would pay more for lower quality and 2 years behind products and services. Remember project prism (Edward Snowden via Wikileaks) \u2026. It was the American government (NSA, FBI, CIA, US military) and American companies (Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Apple, Goggle, Intel, Qualcomm, Networks, Junipter Networks, AT&T, IBM, Dell, HP, UPS and a lot more) that was caught red handed hacking, spying and stealing source codes and information globally. Think about it how is it possible after years and years of hacking, spying and stealing of information from all companies globally, Chinese governmental agencies, Chinese military, Chinese universities, innocent Chinese citizens that the Americans could not provide any single bit of evidence to support their smear campaign. Which no brain idiot would believe\u2026. Australian, Canadian, New Zealand (now pushing the buck onto their operators), Japanese and UK (now saying as long as core network not use then ok) governments. Funny why no western mass media or governments are asking or inquiring about the American global hacking, spying and stealing of global source codes and information\u2026. ",
