            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not a question of whether you\u2019re unconscious, it\u2019s a question of whether the brain is receiving sufficient oxygen. If the oxygen supply is cut off for whatever the reason, you have a matter of minutes before your brain begins to die. I\u2019d have to look up the exact number, I\u2019m sure you can find it easily. Just being unconscious by itself doesn\u2019t damage your brain, although whatever made you lose consciousness may have done some damage, or it may still be damaging you, for example if you\u2019re being poisoned. But people are placed in drug-induced comas for days at a time for medical reasons. And of course you\u2019re unconscious when you\u2019re anesthetized for surgery, often for several hours. ",

            "answer_text": "You got it backward. Unconsciousness does not cause brain injury, it is normally the result of brain injury. As they say in the health field, unconsciousness is a symptom, not a condition. You can be unconscious for an extended perioid, as in a medically induced coma, without the unconsciousness damaging your mind. Conversely, a severe head blow, or a lack of oxygen, can cause even life-ending brain damage without a significant interval of unconsciousness at all. ",
