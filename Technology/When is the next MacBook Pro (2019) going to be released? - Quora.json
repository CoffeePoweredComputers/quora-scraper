            "answer_text": "I have zero inside knowledge from Apple. But let\u2019s see if we couldn\u2019t figure out a plausible answer to this based on facts that everyone has access to. MacBook Pro release dates in last 10 years (dates are for 15\u2033 models) February 2008, October 2008, June 2009, April 2010, February 2011, October 2011, June 2012, February 2013, October 2013, July 2014, May 2015, October 2016, June 2017, July 2018 Time periods between releases (for 15\u2033 models) 2008\u20132008: 8 months 2008\u20132009: 8 months 2009\u20132010: 10 months 2010\u20132011: 10 months 2011\u20132011: 8 months 2011\u20132012: 8 months 2012\u20132013: 8 months 2013\u20132013: 8 months 2013\u20132014: 9 months 2014\u20132015: 10 months 2015\u20132016: 17 months 2016\u20132017: 8 months 2017\u20132018: 13 months So, looking at those periods between releases, we can see that Apple \u201clikes\u201d to take 8 months between releases but sometimes goes longer for some reason or another. The time period between the 2015 model and the 2016 model was especially long\u201417 months\u2014which makes sense because the 2016 model had a lot of changes from the previous version. That is where we first saw 1) the touch bar 2) a new keyboard design 3) a switch to exclusively USB-C/ Thunderbolt ports instead of the previous variety of ports. There were probably design and manufacturing issues behind the scenes on the 2016 model that we the public were never fully allowed to know about. (Although we obviously saw some repercussions, for example the problems many had with keyboard failures on the 2016 model.) So, based on this pattern, I\u2019d guess that Apple would like to release the MacBook Pro 15\u2033 (Early 2019) 8 months after the 2018 model in March 2019. But of course, if there are any design or manufacturing issues, they could go longer. ",

            "answer_text": "Now, I\u2019m all for asking silly questions. In some cases thinking about what we accept as convention is how we revolutionize society. In this case though, I highly doubt it. Since I joined Quora, I\u2019ve seen a broad spectrum of quality in both questions and answers, and I find that in order to give a good answer with some form of discussion (Quora seems to love answers that are at least square in size, i.e. paragraph width matches the height of the article), I often have to assume that the person asking put thought and effort into the wording and level of detail of the question. As such, here goes my answer: The question is poorly designed as it includes an assumption without evidence. Granted, there are rumors of the next gen MacBook Pro out there right now, but until Apple themselves confirm the rumor or actually release the product, it\u2019s all hearsay and vapor, similar to the Apple car or Apple TV (as in an actual display to replace your living room flatscreen). And even though I agree that we can safely assume that the latest version of the MacBook Pro isn\u2019t the last one, we can\u2019t say for certain that it will release in 2019. But, I\u2019m going to level with you and grant your assumption. Given that there will be a \u201cMacBook Pro (2019)\u201d, when will it be released? In 2019. Why? Because you said so in the product name. And how about that, I managed to scrape together a \u201csquare\u201d answer out of a question which had the real answer in itself. Let\u2019s see how much exposure it will get. ",
