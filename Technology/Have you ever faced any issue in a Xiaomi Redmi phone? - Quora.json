            "answer_text": "Yes. The day I bought my Xiaomi Redmi 3s, it hung up twice while using the Play Store to download WhatsApp.Even after downloading WhatsApp, WhatsApp hung once. I had to reboot it.Later, on the second day, my phone again hung twice or thrice while using Play Store.On the third day, my phone's camera stopped working suddenly when I was about to click pictures.I decided enough was enough, and I tried to get it exchanged. The people from Flipkart forwarded my complaint to Xiaomi and the Xiaomi Technicians asked me to update my software. I update my software from MIUI 7 beta to MIUI 7.5 Global Stable. All my problems got solved after that. I guess the problems were occuring due to the beta version of the software. I swear I'm never gonna use beta versions again. Apart from that, SHAREit does not work on my Redmi 3s most of the time for reasons unknown to me. In case you are reading my answers for the first time, Hello!

            "answer_text": "At first, I must say that this phone is amazing, in every aspect like UI, Gaming, Camera, Battery(Really awesome), Its built in apps like Calculator(Yes, mi calculator take it to another level) etc., etc. But i faced 2 big issue with this Cell, Since 1st day \u201cXender\u201d work seldomly and after i upgraded to MIUI 8, xender didn't worked a single time. Simply shows error while connecting.Although, the battery is great. I am facing a strange problem of battery draining. Somtimes, battery works normal but many times it drains at veryyy high rate, for eg., in night the battery is 40% in morning the phone is switched off, even i had to charge it 2 times a day to use it. At times, this is very frutrating.(Sorry for grammitical mistake if any) ",

            "answer_text": "I am using a Xiaomi Redmi dvice(1s) for almost 2 years now. I got it in the 3rd sale which makes me one of the oldest customer of Redmi. The devices are exceptionally good considering its cheap price. To your answer I would say that yes there is a slight problem. To increase its performance it clocks its processor higher than its hardware can support (in short it has heating problems). But that was my problem. Xiaomi launched that device to catch the Indian market. It successfully did so. So it now has got that problem resolved and trust me it is one of the cheapest and most hardy device with a tremendous camera which I have come across. I hope I got you the answer you were looking for. cheers :) ",

I am from Bangalore,India. 4 of my handsets Xiaomi redmi 4a, 4 and note, none of them are having network. It shows full network on screen before and after call. When you dial a number, that's it zero network. Always appears not reachable mode for others. SIM is perfect as tried using sim in other phones. It's handset problem.even did factory reset. And trust me no one is helping resolve this issue neither service centre neither the place from I purchased these horrible handsets. Total disappointment. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideally there is no smartphone which doesnt show any issue. Comparatively redmi phones are doing great with very minor issues cropping up. I bought a Redmi Note 3 in july 2016 and have been heavily using it since then for gaming, entertainment, utility purpose. I faced no serious issue as of now, only once did my phone got completely stuck and restarted itself and back to normal. Even using multiple apps simultaneously, i dont see any type of lag or issues compared to some other devices i have seen people using. Its very quick responsive vibrant and awesome. ",
