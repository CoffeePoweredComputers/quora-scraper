            "answer_text": "Hi, You can enjoy unrestricted internet access around the world by either using a VPN or Tor browser. While a VPN is faster, it is not as safe as when compared to the Tor Browser. it encrypts your data with one layer of encryption and relays it across one server before it reaches the desired website. This makes it faster compared to Tor Browser and by connecting to different servers you can unblock most of the websites blocked in your region. Tor Browser, on the other hand, encrypts your data into 3 layers of encryption and then relays your data across 3 different servers chosen randomly worldwide. This makes it really hard for anyone including your own ISP to track your data or trace it back to you. However, all this process makes the Tor browser somewhat slower. But it sure gives you unrestricted internet access around the world without leaving your traces. ",
