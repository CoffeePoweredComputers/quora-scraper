            "answer_text": "The international propagation of coronavirus (COVID-19) dramatically changes consumer behavior. The that atmosphere of fear has either contributed to physical interaction between people being deliberately or unconsciously avoided. In this way, remote online services such as food supply, mobile banking and insurance facilities, including medical and legal assistance, have been promoted. We are now seeing improvements in marketing and delivery approaches introduced by companies to guarantee that electronic purchases are transferred smoothly. This includes aggressive IT system integration, in particular remote customer recognition technologies. The protection of personal information is of the utmost importance here, so it must be assured by distant services needing sensitive information.  One case: the medical consultation; it can only take place remotely now that we are in the midst of the quarantine. And since a patient would actually need to upload his medical history, test reports, and not just ID to provide such a service, it would also require a high degree of identity protection. Ideally, organizations need systems to ensure that not only a user's document can be distanced by identifying whether their image matches the photograph on the document, but also that the identity document is true or false and that attempts to bypass face recognition using lateral technology can be detected and prevented.  And financial organizations have learned from their own bitter experience of weak remote recognition practices for another example of insufficient data protection procedures, resulting in the offers and issuance of online loans to fraudsters who have obtained passport photos on the darknet and loans. Both service providers and customers now understand that authentication by a single factor is clearly not sufficient. We do not even mention relying solely on login and password data. But even the image of an ID document is not enough, as traditionally demonstrated \u2013 high image leakage incidence has marked the unreliable ID authentication when used as a simple step to verify the user's identity. It poses a real threat, since both your personal data and your account are readily unauthorized. It poses a real danger. The only solution to the user check today, which is a combination of ID document and biometrical facial recognition, appears to be multifactor authentication. The procedure will be as follows: when the document fields, including the image \u2013 which most ID documents have, are successfully recognized, the technology checks on indicators of false information. The second important phase of the process of verification has now been taken: facial biometric technologies identify the user's face from their device camera and check that the face matches that of the document picture. Owing to the pervasive existence of falsifications, both document recognition developers and facial recognition systems have expanded their criteria for detecting fraud prejudices. In this sense, it should be remembered that here we are just thinking about active face recognition, in which the user \"presents\" his own face of free will by displaying it to the scan device's camera \u2014 a smartphone or webcam. But face recognition can be passive too, in other words, where the person does not know how recognizable his face is and what it was. There will be passive recognition in the streets and public areas in order to ensure public safety, but it is simultaneously seen as an explicit form of restriction of freedom. Active face recognition and document recognition, on the other hand, are strictly voluntary acts which act as a step towards the practical realization of rights and freedoms due to the strict security requirements of remote identification. For us, it is clear today that any technology should be used exclusively with the individual's permission during the age of rapid growth, and should help to improve and protect people's rights and freedoms \u2013 in particular when it comes to gathering , storing, systematizing and distributing personal data. In addition , a number of identification methods should be developed, and users should choose how to identify them.  In the identification of both documents and faces, we handle extremely sensitive data, which should be carefully protected from the public by all participants. The user must ensure that photographs of his own document or the face of unknown websites do not be posted and contested services are not registered. Organizations are responsible for choosing suitable vendors to implement technological solutions and ensuring security of their own IT systems. The integration of system integrators is necessary to avoid the involvement of unregulated third-party server that stores and transmits sensitive data via insecure channels. In conclusion, the safest approach at present seems to be an IT system in which user identification is carried out independently on the end device without saving and uploading images of documents through third party networks, so as not to allow scammers to steal, sell and use these data illegally for their own purposes. Thus, facial recognition and document recognition processes in remote identification are not the reciprocal replacement for steps; rather, they should be synergistic because the fullest features of both are exposed in combination.

            "answer_text": "\u201cSafe\u201d is a loosely thrown around word. According to tho the blockchain philosophy, do not trust, verify. Hence, we cant be sure about safety of our data and how it is being used unless we can verify that it is indeed safe. This brings us to the point where we need to have enterprise grade technologies that are transparent but also enforce privacy preserving compliant technology. I see Concordium developing something like this. Maybe face recognition business\u2019 can be built on top of such platforms to enforce successful implementation of security practices while providing transparency. Doing this can ensure safe identity verification. ",

Facial recognition is a great way to verify a person\u2019s identity. You just have to send your selfie or a video and identity verification softwares can match the selfie with the ID document picture to verify if the person is who they are claiming to be.
