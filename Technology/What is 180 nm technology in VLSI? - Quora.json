            "answer_text": "First let's understand what is channel length. Channel length is the shortest electrical length of the silicon(or other semiconductor material used) channel which is present between the source and the drain, and is controlled by the Gate terminal in a transistor.  The length of this channel indicates the technology that needs to worked on. For example if engineers say that they work on 180nm, that would mean that the technology they work on have channel length to be 180nm. We also call it as technology node. But this doesn't mean that all the devices used at this node needs to be 180nm. It simply indicates that the shortest electrical path used by a device or maybe a standard cell in this technology is 180nm. We can have larger length as well for other devices. Also the numbers have lost meaning in recent times and after usage of finfets. For example a 45nm node has a gate length of 25nm on a planar transistor. And for finfets a 10nm node of Intel corresponds to 7nm in foundries. Hope this answers the question. Thanks!!! ",
