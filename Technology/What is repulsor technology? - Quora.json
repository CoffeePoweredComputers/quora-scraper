            "answer_text": "While I am sure that jet packs are being designed to propel the user from the ground, I highly doubt that they are currently also being designed for use as weapons. However, in the film, the repulsors assist in flight, but with a little tweaking, the glove repulsor thrusters and the uni-beam projector at the center of his chest are utilized for yet another use: firepower. Tony Stark\u2019s \u2018repulsor technology\u2019 has not been invented yet in real-life, but we do have particle beam weapons, lasers, and \u2018sound bullets\u2019. In real-life there is some technology similar to repulsor rays that are real or even practicable; most, however, are purely science fiction. The repulsor technology (in the film) does not have moving parts, it imparts kinetic force on the target, it charges quickly, there is no visible thermal or chemical damage, they are independent from the rest of the suit, and there is a recoil when they are fired. A particle beam weapon uses an electromagnetic field generator to focus ionized particles into a centralized sphere of heat and energy. Which, with a sudden reverse of current, can be shot out in an energy-ball type form. This kind of weapon works by disrupting electric circuits and electronic devices in its targets. It can also damage or melt its target by the electrical resistance heating of the target. If living tissue, such as humans or animals, were to be caught by the electrical discharge of an electron beam weapon, they would be most likely electrocuted. Most of the weapons in Iron Man are real and practical such as the dual arm-mounted 9mm submachine guns, shoulder-mounted minigun, shoulder deployed bunker buster missile launchers, anti-tank missiles, anti-personnel guns in the shoulders, flare launchers on the hips, multi-fire adhesive grenade launcher on the upper arm, and a one-time-use hand-mounted laser weapon added to the various suits shown in the Iron Man films. They would simply have to be added to the armor itself. Several experimental particle beam weapons were tested at scientific laboratories such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico by both the United States and the USSR from the 1950s to the 1980s. The U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative Organization put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam for strategic defense applications. Work on a weapon such as this is being developed by Sandia National Laboratories (a portion of Lockheed Martin Co.) in Sandia, New Mexico. Work on a $40 Million Ion Beam Facility at Kirtland Air Force Base has begun. It will house six accelerators; and is scheduled for occupancy this year. The quest to design a controlled fusion reaction is currently underway at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF), with scientists reporting that early progress ahead of ignition experiments (which are set to start later this year). The main aim of the world\u2019s largest laser\u2014which is the size of three football fields\u2014is to develop a carbon-free, limitless fusion energy.  The Navy has been testing laser-armed robotic guns for defense against incoming missiles. It has already been used to knock a drone out of the sky. CIWS are generally outfitted with a 20mm Gatling gun, as a ship\u2019s last line of defense against incoming missiles. If they can make the transition to lasers, there are two advantages: first, they do not have to be reloaded; and second, when used on land, there will not be as much shrapnel lying around as they destroy more of the threat than the Gatling guns do. At the California Institute of Technology, a team of researchers, in Pasadena think that they have found a way to make sound waves even more powerful with a new type of acoustic lens. It works by generating \u2018sound bullets\u2019 that shoot through the air much like a traditional bullet. Acoustic lenses are used to focus sound in a similar way that an optical lens focuses light. Instead of using glass and mirrors, they designed a acoustic lens that is made of 21 rows of stainless-steel spheres, with each row having its own 21 spheres. By striking the top portion of the lens (the first sphere in each row), it generates acoustic solitary waves so that the researchers can send a compressive wave to each stack or row. These waves are then transmitted into whatever is on the other side of the lens. Now that you know everything there is to know about the fictional and real-life Iron Man technology, AI, weapons, jet packs, and suits of armor, are you going to learn from these inventors, programmers, and designers and invent/build/design your own. Who knows? You might become the next real Iron Man. Only the future will tell. Real Iron Man \u2013 The Jet Pack While the Iron Man suit; for the most part, defies physics (not to mention minimal development costs that start at a quarter-of-a-million dollars), some of the technology of the Iron Man suit can be achieved or will be in the near-future.  The Martin Aircraft Company in Christchurch, New Zealand have been trying to perfect the jet pack for over a decade. They are going to debut this year for about $150,000 per unit. It is the first commercial jet pack. While it cannot go into the air higher than 3.3 feet or go faster than 6.2 miles per hour, it is still progress in the development of jet packs. While we still do not have a \u2018decent\u2019 jet pack that will have us flying around like Iron Man or the Rocketeer, there are a few that we can look at or even buy. Two more jet packs are coming from Tecnologia Aeroespacial Mexicana and Jetpack International, both jet packs will each give you only about 30 seconds of flight time, with Jetpack International\u2019s model boasting a slight advantage in speed, topping out at 70 mph. For $250,000 and $155,000 you can get these jet packs individually and the flight training necessary. Jetpack International is reportedly working on a new model that will give the user a full 19 minutes of flight time.  Rick Herron, the creator of Skywalker Jets, has designed a rocket pack that weighs 90 pounds and can propel a 200-pound pilot in the air for 5 minutes. Rick has plans to eventually produce a final model that will have a range of about 4 miles and includes a integrated GPS unit into the HUD showing the flight time and engine information as well as other details to assist the pilot during flight. Rick plans to get the device approved by the FAA and available to the public for $200,000, if it goes into production. In the film Iron Man, the repulsors at the bottom of Iron Man\u2019s boots and in his palms are used to propel him through the air. They are powered by the Arc Reactor. In real-life, jet packs work by shooting jets of escaping gases or water downward. The usually use nitrogen, hydrogen peroxide, or kerosene, while some use Turbojet engines. Currently, most electronic portable power sources in real-life cannot produce enough power to lift a person, much-less, a heavy suit of armor off of the ground. This is why gases are mostly used in jet packs for this purpose. To build an Iron Man suit, the builder would have to create or find a way to power the suit, and create enough thrust and propulsion to get himself and the suit off the ground. Currently, the only option for getting a person off of the ground (like in the film) is with jet packs which (at this point in time) use gases. The builder can not use gases in an Iron Man suit because of the limited flight time (barely seconds) due to the small amount of gas the suit can carry with it, and the rapid burning up of the gas inside of it to be of much use to the builder, which leaves the builder with one choice. Electrical power. The power that such a suit would need has not been developed yet due to the lack of massive amounts of energy (without using a large cable attached to it, which limits the suit\u2019s range of flight) that can be transported through flight, which limits the abilities of a real-life Iron Man suit. The \u2018repulsor technology\u2019 is the technology that Tony Stark uses in the Jericho Missile and in the Iron Man suits. The repulsor technology is basically thrust (it means: to repulse, to expel, etc.) The gloves are \u2018flight stabilizers\u2019 which help him to stabilize himself when he uses the Iron Man suit. The repulsor thrusters are also incorporated into the gloves to assist with flight. The boots are used to lift himself and the suit off the ground while using the gloves to hold himself upright. According to the US Government, real jetpacks have very little practical value due to the limitations of current technology. The United States armed forces, which has conducted most of the jet pack research, has declared that helicopters are far more practical due to the ability to quickly transport more supplies and troops. Many others have worked on devising a functional jet pack, but with limited success. Personal jet apparatuses used in the military would be primarily used for use in reconnaissance, crossing rivers, amphibious landing, access to steep mountain slopes, overcoming minefields, tactical maneuverer, etc. One of the largest stumbling blocks that would-be rocket pack builders face is the difficulty of obtaining concentrated hydrogen peroxide, which is no longer produced by many chemical companies. The few companies that still produce high-concentration hydrogen peroxide only sell to large corporations or to governments, forcing amateurs and professionals to make their own hydrogen peroxide distillation installations. To understand jet packs (in real-life) you have to have an idea of how they work and how they are propelled into the air. In hydrogen peroxide powered rocket packs, a hydrogen peroxide-powered motor is based on the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide. Nearly pure hydrogen peroxide is used. Turbojet packs are packs with the turbojet engine that work on the traditional kerosene. They have higher efficiency, greater height, and a duration of flight of many minutes, but they are far more complex in construction and very expensive. Only one working model of this pack was made; it only underwent flight tests in the 1960s and at present, it no longer flies. Rocket packs are used for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in outer space. While near Earth, a jet pack has to produce a g-force of at least 1g. With only small amounts of thrust needed, safety, and temperature are much more manageable than in Earth gravity inside the atmosphere. Winged jet and rocket packs are jet packs that have wings that assist them with gliding through the air. A water-propelled jet pack is a recently conceived concept that has a small unmanned boat with a pump that delivers pressurized water to the jet pack via a hose, so it can only be used over a body of water.
