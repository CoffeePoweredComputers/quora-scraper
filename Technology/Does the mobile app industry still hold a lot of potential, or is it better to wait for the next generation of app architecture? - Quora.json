            "answer_text": "This morning I was reading this article from Business Insider this morning, then logged on to Quora, and saw your question - what a coincidence!  The article outlines why global app revenue is about to explode, and significantly projects that by 2020 revenue will pass 70 billion dollars. China is expected to make up a significant portion of that, but by all accounts there is still a huge amount of potential in the mobile app industry.  The main reason for app market growth:  Emerging markets are catching on, and people are rapidly joining the smartphone market across Africa and Asia (in particular India and China)The downfall however is that the number of people that will benefit is expected to drop - there will be fewer people making more money as the market becomes even more competitive. It is hard to make money from apps - people are often not willing to pay for apps (it has become expected that they are free, and from the beginning app developers  undervalued their products), and to develop a world class app is expensive and time consuming.

            "answer_text": "It is never a good idea to wait because you will end up waiting forever for the next generation. There are always going to be something new coming out every year, but the basic architecture remains the same. It is much better for you to just dive in and make adjustments and improvement along the way.  Plus, making an app is only part of the equation, marketing is another very important  factor. Just look at the millions of apps sitting in the play store or app store with little or no downloads. When you start now, you can learn how to market your apps before the next generation comes, so you have a head start. It is never too late or too early to do something, so start now. ",
