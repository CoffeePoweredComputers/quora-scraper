With technology we can access unlimited resources through internet like millions of ancient texts, videos of various spiritual organizations and Gurus People are connecting through zoom doing yoga, meditation, chanting etc What matters is how we use the technology its up to us, we can use it for destructive things or we can use it for constructive things like learning new things , developing good habits, it entirely depends on us. But we should not become slave of technology become addicted to it. Same whaats up can b used to send good affirmations or spread positive things and can also be used to spread fear or negativity When we are truly centered in our being (spiritual) in every moment of life, then we understand how to use technology intelligently for larger purpose of life ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is just a means to live a better physical and mental life. Spirituality is to discover the source of all that is, and remain in that unmoved. This is the greatest technology, that of knowing your source. With all the technology in future, you may have more and more toys. Yet, there comes a time when you are tired of all the toys, and you want to get back home. Now, Spirituality is the giant momma waiting for you with a knowing smile. ",
