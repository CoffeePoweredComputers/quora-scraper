            "answer_text": "There are a number of effective water treatment methods used for industrial applications. Depending on the industry and processes in question. A brief overview of some of the types of industrial water treatment systems is below: Water Softeners water softeners are used combating hard water used in manufacturing processes, laundering and more. Read more about Water Softeners Dealkalizers Similar to water softeners, dealkalizers reduce the amount of unwanted ions in the water supply. Read more about Dealkalizers Portable Exchange & Automatic Deionizers Deionization uses ion exchange to remove undesired minerals from the water supply. Read more about Portable Exchange & Automatic Deionizers Reverse Osmosis Systems With reverse osmosis, high-pressure forces water backwards through a semipermeable membrane eliminating up to 95% of dissolved solids, such as minerals, particles, and organics.

In terms of Technologies used, most of the times Aerobic treatment technologies like, MBBRSBRASPMBRare used. Depending on the contamination levels, quantum of waste water, reuse proposition, a combination of these technologies are used. ",
