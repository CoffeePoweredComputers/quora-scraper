Possibly upgraded to block 2.A-10s probably retired along with other teen series aircraft like the F-16, if not all upgraded to atleast block 50+.  All F-15s not at C or E standard retired, unless upgraded. F-15s possibly given an MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) might even be upgraded to F-15SE Silent Eagle.  More reliance on drones. M1A2s all given upgrades to M1A2 SEP or TUSK.Alot of manual turrets replaced with remote turret systems for safety. Humvees probably retired if not then religated to low cost logistics and safe zone transport while MRAPs take frontline duty. TOWs upgraded to TOW2 standard and the Airborne launchers replaced with Hellfires or the new Joint Air to Ground Missile.  A-10s retired or given a final upgrade, making them observer aircraft and given new ECM and designating equipment for F-35s to perform CAS or Standoff strikes.Might see the M-4 relegated to National Guard while main forces might receive a new rifle based off the LSAT machine gun.  More widespread use of the Naval Railgun. The Navy seeing an replacement for their Oliver Hazard Perry class and Ticonderoga class CGs ",

            "answer_text": "Almost drone everything. They already testing drone supply vehicles etc. Human controlled planes and other stuff will still exist. But more and more of that equipment will be replaced with pure drone planes or be modified to become robotic, like abrams tanks maybe gaining autoloader and being retrofitted for remote controls. I don't  see terminator style infantry yet as we are still too far away from that technologically. Remote turrets and tracked machine gun platforms, like bomb disposal bots, but made for an anti infantry role is more likely. Infantry will still be human by and large as they are more mobile across difficult terrain. 40 or 50 years later though we will probably see robot everything on the frontlines. With humans relegated to a rear echelon control, maintenance and supply role. With production and technology rates of the drones deciding largely who wins. The generals running the campaigns will probably be machines, but human generals will remain in charge in an oversight role and for approval of plans and objectives. ",
