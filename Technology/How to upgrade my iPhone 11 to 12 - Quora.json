            "answer_text": "If you go to the Apple Store, if it is still accepting customers, you will have to schedule a shopping time and you\u2019ll do the whole process there. If it you an Express pick up Apple Store or if you order online, you\u2019ll pay the full price for the iPhone and then they send you a box to send in your previous device to Apple. After their evaluation is complete, they refund the amount of the trade in value back on your original method of payment. So, if you buy the iPhone 12 for $799, you\u2019ll pay the full $799 and if you\u2019re trading in an iPhone 11 for $350, after they check it out, you\u2019ll get that $350 back and you\u2019d be charged $449 instead (before taxes).

            "answer_text": "It depends on the models. If u have an iPhone 11 pro max and you want to buy just an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 mini u can exchange them easy. But you won\u2019t get the iPhone 12 exchanged with an iPhone 11. U need to have something that is not cheaper than the iPhone 12. ",
