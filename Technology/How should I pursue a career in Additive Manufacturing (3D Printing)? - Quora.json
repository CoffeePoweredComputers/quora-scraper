            "answer_text": "First, I would begin to learn the CAD design process by downloading a package and running through the tutorials.  Many have trial periods in the 30 day range - you should also qualify for a student package.  The specific software package shouldn't matter, but stick with one of the major ones to start: Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks, Pro/Engineer Creo, and Solidedge.  The mental process is essentially the same for all packages, even though the mouse clicking syntax and menu structures are different. After that, I would suggest gaining an understanding of material properties.  This will help you to know the capabilities and limitations of the 3D printed parts.   Finally, a working understanding of traditional manufacturing techniques will allow you to appreciate the flexibility of 3D printing.  Also, in the case that a design does go to metal and is machined, cast, forged, etc. then you will be better able to tweak the design to allow for this manufacture. ",
