            "answer_text": "The question assumes that magic is real. There is, however, no evidence that it is. So, let\u2019s approach the question somewhat mathematically. Technology + Magic = ? Since magic does not exist, or at least the probability that it does is negligibly low, we can set \u201cMagic\u201d in our equation to zero. Technology + Magic = Technology + 0 = Technology So, what do you get if you mix technology and magic? The answer must be: technology. ",

I don\u2019t care about that opinion, let be frank about that. If you carefully study the old texts any technologically inclined mind can see exactly how to get from point a-b with many of the instructions. That aside I have personally done it! The mixing of technology and magick is not only viable but has been a working real life model in many civilizations for thousands of years. ",

If you are looking at making a magic-tech scifi-fantasy world there is a wealth of existing fiction that explores this. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s lots of cool fantasy settings that do this. Most of the time, they are separated somehow - can\u2019t be combined, or one hampers the other. You should totally play the Shadowrun games - in those, the more cybernetics and tech you install in yourself, the less \u2018Essence\u2019/\u2019Soul\u2019 you have - making you less able to use magic. One could argue that real-life technology is getting closer to magic all the time. ",
