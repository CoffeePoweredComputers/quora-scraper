            "answer_text": "If you want to enjoy the best of web TV has to offer, then free-to-use and pay-to-use software aren't the ones to go after. Of course, anything that says FREE sounds good but you get what you don't pay for. If you don't mind investing in a low-cost service to get the best of web TV has to offer, than I suggest going after one or two 3rd party, web-based TV services. Web-based TV is not software; you don't download anything. You get instant access to many popular TV channels/networks to watch live and vod channels. Issues are very minimum, unlike software that sometimes cause a computer to crash. Many times you are required to enter a license/activation key, so there are more steps involved as well as maintenance. Many complaints have mostly been channels don't work, blurry picture, entertainment not good enough, and so on.   I have two web-based TV services that I joined and use today. One service, I purchased a low-cost annual package that direct-connects me to live TV channels, exclusively for live sports. They also include some live TV channels from popular TV networks to watch old/recent movies, news, TV shows, and music video. The entertainment is awesome. Another web-based TV service I paid is low-cost (one-time fee) that gives me a lot more popular TV channels, both live and video-on-demand (sports, movies, news, TV shows/sitcoms/soaps/episodes, radio, music, etc.). This service also gives me a lot of entertainment. With both services, you can literally cut cable and not miss a beat. I watch everything on my Windows PC and large screen TV. The picture quality is crystal clear in many cases. I have a 150 Mbps Internet connection with wire/wireless modem. When adding Netflix and Hulu Plus, I have a robust web TV entertainment system. You should Google... top 10 internet tv software and web-based 2015 ... and review the top 3 services.   ",

            "answer_text": "Just a software won't work because the channels are paid entities and can't be directly viewed. You may find some channels to be available on certain online sites for direct viewing but they too stream it from some third party.  To be able to watch TV on PC, you need to have a TV tuner card connected to the PC. it's available in the market at around 1500 rupees. It comes with a software specific for the tuner. Install and run it while your PC is still connected to the tuner and the cable is connected to the tuner. You'll be able to view TV on PC. ",
