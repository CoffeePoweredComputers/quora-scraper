            "answer_text": "A library is more than a museum for books, it is a chosen place designated for reading, reflecting, and learning. There are all kinds, shapes, and sizes, of libraries only limited by the human imagination. It is a collection of information stored both in print and online. This collection is traditionally safeguarded under lock and key (or password) by a strict rule enforcing librarian! But this is only to ensure it is not so easily damaged. In reality, it is a privilege to have access to information so freely, without discrimination or social status. It is the only time some individuals feel so privileged and free. Why would anyone ever want to get rid of that? This applies to school libraries even more so because children are eager and ready to learn and be inspired. Books still inspire learning. ",
