            "answer_text": "There\u2019s much to imagine. The following is a mix of hope, concern, and speculation. I give several examples below of what already exists, but may scale up over the next two decades. Adaptive/contingent learning; retraining A Marketplace article discussed a company that, in 2007, DARPA partnered with Silicon Valley contractor Acuitus to use AI to model the best tutoring situations with U.S. naval recruits. The screen-based training that they came up with trained IT system administrators made experts in months rather than years. They could keep each student in that optimal zone between frustratingly fast and boringly slow. And when students got stuck, the computer came up with just the minimum hint to figure it out. After 4 or 5 months, new navy recruits were outperforming people who\u2019d been with the navy for 7\u201310 years. This sort of thing might be scalable to different subjects and to all levels of grade school. It could help revitalize rural areas by allowing them to train into technical fields in which they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to get experience. It could address dying towns looking for a new industry, making retraining far more compressed than historically while giving access to lucrative technology jobs. 04/21/2017: Rage against the machines - Marketplace About us \u2014 ACUITUS Marvin Grosswirth and Abbie Salny report in \u201cThe Mensa Genius Quiz Book 2\u201d (1983) of a Mensa member who taught math to 6th-graders. The students were on such a wide spectrum of starting points that she gave each one their own individual weekly plan\u2014a \u201ccontract,\u201d she called them. Students worked on their own, at their own pace. She used much material from elsewhere, and it took a lot of time (this was late \u201870s, early \u201880s), but the self-direction was highly successful. The weak students succeeded, avoiding an oppressive sink-or-swim situation. The top students were doing trig by the time the year was out. This will be at odds with administrators\u2019 impression that group work provides valuable socialization. When admins see the computer-based learning gives them far better results to boast to school boards and parents about, they will yield. I would like to see the programming for such personalized instruction to be able to go backward, if the student\u2019s scores indicate it, and show more visual instruction. For example, a short clip could play to make a point clearer, if it\u2019s discovered the text or drawings were inadequate to make the point clear. The lower the score, the higher the proportion of review is visual. Yes, it\u2019s putting out fires, but good programming should be responsive to a belated discovery of a student\u2019s knowledge being fragile. I do wonder how such instruction could be automated, though. The DARPA-Acuitus collaboration used AI, but that entails using a lot of trials from which the machine can learn. Over a decade later, Acuitus is still training their software with workers who are hired just for a few months, to use the software. I\u2019m not sure how AI did anything for Acuitus that a person couldn\u2019t have done, and I\u2019m not sure, considering their still hiring trainers for their IT product, they\u2019ve really found scalability yet. Rural; retraining Increasing federal support of public-private partnerships between community colleges and businesses will increase the proportion of community colleges geared toward vocational training. Graduation rates at community colleges will go up. Average tuition costs will go down. Retraining will, therefore, becoming less of a dirty word in regions that are losing their mining or manufacturing industry to automation, natural gas, etc.. Young people will lose the mindset that they should be able to do the same work their fathers and grandfathers did as barriers to other opportunities diminish. Also, towns with no traffic lights will get wired to high-speed Internet, allowing remote regions to enjoy the spoils of the tech boom, which has otherwise been geographically concentrated. The One-Traffic-Light Town with Some of the Fastest Internet in the U.S. The Power of Free Community College The Case for Community College Clickbait/Misinformation Clickbait and misinformation may or may not be as much of a problem in 20 years. Maybe the tech giants will figure out a way to fight it by then. People in poor countries (like Veles, Macedonia) will have incentives to undermine the political learning of wealthier democracies. I don\u2019t know if grade-school teachers will sufficiently inoculate students against misleading information by then. I predict people will still be paid handsomely to mislead others in two decades. I suspect that as the U.S. gets more wired, checking facts will become easier for those who are getting their information largely through, say, AM radio. Fact-checking will become more of a habit, leading to a citizenry better inoculated against misinformation campaigns. I suspect much of the success of misinformation campaigns is due to the difficulty of fact-checking. How Teens In The Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News Why Are Conservatives More Susceptible to Believing Lies? High-school math A second track of high-school math will arise: a pre-statistics course like UCLA\u2019s piloted Introduction to Data Science (IDS), followed by a stat class. This will be for those who aren\u2019t going into a STEM field, those who find algebra 2 a pons asinorum. OPINION: Getting every student on the right math pathway Opinion: Modern high school math should be about data science \u2014 not Algebra 2 Language requirements As technology encroaches on translation, the meaning of studying foreign language in high school will fade. This will be at odds with the world\u2019s increasing globalization. Chinese will be offered in more high schools, but also some schools may recognize those more inclined toward math and technical sciences will be given a pass on the language requirement if they learn computer languages. The importance of seeing three types of programming languages at an early age (before college?) will be appreciated more, leading school administrators to consider the switch. Wired advises against it, reasoning that coding is a skill, not a language, but speaking a foreign language is a skill too, so I\u2019m not sure I follow their distinction. Seriously, Stop Trying to Teach Toddlers How to Code Labs The distinction between data collection and lab design will be appreciated more and class time will place more emphasis on the latter, in an effort to promote abstract thought and design ability. This would be a logical extension of the design emphasis of the STEM initiative. How We Learned to Love the Pedagogical Vapor of STEM Teacher loan forgiveness Teachers currently take on up to $40k in debt to earn a master\u2019s in education as a requirement to get certified. They can get the remainder of their debt erased by working for five years in a high-need school. The trend is that a teacher starts at a rough school and then graduates to a school that meets higher academic standards, after the teacher has worked out some kinks in their approach. So students in underprivileged schools get the new teachers while other schools get the seasoned teachers. I was told by an ed professor that 90% of the openings in NYC were in the Bronx, because of the high turnover rate there. But what if this were reversed? Suppose a teacher had to teach for five years before entering a loan forgiveness program, and had to work in a high-needs environment for several years after getting five years of experience elsewhere to get that waiver? Other countries send their better teachers where the problems are. Maybe the U.S. could try that too. Such an approach would be more of a Finnish approach than a sink-or-swim Bloomberg/Joel Klein approach. If a school needs more resources, give them more resources. It\u2019s also a more Finnish approach in that the level of professionalism of the teacher in the needier schools would be higher. I often wished that I\u2019d known what I know now when heading into the urban school I started out in, so that I could import what was figured out at better schools. Lessons of nope: Joel Klein fails to educate us on how to fix our schools 10 reasons why Finland's education system is the best Civics The U.S. may return to emphasizing civics. Only about a third of Americans can name all three co-equal branches of the federal government. I think both sides of the political divide see a need for increased understanding of how the U.S. government works. Computer science over coding Over time, schools may emphasize computer science over coding. The former is a broader subject, but it\u2019s, of course, hard to get someone conversant in it to take a teacher\u2019s salary. How this shifts may depend a great deal on the good folks at The College Board, including whether Java continues to be the preferred language in schools. As for IB\u2019s CS curriculum, it\u2019s really up to the teacher to make it meaningful and worthwhile. As IB spreads, maybe it will update itself. Since several IB textbooks are written by high-school teachers, I doubt they\u2019ll find the resources to align it with student needs for college prep. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great question. It is essentially a Rorschach test because each person who reads it is likely to be looking for an answer about a different part of our education system. So, I will attempt to answer from several angles. First, I am sad to say that I am not particularly optimistic about the future of the American education system overall. It continues to face huge, complex, systemic and structural challenges that have been in place for many decades, and show no signs of changing willingly. Why? Two big related reasons are poverty and how we fund our schools. Children who are hungry, sick, tired, or otherwise encumbered by the terrible burden of being poor are at a massive disadvantage in life. They often show up to school at age five or six far behind their peers in terms of basic vocabulary, affinity for reading, and generally being ready to learn. Too many of them come from homes where there is no quiet/safe place to do homework and relatively few adults able to help with homework after school. Many lack basic health care and/or have to deal with trauma, noise, and the lack of a place where they can feel safe and secure curling up to read a book and get lost in their thoughts. Many poor children lack parents who are ready, willing, and able to be highly engaged in their children\u2019s education because they are working multiple jobs. These problems are exacerbated by the way that we fund our schools. As you probably know, there is no federal right to education. The federal government provides some education funding to states and districts but the stats that I have seen are that the federal component of education is generally below 10%. It is the states and their smaller political entities (such as counties) that are responsible for funding and delivering education. (Interestingly, more than 180 other countries include a right to education in their constitutions. Interesting article: The Students Suing for a Constitutional Right to Education (https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/lawsuit-constitutional-right-education/576901/).) In the U.S., those who can afford to select their own school districts often do exactly that., and understandably so. Such parents move to neighborhoods with \u201cgood schools\u201d because they love their children and they want the best for those children. And an unfortunate side effect of people \u201cvoting with their feet\u201d is that those who are left behind in failing districts usually have no recourse because they cannot afford to move to wealthier locales themselves. This often leads to a downward-spiral. I see no sign that it is going to change anytime soon, in large part because the people who have the most power, money, and political capital \u2026 are the ones who move to better districts and then work to further improve their new districts. I should also mention that there is often a strong racial component to the entire situation that makes it all more difficult for those children left behind in struggling districts. In short, many parents have what we call \u201cschool choice\u201d in that they can afford to move their households. But many parents do not, and I do not see evidence that this situation is likely to change in the next twenty years. As a result, my expectation is that \u2014 absent an unexpected change in the wider political environment \u2014 we will see in 20 years that the disparity we are seeing today is likely to grow. My second answer to the original question is that I expect that as technology continues to mature, we will find more and better ways to use it to support great teaching and learning. Tools such as augment reality, virtual reality, 3d printing, and instruction that contains embedded formative assessment all offer promising ways to engage students in more interesting and effective lessons. But I expect the impact of that technology to be highly uneven, because of the reasons above, as well as the fragmentation problem, that I will answer elsewhere today. ",

However, what we can predict with some confidence are the following: Perhaps a tripling in the number of international schools (globally) from approx. 10,000 to 30,000, likewise increase in private, fee-paying, educational provision, globally, but especially in Africa.Critical shortage of teachers in most countries. e.g. the predicted 30,000 international schools, alone, will require an extra 2 million English-speaking teachers and right now no one has much idea where they\u2019ll be coming from, though likely from state education systems around the world.Continued deterioration in state education provision in most countries.Those regions/countries which will very likely see continued quality or even improvement in their state education systems are Scandinavia, some Western European countries (not UK), Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan, Canada, South Korea, and select major cities on the Chinese Eastern seaboard.A growing quality gap between private, for-profit, education and state education. This gap is already massive in many countries - it will just get wider.Some countries (governments) will give up on trying to educate their children to become global-minded (e.g. Westernised) and instead retreat to stricter religious educational provision, mostly Islamic. Examples are Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Middle Eastern countries. This can be stopped but only if parents take action and demand it. Similarly, the Chinese government will introduce stricter controls over state education and even perhaps introduce barriers to Chinese children studying abroad.As for the remainder, we can see that current (and emerging) trends are very likely to take root in an increasing number of enlightened schools: differentiation, student-centred learning, inclusivity, mindfulness education, critical thinking, creative thinking, and a corresponding reduction in standardized testing, teaching to tests, and a curricula designed for work (of which there will be much less all round).",

            "answer_text": "Watch for rising popularity of enormous classes with interactive AV lectures having very high production values. Courses will be interactive and tailored to individual learning needs and speed. For example, 100,000 students per year with a lecture that remains current for 3 - 5 years. Ten dollars from every student would provide a budget of several million dollars. That could allow a substantial team of professionals - subject matter experts, educationists, IT, AV, marketing, and so on, for the production of the lecture materials for a one-semester course. However, one hour of one-one one tutoring, assessment, and feedback would cost about $50 per student. Hence, watch for developments in the use of AI to take over or assist assessment and feedback. Allowing $10 for lectures and $50 for individual attention pouts the cost of a one-semester course at $60. This would put the cost of an online course of study (say for a Bachelor of Science) at less than $2000 per student (assuming 100,000 per year for 3\u20135 years). With a \u201creasonable\u201d markup a three-year BSc could be offered at a price of, say, $10,000. This is not enough for the funding of research. That would need to be addressed separately, by government and industry. The final step is accreditation and recognition. If such a massive online course were accredited, and also recognised by employers, it could be a template for the universal democratisation of tertiary education. Imagine graduating with a student debt of $10,000. Not too hard to pay off. So just about ANY secondary student with outstanding ability and an accommodating family could afford a University degree independently of the economic strength of their national economy. Education for the masses would need to be broader. The standard fields of study are focussed narrowly on academic pursuits. There are not enough jobs for all the students who would be enabled to get a degree. There will be opportunities for many many more vocational courses. Negative note: because of the economies of scale, tertiary education would remain mainly in the hands of big-education. However there would be opportunities for entrepreneurial teams to pick up a small but significant percentage of the market. ",

            "answer_text": "First ask yourself how the current day schools changed from those in the past. You will find the answer varies depending not only where the schools were located you look at the past. Education tends to go through cycles. Sometimes in the past education has been provided for all the community, and at other times restricted to those who could pay or could pass the entrance exams. At times curriculum was based heavily on memorization, and other times the curriculum swung the other direction towards making products or a theoretical base. In twenty years the U.S. Schools will become less inclusive. Those who are not academically inclined will be pushed to specific job training tracts, or perhaps only given the opportunities based on test scores. Perhaps parents will pay if schools adopt same profit driven motivations as we see in business. I would not be surprised to see businesses taking charge of some classes to determine the \u201chigh potential\u201d students. However one prediction that you see a lot, a completely computerized education system will not occur. After more than 50% of class time is spent on computers, learning seems to decline. So there will still be teachers and classrooms, although most homework will be done on computers, not on paper. ",

When the reality is school children require basic skills: reading and writing and maybe memory development . Beyond that higher education requires the ability to analyze problems. One must consider the cost and benefits for a population that all have learned algebra, geometry and European history, Shakespeare\u2026. Boatloads of stuff available on the net. The problem begs the question about the value of civics, morals, geography, current events. Teach kids the basic stuff and then let them develop their own strengths at their own pace with people of all ages who also want to develop the same knowledge base. Let them help each other to learn in their respective disciplines using professionals from the outside. Mandate educational civil service for all . Progress towards a degree needs to be measured by those who are responsible masters. Beyond that, everything we choose to study, beyond the mandated basics, is then a reflection on ourselves and ability to navigate our capitalist system. ",

You can already see in America that high school graduates cannot do basic math, and don't have proper grammar, and don't know the correct words or spelling of words. Just an example, they use your instead of you're, and so many others its pitiful. They have no idea about American or world history either. It seems people who have graduated after 1990 aren't given a well rounded education anymore, but are being taught a liberal agenda and things like how to get along with others, and other nonsense, that if you actually get a well rounded education, you automatically get along with others. In Europe, (not the UK) they get a much better education than the states, and it seems that even in the Philippines, they're getting a better education too. So, the answer to the question depends on which country you are getting the education in. ",
