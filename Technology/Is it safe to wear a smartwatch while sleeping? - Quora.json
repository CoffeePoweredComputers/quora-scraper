            "answer_text": "Most Smartwatches do not use WiFi, which is switched ON most of the time, like in smartphones. Better Smartwatches only use its Bluetooth transmitter when its BT receiver is probed by the App on the paired Smartphone. Smartwatches with Sim Card trsnsmit and receive 3 or 4G/ LTE microwave, so, in my honest opinion, THAT kind should not be worn at night. Otherwise, I see no problem. Additionally, most color screen smartwatches need daily or weekly charging anyway, so chances of you sleeping with this type is uncommon.   the above is a Fossil Q Jacqueline Hybrid Smartwatch that I bought as a gift for my own daughter. See the coin release for the battery? I only buy Smartwatches that employ A USER-REPLACEABLE, Li-ion Battery like the CR2430 in a Fossil Gen.2, OR a Withings Move ECG, and there is no charging at all, as the batteries last between 6 months and a YEAR! Now THAT is a SMART design for any watch. NO RECHARGING required! ",
