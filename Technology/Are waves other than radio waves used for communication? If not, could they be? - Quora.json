            "answer_text": "Radio waves are one type of electromagnetic waves, with a particular range of wavelengths. Other electromagnetic waves such as light, can also be used. Now let\u2019s consider whether non-electromagnetic waves are usable. Sound waves (waves transmitted by vibrating molecules) are clearly useful in some cases. Water waves could be used, but are not very good for large amounts of information. Electromagnetic waves are a manifestation of the electromagnetic force, one of the fundamental forces of nature. Could the other forces be used? The strong force only acts over a small distance, compared to the electromagnetic force, which has an infinite range. Gravity waves have been discovered, and these have an infinite range also, but they are extremely difficult to generate and detect, so they are not so suitable. The weak force is now know to be closely connected to the electromagnetic force. Could we use that? The electromagnetic force can be considered to be carried by photons, and the weak force by W and Z particles, but all these particles are \u201cmixtures\u201d, that is they exist on a continuum of electroweak force carriers. The photon is one of an infinity of possible mixtures, but it stands out because of a property unique to it, which is that it is the only point on this continuum that is not affected by the Higgs field. So the photon is the only massless particle of this range. That means that waves transmitted by the other particles such as the Z do not have the infinite range of the electromagnetic field. That\u2019s why we called them carriers of the \u201cweak force\u201d. Actually the force is not weaker, it just seems weak because it is short ranged. Anyway, the weak force is not so useful for communications and you should resign yourself to using the electromagnetic field for communications. ",
