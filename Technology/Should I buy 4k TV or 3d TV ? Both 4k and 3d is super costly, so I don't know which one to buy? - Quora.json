            "answer_text": "First of all, 3D was simply an easily defeatable feature of some higher-end sets from 2010 to about 2016, it did not mean that these sets consistently showed a 3D picture. 4K, on the other hand, refers to the set\u2019s resolution (3840x2180). Second of all, at this writing (2019), no TV manufacturer is offering any sets with the 3D feature. If you have any 3D Blu-ray discs, you\u2019ll have to look for used sets or a 3D-capable projector to watch the discs properly. While there isn\u2019t a lot of 4K software out there yet \u2014 beyond Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, there\u2019s just a handful of streaming services offering 4K programming \u2014 a 4K set is still a prudent investment. If you want to buy a 55\u2033 or larger set, 4K is your only option these days, and you\u2019ll be well positioned to receive 4K programming when it does come on line. ",
