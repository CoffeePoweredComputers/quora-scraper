            "answer_text": "It is impossible to stop climate change. What we can do is slow it down significantly. Perhaps in the future, we\u2019ll determine a way to begin reversing the temperature increase and decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Every little thing helps, such as reducing or eliminating the amount of plastic you use, recycling if you can, volunteering to reforest or clean up a lake, etc. The best thing you can do is join or start a group with at least one person well versed in climate change and get the information out to the public. While it is getting more press these days, it still isn\u2019t obvious to a large number of people that we are responsible for most of it. At this point, climate change is speeding up due to nations increasing their fossil fuel consumption and production, rather than lowering it as agreed to. Unless we can get our leaders to take climate change seriously, there isn\u2019t a lot the private people can do. Most companies like solar installers or makers and wind turbine builders and installers are needed. Substitutes for plastic are sorely needed, since our entire infrastructure depends on it. Plastic comes from oil. That includes this like PVC piping. We use plastic everywhere; hospital equipment, for instance. We absolutely must get to net zero carbon yesterday. Contrary to what everyone is told, we don\u2019t have until 2030 or 2050 to stop polluting the atmosphere, the ocean, drinking water and the land. If we don\u2019t immediately start major changes, we will not stop the rapidly increasing temperatures, storms, fire, etc. There are things we can do at the same time, in the hope that we can get the Federal government to stop subsidizing oil and gas and begin fining those industries instead. Planting trees and ground cover are one way. Getting state and local government to stop building new houses is another, as is preserving more land. The ocean can only hold so much carbon before it too, starts dying. There are many other, opportunities, too numerous to describe here. My master\u2019s thesis is focused on reversing desertification, which is similar to reforesting, but it instead returning land that has been turned into man made desert into healthy land. It is a much slower and more difficult process than simply reforesting, but reducing the deserts also helps decrease temperatures. I hope to do that professionally once I finish. Do what you can, but most of all, push your governmental bodies to make changes to save water, trees, and land. Put back marshes. Learn more and teach more. Okay, I\u2019ll stop there. I know it\u2019s a little long, but hopefully it will give you some ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "As of right now, I don\u2019t believe it is possible to stop climate change doing serious harm. Even if the entire world unanimously agreed to take immediate action it would still take years to get the infrastructure in place to stop burning fossil fuels for energy. It would take decades to bring the tech needed to replace the internal combustion engine. If we\u2019d started when the warnings were ramping up 20\u201330 years ago we\u2019d already be 3/4 of the way there now. The other huge problem which often goes overlooked is that even if by some miracle we turned off every source of human carbon production today it will still take decades for the residual carbon to start to dissipate. For some years to come the atmospheric carbon parts per million (ppm) will continue to rise before they finally level off. Depending how high this leveling off occurs will dictate whether we are past the tipping point or not. Another issue is that no-one knows what the tipping point is. For all we know, and it is highly likely, the tipping point was crossed a long time ago. This means that we are at the mercy of natural cycles to find their balance. This may or may not be at a point conducive to human habitation as we now know it. So, quick fixes. No new power stations which utilize fossil fuels. Switch to renewable energy solution especially on a small scale like homes, small businesses, villages. This can all be done reasonably quickly. New battery storage can make houses completely self-sufficient. Solar, wind and hydro can be used all over the world and scale will have to vary depending on the local needs. Demand will need to change so businesses don\u2019t run neon 24/7 and any unnecessary lighting has to be shut off when not needed. The toughest thing to fix will be transport. Heavy transport is years off shifting to renewable sources although more environmentally friendly gas could be quickly moved into production. Lanes of traffic would have to be closed to allow the use of bicycles particularly for trips under 10km. We are so used to being lazy and hopping in the car we have forgotten that is actually isn\u2019t that hard to cycle. Not only would it be great for the environment it would have a massive impact on obesity in the western world where even a 1km trip to the shop for milk is now done by car. If you can change attitudes and habits you could make giant leaps in carbon reduction, improve human health and get people to see a simpler, cheaper way to live and go about your daily tasks. Sorry. I\u2019m trying to keep this brief so I\u2019m just touching on a lot of key issues quickly and not fully exploring them for you. Many Australian outback towns are shifting to wind and solar because the cost of grid power has increase exponentially since privatization of the network. In 3rd world countries looking for village and small town power small scale wind and solar would be a much more feasible alternative to using fossil fuels and can be located locally negating the need for wide spread electrical networks. There are many ways we can make a rapid impact but first you need to people prepared to make the changes and the political will to implement the changes which, unfortunately, you aren\u2019t going to get with our current money hungry crop of political figures world wide.

            "answer_text": "R&D. The tools that currently exist to reduce GHG emissions are either too small or too expensive. Several of those are mentioned in other answers here. Because carbon dioxide is so stable in the atmosphere, the only long term answer is to reduce net additions to near zero. This is impractical with current technology. Take solar as an example. One answer below says solar is as cheap as fossil fuels. This is a common misunderstanding. In a sunny location, when solar is a very small contributor, the levelized cost of solar power may be very competitive with natural gas. As solar becomes a more significant source, that changes, because of solar\u2019s intermittency. No sunshine, no power, nighttime being the simplest illustration. All of the conventional power capacity is still needed to carry the entire load between sunset and sunrise. (Wind? It might not be blowing that night.) That means overcapacity. The system has all of the conventional capacity it needs to meet the demand, then solar is added. Overcapacity = excess capital cost = rising utility charges. Germany and Denmark have demonstrated this effect to a very painful degree, and their solar and wind contributions to total electrical output are still below 30%. This technology is just unready to perform the role in which so many have cast it. Or planting trees. It works exactly as described, sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. If the wood becomes houses, the carbon will stay sequestered for many decades. Beautiful, but the scale is all wrong. While fossil fuels are burned at the current rate, offsetting the carbon emissions by planting trees would take most of the arable land of the world. These are examples of trying to do a job without having adequate tools. The existing technology cannot sharply limit net emissions except at prohibitive expense (with one possible exception noted below). New technology can change that. For example, low cost grid scale storage would allow pv farms to produce and store excess power during the day for use at night. But lithium ion batteries are not low cost and never will be. Research into viable technologies is ongoing, but a commercial solution will require decades (as with almost all important technologies\u2014think about vaccines, cars, airplanes, semiconductors, computing, television, etc.\u2014none of these appeared overnight). Or trees. Enhanced photosynthesis and other genetic modifications may greatly accelerate growth and reduce the land needed. Again, decades away. These are good ideas, they will just take time. Subsidizing and mandating \u201csolutions\u201d is putting the cart before the horse. The priority should be inventing the solutions that won\u2019t need the subsidies and the mandates. Billions of dollars of R&D now will save hundreds of billions in subsidies and excess costs later. A possible exception would be GenIV nuclear power. This may be ready for primetime if implemented in a systematic, modular manner. Many answers by Vincent Maldia on this site provide excellent information. However, this possibility will not be explored in America, where the regulatory environment and public opinion are far too toxic to permit an economical and speedy roll-out. China may be in the process of testing this approach\u2014an advantage of an autocratic government that need not follow rules of law or respect public opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Every little bit does count - you can help make a difference, you can BE that difference. Conserve natural resources; public transport, car pooling, or bicycle; don\u2019t leave water running when you\u2019re not using it - if you have to let it get warm, run it into a bucket ands use the water to water plants; turn out light when you\u2019re not in the room or use a motion sensors in your rooms. Keep quart glass bottles full of water on the bottom shelf of your fridge to help hold the temperature down for longer periods. Use a lamp on your desk for reading with a 75v watt bulb instead of a 100 or larger in the ceiling fixture. Remove shoes ate the door to combat tracking dirt, bugs, contaminants inside and eo eliminate the need for frequent vacuuming. Dress warmer in winter so you can turn down the thermostat. Use a fan and screened open windows in summer instead of an air conditioner - maybe a swamp cooler unit in the southern states; and heavy light coloured fabric curtains to keep mid day heat out], leave windows open all night where you can in summer, shut them in the morning to hold coolness in. Be creative. One of the best tings I heard years ago was: Tern off your lights and hear a thousand rivers whisper their thanks: fewer or no hydro-electric dams are much better. Install solar power units for electricity in areas that get a large amount of sun-filled daylight hours. In applicable areas, put out a small wind -powered generator for electricity. Collect rainwater from roof runoff for domestic use in those areas where that would make a difference. Save grey-water from dishwashing and bathing for watering gardens and houseplants. RECYCLE: donate and buy clothes at Goodwill, Salvation Army, hospital thrift shops. Don\u2019t buy anything prepackaged, especially in plastic; make your own or buy in bulk and freeze, bag, or jar individually. Use organic foods and/or those that use only non-toxic pest control, or raise veggies in your garden using natural methods such as marigolds to hold down certain pests, plant veggies near tall plants if they require shade at certain times; read an issue of Mother Earth News and other such publications for reference.

            "answer_text": "The current direction of climate change is toward an increase in the total thermal energy content of the oceans, continents, and atmosphere. RE: \u201cHow can we slow climate change?\u201d The ongoing processes that cause natural climate change are slow. They are things like the movement of tectonic plates, the variations in the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, and biologic changes to the chemistry of the atmosphere. The biologic changes include the gradual conversion almost all of the original carbon dioxide to free oxygen (O2) molecules, oxide minerals, and hydrocarbons over billions of years. Saying that our current concern about climate change is about these exceedingly slow processes is a diversion from the serious problem of the rapid changes occurring now.  The current measured concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is much higher than it has been for 800,000 years. The consequences of continuing this rate of increase are debatable but it is foolish to expect them all to be harmless. So, the answer to your question is reducing the rate of increase of CO2 in the atmosphere (and oceans). To figure out how to do that, we need to know where the increase is coming from. We know that it is from the oxidizing of fossil fuels because the amount of carbon 14 in the fossil fuels is zero and the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in the atmosphere has gone down. More specifically, the answer to your question is reducing the amount of fossil fuels that are oxidized and released to the atmosphere. There are many ways to do this. Choosing which of these methods to put into practice should be based on the basis of the largest amount of carbon emission reductions for the money - which is not necessarily the same as the ones that get the most government subsidies and mandates. There is only one currently available energy sources that can replace fossil fuels on a scale large enough to significantly slow global warming - fission nuclear power plants. If we had continued to build fission nuclear power plants at the rate we did in the early 1970\u2019s, global warming would not even be a problem today. ",

            "answer_text": "First, realise that it isn\u2019t all about climate change. Climate change is one of a number of crucial issues that we face globally, others including resource shortages (e.g. habitable land, fresh water, energy)\u00b7biodiversity in nature (which has to be catastrophic eventually if we cannot stop destroying the natural environment)economic inequality (both locally and internationally) causing unrest and conflict that undermines attempts to do get on with anything else and causes endless hardshipfighting over political and religious beliefs and practicesAll these problems are interacting, and I don\u2019t think any one can be addressed effectively in isolation. If our civilization is going to be brought down, it won\u2019t be climate change itself that does it. It will be the way we react to climate change alongside all these other issues. A particular misunderstanding is that the CO2 issue is that it is not about how much CO2 we pump into the atmosphere. It is about how much carbon we release into the environment as a whole. We can pump as much CO2 as we like, so long as the carbon involved comes from elsewhere in the biological environment. The \u2018killer\u2019 is where we take carbon stored in long term (mostly geological) reservoirs (such as coal, oil and gas) and put it into the environment. Also includes things like methane trapped long-term in frozen tundra, and in deposits in river deltas. Emitting CO2 by burning fossil fuels is just an easy way of getting carbon from geological reservoirs into the environment. So, here are my personal suggestions to answer the OP. Reduce personal CO2 footprint Don\u2019t have lots of children! The heaviest cost in energy there is! The lifetime energy and carbon costs of a person and their children dwarf anything else we do during our lives! Overpopulation seems to be at the root of most if not all of our serious global problems of which climate change is just one. I know this isn\u2019t politically correct to say, but that doesn\u2019t stop it being a fact! I also know there will be demographic problems with aging populations for quite a while. I think simply have to find a way of managing this.Reduce home energy usage as much as possible (e.g. low-energy LED light bulbs, minimize use of air con and house heating)Drive as economically as possible (don\u2019t go like a bat out of hell, choose a speed for economy, not excitement or pruning a few % off the journey time) \u2013 much less stressful doing this too! Don\u2019t drive at all if you don\u2019t have to!Don\u2019t buy new things \u2018just because\u2019. Manufacturing \u2018stuff\u2019 is generally expensive in both energy and carbon. If something can be fixed economically rather than thrown out \u2013 fix it and keep using it. Especially cars! If you must throw something out, don\u2019t, look for a way in which it can be re-used by someone else, or recycled into something else. And if you don\u2019t actually need it, don\u2019t buy it.Engage with others in reasoned debate Try to understand the basic mechanisms involved in global warming and the role of carbon (not just CO2 in the atmosphere). Also how scientific enquiry and research works, the kinds of things that are done to analyse data and sift out meaningful evidence from distractions.Discuss with others on social media, places like Quora, sharing what you know and learning from others, disregarding rhetoric and hype from all sidesSupport (use your vote, get involved, lobby) political movements and parties which strive actively to move towards sustainable economies which don\u2019t rely on constant growth to work. Our economies currently reward doing things with less human effort, more shareholder return and doesn\u2019t care about resource usage so long as it is cheap. The balance needs to shift to reward doing things with less resources as a priority! I\u2019m not an economist so I\u2019ve no idea how to do this, but I think it is essential. No matter what happens, I think there is going to be an economic upheaval sooner or later, so this might not be quite as impossible as it sounds! It also doesn\u2019t automatically have to mean \u2018more human effort\u2019. But it does have to provide a means of dignified living for all, regardless of their circumstances.push hard to stop exploration for new fossil fuel resources of any kindput in place policies to stop using fossil fuels of all kinds as fast as possible, prioritizing coal. Accepting that it takes time to achieve, but aggressively pushing plans forward. Do whatever it takes regarding energy conservation, transport infrastructure and deployment of renewable and nuclear power sources to make this happen.support developing countries as much and as fast as possible to find ways for them to develop their economies and prosperity in a sustainable way without following the same route as we did (relying heavily on fossil fuels) \u2013 especially including education, medical provision and family planning. One of the benefits is the crucial need for birthrates to drop. Evidence suggests that this happens naturally as prosperity, medical provision and education improve.push forward international cooperation so all this happens on a global scale, or at least, the \u2018main players\u2019 of the globe with active buy-in from the rest. Otherwise it\u2019s a waste of time because political squabbling and conflict will undermine all attempts to achieve anything.but do all this while still ensuring that people are personally rewarded in some real way according to their efforts and achievements while nobody starves \u2013 this isn\u2019t a hard-left agenda! I don\u2019t think the \u2018left\u2019 agenda works any better than the \u2018right\u2019. We need a new approach, somehow, that won\u2019t fit into the old pigeonholes.Not a clue how all this is to be done but unless we make some significant progress in these kinds of directions, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get on top of our problems before they become unmanageable. I could add more, but this answer is already quite long enough! ",

            "answer_text": "Understand that there are a number of reasons for reducing our use of fossil fuels. Climate change is controversial - the others are much less so. The Earth has only finite resources - including oil, natural gas, and coal. At some point these will run out. Yes - we almost certainly have greater reserves than we think - but the Earth is a finite size and even if it\u2019s made 100% of fossil fuels (which, of course, is not the case) there will come the day when the last bit is gone. So even if you believe that CO2 has nothing to do with global warming, one would hope that you agree we should be able to continue making energy as long as we have a civilization on Earth. Which means either finding a source of hydrocarbons \u201cout there\u201d somewhere, or finding alternatives to burning things for power.Hydrocarbons are complex and valuable molecules that we use for a number of purposes that include plastics, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and more. Does it make sense to burn them, making them unavailable for any other use? And - yes - I know that we can make much of this without hydrocarbons. But these alternate methods tend to require more energy and they can be less efficient.Increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere lead to increasing CO2 concentrations in oceans and lakes. This makes life difficult for the organisms that can only exist in a relatively narrow pH range - such as a lot of the critters that make up the base of the food chain. And - yes - I know that CO2 levels (and oceanic pH) have been far higher (and lower) at times in the past - but the changes took place gradually enough that animals and plants could adapt. That is not the case now.And now one style point. Burning things for energy is so\u2026Ice Age\u2026of us. It ought to be kind of embarrassing that, in over 200,000 years, we\u2019re still burning things to keep warm.It doesn\u2019t matter if climate change is real or not - none of these arguments has anything to do with climate change. If it\u2019s not real - we still need to transition to a source of energy that won\u2019t run out in a century or less, we still have better uses for the chemicals than burning them, and we are still acidifying the oceans. And if it is real - we\u2019ll be helping to combat it as well. So - understand that there are very real reasons that have nothing to do with climate change, that call for us to take the very actions that will help to combat it if it is real. ",

            "answer_text": "Climate change is due mostly to the release of greenhouse gases which in turn are due to us humans: burning fossil fuels for energy, large farming operations, pollution in oceans killing plankton that absorb Co2, clearing forests that also absorb CO2, etc, etc. So the best way to mitigate climate change is to mitigate the release of GHGs. So there are PLENTY of viable options to mitigate these changes. The easiest, fastest and least expensive (in my opinion are): Plant trees. Trees absorb CO2 in vast amounts. They can also be raised to provide fuel for electricity generation and converted to energy via gasification (vs incineration) which retains most of the carbon as a solid vs emitting it as CO2. The harvesting can be done once the trees are mature, at which time their annual CO2 absorption levels off and before they die and decompose (which would release much of the stored carbon as CO2 and CH4) \u2026 or before the forests are lost to fire, which also would release all the stored carbon at once. A recent study calculated that planting a trillion trees around the world would stall the buildup of GHGs, at least temporarily.Plant fuel crops for anaerobic digestion. AD creates natural gas from plant matter using bacteria. The gas can be used to generate heat and electricity and the carbon (similar to above) is left behind as a solid. The same AD can be used to convert animal waste and septic waste to energy, both of which contribute large amounts of methane to the air. Methane is a more potent GHG than CO2!Convert Municipal Solid Waste into energy. Food can be converted via AD and plastics, wood, textiles, paper, cardboard, etc can be converted using gasification. This would save an equivalent amount of fossil fuels being used. In the case of food waste, AD can be done fairly inexpensively at home. The gas won't likely be enough to run a generator, but could easily be used to augment the heat in your water tank or forced air furnace.Add solar panels (PV) everywhere practical. The cost of solar energy has gotten very low. It's almost as practical to use solar (at least during daylight hours) as it is to use fossil fuels. In many places it is actually more cost-efficient to do so.Use solar heat to heat our homes and water. Vacuum tubes are quite efficient and can raise the temperature of water by 10 to 20 degrees quite easily, if not all the way to 120F. It uses less energy to raise the water temperature from 70F than it does from 50F.Use ground source heat pumps to heat and cool. Again, even if they are not used to do the entire job, just adjusting heat (or cooling) levels by even 5F degrees using \u201cfree\u201d energy in the ground can have a significant effect on the use of other costly energy sources.",

Once the polar ice begins to melt it can not be stopped. The polar ice is and has turned to black ice and black ice is dead ice which accelerates the melting because black absorbs heat where normal white ice used to reflect heat. Any ice that is remaining today is black ice. Absolutely no hope for recovery there and any news reports of \u201csurface ice\u201d growing is propaganda exaggerated to give the public a false sense of stability. The fake surface ice expansion/growth is from geoengineering in the arctic. Ice 911 dot org is the confession of this. There is also weather modification dot com to awaken you. The ice 911 web site is arrogance that man can or is fixing the situation with micro and nano particles of glass like silica put in to the arctic ocean to mimic surface ice. Ice nucleating chemicals that have created a slushy surface \u201cextent\u201d that news reports as growth. Its all pretty out of control and that's why there are so many trolls in quora answering your questions saying all is well, there are no worries, its just weather, the ice is growing, the ozone is healing, and man has nothing to do with any of it! Complete insanity obviously from leaders who know we are f'd and are in behind the scenes crisis mode for resources and power. Now with that being said, where are all these \u201cmicro\u201d plastics in our oceans coming from?!!! Hmmm, think there's a connection to the geoengineering I just told you of? Seems suspiciously related to me. Does anyone realize how long it would take a plastic bottle to break down to become a micro plastic found in our waters or our marine life's stomach? Its not possible so must be coming from another source. I just connect the dots. You decide. But as far as recovery goes, or stopping the heating of our planet, there are many causes in play today and too many now to blame just one. Making it all the more impossible to correct or stop. Especially due to the fact that any recovery efforts must begin with the first step of admitting there is a problem. Any recovery institution will confirm this, yet we in this world have not even been able to do that yet!! So how in the hell can there be a recovery to be had when lunatic leaders and half the population still don't believe there is a problem and continue to destroy the environment pushing the planetary heating in to over drive?!! Sorry but the truth is bad and ugly. Stop supporting the lunatics if you really want to help. Get your spiritual house in order too. ",

One easy rule contributes a lot to lower your co2 footprint: try to leave behind the least amount of waste possible. Here a couple of tips on how to start: Don't accept plastic or even paper bags in stores, bring your own reusable ones,Store leftovers in closed reusable containers, don't use zip locks or plastic film,Buy at stores where you can weigh nutrients and pay per ounce, instead of buying amounts predetermined by a grocer, and bring your own containers to weigh and transport your groceries,Eat less or no red meat. Beef producing industries are huge co2 contributers. You don't need more than one 2 ounce steak per week anyway, nutrient wise,Carpool when you can. Or walk, or take your bike. Bonus: you'll have a work out for free,Switch off the tap while shaving, shampooing your hair, brushing your teeth etc,Switch off lights in rooms you don't use,Buy soda by the gallon, not in cans. Or don't buy soda at all. It's unhealthy.Don't use plastic throw away bottles for water. The energy used to transport water around the world leaves an absurdly high co2 footprint. Use glass bottles and refill from your tap,Take a good look at your full garbage bag and see what you can stop using to avoid waste, every bit helps.Take for the A2A. Hope this helps to get you started! ",

            "answer_text": "1. Eat less of, or completely stop eating meat This may seem like a strange tip, however, this is incredibly effective. The Earth was not designed to withstand this high demand for meat. Between 7.7 billion people, we eat a lot of meat. This creates an increase in livestock, which then causes an increase in methane gasses that end up in the atmosphere. The methane gasses are created from the flatulence and belching from cattle, particularly cows. Although methane is not C02, it still traps heat in the atmosphere. In fact, methane traps 30 times more heat than C02. 2. Walk or carpool According to the EPA, A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Multiply this by the over 1 billion cars on the planet, and you can see how driving has become a problem. If enough people consistently carpool, use public transportation, or walk/bike to work, we can drastically reduce the carbon emissions caused by cars. 3. Unplug electronics As seen in my last blog article, electronics continue to draw energy through the outlets even if the device is off. The NRDC stated that 25 percent of home energy use is consumed by what they call vampire power: the use of energy from an outlet even if the electronic device that is plugged in is off. So the moral of the story? Unplug electronics when not using them. 4. Eat local If I were asked to give on tip that would reduce one\u2019s carbon footprint with ease, this would be it. For anyone looking how to help climate change, buy local food! Imported food is transported on planes, ships, and trucks. All three of these transport vehicles emit large amounts of C02 emissions. By buying food that is locally grown, the C02 emissions to deliver the goods to the grocery store is far less than imported food. Source: https://reducewastenow.com/how-to-help-climate-change/ ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What do you think is the best solution to stop climate change? We can't \"stop\" climate change. It is a natural process over which humanity has no control. What we can do is try and not contribute to the changing climate as much as we do by burning less carbon fuel. The climate would continue to change (i.e., continue to warm), just not as quickly. At least, that's what we're being told. In order to do that, we need to change how we generate electricity. Other sources of CO2 (transportation, construction, and some manufacturing) are decades away from reducing their carbon output. When (if) they ever do, they'll just shift the burden onto the electric grid. That's where we need to focus our efforts. The only way to do that is to shift to nuclear power. Wind, solar, and hydro can be in the mix, but they cannot scale to the levels needed to address the issue. And, apart from hydro, they also emit CO2. Nuclear energy has to be at the forefront of the effort. This comes with risks, however. There are issues of nuclear waste, the potential for releasing radioactive material into the environment, and proliferation concerns. All legitimate, of course, and this is why climate change advocates reject the technology. Understandable. However, they also tell us the climate change is the \"greatest existential threat to the planet.\" President Obama told us in a State of the Union address \"No challenge - no challenge - poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.\" It's a greater threat than war, disease, famine, pestilence, poverty, or anything else threatening humanity. That's pretty serious if you ask me. I've seen articles back in the day saying climate change \"will\" (not \"could,\" not \"might\" - \"will\") lead to the end of civilization, whatever that means. Ocasio-Cortez tells us we have just over 10 years before we're irreversibly doomed. So, which is it? Is climate change really that big of a deal? If so, then why haven't we embarked on an ambitious plan to replace our existing coal/oil/gas electrical generation plants with nuclear plants? We're at least a decade behind where we need to be to achieve our goals, and every permit that is denied, or every plant that is shut down, just sets us that much further behind. Or, is nuclear power just too dangerous of a technology? If so, then it appears that the whole climate change narrative is, to say the least, oversold as an emergency. After all, if you have a problem and solution to it, but you won't implement the solution, do you really have a problem? So here are our choices. Go nuclear (and accept the risk that entails), return to a pre-industrial lifestyle (no lights, no phones, no motor cars, not a single luxury), or figure out how to live with the changing climate. ",

            "answer_text": "Nukes, electrification, heat pumps, and research into fixing atmospheric carbon. Accelerated industrial development in the third world. Maybe discourage natural gas. The best base load energy source we have for carbon emissions (Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources - Wikipedia has a good summary and references the IPCC report), and the safest overall in practice (How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources), is nuclear fission. We have plenty of industrial experience with it for electricity generation. (Using more waste heat from nuke plants for industrial purposes would be nice, too. But first things first.) So, encourage nukes for as much primary electricity as possible. (Nothing wrong with other renewables where they make economic sense. Especially wind turbines. A substantial fraction of energy can economically be generated with wind, solar, hydro, and maybe tidal resources. That's well underway already.) Electrification of some industries is economical. Light transport is even well underway, which I wouldn't have predicted possible 20 or even 15 years ago. With a lot of nukes online, and oil and land gradually becoming more expensive, plenty of existing technologies will come into play naturally, shifting many industries toward electric power. Heat pumps are economical pretty much everywhere in the world for space heating. Non-electric commercial/residential is a big carbon source (Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions | US EPA), which comes down mostly to direct heating. For a few applications where electricity doesn't work well, like maybe container shipping, hydrogen fuel does, and that we can synthesize from electricity and water. For applications that really need dense liquid fuel, and which aren't readily replaced, we don't have practical industrial technology to pull carbon from the air. (We do for synthesizing the fuel, but not for (re)capturing the carbon.) Maybe throwing some money at research would help? We do have promising research technologies already (Can Removing Carbon From the Atmosphere Save Us From Climate Catastrophe?) but we don't know for sure that they'll pan out at scale. We don't have industrial technology to reverse warming [economically]. So warming will continue and it's probably cheaper and more feasible to deal with the resulting human migration than sequester carbon to reverse warming. But, who knows? Anyway, emphasis on nukes can at least reduce warming and its concomitant costs. Much of this is pretty natural economically. Oil supplies are getting harder to extract, and traditional renewables get a lot of support, including applications like electric cars. Public policy seems like it can mostly help by supporting nuclear, maybe disincentivising natural gas, and encouraging industrial development in the third world to reduce deforestation for cooking fuel and electrify more people to benefit from near-zero-carbon nuclear, wind, and solar energy sources.

            "answer_text": "Although human-induced climate change is not reversible, there is still time to keep it from getting much more severe. Not a lot of time. The good news is that wind and solar generation of electricity are now cheaper than fossil and nuclear generation, and we can make the world a wealthier place, while solving climate change. It\u2019s a sort of economic growth which will be available to everyone, and while some people will make more money than others, we will, if we do it right, end political strife over energy resources. What is needed depends on what you are able to do. Individuals can be more efficient, use renewable energy, and support political leaders who see the societal benefit to expanding cheap clean energy. People with specialized knowledge can make conversion to wind and solar happen faster. Buying an electric car will help, because we are going to make the electric supply carbon free, and then use expanded electricity to make transportation carbon free, and industry and business, and space and water heating, and at the end, we are going to make chemicals and plastics out of renewable energy and hydrocarbons. It may be possible to make plastics and chemicals safer and more recyclable, but that is a secondary group of problems. What matters today is that we know that the path is available to us, and if not every single step of the way is cheaper than the steps we are replacing, the vast majority of the way is going to make us richer and improve the quality of our lives. As an individual, you may not be personally engaged in most of this. Even so, it helps if you learn about it, tell others, and support those who are acting. We can\u2019t be sure we know how to remove carbon from the atmosphere in sufficient quantity, fast enough to matter. I urge people to regard this as two separate problems, or at least two separate steps to a problem. Ending fossil fuel use and emissions as fast as possible is achievable, and extremely urgent. Pulling carbon out of the atmosphere can be done, but whether we can do it fast enough, pull enough carbon out, and whether we will be willing to pay what it costs all remain to be seen. We need more people to deny the misrepresentations, the falsehoods and the lies. I\u2019ve seen how the fossil and nuclear industries promote misrepresentation, but it seems that a lot of people just accept the falsehoods and are trying to do what they think is right by perpetuating claims that climate change isn\u2019t serious and that renewables are too expensive or are somehow impractical. I\u2019ve worked to promote efficiency programs for more than half my life, and I know how the misunderstandings undermine good things that we know how to do. I wish I could pass all that experience along, but it\u2019s all I can do to talk about it now and then. Have confidence in your own determination to do good. It\u2019s a self-reinforcing effort. ",

The main is how it can be solved and who is going to solve it.There are some things which must be followed:- Complete \u201cbanning of PLASTIC\u201d throughout the country. Because it's disposal creates lots of pollution, there are only two types of disposal of it , burn it or bury it.Customisation of electrified or fuel cells supported automobiles, they are very costly but government and private sector must invest more to develop it,. And \u201cTESLA\u201d is doing great in this .Restrictions on excessive production of \u201cPALM OIL\u201d , because it's plantation ripped of the forests in Indonesia.Complete ban on artificial crude oil production, because it's processing leads to high air pollution.Declaration of two km area on both sides of all rivers as the \u201cECOLOGiCALLY SENSITIVE ZONE\u201d , and grow the native trees , it is the best way of recharging and reviving our destroying rivers.Putting \u201cCARBON TAX\u201d on the products according to the amount of CO2 produce during its production.There are many more stuffs to do to solve the problem but these solutions must be given priority as it is mentioned by the scientists. But the question arises who is going to do this , the answer is government via public, the govt is the face of people and it won't do anything unless it is forced to do , it has been seen from many centuries. So the time needs to do what is needed. ",

We have access of to some of those connected with the current warming hoax that explain the real plan behind this monstrous lie.

From November 14, 2010, -- Climate policy has almost nothing to do anymore with environmental protection, says the German economist and IPCC official Ottmar Edenhofer. \u201cThe next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the world\u2019s resources will be negotiated.\u201d \u2013 Ottmar Edenhofer Ottmar Edenhoffer -- UN-IPCC official: \"We redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy...Basically it's a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization...One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.\" Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2011/05/0...

This ideology wants to replace the free and spontaneous evolution of mankind by a sort of central (now global) planning.\u201d MISC. GW Quotes: H.L. Mencken - famous columnist Quotes: \"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed \u2014 and hence clamorous to be led to safety \u2014 by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.\" And, \"The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it.\" We start with Mencken's quotes because they are so well known from the past, but yet still so relevant so many years later. His past insights to those whose lives are addicted to the seeking of power, or control, or fame, or money is still as valid today, as it was 70 years ago. Below are quotes from the powerful; the rich; the religious; the studious; the famous; the fanatics; and, the aspiring, all sharing a common theme of keeping \"the populace alarmed\" to further their own personal, selfish goals. Once you read the below quotes, come back and re-read the previous paragraph. The threat to the world is not man-made global warming or climate change. The threat to the world, as is always the case, is a current group(s) of humans who want to impose their values and desires on others. The people below represent such a group, and they are not saints as individuals; in fact, quite the opposite, unfortunately. Paul Watson -- a founder of Greenpeace: \"It doesn't matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.\" Jim Sibbison -- environmental journalist, former public relations official for the Environmental Protection Agency: \"We routinely wrote scare stories...Our press reports were more or less true...We were out to whip the public into a frenzy about the environment.\" Club of Rome -- \"In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the \u201creal enemy, then, is humanity itself....believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is \u201ca real one or\u2026.one invented for the purpose.\" Daniel Botkin -- emeritus professor: \"The only way to get our society to truly change is to frighten people with the possibility of a catastrophe.\" President Jacques Chirac of France explained why the IPCC\u2019s climate initiative supported a key Western European Kyoto Protocol objective: \u201cFor the first time, humanity is instituting a genuine instrument of global governance, one that should find a place within the World Environmental Organization which France and the European Union would like to see established.\u201d Christiana Figueres -- Executive Secretary of the U.N.\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change -- \u201cThis is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.\u201d - \u201cThis is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.\u201d David Suzuki -- celebrity scientist, alarmist extraordinaire: 1990 quote: \"More than any other time in history, the 1990s will be a turning point for human civilization.\" David Suzuki -- celebrity scientist, alarmist extraordinaire: 2011 quote: \"Humanity is facing a challenge unlike any we\u2019ve ever had to confront. We are in an unprecedented period of change.\" Robert Stavins -- the head of Harvard\u2019s Environmental Economics program: \"It\u2019s unlikely that the U.S. is going to take serious action on climate change until there are observable, dramatic events, almost catastrophic in nature, that drive public opinion and drive the political process in that direction.\" Al Gore, former U.S. vice president, and large CO2 producer: \"I believe it is appropriate to have an over-representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is, as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are, and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis.\" Stephen Schneider, Stanford Univ., environmentalist: \"That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\" Sir John Houghton, pompous lead editor of first three IPCC reports: \u201cIf we want a good environmental policy in the future we\u2019ll have to have a disaster.\u201d Monika Kopacz, atmospheric scientist: \"It is no secret that a lot of climate-change research is subject to opinion, that climate models sometimes disagree even on the signs of the future changes (e.g. drier vs. wetter future climate). The problem is, only sensational exaggeration makes the kind of story that will get politicians\u2019 \u2014 and readers\u2019 \u2014 attention. So, yes, climate scientists might exaggerate, but in today\u2019s world, this is the only way to assure any political action and thus more federal financing to reduce the scientific uncertainty.\" Christine Stewart, former Canadian Environment Minister: \u201cNo matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.... climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.\u201d Timoth Wirth, U.S./UN functionary, former elected Democrat Senator: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.\u201d Quote from the UN's Own \"Agenda 21\": \"Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.\" Maurice Strong, a billionaire elitist, primary power behind UN throne, and large CO2 producer: \u201cIsn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?\u201d Gus Hall, former leader of the Communist Party USA: \"Human society cannot basically stop the destruction of the environment under capitalism. Socialism is the only structure that makes it possible.\" Peter Berle, President of the National Audubon Society: \"We reject the idea of private property.\" Jack Trevors, Editor-in-Chief of Water, Air, & Soil Pollution: \"The capitalistic systems of economy follow the one principal rule: the rule of profit making. All else must bow down to this rule\u2026The current USA is an example of a failed capitalistic state in which essential long-term goals such as prevention of climate change and limitation of human population growth are subjugated to the short-term profit motive and the principle of economic growth.\" Judi Bari, an American environmentalist and labor leader, a feminist, and the principal organizer of Earth First!: \"I think if we don't overthrow capitalism, we don't have a chance of saving the world ecologically,\" David Brower, a founder of the Sierra Club: \"The goal now is a socialist, redistributionist society, which is nature's proper steward and society's only hope.\" UN chief Ban Ki-moon: \"Now it is the least developed world who are not responsible for this climate change phenomenon that bore the brunt of climate change consequences so it is morally and politically correct that the developed world who made this climate change be responsible by providing financial support and technological support to these people.\" David Rockefeller, heir to billion dollar fortune: \"We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis...\" Helen Caldicott, an Australian physician and a leading member of the Union of Concerned Scientists: \"Free Enterprise really means rich people get richer. They have the freedom to exploit and psychologically rape their fellow human beings in the process...Capitalism is destroying the earth.\" Judi Dench, famous UK actress: \"The need for a global structure of control in the form of a world environment court is now more urgent than ever before.\" Club of Rome: \"A keen and anxious awareness is evolving to suggest that fundamental changes will have to take place in the world order and its power structures, in the distribution of wealth and income.\" Mikhail Gorbachev, communist and former leader of U.S.S.R.: \"The emerging 'environmentalization' of our civilization and the need for vigorous action in the interest of the entire global community will inevitably have multiple political consequences. Perhaps the most important of them will be a gradual change in the status of the United Nations. Inevitably, it must assume some aspects of a world government.\" \u201cThe threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key to unlock the New World Order.\u201d Gordon Brown, former British prime minister: \"A New World Order is required to deal with the Climate Change crisis.\" Club of Rome: \"Now is the time to draw up a master plan for sustainable growth and world development based on global allocation of all resources and a new global economic system. Ten or twenty years form today it will probably be too late.\" Lester Brown, founder of the Worldwatch Institute, and founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute: \"Nations are in effect ceding portions of their sovereignty to the international community and beginning to create a new system of international environmental governance.\" Dixy Lee Ray, former liberal Democrat governor of State of Washington, U.S.: \"The objective, clearly enunciated by the leaders of UNCED, is to bring about a change in the present system of independent nations. The future is to be World Government with central planning by the United Nations. Fear of environmental crises - whether real or not - is expected to lead to \u2013 compliance\u201d Quote by UN's Commission on Global Governance: \"The concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.\" David Shearman, an IPCC Assessor for 3rd and 4th climate change reports: \"Government in the future will be based upon . . . a supreme office of the biosphere. The office will comprise specially trained philosopher/ecologists. These guardians will either rule themselves or advise an authoritarian government of policies based on their ecological training and philosophical sensitivities. These guardians will be specially trained for the task.\" John Holdren, President Obama's science czar: \u201cA massive campaign must be launched to restore a high-quality environment in North America and to de-develop the United States...De-development means bringing our economic system (especially patterns of consumption) into line with the realities of ecology and the global resource situation...Redistribution of wealth both within and among nations is absolutely essential, if a decent life is to be provided for every human being.\" Al Gore, former U.S. vice president, mega-millionaire, and large CO2 producer: \u201cAdopting a central organizing principle means embarking on an all-out effort to use every policy and program, every law and institution, to halt the destruction of the environment.\u201d Ban Ki-Moon, UN Secretary General: \"A deal must include an equitable global governance structure.

The most unimpeachable experiment was run by National Institute of Standards (NIST) CO2 is Not Driving Global Warming which showed that at current atmospheric CO2 levels, all of the IR which generates heat (in the CO2 absorption bandwidth) is already absorbed with in about 1500 feet of the surface of the Earth. Adding more CO2 doesn\u2019t matter, because there is no more IR to absorb. This is corroborated as well by real world data. From 1957 to 1977, global temperature dropped substantially, while CO2 just kept going up at its present rate.  So, maybe CO2 increases cause cooling, or warming, or \u2026 I\u2019m confused! The scientific method says that if you claim some statement to be a scientific truth, then there can be no exceptions. It is also the case that for the last 400,000 years (about four ice ages) the CO2 concentrations didn\u2019t move upward until temperature had already started up. This is easy to explain: when the oceans warm, CO2 is outgassed. That is exactly what we are seeing now. The planet has been warming for about 150 years from an extended cold period (Little Ice Age, 1400 - 1850), and sure enough, CO2 is going up. How much of it is due to humans? 3%, as even admitted by the IPCC. So take a deep breath, turn off the panic switch and try to stop bad science instead. The climate is here to stay, and we don\u2019t control it. ",

            "answer_text": "Climate change is a hot topic nowadays. Many woke individuals from all over the world are trying to spread awareness regarding the same and I too wished to dig deep into this issue which affects us all without exception, to really understand where we are losing the game collectively. And while doing so, I came across an interesting research: How education and governments miss the most effective individual action to mitigate climate change? \u25cf Current anthropogenic climate change is the result of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, which records the aggregation of billions of individual decisions. \u25cf Here, in this study we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. \u25cf We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: 1. Having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6\u2009tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year) 2. Living car-free ( 2.4 tCO2e saved per year) 3. Avoiding airplane travel ( 1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) 4. Eating a plant-based diet ( 0.8 tCO2e saved per year).  \u25cf These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). \u25cf Government resources on climate change from the EU, USA, Canada, and Australia fails to mention these actions (after observing ten high school science textbooks from these countries). \u25cf National policies and major energy transformations often take decades to change locked-in infrastructure and institutions, but behavioural shifts have the potential to be more rapid and widespread (i.e. reduced reliance on cars can begin immediately, whereas improved power plant efficiency occurs on a decadal time frame.  Now, in India's context this is something which should be in the domain of public knowledge but no influential figure has ever spoken on this particular topic apart from Acharya Prashant. Most of the influential personalities say only that which pleases people or conforms to the belief systems of the masses. This surely helps them with a huge \u201cfan-following\u201d but it totally undermines the welfare of that \u201cfan\u201d itself. This is something that must be put across on a wider-scale. A few suggested reads on the same topic: On the global crisis of population, consumptionThe only solution to Climate ChangeThe time has come that we all stand together for this cause. And the best and the worst thing about this is that it totally depends on our choice!

Sit down, sit back, get loose and relaxed and I will tell you, show you, teach you, exactly how to get the Earth to stop warming up, and start cooling back down. And the good news? My method is absolutely free. Zero cost. But you have to be patient. You have to wait for it. And then you will learn\u2026 steps A to Z\u2026 the secret method for getting the Earth to stop warming, and then with time, actually start cooling. More good news? Every single human can do it. We all have the ability. It is very simple. Even the elderly, the infirm, and infants can help out. Global warming does after all, impact every human life. We are all on the same planet. We all have the same rights and in theory the same freedoms, and the same obligations and responsibilities. And global warming, if it never stopped would be a bad thing. We all want warming to stop and cooling to start, at some point. Here is the secret plan. And\u2026 just one more thing, before I tell you, I want to give you one more piece of good news\u2026 You have already started the educational process. You have already been taught an action, and practiced it. Because\u2026 The\u2026 Secret\u2026 To \u201cstopping\u201d global warming\u2026 And even better\u2026 the globe not just stopping warming, but actually cooling\u2026 Is\u2026 Something\u2026 You\u2026 Even\u2026 Now\u2026 Are\u2026 Doing. Wait. Pass time. Twiddle them thumbs. Plant a pebble and watch it to see if a rock garden will grow out of it. Watch an episode of The Simpsons, or SNL. Because ALWAYS\u2026 warming happens. And then !!!\u2026 cooling happens. It is the way of the world. How things work. Every single year, the Earth warms up by about 3.5 degrees. And then that same year, it cools by about 3.5 degrees. (YES! The average global temperature of Earth fluctuates by that much, every single year). As well as that, we have increases and decreases in global temperature during Grand Solar Maximums and Grand Solar Minimums. They can last anywhere from 30\u201340 years, up to several centuries. So if the \u201c0.5 degrees over several decades\u201d warming is what you are talking about\u2026 then your job is to wait several more decades, and the situation will reverse. We have just come out of the MODERN GRAND SOLAR MAXIMUM. So further minimal global warming is very unlikely, and if a Grand Minimum is what is next, then some cooling will take place. The Sun matters. Humans don\u2019t.  But if you are invested in the idea of embracing and supporting renewable energy sources, and more fuel efficient vehicles and use of public transit and development of electric vehicles, and other forms of energy conservation\u2026 and wonder whether you are serving anyone\u2019s good purpose, or are being manipulated into thinking as you do\u2026 No worries\u2026 Here is the master you have been serving\u2026 The US economy,US dollar value and general prosperity,US energy security, andUS diplomatic independence (freedom from coercion by OPEC).Here is the evidence: National Energy Program Fact Sheet on the President's Program.

            "answer_text": "Marcella, the same way we have been dealing with the phenomenon for the past 150 years, i.e., since the end of the Little Ice Age when the current warming period started. While the debate about global warming has been completely hijacked for the moment by the enthusiastic supporters of AGW, heavily peppered by often selective and sometimes dubious data, we have not seen an empirical proof of meaningful acceleration of the process. Our sea levels continue to rise at the same rate, i.e., around a foot per century. The climate, particularly further north and south of the equator, appears to be warming but the rate of warming stays fairly stable. And, more importantly, our attempts to correlate temperature rise to concentrations of greenhouse gasses have not been very successful, i.e., we cannot predict with any solid level of confidence what the climate is going to in the next decade or so. Is it possible that the greenhouse gases being released by human activity are a major contributor to climate change (and we have just been lousy at finding the right correlation)? Yes, but not likely. Should we be spending our taxpayers' money to invest in wind and solar as the AGW activists and politicians are telling us? Probably not as the cost, both in dollars and damage to the environment and social well being, would be huge. However, there is an alternative that can satisfy both concerns, which is clean nuclear energy. We are finally at the stage when we can address the two major concerns typically invoked with nuclear energy, i.e., proliferation and waste handling. ",

You see, the most important, and quite possibly the only thing you need to know about climate is that it is a \u201ccalculation\u201d. I can create any climate and any climate-trend. I can make a hot climate, a cold climate, a wet climate or a dry climate. I can make it for anywhere and any time. And given that I\u2019m far from the sharpest tool is the math shed then you can bet your bottom dollar that almost anyone else can likewise create any climate they want. Climate is a Calculation. Weather is what you experience. There - we\u2019ve exposed the trick being used to fool good people.  So if anyone can create any climate and climate-trend desired, why do alarmists want to talk about climate? As every trickster and illusionist knows, the key to duping their audience is misdirection.

            "answer_text": "Yes, well the answers so far say nothing about reducing the effects of climate change, instead they discuss aspects of causes of climate change. To reduce the effects of climate change we need first to accept that climate variability exists, which it always has, and that the degree of variability itself varies. Right now, as we enter another cyclical solar minimum, the variability is increasing as must our resilience and our acceptance of the situation and future planning. Predicting future crop yields and planting times, for example, becomes more subject to error and we must be prepared to accept that a lower proportion of food crops will grow to maturity, as many US farmers are realizing at present after a disastrously cold summer followed by early snow in many areas. In addition, it will be very beneficial if people are able to grow their own food in their own gardens. Not only will this ease the presemt and future food shortages, it is also healthier and goes some way towards teaching the next generation the skills needed and advantages of growing their own food. We can also prepare better for the more variable and frequently colder weather in the future by ensuring that we have enough firewood, a suitable wood burning stove that you can cook on, preferably with a wetback, and generally develop skills and resources for self-sufficiency.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. Climate change is a natural occurrence. Contrary to what you might have read/seen/heard, OUR CO2 is not at fault. With all the evidence out there, what is it that says NO? Nahle calculated two particular pieces that are important to the argument: our emissions are 33 meters apart in the air, and the entire interaction with IR takes .0001 seconds. With the separation of our CO2 so wide, the \u201cblanket\u201d explanation is very far fetched. In addition, the \u201cheat\u201d developed by the molecule in .0001 seconds is enough to replace the \u201cheat\u201d it used to \u201cexcite\u201d the bonding points. The assumption by those touting our fault rely on the concept that all the CO2 increases since 1850 (some say 1750) is due to our burning of fossil fuels. It does not take into account that while our emissions have increased, natural emissions have also increased, and are not all absorbed. Can I prove that? Yes. In 2019, we emitted 38 GT, which is about 4% of the total annual emissions. Multiply 38 times 25 (100%), and you get 950. The highest annual absorption rate I\u2019ve seen is 788 Gt (Scientific American). Subtract 788 form 950, and you get 162. We are told taht around half of our emissions are also absorbed. So, subtract our half (19), and you now have 143. Those 143 Gt are NOT our accumulation, as we are talking annual. Then, who do they belong to? NATURE. The ratio of nature to us is 7+:1. That means it would take us 7+ years, just to equal the excess of nature for 2019. If CO# is truly at fault for climate change, then Nature is the one to look at, not us. ",

            "answer_text": "How can we stop climate change before it becomes irreversible? Let\u2019s start with the facts.Current climate change is caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases and there is more than enough of evidence of it so the science agrees on it. Summary for Policymakers of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C approved by governments  Whoever thinks that this isn\u2019t true should bring up his doubts - but check them against this list first. Skeptical science - Arguments from global warming skeptics If his doubts are already covered, he may face being blocked. I don\u2019t have the time to debate supporters of global conspiracies or science deniers.Those get blocked immediately. Similar faith may face also data cherry pickers (\u201clast 3 summers/winter in <insert blanks> were cold\u201d) or people who have no idea what physics is. That\u2019s for the start. There are two questions: is the current climate change irreversible? Yes. Species that went extinct are extinct, they cannot be brought back. But the question might actually be - is it unstoppable? No, at least - not yet. There are two tipping points that have to be avoided and they I know of. The first looks to be more imminent - the ice melt in summers on the North Pole.Currently it still covers it, but it is getting thinner and thinner.  Once it will melt down completely, the sea water will absorb the sunlight instead of reflecting it - and the sea (and Earth) will become even warmer. A couple of years in short sequence - and we are past the tipping point. The other one is the amount of melting of the Ice on Antarctica. Once this one starts to melt and drift into the ocean even faster, that\u2019s the second tipping point.Antarctica is gaining ice, but also losing it even faster How to stop it? By stop adding fossil carbon into the atmosphere. The rest are details that have been said so often that even birds are tweeting them and I have no time for repeating them for those who won\u2019t even listen. ",

            "answer_text": "Climate Change is a combination of natural processes that have been going on since the Earth cooled enough for the oceans to rain down out of the atmosphere. The problem we are attempting to address is Anthropogenic Global Warming, which has only been going on since we ramped up CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in the Industrial Revolution. As science advanced and emissions increased, it was recognized as a possibility at the end of the 19th century, measured in 1938, recognized as a potential threat in 1957, and found to be causing measurable damage in 1972. The IPCC and the Global Warming Denial movement each began in the late 1970s. We have been advancing the technologies of renewable energy for decades, and of energy efficiency and conservation. We began to pass into Grid Parity, renewables cheaper than coal, in 2011, and we passed Peak Coal in 2013. Now we have private investments of about $300 billion annually in new renewable generation, including geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, and others. Meanwhile market prices for coal, oil, and gas have tanked, and much of the coal and fracking industries is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, or has fallen over. The most important new technologies in 2016 are in batteries. They are enabling Electric Vehicles with ranges of more than 200 miles and prices around $35,000, due out in 2017 from Tesla and Chevrolet. We can expect greater range and lower prices every year for the foreseeable future.Load balancing and time shifting in the increasingly smart grid and in homes and businesses with rooftop solar. This means that intermittent renewable sources will no longer have to spill power generated when it cannot be used. That will further lower the cost of such power. In addition, it means that there is no limit on the fraction of renewables in the grid.Community microgrid solar, shared across entire villages. It is becoming viable via microfinance for the poorest and most remote villages, those with no hope of grid connections. This means a huge boost to rural economies in the poorest countries, among other benefits.We still need more technologies to replace other forms of carbon burning. Synthetic jet fuel, perhaps, or using hydrogen from water rather than methane to make ammonia. We understand the chemistry for those, and it is now just a matter of getting costs down relative to carbon. There is a synergy there with declining costs for renewable energy, and with the movement to repeal subsidies for carbon, and to tax it according to the costs it imposes on the world. We can thus see our way to Peak Carbon, which is fast approaching, and beyond that to Net Zero Emissions, probably somewhere between 2030 and 2050. Going sufficiently Carbon Negative to cool the planet will be harder, but there are some plausible geoengineering technologies in development. Not a sunshade for the Earth, which is in the realm of science fiction or even fantasy, but causing large plankton blooms in the ocean, or reacting CO2 with various reactive minerals to create stable carbonate minerals. There are continuing experiments with basalt, and with olivine and serpentine minerals. All are plentiful near the Earth's surface. ",

Whether they would be able to switch to a different source of energy or not remains to be seen but we don\u2019t need everyday people who drive to add onto that process. Second, we need to plant more trees. Don\u2019t know if people have studied the carbon cycle but we\u2019re basically cutting down our carbon sinks while heavily loading onto the release of carbon. The ocean is taking a hit and we\u2019re seeing the effects of that with acidification and dying coral reefs. Third is probably going to be the one that will get people even more entrenched on not trying to solve this issue. What is it? Eating less meat. I can hear the outrage already. But it isn\u2019t a secret at all what one of the main contributors is and that is our livestock. We simply have too many because the demand is so high. This is also something I think about in terms of the sheer volume of meat being consumed. If I\u2019m at the mall or any other restaurant, I think of how many people are there. How much the restaurant buys. I think about how many restaurants are just in the particular city I\u2019m in and how there are probably millions of restaurants just in our country. There are also a lot of other countries who buy beef as well. That\u2019s a lot of cows dude. My view is that we have basically manipulated enough of the environment where the carrying capacity for humans has been lowered. We can\u2019t keep this up and we\u2019re already on track for quite a bit of damage that\u2019s going to be inflicted on our societies. My guess is we\u2019re right about here:  You think we have an immigration/overcrowding issue right now? Wait until there\u2019s less land to live on. It\u2019s gonna be a real shit show. But I\u2019m not hopeful. Humans are super short-sighted and averse to change.

            "answer_text": "The only way of which I am aware, that has been studied as a possible mechanism to affect climate change, involves geoengineering. There are actually numerous scientists who are researching this tactic. Some individuals believe it has already been instituted, but as far as I know there is no definitive proof of this. But, indeed, it is being seriously considered by governments and various science organizations. The most common form utilizes the aerosolization of micro-particles of aluminum oxide, sulfate or other elements which are sprayed into the upper atmosphere in an attempt to block a portion of incoming solar radiation. Such an operation would possibly create dense visible, long-lasting atmospheric trails behind the aircraft spraying the material, the so-called \u201cchemtrails\u201d, which some individuals claim are already being seen.  Another reported scheme (although without substantial factual evidence thus far) involves directing massive amounts of microwave radiation at these aerosols, conceivably heating them and the surrounding air. The heated air would then rise, producing an area of low pressure. Under the proper conditions, it is alleged that this could lead to local rainfall or be used to prevent rainfall in adjacent areas. Whether this tactic could actually change the climate and not just local weather is not clear.  And no, there is no experimental evidence or proof that changing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 can affect the climate in any significant amount. That is just an unproven hypothesis at this point. But there is mounting evidence that atmospheric CO2 levels do not correlate with global temperatures: https://www.quora.com/How-do-human-CO2-emissions-compare-to-natural-Co2-emissions/answer/John-Walker-922 \u201cSpurious correlations are common in climate science where many critical relationships that support the fundamentals of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) are found to be based on spurious correlations. Correlation between x and y in time series data derive from responsiveness of y to x at the time scale of interest and also from shared long-term trends. These two effects can be separated by detrending both time series. When the trend effect is removed, only the responsiveness of y to x remains.

            "answer_text": "Removing CO2 in massive quantities from the atmosphere. There is no other way. CO2 residence time is naturally too long for us to wait for the Earth to remove it. We have to literally suck it out of the atmosphere or cause CO2 to react with something somehow with a harmless bi-product. How we do this is not known. Technology is not good enough or scaleable enough at this time to make a major dent in the levels. Trees can only do so much and we are STILL cutting them down in the major rain-forests due to agriculture. What I think we can do is make CO2 emitting activities harderto do and introduce alternatives. Part of it is technology, but a lot of it is personal choice. People ultimately have to make the decision and within their abilities. Someone in poverty can\u2019t just \u201cbuy a more fuel efficient car\u201d. Not everyone can live walking distance from work. Society has to fill the gap somehow. The big WE have to make some hard decisions to buy time until we can just suck the stuff out of the air. ",

            "answer_text": "How can we stop climate change before it becomes irreversible? Answer Despite what others may say, it\u2019s never irreversible. The longer we keep going on the way are though, the more damage will be done and the harder it will get to arrest and even reverse the harm. At this point we have initiated a degree of momentum that will require a huge effort to stop. That\u2019s why we need to convince our leaders that the transition from hydrocarbon fuels is critical for our future. People always complain that our leaders are incompetent or corrupt, yet these leaders don\u2019t get delivered by aliens or anything like that, they come from us. We have to take responsibility for the policies that our governments enact. Controls that reflect the true cost of burning fuels need to be implemented, otherwise parasites like the Koch brothers will continue to make obscene amounts of money out of destroying our children\u2019s future. Show your leaders that you\u2019re worried about your future, make sure your vote counts and hold the politicians accountable. Remember that they represent you, they are the public servants. Be a good example and restrain uncontrolled impulses, actively work to reduce your impact such as fitting solar panels to your home if possible. Give health a try and leave the car at home if you can use a bicycle instead, you might even find you like it, your heart and lungs certainly will. Teach your children the true meaning of responsibility, and don\u2019t throw away their future. Technology will certainly play a part, but without the majority of us taking an active part in this we\u2019re doomed to continuing the cycle of damage. And the longer we vacillate, the harder it becomes. ",

But we have pushed it in the direction of warming by putting carbon back whence it came from in the first place \u2013 in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas. The fossil fuels were formed from it in the Permian and Carboniferous periods three hundred million years ago over about 70 million years, and the rate of our returning carbon to the atmosphere over the past century has been phenomenal. Take a look at this graph \u2013  The sight inflection at the very top of the graph is good news; the switch to renewables might just be the cause. If so, we can slow global warming, hopefully to a point where our innovative abilities can manage it. Note, however, that carbon dioxide is not the prime driver for warming; entropic heat from the inefficiencies of fossil fuel use is the principal source, followed by the vast amounts of water vapour we are putting out, principally from power station cooling towers.

You can see the results here: Climate History So, for my money, CO2 is necessary to grow my garden and could be higher to help the crops. Regardless of the federal government proclamations, it is not a pollutants but a requirement for plants of all types. The false equilibration of pollution and climate change is invalid and meant to mislead. In summary I cannot improve on Dr Scorese\u2019s remarks: ICE HOUSE or HOT HOUSE? During the last 2 billion years the Earth's climate has alternated between a frigid \"Ice House\", like today's world, and a steaming \"Hot House\", like the world of the dinosaurs. ",

            "answer_text": "AFAIK it cannot be \u201cstopped\u201d by cutting GHG emissions. If we magically stopped all GHG production right now, the temp would still increase for a while. This is because the thermal inertia of the earth, the ice caps, and specially the oceans means that the earth and its oceans still has not equilibrated in temp yet. Plus the GHG\u2019s already in the atmosphere will take a long time to be removed. Wave a magic wand and stop GHG production and the earth\u2019s average temp will rise for a while then plateau slowly slowly decrease back to pre industrial levels. However the temp will plateau at a level much lower than if we still kept to business as usual. This alone makes anti climate change actions worthwhile and not useless. Scientists tell us that even if CO2 was stabilized at its current level of 390 ppm, there is at least another 0.6 degrees \u201cin the pipeline\u201d. If findings from a recent study of Antarctic ice cores is confirmed, the last figure will prove to be conservative [ii] . The delayed response is known as climate lag. The reason the planet takes several decades to respond to increased CO2 is the thermal inertia of the oceans. Consider a saucepan of water placed on a gas stove. Although the flame has a temperature measured in hundreds of degrees C, the water takes a few minutes to reach boiling point. This simple analogy explains climate lag. The mass of the oceans is around 500 times that of the atmosphere. The time that it takes to warm up is measured in decades. Because of the difficulty in quantifying the rate at which the warm upper layers of the ocean mix with the cooler deeper waters, there is significant variation in estimates of climate lag. A paper by James Hansen and others [iii] estimates the time required for 60% of global warming to take place in response to increased emissions to be in the range of 25 to 50 years. The mid-point of this is 37.5 which I have rounded to 40 years. Climate Change: The 40 Year Delay Between Cause and Effect Note that I did not say \u201ccannot be stopped, period\u201d. It is theoretically possible (although spectacularly expensive and impractical) to reduce or at least stabilize earth\u2019s temp by using geoengineering. Other problems like ocean acidification would not be affected though. The usual methods of reducing GHG emissions apply. Massive shift to low carbon electricity. Fission, hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, biofuel, etc. For transport use batteries, biofuels, hydrogen, ammonia, synth-fuels, etc etc. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of them, a lot more than most \u2018skeptics\u2019 admit. Transformation Wind energy - already the cheapest form of new generation on most grids, it\u2019s also cheaper than a lot of existing energy sources. It\u2019s also continuing to get cheaper. Compared to coal and gas generation, lifetime CO2e emissions approach zero. And it\u2019s a lot faster and cheaper to build than nuclear and can be built in every country of the world, unlike nuclear. Build it instead of almost anything else.Utility-scale solar energy - On track to be cheaper than wind energy at utility scale, which is saying a lot. Very similar otherwise.Rooftop solar - It\u2019s a great way to reduce peak load and since it competes with retail electricity rates, it makes a lot of sense. Support it with net metering.Electric cars - As the grid decarbonizes, electric cars go from merely being a lot lower emissions to incredibly less emissions of CO2e. And they reduce noise pollution and a variety of noxious tailpipe emissions as well, so population health increases as a by product. And they accelerate like crazy. Win, win, win. Supporting them with incentives for purchase makes a lot of sense. Supporting them with zoning requiring condo and apartment buildings to allow or even provide electric car charging makes sense. Supporting them with new charging infrastructure in urban areas and along inter-city corridors makes sense.Electrifying transportation - Buses and trucks are big sources of CO2e as well as lots of nasty pollution which makes it hard for our kids and aging parents to breathe. Shifting rapidly to the new, much cheaper battery technology that\u2019s available now gives them much better operating costs, a lot less noise \u2014 no engine braking for example \u2014, low CO2e and no pollution emission. There were 90,000 electric buses sold in China in 2015. Chinese electric buses are arriving in cities all over the world, including St. Albert, Alberta, a bedroom community of Edmonton.Shutting down coal plants - They are the worst emitters in the world. And they emit the most pollution as well. They suck. Replacing them with literally anything except diesel or oil generation is a win. There is no war on coal, there is a war for clean air, healthy children and less climate change.Not building too much methane generation - \u2018Natural gas\u2019 is better than coal in almost every way, but it\u2019s worse than wind and solar in almost every way. The trick will be to build enough of it to get rid of coal rapidly and then to get rid of the gas generation as rapidly as possible after that. As a bridge, we need to make it a footbridge, and not a 12 lane permanent monstrosity.Eliminating all subsidies for fossil fuels - There are a lot of baked in incentives in tax codes, ordnances, regulations and governmental budgets that make it more profitable to go the fossil fuel route. Whether it\u2019s diesel subsidies for farmers or oil-and-gas exploration tax breaks, there\u2019s a lot of hidden money sloshing around. Get rid of it. Redirect it to the future technologies. It\u2019s hard work, but eminently reasonable.Pricing carbon - Even if you eliminate all of the direct, systemic subsidies and support that fossil fuels get, that won\u2019t do a thing for their free-rider negative externality. So cost it.Keeping existing nuclear running as long as safe - While nuclear plants are being shut down in many jurisdictions for reasons including lack of economic competitiveness, loss of public support and poor fit with the more flexible generation sources now available, they are a major source of CO2e neutral electricity. Few are likely to be built new, but keeping existing ones going makes a lot more sense than shutting them down early. Some US states are finding additional subsidies that can be provided to keep them going, which is a sensible choice.Adaptation Seawalls, dykes and barrages - In most major, rich seaside cities in the world, the sea\u2019s rise is manageable with flood control technologies not dissimilar to what the Dutch have been using for centuries. It\u2019s cheaper to make the cities a bit more watertight than to move them.Abandonment - There are low-lying island nations, cities in underdeveloped countries and a handful of places in developed countries that we are just going to have to abandon. Miami is the poster child of doomed seaside real estate in the developed world, as it\u2019s build on porous limestone, it\u2019s really flat and low, and it\u2019s sinking a bit while the sea is rising. The Maldives won\u2019t exist as a nation. We\u2019ll have to accept these things and help the population move sensible and with the lowest disruption and fewest climate refugees.Crop adaptation - Monocultures are particularly susceptible to natural disasters of specific types. But since humans control when and where they grow as much as nature does, shifting crop choices for arable land is straightforward. Lots of that has already occurred and more will.There are a handful more that I could list, and likely one or two of them are as major as the ones above. There are innumerable finger-and-toe reasonable societal choices. But these are the biggies. There\u2019s nothing unreasonable on that list unless you think that fossil fuels losing their unfair advantages and being forced to compete on a level playing field is somehow oppressive to them. And you have to really question someone who thinks that way, kind of like you have to question the well-off, pasty folks in the USA who voted for Trump because the playing field isn\u2019t quite as tilted toward them as it used to be.

The past seven or eight recession are related to oil shocks that began in 1973 when OPEC was newly formed and decide to declare an oil embargo. The latter shocks were caused by supply shortages. We are now thinking that we will never suffer or experience another oil shock from any possible kind of supply shortages. We had always known about shale rock oil for decades if not centuries since when? and we always said that shale oil rock was very expensive to develop and produce. boom! we are producing oil from shale rock just right after the infamous great oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico back in 2010 or 2011. This oil spill seemed to be the catalyst for the big move toward shale rock ever since.. Even now, we are thinking that we are already peaking production with shale rock and we are fearing another oil shortage in the future. You might wonder what this has to do with stopping climate change, again it is the health issues that is always the real issue . People just doesnt seem to appreciate the hazardous effects of pumping gasoline into car tanks with exposure to the fumes that can cause cancer. I am not suggesting that carbon dioxide is unimportant , but it is an useful selling tool to convince more people to reduce oil consumption with more clean energy as the alternative as well as an excellent buffer against the inevitable oil shortage shocks in the future all the same as before .. We never learn our lessons through history as always if ever! Everyone is too busy making a living to be constantly reminded of the health hazards associated with fossil fuels . We need a change of scene like anybody does. Politics never get old, you know\u2026 ?? ",

We should have had a \u201cgas tax\u201d 10 years ago when I and others wrote about this during the 2008\u20132009 economic depression when gas prices were up to $4 gallon, and Americans drove 18% less highway miles in single passenger vehicles. A lot of economy cars were sold that year, but, with low gas prices and trumps rollback of auto emissions rules, large SUVs are selling so many, Ford does not even manufacture many sedans any more. That is why we may be doomed. Sadly, French president Macron passed a gas tax a couple of years ago, and the \u201cyellow vests\u201d rioted in the streets. These protests were encouraged by left wing groups, the same groups also wailing about climate change and the environment. We are doomed as of that event.

This is a worldwide issue, climate change is substantially altering annual weather patterns (National Climate Assessment). In the US there are a huge amount of petroleum dollars at work pushing disinformation campaigns. If you dig a little, it\u2019s clear to see that all dollars that are pushing the global-warming-is-false agenda are supported by petroleum industry dollars. Ten years ago they were also supported by Coal dollars. However, this is less true since all major Coal companies have gone bankrupt. The same will happen to petroleum companies some time over the next decade. This will happen because of the falling cost of renewable resources and storage technology. In this first chart you can see renewables doubling between 2010 and and mid 2013 and doubling about between 2013 and 2016 (2016 is also when we saw Peabody Coal declare bankruptcy). Part of this is due to Swanson\u2019s Law, which is explained pretty well in the video below.   The populations that will be effected most rapidly by rising sea levels (India: Mumbai, China: much of Guandong province, Indonesia) are also the populations that are moving towards using less sustainable regional actions. We can\u2019t handle this at the level of individuals or individual states and we need to harness the innovation and motivation from Capitalism. Greater Asia is where more than half of humanity lives along with those most susceptible to sea rise. It would advantageous for that part of the world to form strong bonds to fight global warming (as a trade-union these countries would be far stronger than the US). This area needs to become the most responsible area in the world for Global Warming (because they suffer the fastest, most dire consequences if it\u2019s not solved):  Slow or stop adding CO2 to the atmosphereCarbon sequestrationScaling up reforestation and geopolymer cement don\u2019t look like it\u2019s happening fast enough. The rate that renewable power is doubling looks promising if it continues it\u2019s exponential rate of increase. Replace Cement production, move from Portland Cement to Geopolymer cement - WikipediaGet better at storing power (and continue dropping the price of producing it).Renewables are already cheaper than fossil fuels. Swanson\u2019s Law appears to still be cutting the cost of photovoltaic power by around 20% per year. Energy storage, largely because of Tesla\u2019s Gigafactories is dropping price nearly as fast. (please note that after the expensive collapse of the coal industry, which includes subsidies around bankruptcy Nearly half of US coal is produced by companies that have declared bankruptcy \u2014 and Trump won\u2019t fix that isn\u2019t included in these \u201cun-subsidized\u201d numbers, and only \u201cdirect\u201d subsidies are included) Reforestation/De-desertification/revitalize soil.

We have the technology: just build lots of solar, wind, and nuclear plants, mothball all of the fossil fuel plants, scrap cars and trucks and replace with electrics, and what you must run with liquid fuels (like planes) use biofuels. Plant tons of trees, then after several years cut them down and bury the wood in deserts or the tundra - places where they won't rot. Or build things out of them! Add a little iron to the ocean to fertilize bacteria that, after absorbing CO2, will fall the the ocean floor. Explore carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere - power it using solar panels.

If that money did not exist many of those causes would no longer be quite so devastating. If you wanted it to stop today we would need to convene a constitutional convention among all the states and have them draw up a new constitution, or use the old one, it was fine until overly amended, and then work to find jobs for those federal employees. The states would have to step up their services and their taxes to make up for the loss of federal taxes and money. I doubt many are really interested in changing things though. So prepare for another week of money grabbing initiatives hidden behind disastrous messages of doom and destruction that can only be cured by more money. ",

If you get whole masses of people doing likewise, then it can have a positive impact. A big thing to do is to go vegetarian. The animal ag business is a major source of methane, a powerful GHG. Methane from animal flatulence is a major pollutant and does contribute significantly to the global warming problem. (Not to mention the abhorrent conditions the animals suffer through). If enough people went veg, this would help tremendously. Also, using land to grow crops versus anuimals is a better use of land as there is less energy loss to grow crops. It is more efficient and yields more kilograms per acre than raising meat does. Best thing to do is VOTE. Vote in politicians who will actually implement green technology, politicians who will get us off fossil fuels. Putting aside the problems of voter suppression, vote flipping, rigging, etc, people need to make their voices heard. This is how we get our voices heard. Vote in politicians who are fervently for green technology (that is, not paying lip service). ",

These are China (30%), India, USA, Russia and the European union, which produce about 2/3s of total world emissions. The efforts of small emitters (under 4%) will have little if any effect. Smaller emitters need to be willing to follow the lead of the big emitters. It's not an optimistic outlook, so we need to hope that world climate is self regulating. Consider that a warming earth has increased evaporation ( 71% of earth's surface is water), and this vapour rises into the atmosphere ( it's lighter than air), and as it rises it cools and condenses forming clouds and rain drops or snow flakes. The clouds then reflect more of the suns warming rays away from the earth, and enable rain to fall. This rain is cooler than the earth's surface, and has a cooling effect on the earth. Is that cooling and the extra reflection enough to counterbalance the heat absorbing tendencies of CO2. Might it be a self regulating system? ",

If the cause is human we have to understand exactly what it is and how it happens. All of this requires solid science. For the moment CO2 is being blamed. Why? because it is infrared active and it has been rising since the Ice Age began ending, increased further when the Little Ice Age ended which incidentally coincides with the beginning of the industrial revolution. There is some correlation but if you are a scientist you know that correlation is not causation. The increase in CO2 may be symptomatic of something, or a function of something else. Directly tying increased CO2 to increased temperatures is naive at best. It is not science. Neither is tying increased CO2 to the use of fossil fuels. What is needed is direct experimental proof that CO2 is a \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d so we can study and understand how it \u201ctraps heat\u201d. Until we have that direct experimental proof we have no business declaring CO2 to be a greenhouse gas, claiming it can trap heat, or be the cause of global warming. Time and time again I have asked for the solid experimental evidence that that proves CO2 causes warming and can trap heat and all I get is diffusion, strawman links or plain abuse. The simple fact is assertions are made about CO2 based on assumptions due to it being infrared active. Until there is experimental proof that CO2 can actively trap heat and provide any warming there is no point in trying to manipulate CO2 in the atmosphere. and if it is not CO2 then what is causing the climate to change., Summary: \u201cThe physics of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u201d Papers 1-3 The Deliberately False Greenhouse Gas CO2 Experiment | PSI Intl ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly the earth has survived considerable climate changes in the past. For instance after the Roman Warming when it was probably 2\u00b0C warmer than today, so warm Hannibal in 219BC was able to cross the European Alps with his army of elephants. He couldn't findt today it is not warm enough. Anyway after that it got so cold that thousands died of starvation as crops failed. It was also very cold when brown bears had to adapt in some regions and they became polar bears. The last 160 years it has warmed up slightly, about 0.8\u00b0C It is now cooling. New Little Ice Age Instead of Global Warming? by Dr. Theodor Landscheidt Schroeter Institute for Research in Cycles of Solar ActivityKlammerfelsweg 5, 93449 Waldmuenchen, Germany Abstract: Analysis of the sun's varying activity in the last two millennia indicates that contrary to the IPCC's speculation about man-made global warming as high as 5.8\u00b0 C within the next hundred years, a long period of cool climate with its coldest phase around 2030 is to be expected. It is shown that minima in the 80 to 90-year Gleissberg cycle of solar activity, coinciding with periods of cool climate on Earth, are consistently linked to an 83-year cycle in the change of the rotary force driving the sun's oscillatory motion about the centre of mass of the solar system. As the future course of this cycle and its amplitudes can be computed, it can be seen that the Gleissberg minimum around 2030 and another one around 2200 will be of the Maunder minimum type accompanied by severe cooling on Earth. This forecast should prove skillful as other long-range forecasts of climate phenomena, based on cycles in the sun's orbital motion, have turned out correct as for instance the prediction of the last three El Ni\u00f1os years before the respective event.

Uncontrolled speculative capitalism are part of challenge. The US public will not demand the level of change nor change their consumption levels until they are forced to by various calamitous events. Small car gas efficient sales have tanked and truck pickups and SUVS selling selling. They keep voting for climate science deniers and are apathetic about environmental rules roll backs that protect our clean air,water and reduce emissions. They reject science and live on emotion and insular tribalism. The fossil fuel folks in their quest for revenues are expanding extraction in more and more places then leveraging political power to allow them to Lock us in to burning more fossil fuel long after its truly economical. Granted transportation is 25 to 30 % of total oil usage globally. But it sets the tone and triggers more emissions growth. We are on track for close 50%,renewable energy by 2035 globally. Latest forecasts as published in Forbes and IEA and others. However electric generation is only 20 to 25 %,of the emission problem. We have to change transportation agriculture, and industrial sector. Coal must be gone asap but market control and vested foreign interests are resisting dropping coal A few bright spots China is backing off coal as they get their transmission line capacity built up. This allows them to turn on large amounts of wind and solar. Health concerns is closing down coal but have a ways to go. Also they turn on 8 or 10 nukes soon. Decreasing big coal. They will ramp.up Ev s faster so give China some credit UK and Scotland wind capacity is large and growing . They only use minimal coal plants less than 6 % of their capacity and UK has many coal less weeks where none is burned. I recognize them as they were the birthplace of steam by coal industrial revolution. All their mines closed now. Import very little. So UK has evolved we could learn from them but our arrogance and corrupted political system reduces our progress.we need faster action. They let go of past while US clings to myths and past. The 5 European oil Wind co coming to our East coast to develop up to 90,000 megawatts all along East coast. That kills off more coal etc. But 15 to 20 year development cycle So we losing TIME our enemy is limited time. No more analysis paralysis can be afforded as I see it. INDIA and Australia rising coal use in India case and Aussies love money fron coal exports while they build solar at home. Working both sides of street. The list of countries not changing is too long. So barring any wonder wand technology or enlightened political change in numerous countries I just dont see the brakes and reversal of global warming until major disruptions occur. By that time I believe irreversible damage will be done. Life will get harder. Hope I am wrong want the best for all. But Wishing and Hoping is not a Solution Regards peace ",

Three solutions to that are 1.) vastly increased energy efficiency, 2.) electrifying (nearly) everything, 3.) supply all energy with renewables, mostly wind water and solar, with storage and some hydrogen thrown in for longer term storage The rest are sustainable forestry, sustainable and organic farming, focusing on plant-based meals and protein, and a conservation mind-set, eliminating single-use items as far as possible and avoiding over-consumption. As others have pointed out, it is very hard to stop climate change, but we can try to limit catastrophic climate change and, ultimately, start to reverse it with carbon drawdown. However, the oceans act as a thermal flywheel, and today\u2019s rapid climate change reflects greenhouse gas levels of 20\u201330 years ago. We need to act rapidly and probably need to achieve an 80\u2013100% GHG emission reduction over the next 10 years.

Electric cars will be required within 10 years. Gasoline prices will rise and many areas will be blocked to cars.Stop eating red meat.Turn yards into nature preserves.

            "answer_text": "Please be patient when reading this answer as I think to answer it properly first the common assumptions need to be explored. Then I\u2019ll say what, given the little I know in the vast sea of humanity, where this seems to be leading as the best hope for success. The answer a person sees as valid to this varies widely and depends upon underlying assumptions about:- how fast infrastructural change can occur- how fast and widespread behavioural change is possible- whether growth and sustainability are compatible- technology\u2019s ability to help- the power and position taken of vested interests- the speed and impact of attempts at social upheaval(Sadly most of my sources are behind academic paywalls, so I\u2019ve generally left out references.) Tackling these one at a time with as minimal detail as possible: Infrastructural change - Views vary widely on what is a realistic rate of change given existing infrastructure (and what degree of change is necessary) and what the impact will be. To illustrate electric vehicles (EVs) are often touted as a great solution. They are a replacement that works largely within existing infrastructure, unlike light rail which whilst brilliant take years if not decades to plan and implement. (Most seem to place significant infrastructural changes taking 20\u201330 years.) There are no direct emissions when driving around EVs. But, and this isn\u2019t a small but - how much better an EV is depends upon how the electricity is generated and whether \u2018rebound effect\u2019 occurs, plus future approach. In NZ for instance, as electricity is dominated by hydropower and geothermal, (sadly there are still coal powered plants in NZ too), an EV makes a huge difference. So whilst EV is a clear winner and is estimated to roughly halve emissions (Electric Car Myth Buster \u2014 Well-To-Wheel Emissions) if we continue with population growth, car ownership growth (China, India), traffic density increase, and the emissions associated with cement for building more roads, it becomes clear that whilst a switch to EV is great, changing the car type alone is not a long-term answer without other changes. Large numbers will also need to change to different modes of transport and infrastructure to support this. This brings me on to behavioural change. Behavioural change - Getting people to change even one thing in the following list is notoriously hard: fly less, switch to non-meat diet, use reusable materials (plastic for instance uses oil in its production and produces plenty of emissions in its lifecycle), buy less, use a car less. [See also infrastructure.] However, once the general populace feels a new social norm is dominant i.e. widely accepted, many people adopt that behaviour through mimicry (e.g. person in front of you doesn\u2019t use a bag for 3 apples so you also don\u2019t), fear of exclusion (e.g. neighbours on both sides go solar so you do too), peer trend (e.g. not taking the lift is is a socially desirable attribute in the workplace) and so on. Getting someone to turn down a large steak because its carbon footprint is large is not easy. For clarity this applies as much to businesses and their behavioural change as much as individuals. The unspoken rules/priorities of a business - profit is the most important outcome, have shifted dramatically in some companies but they are still the minority. Many companies have goals of reducing their emissions per item or per plane seat, which whilst commendable, may not reduce the overall emissions by that company as the number of customers keep growing. This leads me to growth and sustainability. Growth and sustainability - whether growth / degrowth / agrowth is required for a sustainable human existence is debated. (There\u2019s articles that show the tight link between carbon emission reduction and sustainability strategies and philosphy, hence me suddenly switching to talking about sustainability.) Degrowth - a strategy of actively reducing economic growth. Given the years of focus on growth drummed into us this is seen as heretical by believers in capitalism and can prompt accusations of a socialist agenda. It raises though the very realistic issue that economic growth as currently achieved cannot be continued as we\u2019re literally running out of resources (e.g. global soil poverty, deforestation). Others believe agrowth - an approach to economies that ignores whether growth occurs or not (agnostic) is possible. Some believe growth can be \u2018decoupled\u2019 from resources - that we will find ways to meet the growth narrative through efficiencies, innovations etc. Whichever of these positions is held changes drastically whether the solution is seen as a fundamental change to society, a social realignment of some degree, or something that human ingenuity can solve. Which leads me onto many people\u2019s faith in technology. Technology - the appeal of thinking we can invent or design our way out of this mess is tangible. Current infrastructures, behaviour, and growth and sustainability are all theoretically possible if a technology comes along that can suck carbon emissions up and do something with them. For those who know the board game monopoly - this is the \u2018Get out of jail free\u2019 card. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the most popular technological angles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sadly after decades of investigation scaled CCS solutions that are energy efficient enough, and the lack of enough known geological locations suitable to store the massive amount of liquid carbon to make a dent in our emissions, is looking increasingly unlikely. Land use change - planting good ol\u2019 fashioned trees, still seems to be one of our best bets. Whilst the switch to renewables is lauded and is happening at an unprecedented rate it is still at current projections going to take far too long to keep us below 2 degrees, due to lobbying pressures from the business sector. Vested interests - Predominantly if not always, business support for emission reduction measures falls way behind public support. (Political support is country specific. It is questionable, in those where emission reduction is still in the political domain rather than legislated and depoliticised, how deep seated that political support is.) Vested interests want the transition to be as slow as practicable, as status quo is preferable. This does not mean these vested interests are not adapting in preparation for a more chaotic climate, in fact many are changing their business models to avoid stranded assets, whilst playing down climate urgency. Social upheaval - more recently a new climate lexicon has appeared \u2018climate emergency\u2019, \u2018climate justice\u2019 \u2018extinction rebellion\u2019. Youth activity is mounting. There are also arrests being made, an increase in voted in environmentally unfriendly governments for major nations (e.g. Brazil), and it has also been a very bumpy journey during COP24 (UN climate gathering) so far in Katowice, Poland. Whew. Hope this helps. After all that my money\u2019s on the people, I think an upheaval is required and there\u2019s enough unrepresentative \u2018democracies\u2019 for some big change to be forced through. Enough is enough. Make your decision where you will, I\u2019d love to hear other\u2019s opinions on this as it is in my mind perhaps the most important question on Quora. ",

All five ice ages we had in the past have been followed by global warming. When the greenhouse gases increase there will be global warming and climate changes. This is the behavior of our planetary eco system. When the same greenhouse gases are removed, the temperature plummets. However, the plant and animal species that perish during these climatic changes can\u2019t be reproduced. From that sense, global warming consequences on the living beings can\u2019t be reversed. What we should all be concerned is not the CO2 level or global temperature level, but how fast we get there. If the same CO2 is added over a thousand years, the effect will not be felt and most species adapt to it. But now we have added 1000GtCO2 in less than fifty years and our atmosphere is imbalanced. Again it is not the CO2 level but the \u201crate of change\u201d is what is of concern. If we stop adding CO2 will our atmosphere stabilize? You bet! That is exactly what we need now.

The biggest single source of excess carbon in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels, so burn less fossil fuels. On a personal level, that means using less private cars and more alternatives like public transport and bicycles. Using less electricity with LED lightbulbs and more efficient appliances. Buying more local produce and less food that has travelled long distances. ",

In the time scales that matter to us, climate change is irreversible without massive geo-engineering. Mankind has been throwing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the sky for more than a century. Some falls out but is replaced by ever increasing amounts put in. CO2 takes a very long time to fall out. What we can do is make climate change less bad by no longer adding to the greenhouse gases we put in. And by less bad I mean avoiding a future where billions if not everyone dies, which is where we are heading if current trends continue. ",

The equation is as follows: Input minus output equals accumulation We have reduced the output and the input has remained stable so the accumulation he is positive. Previously it has been pretty well balanced for the last couple of million years. The problem is we have made long-term changes in the atmosphere and that is likely to continue to block the output of energy back to outer space So we need to do creative things that we don\u2019t yet know how to do like increased output of energy to space By reflecting it back in spite of the atmosphere or some way to block the input.
