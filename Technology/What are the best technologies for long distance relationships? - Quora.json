            "answer_text": "My boyfriend and I were in a LDR for the whole summer. He was in the US while I was in Vietnam, so the time difference was really a bitch, but we made it work still. And here are what we did: Video calls. Skype/Facetime will be your best friends, because it's the only way to see each other face to face. Don't give your calls a time limit. Don't make it like those calls with your friends just to catch up on things then hang up. Leave it on as long as you can and watch each other do things. I loved watching my bf sleeping.Constant messaging. Send messages anytime you can and show him/her that you care. Don't be absent for too long. In case you have to, notify about it first so no one will have to wait. Embrace the little things. Ask about his/her day. Talk about what you do during the day. Say good morning/good night/I love you everyday. Find things that you can do together. You can read the same book, or go watch the same movie, then discuss with each other. My boyfriend and I made google docs and wrote to each other. I gotta say it was the most intimate thing I've ever done with anyone.  Gifts. Send each other stuffs. They don't necessarily have to be physical things. Use your talent. Play a song with your guitar, or sing, or draw a picture. Make something with love.These are the few tips that I found very useful. However, the most important thing is to trust, even when it seems like a dangerous thing to do. ",

            "answer_text": "I was in a LDR with my boyfriend for 2 years (Vietnam to England) and can vouch for everything Hoa Vu said, particularly Skype which was essential. Here are a few other bits of technology we used... 1. A private WordPress blog together and did little posts where we shared pictures, wrote creative writing prompts for the other to finish, picked a random question from a generator and both answered it... It was great because, with the 6/7 hour time difference, I could wake up in the morning and have a new post from him. It was like a little online scrapbook. 2. Couple: a messaging app for two people. You can draw together, share pictures... there's even a 'thumbkiss' function where you touch your screen and a thumb print comes up on theirs... If they touch it in the same place both your phones vibrate. Cheesy but sweet. 3. We always knew when we'd next see each other and had an online Countdown Timer as something to look forward to when we really missed each other. 4. And this one, less of a technology but definitely a tool for staying close: have a common goal. We trained for a marathon together and it was fun to make a Google spreadsheet and enter our training sessions together, and to be 'MapMyRun' buddies and to 'like' and comment on each other's workouts. This kind of thing, more than anything else, stopped our lives from feeling totally separate. ",
