            "answer_text": "Hi. There\u2019s no such thing as an atheist nor atheism. It\u2019s a word that is a contradiction. He\u2019s most likely an agnostic (but since he prayed at least once in a Falcon 1 launch, he\u2019s going in the direction of believing and loving Jesus/God but now he\u2019s more of an agnostic), waiting for evidence that\u2019ll suit him (he\u2019s most likely waiting for this type among many types of evidence: empirical evidence, whereby one or more of our 5 senses, actually experience Almighty God, like with Moses in the burning bush and approved catholic apparitions and vision like in the Divine Mercy with St. Faustina). It\u2019s logically impossible to be an atheist (note: there\u2019s not such thing as agnostic atheist, that\u2019s also contradiction, it\u2019s like it\u2019s either a 0 or a 1, unless you\u2019re quantum particle) because you\u2019d need to absolutely know everything in the cosmos (cosmos means if multi-verse exists, it\u2019s in the cosmos or the natural world, one half of all reality. The other half is above the natural world or supra- thus supernatural world. Both of these combined makes up our reality), to absolutely, 100% conclude and be absolutely certain that there is no God. It\u2019s impossible to do that for obvious reasons. The amount of energy you\u2019d need to traverse the whole universe to absolutely know everything about it, even if were\u2019 in the Type V civilization (where technology has been maxed out, no more technology can be created) must be unlimited and since the universe is expanding faster than light, then that makes it doubly even more impossible- and we\u2019re only talking about our universe. What if there are an infinite number of universes in the cosmos (the multi-verse which most likely does not exist). It\u2019s a better bet though to believe, says the mathematical conclusion (in narrative form) of Elon\u2019s fellow genius: Blaise Pascal. See you all in heaven. Keep working doing your best with faith (religion, like the Catholic Church), math & science. God bless, Revelation 21:4 ",

            "answer_text": "Elon Musk is highly objective. So much so his reasoning often defies Populist logic with statements like the one in billions chance that we\u2019re living in base reality. For this reason I suspect Musk will align himself not with Richard Dawkins as an atheist, but with Carl Sagan: \"An atheist has to know a lot more than I know. An atheist is someone who knows there is no god. By some definitions atheism is very stupid.\" So in answer to your question, no I don\u2019t think Elon Musk is religious. I like to think he practises Saganism. ",
