            "answer_text": "Sounds to me like the question might refer to \u201cquantitative\u201d (measurement-related) knowledge\u2026. It is unfortunate that the gathering of symbols and procedures that are typically bundled in \u201cmathematics\u201d are supposed to support our knowledge and skills in dealing with our environment with accuracy (exactness) and predictability (precision), with the assistance of helpful mental (abstract) objects, symbols and procedures. In that case, the disadvantages of not learning (knowing) the necessary ideas and skills could definitely be disastrous for persons and communities. Sorry if this answer is a little protracted (long), but it seems particularly necessary to address the short question. Good luck. ",

But, if you do not understand the basic ideas that underlie mathematics, such as the fact that it\u2019s possible to actually calculate certain things, or what underlies statistics, you will not be able to form valid opinions about just about anything in politics. Example issues: are black people discriminated against by police, is it possible for carbon dioxide to warm the earth, how safe is it to take off a covid mask, can all electricity be supplied by wind and solar power,\u2026 ",
