            "answer_text": "No. You can watch anything in 3D that has a 3D version on a 3D TV. Many TV manufacturers promote their \u201cauto 2D to 3D conversion\u201d but it\u2019s complete garbage, and will absolutely give you a headache and/or nausea after even a short while. The problem is most programs don\u2019t have any stereoscopic information to work off of. Because of that, any \u201cauto\u201d conversion is going to be massively broken and distorted. The only exception is sporting events. You\u2019ll notice that with most sporting events they can do \u201cinstant replays\u201d with circles under players that line up with the perspective of the field/court/rink, and the players occlude those circles. This is because the cameras are set at very specific positions, and at a very specific angle to the field of play. Because of this, anything moving on the court/field is fairly simple to play in depth at where it ends on the bottom (where the players feet are). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in most cases with modern 3D televisions. The newer 3DTVs have 2D to 3D realtime conversion built in as an option. Some implementations are better then others, but I\u2019ve seen some fairly compelling examples of this conversion and it\u2019s not bad. As the years go by, this will become better and better. LG passive 3D TVs are by far the best available on the market.  ",
