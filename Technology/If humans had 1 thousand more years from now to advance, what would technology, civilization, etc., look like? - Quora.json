            "answer_text": "No one can even comprehend what things will be like by then, or else the limits of our imagination is also the limits of technology. But tjen again, no one could have imagined were we ended up, from a thousand years ago. Heck we\u2019d be burned alive for being a which and using modern tech, or thrown into a cookoo house for hypothesizing modern tech. Things wouldn\u2019t be so rash nowadays, but the point is, that mankind has evolved so much in the past thousand years, heck, in the past hundred years, that a million years from now is unimaginable. Not only that but, we are developing tech at a faster rate each year, than ever. Just 50 years ago, ai was a joke, maybe it could play chess and win every time, but it had to be taught to do anything, and that was greatly limited. Now that our phones our faster than all large, non-super, computers. Heck, more advanced than what sent man to the moon. We are developing ai, that can learn by observation. A.I. that can develop other ai better than we can. Seriously, look it up. It will take a few years for our most advanced theoritical technology under development to become a reality, but 50 years from now, we will have self driving electric cars, ar glasses as slim as the ones on your face, perhaps even ar contact lenses, ai developing more advanced technology than ever, ai designing products for aesthetics appeal, and practicality, ai building its own stuff, micro robats aiding the fight against all disease and making us far more intelligent, solar roffing all the way, planes flown at faster speeds, withjust solar panels, quantum computing that significantly increases our cpu, colonies on Mars, perhaps everywhere else in the solar system also. Some of these are appearing on the markets already, while the rest won\u2019t be around for another 50\u2013100 years. But I assure you that if we don\u2019t destroy ourselves, then the limits of our imagination will become reality in just a thousand years. And a million years will be tech beyond our imagination. ",

            "answer_text": "Extremely hard to predict exactly, but probably so different from now, we could possibly not even comprehend it if it was shown to us. In Year 3018, the NanoRapture occured, converting the Entire Earth to processing crystals and uploading everybody as gods in a plethora of incredibly different and complex virtual worlds. Evil and suffering eradicated forever! Or not. Maybe we develop some tech so powerful and dangerous, it blows up in our face. Year 3018: \u201cYeah, my son, the 5th world war, about 400 years ago, that damned NanoBlast, was real bad. It ruined ALL the tech! 38 billions died, leaving only a few surviving millions. That threw us back right up to the primitive age!\u201d Or maybe some religion wins their great \u201cjihad\u201d, then bans a lot of technology in order to keep their control on the status-quo, so things end up much like today. So, who knows! ",
