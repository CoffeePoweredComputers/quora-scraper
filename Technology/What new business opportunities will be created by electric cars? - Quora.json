Sure there\u2019s charging stations, but, there are a 100 companies already in there and the tech is changing every few months and I\u2019m not kidding. You could form up for the charging station shakeout and get backing to buyout the ones who don\u2019t make it. Way better to define a related market that, in three years, will be defined enough to get funding. When you get a sea change like this EV turnover, there are all kinds of diffuse, but related activities that will, if properly addressed will become large markets that will grow for what? Twenty years? At the start, the Dodge Brothers didn\u2019t really make cars, they made parts/systems. Who knew about that when cars were just starting as hand built oddities? Smart phone cases are an example, but, barriers to entry are too low. Phone apps always drove me crazy because there were 2 million people building them and trying to get in. It\u2019s effective to be first into a market as you can control the dialogue on the product relative to pricing/packaging. All the followers dance to your tune. Of course you need to offer a sustainable model unlike Uber or Grubhub who rely on people to work for you\u2026.for $5 an hour\u2026.maybe. They are already on this, but, it\u2019s a good one if you\u2019re smart. Most EV companies won\u2019t be like Tesla, which is hanging in with being a tech company\u2026no, most EV companies are good at and committed to manufacturing and distributing their EV\u2019s. In my view, this already makes sense, but, there is stuff that these EV manufacturers will need to outsource as the world is changing and these products/services will be needed and really big firms will grow out of this demand. If you study and study and study? You\u2019ll figure it out. If you are lazy and ask me to tell you right here? Two truths will arise. You won\u2019t do it because lazy folks aren\u2019t ambitious enough and? You won\u2019t get it and just call me crazy. Like in 2003 in Palo Alto, California\u2026\u201dI\u2019m starting an electric car company.\u201d \u201cOh yeah? You\u2019re crazy.\u201d ",

Electric charging even today takes more time than refilling petrol (gas). So there could be a market for anything from coffee to back massages to Mars vacations while your car is charging.Metal/Component production: Copper, Lithium etc.Less obvious ones like Acoustic Research. Your battery car can theoretically be as noiseless as your mobile phone. But if your car suddenly went silent, most people would freak out. So there is research to ensure that electric engines produce \u201cengine-like\u201dnoise and re-assure the drivers and pedestrians.Electric Fire ExtinguishersEffigies of Elon Musk (to burn). When the world one day realizes that the carbon footprint for manufacturing electric cars is actually HIGHER than their gas counterparts. (See this: Tesla\u2019s Electric Cars Aren\u2019t as Green as You Might Think). But then, like the George Bush re-election, it will be too late",
