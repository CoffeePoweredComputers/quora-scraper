            "answer_text": "I\u2019d try a wonderful system that was tough to me back when I was a kid. It may be hard at first. But with practice it could get much easier. It\u2019s called taking. Don\u2019t let it scare you. It used to be quite popular. It had advantages over texting. With just the tone of the voice you could express anger, excitement, happiness, Joy fear, and much more. With most it was just a way to communicate, but with some talking was an art. The second best one, and this will though you for a punch. Was writing on a piece of paper, instead of you text box. It never needed recharging and was good for thousands of words without getting an ERROR message. All it toke was a paper and pen or pencil. What was cool about it is you could put a hand drawn simile face at the end. New to it, it\u2019s not hard look at the letters on your cell phone and try to copy them onto paper with time you will be able to form words. So with a little practice you could be just like it was in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s talking and writing. For the more advance there was something else called books it was not located on your cell phone or tablet, but on shelf's they even had what was called a library for Those that wanted to extend their reading power. I\u2019m sure with all that old stuff it wouldn\u2019t be to bad around here. Lets see what others think of this. ",

            "answer_text": "In recent days, I am preparing for the Business English Test,sometimes I just feel puzzled by some problems such as,listening comprehension,reading comprehension and particularly my oral English.For the last one ,I have no choice but to date with my partner to practice talking about the topics on business and developing the ability to think independently.Every time we feel embarrassed when we can't work out in English what we think in Chinese thinking style,so the process seems to be pretty hard for me.From what I say above,face-to-face communications attach great importance to daily interaction,because of the lack of the ability,we are not unable to express our true feelings in the deep of heart,which impedes effective communication between us and others.Maybe every of us has an wonderful memory in the primitive stage,there are no mobile phones,no personal computers,no Internet but the fixed phone and it occurs us the existence of it only when something important happens and we don't have to handle it.But now,high-tech brings great convenience meanwhile causes the indifference among humans,which is not what we expect. The warmth between people makes we happy while the coldness also makes cold. If time permits,we can make a date with our friends to chat with a coffee nearby our house,expand our standing for some topic,however what is the most important for me is to run on the playground,letting the sweat out,then I will tell my friend something about the boy I loved,my long-leg-dad,my serious mom and other trivial things that make me happy or sad.At that time I can enjoy the feeling of releasing myself and the happiness of true human communication.
