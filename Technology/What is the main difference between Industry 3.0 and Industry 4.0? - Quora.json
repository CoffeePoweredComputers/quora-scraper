            "answer_text": "By the name it can be understood that Industry 4.0 is the fourth industrial revolution which is an ongoing transformation in the industrial sector. To understand the difference between the I 3.0 and I 4.0 it is essential to understand what changes were introduced in each of the revolutions which the Industry underwent previously: Industry 1.0: Industry 1.0 refers to the mechanization of work which our ancestors used to perform manually. Thus, it was after the introduction of steam which made the mechanization of work possible. E.g. Weaving Loom etc.Industry 2.0: Industry 2.0 is the transformation which was brought about by the introduction of electricity in the various processes. This made the use of assembly lines possible. The first electric assembly line was built in 1870.Industry 3.0: Now industry 3.0 was a huge leap ahead wherein the advent of computer and automation ruled the industrial scene. It was during this period of transformation era where more and more robots were used in to the processes to perform the tasks which were performed by humans. E.g. Use of Programmable Logic Controllers, Robots etc.Industry 4.0: The fourth era of industry is the era of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). CPS comprises of smart machines, storage systems and production facilities capable of autonomously exchange information, triggering actions and control each other independently. This exchange of information is done by the Industrial Internet of things (IIOT) in which thousands of sensors work real time and transfer the data to a local server or a cloud server. Here the analysis of the data is carried out by developing predictive models which help the organization to anticipate some irregularities in the processes or systems so that action can be taken well in advance, as opposed to taking action when the process or system is broken down. This is call Predictive Maintenance, taking the required actions in advance is made possible help of the data which is captured by the sensors.This data is very huge and termed as Big Data. The data analysis helps the industries not only to maintain the processes but also to improve manufacturing processes, material usage, supply chain and life cycle management of the product.Difference between I3 and I4: To put in simple words the basic difference being that the machines work autonomously without the intervention of a human in Industry 4.0. Whereas in the industry 3.0 the machines are only automatized. For example: Consider a CNC Milling machine, if the machine is in the era of Industry 3.0, the tool changes can be done automatically but the speed at which the spindle should run is to be observed by the operator and the corrections should be made by him. Similarly if the machine is in the Industrie 4.0 the tool changes are automatic at the same time the spindle speeds and all other parameters essential to carry out the process are recorded by the hundreds of sensors present in the machine and the optimum settings are done on its own based on the large amount of data there is to compare and optimize the process.HOPE THIS ANSWERS THE QUESTION.

            "answer_text": "Industry 4.0 has emerged as one of the most popular technologies in recent times.. To know the main difference between Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0, we must know all the industrial revolution starting from industry 1.0, industry 2.0, industry 3.0 and industry 4.0. Industry 1.0: It started around 1784, where people used Steam and Water power set up and operate all industrial operation.Industry 2.0: This was then the most popular one, where Industries started to use Electrical Power with assembly lines. This was around the 1870s. One of the biggest advantage there was the Mass production of products was possible via Industry 2.0.Industry 3.0: Who can forget the computerization happened around 1969 onwards. It was a massive revolution as the automation first came into play. Here Computer and IT solutions came up as a huge boost for industry automation and continue to rule for almost half a century.Industry 4.0: Industry 4.0 is the 4th industrial revolution where the use of Sensors, Cloud Computing, Blockchain, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Business Analyst and Business process Automation are integrated to make it happen. And we can say we are going to witness the massive use of Internet Connectivity in every Aspect of Industry 4.0.The main difference between industry 3.0 and industry 4.0 is the degree of automation. Industry 3.0 used to support automation but with human intervention. On the other hand industry, 4.0 depends on the concept of CPS(Cyber-Physical System). This means the machines can interact with each other, collect data, monitor cameras and all other sensors without human intervention. So we may further say that The Industry 4.0 supports the concept of Smart Machines and Smart Factory where the main feature is Industry Automation. Also unlike Industry 3.0, Industry 4.0 uses the IIoT or Industrial IoT concept where hundreds of sensors work together and send/collect data over Cloud to a Server which can be accessed by the End User in the most effective manner. Qmansys Infosolution is providing the most upgraded and updated solution for industry 4.0 and Digital Transformation to all the Industry and Corporate clients. Starting from Small MSME company to a Big MNC Qmansys Infosolutions has everything for everyone. ",

The term was coined in 2011 to represent the role that cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, and IIoT (industrial internet of things) will have on manufacturing processes. This technology\u2019s impacts include: InteroperabilityDecentralization of informationReal-time data collectionHeightened flexibilityAs such, the difference between Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0 is the presence of new interconnected technologies in plant operations. A brief history of industry  To explore this further, let\u2019s look at historical industrial revolutions: 1st industrial revolution \u2013 Steam and water power are used to mechanize production2nd industrial revolution \u2013 Electricity allows for mass production with assembly lines3rd industrial revolution \u2013 IT and computer technology are used to automate processes4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) \u2013 Enhancing automation and connectivity with CPSWe\u2019ve basically followed a sequence of increased automation, and the final development (which is still underway) takes that automation to a whole new level by making use of big data. What is the difference between Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0? In Industry 3.0, we automate processes using logic processors and information technology. These processes often operate largely without human interference, but there is still a human aspect behind it. Where Industry 4.0 comes in is with the availability and use of vast quantities of data on the production floor. For an example of the old way (Industry 3.0), take a CNC machine: while largely automated, it still needs input from a human controller. The process is automated based on human input, not by data. Under Industry 4.0, that same CNC machine would not only be able to follow set programming parameters, but also use data to streamline production processes.

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re in the midst of a vital transformation around the way we manufacture products thanks to the digitization of manufacturing. This transformation is so riveting that it is being called Industry 4.0 to represent the fourth revolution that is happening in the manufacturing sector. Even though some consider Industry 4.0 as solely a marketing buzzword, transformations are occurring in manufacturing that deserves recognition. Industry 4.0 is the new phase of the industrial revolution that focuses primarily on machine learning, fuelled by real-time data monitoring and processing, interconnectivity between machines and computers in the autonomous systems. Some refer Industry 4.0 as IIoT( industrial internet of things) or smart manufacturing. Companies face formidable challenges while adapting to new technologies. To build and sustain a lead in the race to full execution, they need to expand and increase their practical knowledge about digital technologies and the related use cases\u2014and then develop and implement customized digital manufacturing procedures. While several companies might still be in denial about how Industry 4.0 could change their business or are coping to find the expertise or knowledge to know how to best adapt, several others are implementing changes today and preparing for a future where smart machines improve their business. Every organization is operating for different prospects for several industry segments in various ways with a different culture and international standards. But all of them face the same challenges i.e., improving production quality, monitoring and processing real-time data of the production. In Industry 4.0 manufacturing units partners with physical production and operations including smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better-connected ecosystem for companies that focuses on manufacturing and supply chain management. Industry 4.0 is not only using new machines and new technologies. It is about using the correct technology to improve efficiency and revolutionizing the way the entire business operates and grows. So how this 4.0 Evolved? It all started in the 1700s. Earlier most of the work was either carried out by animals or by humans. In the late 1700s, human beings started focusing on machines, this commenced the Era of Industrial Revolution. This revolution is categorized into four periods such as industry 1.0 to industry 4.0  So how this 4.0 Evolved? It all started in the 1700s. Earlier most of the work was either carried out by animals or by humans. In the late 1700s, human beings started focusing on machines, this commenced the Era of Industrial Revolution. This revolution is categorized into four periods such as industry 1.0 to industry 4.0  Industry1.0 It is assumed that it happened somewhere in the late 1700s. During this period people started optimizing manual labor and animals to employ some kind of machine to do the same work in a lesser period. The water steamed engines were developed to complete these needs and from here the industrial era roused. Industry 2.0 It all started in the early 20th century. We learned to mine and started using steel. Also, learned to invent and distribute electricity. People started using electricity for daily work and in factories. This increased the efficiency of the manufacturing processes. Here the assembly line concept was introduced to boost productivity. Industry 3.0 In the mid of the 20th century, the industrial world was progressing at its maximum pace, and almost every day something new was invented. In this era, the world of manufacturing was incorporating these innovations in the machines. New electronics and computer-based technologies started evolving. The place of electric-mechanical machines was taken by computer-operated machines which were far more efficient and time-saving than the normal electric operated machines. Industry 4.0 In the previous revolutions, we observed that machines operating on steam-powered engines were replaced by electric machines and later it got replaced by automatic computer-operated machines that interacted with each other to decide the next course of action. Following is the image which introduces each industrial revolution. ",

The current technology solutions in automation establish a predefined hierarchy where the connectivity levels (inside a factory) are already predefined, from the sensor that measures the process state, to the software used at the highest levels of decision-making (e.g. for the business planning or logistics). However, Industry 4.0 vision establishes a hyper-connectivity that goes beyond the factory walls and where production means interact not only with the factory environment itself but along the value chain to which customers, suppliers, logistics etc. belong to.

Numerous enormous Indian organizations of their particular divisions are as of now receiving rewards of Industry 4.0 which are: The diminished requirement for incompetent work Higher productivity and adequacy through computerizationSmoother business measuresShrewd assembling measureDiminished danger of assembling issuesMajor Difference In Industry 3.0, we mechanize measures utilizing rationale processors and data innovation. These cycles regularly work generally without human obstruction, however, there is as yet a human angle behind it. Where Industry 4.0 comes in is with the accessibility and utilization of tremendous amounts of information on the creation floor. For a case of the old way (Industry 3.0), take a CNC machine: while to a great extent mechanized, it actually needs contribution from a human regulator. The cycle is robotized dependent on human information, not by information. Under Industry 4.0, that equivalent CNC machine would not exclusively have the option to follow set programming boundaries, yet in addition use information to smooth out creation measures. ",
