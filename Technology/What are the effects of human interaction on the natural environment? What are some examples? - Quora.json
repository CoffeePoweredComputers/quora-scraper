            "answer_text": "Our biggest problem is the burgeoning sapien uncontrolled population which has a main affect on ecosystems and habitat loss, which is the number one symptom which also leads to wildlife extinctions. This in a nut shell! But: This is a very similar question to one which I have already answered; Why are man-made effects on the environment considered unnatural and undesired, e.g. extinction of species or global warming?  Lars Hildebrandt, Student of Life at Natural Resources Management (1980-present) Answered Jul 17 There are some really good answers below, that explain a lot, so I will keep this real simple.>Man made effects on the environment are happening at an extremely fast pace.>Habitat Loss due to the burgeoning Homo sapien population expansion and all it entails; Habitat loss*, climate change, air and water pollution, over-hunting (past and present), invasive species, all are an assault on natural ecosystems. Habit Loss is THE most important symptom of sapiens burgeoning population.>Extinction; \u201cIt's frightening but true: Our planet is now in the midst of its sixth mass extinction of plants and animals \u2014 the sixth wave of extinctions in the past half-billion years. We're currently experiencing the worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.\u201d The Extinction Crisis>Diversity of life is the key to healthy ecosystems. As is the robustness (size matters), of such ecosystems.>The Speed of habitat loss, of changed ecosystems, of pollution, of climate change, does not allow for natural evolution of many species before extinction. That being said; there will be species that enjoy the man made habitat; raccoons, coyotes, cockroaches, mice, rats, chickens, sheep, snow geese, Canada geese, deer in rural areas, all are enjoying a population boom due to mans activities. There are always winners and losers; but in a man made world, there are far more losers.Recap: Cause of all of man made problems; burgeoning sapien population.Think Solutions.;>peaceful lowering or stabilizing sapien populations. What does this entail and how could it be conducted? World agreed upon laws, based on population densities, similar to what China had to do? One-child policy - Wikipedia>Address climate change, reduce sapien land use, better cities, better agriculture (*with less land use), less pollution, better green technology. Shalom! ",

Hey we are only chemicals in motion fizzing about, doing what nature forces us to do. I dont know why nature wants me to drink so much but hey it would not have given me chemical predispotion to do that if not with its blessing. right? ",
