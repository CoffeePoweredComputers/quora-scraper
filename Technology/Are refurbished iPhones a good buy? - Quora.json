            "answer_text": "First, let's distinguished between \"refurbished\" and \"used.\" If an iPhone was returned just after it was purchased, then re-sold, it is \"refurbished.\" Refurbished iPhones usually come with a factory new warranty. If someone used the phone for a year or two and then wiped it to factory defaults it is used. Even if that iPhone is being sold by someone claiming to be an authorized dealer (they may or may not be), it is still used, not refurbished. With that out of the way, yes, by all means, a refurbished iPhone is a great buy. Here's why: Refurbished phones were either returned by the original purchaser, or, in some cases, floor models. People return iPhones for a variety of reasons, but there is usually nothing wrong with the unit. Sometimes they just want a bigger model (maybe more storage, or perhaps a 6+ instead of a 6). Other times maybe something was defective about the unit and Apple swapped it out. In the case of the latter, Apple is going to swap out the defective part and test the unit thoroughly before reselling it. Even with the ones that weren't defective, Apple is still going to test the unit just to make sure it is restored to factory defaults. So in many ways, you are less likely to get a defective unit when you buy a refurbished iPhone. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say\u2026 yes? But hesitantly. If you can afford a brand new phone, do that. If you\u2019re a broke college student like me and you have the same magical ability to break everything you touch, this might be a good option for you. I bought my phone certified refurbished by Apple somewhere around January 2018. Looked great, and I got it for way cheaper than I would\u2019ve paid for a new phone, probably about a $100 difference. No physical imperfections, brand new battery, couldn\u2019t tell it had ever been used, which is the whole point of being refurbished. But then I discovered something was wrong with the camera\u2019s flash. I guess it wasn\u2019t picked up on when it was going through testing. Any photos taken with flash get really strangely washed out. I have never seen this happen with any other iPhone SE.  Not great. And then when I put my SIM card in for the first time, the entire phone froze up and started acting weird. The person at the T-Mobile store shook his head and said he\u2019d never seen an iPhone do that before. I hard reset it and it fixed the issue, but that was weird. And then there\u2019s the issue where sometimes my phone refuses to unlock and I have to turn the screen on and off again. And yes, I\u2019ve checked. It\u2019s definitely been refurbished by Apple and not a third party. I guess I just got unlucky? Anyway, despite that, I still recommend it. I got a great phone for a great price from a high-end phone brand. Lower-end Samsungs have never worked out for me and buying a great phone from a sketchy Chinese company also didn\u2019t work out too well so buying a refurbished iPhone was a good way to stay within my $200 budget while also buying a phone with good specs from a trusted brand.

            "answer_text": "A refurbished phone is not like a normal second-hand phone. It may have been returned by a customer for having a fault that the manufacturer has then repaired and sold it on as a refurb. The customer may have sold it back, so they can upgrade. Or if you're really lucky, they may simply have changed their minds and returned it unused, in which case you'll essentially have a brand new phone but for less. Before it's sold on, it will undergo a process of diagnostics, and ensure it is up to a certain standard. Then they will sell it to you, although probably without the standard box or accessories you get with a new handset. Not all manufacturers sell refurbished phones but brands like \u2018togofogo\u2019, \u2018yaantra\u2019, and \u2018hyperXchange\u2019 or marketplaces like \u20182GUD\u2019 and \u2018Amazon renewed\u2019 will have a similarly high standard of refurbishment'. Refurbished iPhones are definitely a good buy as: It's cheaper. A lot cheaper. A refurbished phone can save you hundreds of rupees. It's been professionally checked and repaired, unlike a typical second-hand phone. There will be a warranty period (although it's important to check how long). Most marketplaces like 2GUD and Amazon renewed have a 6 months warranty plan whereas brands like Yaantra have 12 months warranty and hyperXchange has 12 months Replacement Warranty program. As well as extensive testing, the company has to wipe any data left by the previous owner or risk falling foul of the Data Protection Act. ",

            "answer_text": "Refurbished phones account for a small fraction of industry sales. But they can be a great option for anyone looking for significant savings, especially these days when the price of a new model can easily exceed $1,000. On Apple\u2019s website, for example, you can purchase a refurbished iPhone 7 Plus for $470. A new 7 Plus costs $570. Samsung offers a refurbished Galaxy S7 for $350, which is about $120 less than you\u2019d pay for a brand-new one. And according to a spring 2018 survey, Consumer Reports members have been generally satisfied with purchases like those, not to mention their overall shopping experience. In fact, 67 percent of the refurbished iphone owners they surveyed said they had no complaints. That\u2019s just a hair less than the 69 percent of new smartphone owners who said the same thing. Before you buy a refurbished phone, though, you may need to do a little extra homework. Here\u2019s what you need to keep in mind. Know What You\u2019re BuyingMake Sure You\u2019re ProtectedAsk About the Returns PolicyWhere are the best places to pick up a refurbished iPhone? Apple Refurbished Store:There is no other store well-suited than the legit manufacturers of the real products. After getting some complaints in the models of the phone about manufacturing defects, Apple itself decides to recondition the products and sell them as refurbished ones. Jem Jem :One of the leading and renowned websites selling refurbished products is Jem Jem. One of the main reasons Jem Jem is flourishing is the quality and variety of products they offer. As the website is only dedicated to refurbished products, all products available there go through a thorough testing process. The product comes with a 90-day warranty and 30-day return policy if the product is not up-to-mark. ",

If you want to get iPhone 6, 7 & 8 without paying full price, then buying a used or refurbished iPhone may be the best for you.. Refurbished iPhones usually come with a factory new warranty. Even if that apple iPhone is being sold by someone claiming to be an authorized dealer (they may or may not be), it is still used, not refurbished. With that out of the way, yes, by all means, a refurbished iPhone is a good buy.  ",
