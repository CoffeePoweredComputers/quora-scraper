            "answer_text": "In sublimation printing, both solvent and eco-solvent inks are used. In sublimation printing heat is used to transfer dye on to materials like paper, fabric, plastic and cards. As the dye makes a transition between the solid and gaseous states without going through the liquid phase, this type of printing is called as sublimation printing. It is a process in which heat and pressure are applied to a solid and that turns into gas. This happens through an endothermic process without passing through the liquid phase. Solvent inks are oil-based as they hold the pigment and resin together. They are waterproof, fade resistant and have resistance towards abrasion. It is excellent for long-term outdoor banners and vinyl. Printers should be regularly cleaned when this type of ink is used. Eco-solvent inks are obtained from refined mineral oil. It is a low or a light-solvent ink. This ink can be used to print on uncoated substrates and it can take a long time to print. Eco-solvent inks deliver high-quality printing but are costlier than solvent inks. ",

            "answer_text": " Sublimation Ink Sublimation ink is mostly made of woven dyestuffs. Disperse dyes because of its saturated color and good weather resistance, so in the textile printing and dyeing has a wide range of applications, so far still one of the printing and dyeing industry, one of the main raw materials. Traditional textile printing and dyeing industry using the dispersion of pigment dyeing process has a serious environmental pollution problems, and not suitable for small batch production.Sublimation ink is mostly made of woven dyestuffs. Eco-solvent Ink Eco-solvent inks were developed as a more used friendly alternative to the strong solvent inks for shops that don\u2019t print every day. These light solvent inks, which utilize a mineral oil as a vehicle, are less likely to clog than the fast drying strong solvent inks and require less maintenance. For the most part, you can print on the same types of media that you use for the solvent inks. There are a variety of ink sets with expanded ranges of color that are available in the eco-solvent category. These pigments inks provide good durability for outdoor applications, such as vehicle graphics.and good image reproduction for indoor applications, such as P.O.P displays, trade show and museum graphics. The downside of these inks is that they don\u2019t dry as fast as the solvent. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually speaking, people use both solvent ink and eco-solvent ink in sublimation printing. The deciding factor here is the type of object on which you are printing and its usage. Eco-solvent inks are basically color suspended in a biodegradable solvent. This solvent reacts to heat and water and might wear off if exposed to them. They are really costly as the quality of the print is too damn high while using an eco-solvent ink. Solvent ink, on the other hand, is hard and non-bio degradable. The quality of the print is comparatively lesser than that of eco-solvent ink. But the price of solvent ink is cheap. This is the major difference between these two inks. Eco-solvent inks are intended for objects that are used indoors and solvent inks are for outdoor purposes. So to decide between a solvent ink and an eco-solvent ink, one must be clear about the surface of the object to be printed and the purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "Sublimation Printing is a printing process that converts the solid dyes into a gas state without forming the liquid stage. There are basically two methods of printing -direct and transfer. In the transfer method, the image is printed on a transfer paper and later sublimating it on to a polyester product such as textiles. In the Direct method, the image is printed straight to the fabric and then sublimated without the help of a paper. In this printing process, solvent and eco-solvent inks are mainly used. But based on the usage, you can prefer the ink. The printers that print using the eco-solvent ink are mainly for the in-home purpose. The solvent ink is mainly used in the large industrial inkjet printers. ",
