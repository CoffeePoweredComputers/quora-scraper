            "answer_text": " Here are some near-term technological advancements we can expect to see in the next few years: Fusion Energy: There\u2019s a lot of progress being made in fusion research. It\u2019s a lot more powerful & much cleaner than fission energy, but also a lot harder to initiate & control. Still, solid research is being done in the academic world along with startups like Tri-Alpha Energy that could make it a reality by around 2040.Cryptocurrency: Transmitting money in the USA is easy - but when it comes to international transactions, there are lots of delays & bank markups. I think globalization is one of many trends pushing the development of next-generation cryptocurrencies like Libra. Another driving force is a growing public desire for data privacy.Medical Wearables: Elderly people are 8.5% of today\u2019s population - by 2050 they\u2019ll be 17%. People are living longer, and they\u2019re living more independently - which creates a massive market for medical wearables like the Apple Watch that can help them stay safe. In a few years, we\u2019ll see a lot more devices like this, and they\u2019ll offer a lot more health monitoring functionality.Quantum Computing: This technology is already here, it\u2019s still just very rudimentary. Nonetheless, IBM just unveiled the Q System One, which all online access to a real quantum computer using a timesharing model similar in some ways to mainframe computing in the 1970\u2019s. Expect quantum computing to continue improving, as Moore\u2019s Law is dead in traditional semiconductor design.Better Voice Recognition: Wearables like the Apple Watch are reaching the minimum physical limits for buttons & screens to control them. One solution has been pairing them with a smartphone - another is better voice recognition systems that enable these products to be sold & used as standalones.Next-Gen Smartphone Cameras: Today\u2019s iPhone has two rear cameras, next year\u2019s model may have three in a cluster. This is an expensive, inelegant solution by manufacturers that pride themselves on design. Expect to see alternative solutions like Alvarez Zoom lens technology by companies like Dynaoptics replace traditional lens systems in the future.Electric Cars: Tesla, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, and others are already here, and in 2019 we\u2019ll see Audi, Mercedes, Mini, BMW, Porsche, Kia and Volvo all release electric vehicles.Passenger Drones: Smartphones and now electric vehicles are driving advances in battery technology that make enable larger drones with longer flight times. Expect today\u2019s camera drones to begin carrying cargo soon - and people not long after that.",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A! Technology has without doubt an impact on society. As a matter of fact, we experience this effect in our daily lives. It has an effect on the growth of the economy, our culture and our living standards. It is however important to note that the benefits are a double-edged sword with some being detrimental and other being beneficial. One should be very careful and get to know how the effects on society get to effect the business activities and operations. Positive impact of technology: Technology impacts on our daily lives. Our environments are all so full of technology to the point that most of the time we take it for granted and never actually notice the level of impact that it has on us until when we have no telephone, transport, water or electricity. Advancements in technology have greatly increased our living standards. Despite the fact that we are currently experiencing very high inflation rates and the rates of unemployment are very high, generally, people are feeding better, are dressing better and are as a matter of fact living more comfortable lives. Technology also has a great impact on all the fundamental aspects of all our cultures including laws and how they are enforced, language, art, health care, mobility, education and religion. For instance the great technological improvements in health care have given a chance to doctors to treat their patients in an environment that is virtual through the use of mediums such as video conferencing which has also greatly benefited the legal environment as it allows the judges to still listen to the cases of hard core criminals who cannot be allowed to get into the court rooms due to security reasons. Negative impacts of technology: With every advancement that is made in the technological world, creative destruction results. For example, television impacts negatively on the movies and synthetic fibers impact the cotton fibers negatively. The coming in of new types of technology also results in a negative impact on the growth of the economy at times; television at times consumes all the productive hours that a man has in a day. Every new form of technology gets into the market together with long term consequences that are most of the time not foreseeable. For instance is there really a justification for nations coming up with bombs, nuclear weapons and missiles to maintain security? Conclusion: Despite the fact that we cannot really ignore that there are a number of ways in which technology negatively impacts our society, for the better part it has greatly helped to make out lives better. Technology has greatly helped us to become more efficient thus increasing our productivity. It has also helped us a great deal to be able to save on many resources such as time and money and these are great benefits that cannot be ignored. It has also worked well in bringing unity into the world by turning it into a global village which has in turn helped people to more easily overcome their cultural, racial and continental barriers.

            "answer_text": "How are you defining \"new\"?  If you mean technologies that already exist but haven't been fully deployed, I think it's cameras, real-time streaming, and LED displays.  Cameras plus LEDs have the ability to make many objects effectively invisible, by recording on one side and then real-time broadcasting on the other.  Near-term applications include military and construction, but such buildings will also create universal record-keeping of all activities near any cameras.  As the costs of cameras continues to fall, that means a global record-keeping the likes of which we've never seen.  We know that expectations of privacy have declined in the younger generation due to exposure to the mobile Internet; a generation from now, even those norms will seem quaint.   If you mean technologies that don't really fully exist, or exist only in their early stages, clearly genomic medicine is in its very earliest stages.  This technology will cure cancer when all is said and done.  As I think you know, one of my portfolio companies is using medical genomics right now to help with diagnostics and also drug development.  (See MedGenome - Clinical Genomics for India).  The dark side of genomics was fictionalized in Gattaca (1997), and some of those applications (for discrimination) could yet become real.  We're only touching the surface of this technology and how it might be used.   One step further out from this is the intersection of computing and biotechnology and robotics in the emerging field of neural prosthetics.  We now have the ability to attach sensors to various parts of the human brain and get the brain to adapt to new sensations and manipulate new objects.  Michio Kaku has written about how we will be able to use our minds to control superconducting materials via interfaces in our contact lenses -- essentially, moving objects with our minds in ways that would look like telekinesis to someone from even just a few decades ago.  We can wear jackets that allow our brains to learn to sense when people are talking about us.  This, combined with genetic engineering, starts to get us on the path toward what Kurzweil described as the \"singularity\" where human / machine co-evolution starts accelerating so dramatically that we can't really see what's on the other side.

            "answer_text": "Graphene will be a massive game changer once we commercialize production. It is the strongest material known and 100 times stronger than steel and it is also very conductive, it will lead to extremely high performance computers which are much smaller than anything we have now, it will also be a game changer for batteries because Graphene batteries will not progressively deteriorate with every charge and can hold 10 times or more capacity compared to the lithium batteries we use now meaning computers and phones could potentially last several weeks between charges, Graphene is also one of the lightest materials known, to get this in perspective if you compare 1 square metre of Graphene with a square meter of paper the paper is around 1000 times heavier. Currently we are not sure exactly how to exploit Graphene's unique characteristics, but it looks likely we can combine it with composites and plastics to create materials vastly superior to anything we have now. Two more to watch are AI which could be at or approaching human level in 10 years and also without a doubt gene therapies which will revolutionise medicine. ",

They will have their own wants or desire for the next technology that will be significant to its people. For example, A society in Nigeria has no good roads, no pipe borne water supply and electricity, they lack transportation system, what do u think their immediate needs are? People that still use well or go to the stream to get water, their next significant technology will be seeing water running in their homes and kitchen from taps and showers and they will love to develop stations that will generate electricity for the town. So issues of technology is relative, you can narrow your question by asking which of the society in particular a technology will change them because different countries and states have different challenges and their next deal in innovation will be technology that will solve their immediate needs.

            "answer_text": "Realizing that FECAL DUST in hospitals could be a cause of HA Infections,2. the best thing is the use of the $14 VERTICAL jet bidet, instead of t. paper, for comfort, dignity, 100% cleaning, even on hemorrhoid presence, time sparing, ecology, water economy and mainly hygiene ( it reduces: fecal dust and so UTI, HA Infection, antibiotic resistant microbes, as MRSA etc).Related facts : \u201c99.000 DEATHS EACH YEAR IN USA FROM HA INFECTION. ABOUT THE SAME IS THE CONDITION IN EUROPE. A SIMPLE TEST COULD REDUCE THOSE HAI RATES. WHY CDC OR SOME OTHER HEALTH CARE INSTITUDE DOES NOT DO IT? WHAT DOES IT STOP THEM? Years before, dr Semmelweis saved millions of people since, by doing this simple test: In few words (to shorten the whole story), in order to show the need of hand sanitization in hospitals, he selected two similar clinics. In first one, drs and other staff were sanitizing their hands, while in the other, following the then usual practice, were not. The results are known. The death rates were much less in the first clinic. It is worth noting that Semmelweis's hypothesis, that there was only one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest. Semmelweis was outraged by the indifference of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European drs at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, believed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly twenty years after his breakthrough, he was committed to an asylum. Now, let return to our contemporary problem of high HAI rates. The causes may be many. But it seems one is more prominent: The human FECAL DUST in hospital wards. \u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left after wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through hair is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a 4-6 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density in the wards is a one more factor that increases their chance of developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers. CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust\u2019s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative. That means that nobody had done any relative research work, as anybody could see in internet. The test, I am suggesting is simply a repetition of about dr Semmelweis\u2019s method: a hospital, that takes all the specials measures to prevent human fecal dust forming and then a comparison is made on its HA Infection rates with those of other hospitals, in which no special care is taken. If the answer is positive, imposing those measures would naturally be the next step to all hospitals. On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong and very suspicious reasons, for somebody to ignore so many deaths, suffering and high hospital function cost.
