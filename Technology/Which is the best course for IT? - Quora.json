It includes:- Search Engine Optimization (SEO)Search Engine Marketing (SEM)Social Media Marketing (SMM)Email Marketing (EM)Inbound Marketing (IM)Web Analytics (WA)Other modules include Affiliate marketing, Facebook marketing, mobile app marketing.. But the 6 above are considered to be core modules.. It would take around 12\u201315 hrs for each module.. And you can choose any one or any combinations of modules or all for that matter..

            "answer_text": "There is no one best IT field. It all depends on what interests you. E.g., some find security exciting, others find it boring or, at best, a necessary evil. Some might find embedded real time, safety critical control systems just the ticket, while others might be more interested in databases, AI or robotics. There are obvious overlaps here. E.g., database applications often involve real time transactions update and safety critical elements, such as those used in medical physics. Yet others might be interested in the fundamentals of computing itself, e.g. computability and related fields. All this is before we get to maintenance and support, always vital in any complex system and usually overlooked: someone has to keep the hardware running, refactor code, hunt bugs, test and so forth. In short, you have to find out what interests and excites you. Hope this helps. ",
