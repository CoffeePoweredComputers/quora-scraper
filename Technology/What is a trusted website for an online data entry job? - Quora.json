            "answer_text": "There are many legit data entry jobs that people can find online. Here is the top of them that I would recommend. Paid Surveys Watch This Video Carefully  This guy shows us exactly how we can start making money online with paid surveys in India. Paid surveys are the easiest data entry job that people can find online. Paid surveys don\u2019t require any special skills. All you have to do is to answer easy questions. See, there are big companies that want our opinion about their products and services. And they know very well, that they can\u2019t get it for free. Our opinion cost money! Sometimes I complete the full day, sometimes I\u2019m lazy, but every time that I complete a survey I get from $0.50 to $3 for short surveys. If the survey is long, I get up to $10. I know people who make $150 per focus groups per hour. Well, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t able to get such a high paying offer, but it is possible. Pros: Very easy task.Free registration.Start making money today.No skills required.Cons: Not a lot of money.Not possible to work a full day.In my opinion, paid surveys are a great way to make something, but they can\u2019t become your full-time job. Use them only as an extra income. This is my personal opinion. Now, there are people who make full-day money with paid surveys. But I think these are rare cases. Freelancer Sites Freelancing is a great work at home business. Freelancer sites register both people like us who are looking for a job online and people who offer jobs online. People who offer jobs online post their projects. We bid on them hoping that we will be selected. If we get paid, the freelancer site gets a percentage of our earnings. Making money like a freelancer looks easy, but in reality, there are problems. The main problem is that there are many people who bid on these projects. So, we have a huge competition. And chances to get approved on a project are small. In my personal opinion, people with some knowledge in some type of work have higher chances. See, if you are an expert in any field: There will be always less competition.There will be always higher bids, so you will be making more money.Now, over 90% of the people who work for these sites are low qualified. Everyone expects to find easy work and make some money fast. But this doesn\u2019t always work that way. The truth is that many people only waste time bidding. The largest freelancer site that offers data entry is Upwork. See how many offers are available under their section data entry:  As you can see there are 1635 jobs available only in one day. That is a low of work! I highly recommend Upwork. Get a Real job I\u2019d say that this is the best tip that I can give you. It\u2019s true that there are many ways to make money online, but none of them are guaranteed. In my opinion, the best way will be to find a real job. Here are the best job sites for jobs in India. Make money online, but this shouldn\u2019t be your main source of income. The best way, I\u2019d recommend is to get a real job and if you have time to work online from time to time.

            "answer_text": "Hello all, As this answer got a lot of views, this is my humble request if you are going to do some data entry job with any online virtual company please first check here\u2026Indian Consumer Complaints Forum If you get a call from any company which provides a data entry job for free. Don\u2019t be trapped because they are not going to pay you money but will give you goosebumps. They ask you to do work from home anytime anywhere but you have to do 700 entries in 6 days otherwise you have to pay a penalty of rupees 3999 for this they will pay 25rs per form. Ok, now you will agree that this job is free of cost means it must a genuine job, \u201co god thank you, you gave me an opportunity\u201d. Now, you sent them your id proof and they sent you an email and ID login credentials where you will work. you log in the Id a fake agreement section is there, you read the agreement thoroughly and believe in that and think this is a genuine company. you start work happily to complete it before the deadline. 5 days you will work successfully but on the 6th day they start making problems like your ID will block and to unblock ID they will ask 3999 which is totally refundable they would say, you pay them bcz you believe in agreement. After completing almost work at last your workload show error again you call them and the technical team asks 3999 for a new id as your last id will not work because you have done a lot of mistakes on that you pay again because you believe in agreement that they will refund after the salary. After completing work they neither attend your call nor paying your refund money or salary and will block you. This type of fake data entry fake company is The Data Entry Company they have a fake website also which has no complete information, please be aware of them. In my opinion, there is no real data entry job online. It does exist but only brick and mortar places. If you want to search for data entry job you should search on the freelancing sites where you have to show your skills and attract the consumer to your profile. But don't be trapped in those fake jobs. Note - Thanks for 9k views and 26 upvotes. I request to readers who have been frauded please share the fraudster's email, number, and name here so another person could be aware of them. You can find a few numbers here. What can a data entry company do if we don't pay money? Thanks ",
