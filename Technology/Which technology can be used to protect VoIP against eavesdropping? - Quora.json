            "answer_text": "If you are using plain RTP then Voice Packets can be captured in the middle and reconstructed the voice using tools . You can test this by installing wireshark on your computer and capture packets while you are using some voip softphone on your computer . You can be able to replay the captured audio . Imagine if someone sits at the router in your network and capture the network packets , its called MITM . To protect against man-in-middle attacks you can use SIPS(TLS)/SRTP as most of the hardware phones (IP PHONES) support SRTP . Many softphones supports ZRTP ( best key negotiating protocol for voip) so you can just enable ZRTP on your softphone . Make sure both the end points ( callee and caller parties ) support ZRTP . SipCo Systems can help you securing your existing PBX , IP telephony systems or in implementing a new Secure IP communication platform. ",
