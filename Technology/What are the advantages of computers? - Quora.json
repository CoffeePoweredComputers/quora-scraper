            "answer_text": "In addition to the other excellent answers, I\u2019d like to add this: Computers are very good at doing things that humans are generally pretty crummy at. Here\u2019s a simple example. The next time you go on a major shopping trip, once you get home, go through the receipt and add all the prices together, then calculate the tax. Some people are good at that sort of thing. But most people aren\u2019t. I majored in Math in college and graduated summa cum laude, but I hate trying to add up a long list of numbers. I\u2019ll get it wrong more often than not. Way more often. But a good computer, properly programmed, eats that stuff like candy. Computers do that without breaking a sweat. Without an error. Ever. And that just a simple task for computers. One of the first \u201csuper apps\u201d was a spreadsheet. VisiCalc was introduced for the Apple II back in 1979, Before that, there were spreadsheet applications on mainframe computers. Prior to that, there were document creation programs. The first available on a \u201chome computer\u201d was Electric Pencil for the Altair in 1976. Many people today have never experienced the torture of using a typewriter for writing a memo, or a school paper, or even a letter. Some may have used a typewriter with a built-in erase function. I was lucky enough to have one of those when I started college in 1980. In addition to a ribbon containing the black for the letters, it also included a white ribbon that would cover a mistyped letter. Or two, maybe. But see a misspelled word a few lines up? Your choice is to either re-type the whole page or leave the typo. Want to move a paragraph around, maybe from one page to another page? You have to re-type the \u201cfrom\u201d page and the \u201cto\u201d page, and likely all the pages in between. I really hated writing papers for school. And I was actually pretty good at the composition part, but getting a clean copy was infuriating. Word processors changed all that. You can make mistakes and easily fix them. You can easily move things around to your heart\u2019s content. And later word processors started to help you catch and fix errors. You can also get a computer to do boring tasks that a human would fail at. Count all the letters used in a 400+ page book? If that book is in e-form, a program can do that easily, and quickly. A human? Not so much. Ok, maybe no one cares about how many letters are in a book. But the same idea is very useful in all sorts of ways. ",

            "answer_text": "In today world the computer benefits can not be denied. It provide support in every aspect of life. Here we disscussed some benefits of Computer which are following. High Speed: In shortly, computer is a fastest machine in the world. It is able to performing calculations of very large amount of data. The computer can done its task in a very nanoseconds.Accuracy: If we talk about its accuracy, than there is no such machine like computer that gives always correct accurate answers. It always done its job 100% with accuracy, so whlie using computer you do not really to worried about your answers.Using: In today world, the computers are using in every aspects of life either it is used in Science and Tehnology, Education, Banking, E-Commerce Health and Medicine etc.Versatile Machine: In addition to being used in every aspect of life.

A person who is working on it may get board but the computer never does so, but sometimes it may be hanged while using multiple of tasks, because when the tasks are out reacheable of the memory of RAM.Storage Capability: Computer memory is very important characteristics of computers. A computer is the only machine that has the ability of storing huge amount of data. Memory is divided into four parts: 1.KB(kilobytes) 2.MB(Megabytes), 3. GB(Gigabytes) 4.TB(Terabytes).Now i hope you people are little bit know about advantages of computer. Thanks ",
