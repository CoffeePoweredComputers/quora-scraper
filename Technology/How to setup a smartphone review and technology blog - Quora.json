Step 2: Decide Your Platform Though there are many platforms to blog on, Wordpress and Blogger have been dominating the market. Whatever you do, DO NOT sign up for a free wordpress.com website. They do NOT give you ANY freedom. So, you have only two options: Blogger(Free, by Google) and Wordpress(Self Hosted; Costs $$$). Next, get yourself a domain name.
