I would look on Google to see if your phone memory can be \u201cseen\u201d as an external USB flash memory from your PC, assuming you install the appropriate drivers on your PC. All Android phones should work, unless the USB port has been disabled. More details can only depend on your phone model and release. ",

You should be able to plug it in with a USB cable and access it like any other removable storage device - provided of course that it\u2019s not an iPhone. If it is an iPhone, you need to mess with iTunes and I fortunately have no experience with that. I\u2019m sure Google can help you out either way. Solutions ",
