            "answer_text": "Most of the \u201cmillionaire tech entrepreneurs\u201d I know live very humbly. None of them have retired early, and only a few I know have flashy or stereotypical things you might think of. A couple I know made their money fast and early (when they were in their late teens/early 20s). Most of them blew their money on cars and \u201cstatus\u201d crap to impress friends or others (private flights, etc.)\u2026and those people are working a regular tech job now. Such a shame. The majority I know have a very nice place but not excessive (bought a condo, home, etc..) but have pretty normal lives - they just splurge on fun things (flying to a special Yankee game, travel, maybe a nice boat or car they wanted, etc..), and use their income primarily for future ventures or investments. They dress normally, eat at normal places, and live a life pretty indistinguishable from any other person you might see on the street. It\u2019s the rare exception that lives \u201cbig,\u201d and sustains it. The people I have met who really live *big* are hedge fund or finance guys\u2026they often make far more money - but media, for some reason, doesn\u2019t focus on those guys at all. ",

I pay myself less than what other people in my position would get paid and invest most of the excess money we generate back into the company. I would imagine the majority of millionaire tech guys live very similar to me. You are probably wanting to know how the mega millionaires live and I am not qualified to answer that question :) ",
