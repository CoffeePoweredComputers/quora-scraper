            "answer_text": "Which crops can grow in mountain soil? Nearly any crops can grow in mountain soil. Mountain soil tends to be rich. I currently live in the Rocky Mountains. I previously lived in the Cascade Mountains. In both cases, I\u2019ve grown crops such as peas, beans, corn, squash, pumpkin, watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumbers, carrots, beets, chard, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, various herbs, cabbages, cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale, and a few that I\u2019m probably forgetting. Apples, pears, plums, cherries, peaches, apricots, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries grow in profusion in both mountain ranges. In the case of mountains, the soil isn\u2019t the limiting factor for growing crops. Climate is far more important. ",

            "answer_text": "So, different mountains have different soils. Some mountains are fairly barren, others have rich soil. Not all of earth\u2019s mountains were created the same way, or at the same time. So it\u2019s kind of hard to answer your question fully. Also, keep in mind that altitude, length of season, precipitation, temperature range, etc. In the Andes, I believe potato is the staple crop. In the higher elevations of the Himalaya, it\u2019s millet. ",
