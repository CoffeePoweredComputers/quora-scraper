            "answer_text": "This is not the case. As long as game consoles are making their respective manufacturers money, they will not stop producing them. Gamers still want a PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo system, or a PC, and want full games with the best experience, as such smartphone games have not fully taken over. (I\u2019ve explained the finer state of the mobile games market in another post, so I\u2019ll refrain from doing so here). The sole advantage the mobile market has over the console market is install base: more people have an iPhone than have a PlayStation. Let\u2019s look first of all to look at Sony as a company. Sure, Sony manufactures smartphones, but, those phones hold less than 1% of the global market share. Samsung and other giants, and the obvious juggernaut that is iPhone, hold that market. PlayStation is what makes Sony most of its revenue. And Microsoft, to my knowledge, never really manufactured smartphones in-house in the first place. And frankly, Microsoft\u2019s domain is in Windows and Xbox products, and since that\u2019s their strong suit, departing from that at this point is not a good idea at all. Even though certain unique markets like Japan do tend to favor portable gaming over a home console these days, in the Western world that isn\u2019t the case\u2026 yet. That\u2019s why the Switch did so well in Japan compared to its competition while still not quite overshadowing. ",

            "answer_text": "Not likely. Console games and the way they work may change, but given how things are with cell phone gaming industry: \u2014You can\u2019t charge more than a few dollars for quality gamesThem\u2019s the market. There\u2019s generally a culture of not paying for things on the mobile markets. Video game studios don\u2019t want to make a game, but be artificially constrained by some $5 price tag because if they go above that, they lose a large share of buyers going above some \u201cimpulse buy\u201d limit. \u2014Freemium is the most popular model by far and largeNot all freemium is evil. Some of them are actually half decent to play. However, overall, the monetization schemes and paywalls really do detract from the overall game experience \u2014Cell phones can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t handle intense gamesYou can only get so many read/write cycles. It would be very taxing on the life of the phone. Plus, the heat. Also, consoles still have superior specs. \u2014You can\u2019t replicate some games on cell phone hardwareSmall screen, no physical controls. Cell phones shouldn\u2019t be trying to shoehorn full fledged console and PC games into them. They\u2019re fine for smaller games though. ",
