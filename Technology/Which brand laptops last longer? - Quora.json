            "answer_text": "A calm user? If you mean longevity as in - durability. Hunt for business laptops - there is a lot of them, just check major manufacturers sites for those. If you mean performance in few years - just go for something that excels in performance benchmarks but fits into your budget - but you might get a 4kg laptop which is the opposite of portability I\u2019m writing it on 5-ish year old HP Pavilion laptop with replaced keyboard (due to fluid spillage) and storage(after 5 years I got wiser and finally put SSD in there). Only thing it can\u2019t handle today is 4K/UHD x265 videos. 4K/UHD in H.264 is cool, FullHD in x265 is also cool - both up to 60fps tested. It can handle Fallout 4 at medium details (Witcher III not bought, can\u2019t say) and Youtube at 4k(downscaling results in crisper image and I have the bandwidth for this so I \u201cforce\u201d it despite not having the 4k display in laptop). This laptop price was around 820USD at the time - with current conversion ratio it would be 680USD so hard to tell what was the original pricing. I guess it was mid-budget model HP Pavilion 17-e045sw Notebook PC Product Specifications. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm, It depends on purpose. Media & Content Creation : Apple , Sony (More GPU based operations) Business Activitites : Lennovo , Compaq , Toshibha (Continuosly powered on,Long batery Life) These companies known to pick expensive hardware and fit into the budget. especially Batteries and Hard disks. Gaming : Alienware, MSI Companies like Dell, Samsung would give mixed usage. All the companies have good and bad models but the longevity differs with respect to below factors 1. Reliability : How the laptop\u2019s internal components are designed to cope up with things like thermal management, LSI , inernal hard disk etc. 2. Durability : What type of plastic used. What thickness the plastic has , What is the gauge of the material used in making hinges etc. 3. Scalability : What workload the laptop can handle , How future intrinsic laptop is etc. Unfortunately only few of manufactures market product on these or none of the customer are interested to look at these metric all they look for is specs. Lennovo\u2019s thinkpad series would answer the above metrics. In other brands find the similar series. ",
