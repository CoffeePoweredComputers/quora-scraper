            "answer_text": "Redmi Note 9 Pro may be referred to as the elder sibling of the Redmi Note 9 smartphone but this was launched way back in 2020 while Redmi Note 9 has been launched a few weeks ago. And if you are looking for the better option between the two, there are two aspects and you need to choose the better option on the basis of the features of the smartphone. As far as the display is concerned, Redmi Note 9 Pro has a slightly bigger screen but the display resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass protection in both the smartphones is same, so there\u2019s hardly any difference in the display. However, the most prominent difference between the smartphones lies in their processor section and performance. Redmi Note 9 is powered by Mediatek Helio G85 gaming processor which is octa-core in nature and is clocked at 2GHz, the Redmi Note 9 Pro smartphone has Snapdragon 720G processor which is also octa-core in nature and clocked at 2.3GHz.  However, if you talk about the gaming performance, Redmi Note 9 has much better performance than Redmi Note 9 Pro and thus, if you need better gaming, I think you should go for Redmi Note 9. This is one of the aspects that I talked about the smartphone earlier. However, if you need a better camera section, I think you should go for Redmi Note 9 Pro because it has 64MP quad rear camera with a 16MP front camera against Redmi Note 9 which has 48MP quad rear camera and a 13MP front camera. The battery section on both the smartphone is highly similar which is 5020mAH but Redmi Note 9 has 18W fast charging support with 9W reverse charging support and Redmi Note 9 Pro has only 30W fast charging support. Besides, we should not forget that Redmi Note 9 Pro costs much higher than Redmi Note 9 smartphone. Therefore, at the cost, I think both the smartphones are good for their features. ",
