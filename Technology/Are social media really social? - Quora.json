            "answer_text": "Social media has come to encompass almost every aspect of our lives, bringing more conventional and easier lifestyle for many reasons.For historic fact, No denying that Egyptian came the center of thinking and their action was on the discussing table in all powerful media for political upheaval to overthrow the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and obviously for Mexican revolution for survival that lasts long, and influence on Arab spring brings .Social media with instant communication, easier and unlimited access, being a cheaper way of messaging, in the pave of raising awareness, sharing knowledge generating idea, promoting business, spreading politics, has revolutionized modern day society.After earnestly scrolling down several pages by scrutinizing every possible designation executed by Social media authority, I have finally come to screening my mobile phone so much false and fake news from the times social media were born, in cheating on people, harassing one another, and media scam resulting in a terrible consequences.The Nigeria Letter 419 Advance Fee fraud is the most commonly known scam.The spreading of questionable or offensive content can spread quickly from one person to another, from one part to another part can cause to dangerous impact.In the time of technological advances, the youth are dangerously addictive more to their Facebook rather than their text books. In recent time our prime minister postulates to hold back our text book as well, remembering her memory concerned that \u201cIn our time, we spend more time reading books ,now young generation spends more time using social media\u201d.Senior journalist A.K Azad\u2019s recent article helps us figure out how women being treated badly using social media as he wrote an article titled on that \u201cFacebook messenger, a new platform of torturing women\u201d. Experts on social media rightly pointing out that \u201cNo matter what you think, no matter how strong your privacy settings are, everything you post and every interaction you have had the potential to reach the rest of the world faster than ever before\u201d.With the passage of time, it seems that there has been a hard core harvesting to draw an attention to be a leading light here in our society or anywhere else in the world by pursuing irrational logic, brazenly caricatured or offensive language, and sadistic gesture on social media that- has an incredible evil power to influence our social and global discourse of life.To share anything wishful and to post a objectively anti social message on social media expecting some more flowers and likes, without thinking so much - are being a regular basis phenomenon. To express hypocritically nonsensical speech on social media putting all under the cover of \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d- is becoming more common recently.Now-a-days \u201cLonging for becoming a popular face\u201d is an epidemic. The most \u201ccivilized\u201d nations are intensely affected by this seemingly incurable disease. So, Take on it will not be considered to be an admissible to many. But it is surely a wrong turn, if used by bad person for wrong reason.For increasing website traffic, having more subscribers on YouTube channel, and having more followers on social media blog by undermining the considerable values seem to become a prime manifesto for many youth to be young icons overnight.The contents floating over all sorts of media made by people of this time sometimes do not lead to our social and national commitment. In some cases, this contents circling through on internet consciously or unconsciously manipulate our cultural and traditional competence and national aspirations.Some of us are making them celebrities in entertaining ourselves without realizing whether these cheap and cut price contents really match with our psychological or ideological discord or not.More flexible access to internet, cheaper devise to use, and untrammeled right to put down pages are the strong reason for youth sensational priority to visit website containing unethical and morally bad site. Opposite are found less.To mention that now, Some are found as Facebook celebrities as they are posting some deceitful post tagging to people of same taste and decency and sharing to worldwide, which help them keep it up to be a popular face.Solaiman Shukhon, a Social media activist, rightly cited on his Facebook page that \u201cDue to wrong reason  , popularity\u201d has no value. Time is a merciless judge .Time eliminates wrong people, and erroneous theory even after decade or century goes by\u201d. Unlike Solaiman Shukhon, Some intellectual bodies are often induced or misguided, and are responsible to make distorted young mindset a notable one and value them in any form of reception.Social activist Shukhon further suggested that \u201cWhatever our mind tells us is always pure enough; thinking so is a complete foolishness. Mind is like a changeable memory card. To sometimes format it is an urgent and time-demand\u201d.The huge social network said Wednesday that 1.39 billion people log in to Facebook each month to scroll their News Feeds, communicate with friends and look at photos.UK based online news paper \u201dThe Huffington post\u201d made headline that \u201cFacebook Is Now Bigger Than The Largest Country On Earth. If Facebook were a country, it would be the most populous nation on earth\u201d.As a matter of fact, this generation can play an important role in spreading knowledge through proper utilization of technology.As social media matters; It is time to rein some misuse of social media, isn\u2019t it?What we forget is that: Righteousness is a crucial importance, popularity instead.

            "answer_text": "Social media are a business-to-business advertising platform in which everybody can throw their sales pitch to sell everything they want, included their entitlement, and where there is no room for wary potential clients: either you like one\u2019s product straight away or you better leave them alone. The most resonant aspect of social networks are the rabid insults against everybody in disagreement; and disagreement equals more often than not to frustration from lack of appraisal: it's frustration erected to philosophy and system. Everybody can do and say what they want, shielded by virtuality which by definition doesn't even exist, but we must realize that the circle of friends should not be considered within the followers that in a moment of stupidity click a like button (if you are my \"friend\" or social equal you must like what I say...). The friends in life are built by subtraction, because the aim is to leave less and less, but the best possible ones. Exactly the opposite of what happens in social networks. So, to me, social media are definitely a mere promotional tool: some promote their business, few promote their personality, the majority promote their virtual self. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot depends upon the community. The more the community members are on the same page of their own understanding about the purpose of being social through virtual media, the more social will be the orientation of Social Media. It will rather be lesser an audience mapping tool for businesses. Being social is a method of interaction with other living entities which essentially leads to exchange of thoughts and ideas, thought provocation with excitement of existing interest, introduction to more interests, and an action in a geo-physical space that envisions to makes life easier, happier, and purposeful, in short term or long term. The nature, impact and extent of the action may be relative, depending upon the level of excitement. Being social in principle was supposed to give a boost to our own realization of being a part of a society where there is acceptance, cooperation and exchange of constructive ideas. As long as the element of \u2018action\u2019 remains and keeps on happening through social media, we can say social media is really social. ",

And as soon as the Relevance Paradox was broken ( An analogy would be that of a near-sighted person who is unaware of their condition. They would not perceive any benefit in getting the glasses they need to improve their sight, until they tried wearing the glasses. Having never experienced a priori results or knowledge from unknown social communities, the near-sighted person requires a posteriori knowledge dependent on experience or empirical evidence - OR a trusted, known social community. Such a situation could be resolved by a third party, aware of its relevance, recommending an eye test.
