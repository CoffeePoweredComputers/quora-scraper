So, its hard to find a good job with good packages. But you can try in SAP itself. They hire freshers. And If you know ABAP already, it will be really helpful. Outside India, there are really good opportunities.One of my friends got training in ABAP, and was able to find a job in Canada easily and She was a fresher. And if you are not able to find a good job in India, take some internship program and work on some shadow projects , get some experience and then apply for jobs.International Internship Program With The Intern GroupThis might be helpful.
