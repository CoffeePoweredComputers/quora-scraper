            "answer_text": "Tuition is paid at the begnning of each school term. If the school is on quarters, you usually attend 3 quarters and therefore pay tution three times a year. For semesters, the school year has two and you pay twice. Summer school is extra. That said,some schools have payment plans, some people take out loans which have payment obligation of some sort while the person is still in school although most school loans are deferred until after you leave school. Most school loans are repaid monthly. ",

            "answer_text": "It is entirely based on the institution where you study . Some people collect tuition fee for the whole year while some collect it month wise.It\u2019s better to join in a tuition which collects fee month wise rather than the whole year . Hence, you will have a option to choose(whether to continue or not). With technology improving day by day one can even choose to study at home. Great achievers have spent their time in experiments rather than going to tuition. GOOD LUCK!! ",
