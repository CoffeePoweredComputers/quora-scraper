            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t want to drown your enthusiasm, but considering your situation, I would say no. I\u2019m sorry. Long distance relationships are hard, even for couples who know each other and are committed. However, the good news is I don\u2019t know you or the woman you love, so I could be wrong. And since you asked, here\u2019s my opinion based on what I have seen over the years and what you have shared with us. You don\u2019t seem to know each other well. Yes, you had a great time and you both matched really well. But it was a very brief time together. Please consider what you did together and how much she enjoyed it and think about the odds of her limiting this fun and pleasure to just you. For two years. You didn\u2019t even make it much past two weeks before you found someone else to sleep with. Do you think she can? You already said you might not be able to stand it if she was with someone else. Let\u2019s imagine that happens. What will you do? She forgave you; can you forgive her? I think your desire to maintain this relationship is comparable to a weak man wanting to run a marathon. In this particular example, you would not have made it to the end of the block. But let\u2019s say you both agree to live your lives and meet again after two years. You would like to know how you could keep your relationship and get together without any awkwardness. Maybe on her part it could happen, but I would say on your part, no. You already were honest about sleeping with someone else not long after your lover was gone. And you admitted it would be hard to imagine her with someone else. If you factor in the possible guilt you feel, things will be awkward when you two meet in two years. They would probably be awkward if you met tomorrow based on your feelings about what you\u2019ve already done. What would it be like in two years? Have you also considered what your lives will be like in two years if you get back together? You will be exclusively dating. That means no one else. Every day together with morning breath, looking for jobs, days spent cleaning the apartment, (if you live together), sharing the bathroom. Does she have any habits you don\u2019t like? Imagine them the rest of your life. And which country would you two settle down in? Hers? Yours? My suggestion is you two change your relationship. Become friends only. Get to know each other. Support each other in your separate endeavors and be true friends to each other. Because bottom line in a lasting relationship is the friendship and respect each person feels for the other. Let her live her life and you live yours without regrets. Then meet in two years and see what happens. ",

            "answer_text": "In a sense, nothing is impossible as long as you are both alive. As long as neither of you dies before the two years elapse it would be inaccurate (technically) to say there was absolutely zero chance of the two of you getting together when you are both free to do so and having the relationship be a success. Having said that, IMO, the chances of that happening, however, are at the lowest fraction of percent above absolute zero. Long-distance relationships, in particular those that must endure beyond a few months, are fraught with challenges that reduce the likelihood of the realtionship\u2019s success. The more time that passes with the couple having to remain apart, physically, the worse the chances become. I would say exponentially worse. This means the chances of something going wrong increase at a faster and higher rate with each passing day apart. Add to that, though, the fact that you \u201ceven knowing what <you> want, <you> couldn't resist and had an affair with another person 15 days after she left\u201d and I would say your LDR with this lady is almost certainly doomed. It's nice and very open-minded of her to react so tolerantly to the truth you shared with her. Even so, though, I would estimate the odds of you two staying in contact and both of you remaining as deeply committed to enduring the separation as you were the day she returned home after her visit are abysmal. The odds are so low they are almost incalculable. If you both continue with the hope you will be together in two years, sadly, I predict you are setting yourself up for an experience of frustration and possible heartbreak for one or both of you. More likely, the thing will die a natural death and the energy and interest you both have in making this thing work will simply peter out and lose gas until the tank is empty. In the meantime, though, one or both of you are likely to suffer emotionally, possibly to a great extent. My guess is you aren't ready to walk away from this LDR and will probably stick with it for the time being. The more prudent and sensible course of action is, IMO, to recognize the high probability of failure of the thing and focus your energy on finding love with a compatible partner in your own community instead. I wish you much luck and personal happiness in whatever course you choose. ",
