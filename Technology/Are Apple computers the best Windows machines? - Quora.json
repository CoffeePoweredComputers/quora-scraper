            "answer_text": "As a developer, I think they\u2019re very good Windows machines, but probably not the best. Windows is becoming an OS with strong support for touch screens and stylus, like Surface and other models. If you\u2019re a Windows developer, with an interest in developing Windows applications, you should consider that Surface users are a growing part of the user base, and you\u2019ll probably want to test with touch screens/stylus. If you don\u2019t care about touch screens/stylus, then it makes far less difference. I\u2019m just talking from a developers point of view. From a typical user\u2019s point of view, running Windows, Apple\u2019s machines are basically a really nicely made computers. ",

            "answer_text": "You should read yesterday\u2019s article from The Verge Apple should stop selling four-year-old computers A 4-year old computer can never be the best. The best computer has many definitions. Some of us believe the performance is the most important; some think highest screen resolution is the most important; if you carry laptop 5 hours a day the best computer for you will be the lightest one; if you prefer writing to typing the best computer will be laptop that has a pen support; some think the best desktop computer is the one that can be updated in 5 years just by upgrading CPU and adding more memory with minimal costs (not replacing the whole machine)\u2026 Apple computers are not top in any of these properties, not even at the moment they release the new device, not to mention 4 years later!

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Apple makes great hardware. There is no disputing that. Since they use the same Intel processors as PCs, it goes to follow that they run Windows just as good, if not better, than most PCs. As to whether they are the \u201cbest\u201d or not, I think there are far too many choices for PCs out there \u2014 some of which are designed every bit as good as Macs \u2014 to make that assertion. But they are certainly better than most. ",
