            "answer_text": "Depending on what kind of startup you have and what kind of products and services you provide, the answer may differ significantly. Generally, there are three large options you can choose from: AI / Chatbots For smaller startups chatbots can be a good idea. They are effective in dealing with simple questions live. However, in case of a more complicated issue, their inability to escalate further to a human agent does not make them so different from a simple FAQ page. FreelancersThrough numerous freelancer platforms around the web you can find nearly any professional, a customer support agent included. A person or a few could help you handle initial customer support. Though, it is important to make sure you have enough agents to handle the volume of tickets. Outsourcing When using outsourcing companies, you can hire agents but also often rent other services to deal with customer support. It might sound similar to freelancing, but unlike freelancing, you can have agents that are closely familiar with your product and work on providing support for your business continuously rather than in a short-term project style. Security and quality assurance are also among the benefits of such an approach. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably impossible to automate every aspect of your customer service operations. That would lead to a fairly poor customer experience and definitely not something you want. You want a healthy mix of automation alongside human interaction. In Re:amaze for example, there are several different automation features: Workflow automation (for things like auto-routing, assignments, tagging)Automated messaging (for on-site engagement)Pre-built chatbots (to help with commonly asked questions)Custom chatbots (to help with unique scenarios such as finding a product)There are things you want to automate internally and there are things you want to automate externally (customer replies) but be careful with what you automate as a fully automated support process can be extremely alienating for customers. A mixture of the options above will help you speed up customer service but still enable you to offer a human element to your business. ",
