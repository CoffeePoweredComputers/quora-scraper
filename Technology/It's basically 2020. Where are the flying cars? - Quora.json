            "answer_text": "There are, in-fact, flying cars right now. A few innovative developers and engineers have made street-legal automobiles, which can be driven to the airport and flown.    Unlike bubble-topped flying saucers, like you\u2019d see on the Jetson\u2019s or in a 1950\u2019s Popular Science magazine, the real thing isn\u2019t so attractive, compact, simple or tidy.  As the various attempts have proven over the years, a good car makes a terrible airplane and a good airplane makes a terrible car. The side-impact protection, rollover protection, crumple zones and reinforced structure of a car, designed to carry its weight along the ground at substantial speed, with heavy suspension and braking components are contrary to the design philosophy of a good airplane. That is to have a lightweight structure, with little weight spent towards crash protection, suspension or braking, noise abatement or creature comforts. In most cases, the aerodynamic considerations alone make the two vehicles a bad fit for each other. Perhaps the biggest hurdle has been the wings, or better yet, what to do with them when you\u2019re ready for highway travel. Wing area must be adequate to provide a comfortable lift envelope to keep the vehicle flying. To do that, they must be pretty big. Even when folded and stored, like a Transformer toy, they\u2019re still awkward and ungainly to store and bring along with you. If they fold along the sides of the vehicle, they typically block access to things like doors, windows and other \u201ccar parts.\u201d Some use vertical lift fans, like a big drone. In order to vertically lift something requires a lot of power and fan area, or extremely light weight. Again, those work against the principles of building a safe and sturdy car, especially when it relies on 3 or 4 spinning impellers, which could easily puree small children and animals.  In addition are the logistics of operating a flying car. In every civilized country on the planet, flight is heavily regulated. Pilots must be certified, licensed and type-rated. Aircraft cannot simply take to the skies from any public highway. Once airborne, the problems of collision avoidance become a very real issue, not just with other flying cars, but also with telephone wires, trees, structures and birds.  Finally, the expense of a flying car today is pretty extreme and well outside the norm for a typical middle-class family taking their kids to school and picking up groceries every week. So are flying cars here? Yes they are, but you\u2019ve got to be pretty determined and wealthy to own and operate one, and in the end, you\u2019ll have a mediocre car and a crappy airplane\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Never going to happen. Aside from all the enormous technological and economic hurdles of making one, there\u2019s a number of reasons: Flying cars add no significant utility to the buyer.Piloting a craft in three dimensions is exponentially more difficult than piloting one in two. Given that you have worse than 1 in 200 odds of having a collision in a car, do you really think it\u2019s a good idea to make the average Jane a pilot? It costs $150 or less to get a driver\u2019s license in the US; a pilot\u2019s license restricted to daytime-only, clear visibility flying costs around $10,000 to obtain. There\u2019s a reason for that.Damage from an accident would also be exponentially worse. Both in terms of human damage and property damage; fatalities would be almost assured for every participant, and the amount of collateral damage increases by orders of magnitude when you\u2019re flying versus driving.Physics dictate that the amount of energy required to fly a car would be vastly more than driving a car for the same distance. That means it\u2019d be absurdly expensive to fuel.The design attributes that make a good car make a terrible airplane, and vice versa, so any car that can fly is going to be at best a mediocre car and a mediocre airplane. Why not simply have a fantastic car that you drive to an airport, where you can fly a fantastic plane?So where are they? They\u2019re going to remain the occasionally interesting toy of some wealthy individual, because they\u2019re fundamentally a bad solution to a non-existent problem. Well, unless sci-fi comes true and handheld energy sources have more power than fission reactors and anti-gravity is somehow achievable. ",
