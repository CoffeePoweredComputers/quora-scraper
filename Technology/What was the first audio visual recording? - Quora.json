            "answer_text": "The first audio visual recording was the Dickson Experimental Sound Film of 1895. The Dickson Experimental Sound Film - Wikipedia The Dickson Experimental Sound Film is a film made by William Dickson in late 1894 or early 1895. It is the first known film with live-recorded sound and appears to be the first motion picture made for the Kinetophone, the proto-sound-film system developed by Dickson and Thomas Edison. Dickson also stars in the film, as the violinist!  It was recorded at Edison\u2019s first studio, that could be pivoted to follow the sun.Edison's Black Maria - Wikipedia    Google Maps Edit: \u201cOnly forty-five Kinetophone machines were sold\u201d[1] They claimed an earlier sound movie in 1889:[2] [3] [4] [5][6] \u201cBy Dickson\u2019s own account, he produced a more-or-less successful synchronized sound film circa October 1889, combining phonographic sound and kinetoscopic visuals. Upon Edison\u2019s return from the Paris Expedition of 1889, a brief welcome-home film was presented to him in which, reportedly, Dickson \u201cstepped out on the screen, raised his hat and smiled, while uttering the words of greeting, \u2018Good morning, Mr. Edison, glad to see you back. I hope you are satisfied with the kineto-phonograph.\u201d Alas, no physical trace of this very earliest of sound films is known to survive, although other (silent) test films from 1889 do. Because of this, some have questioned whether the 1889 \u201cwelcome home\u201d sound film was ever actually made or if it is simply yet another example of early cinema braggadocio.\u201dThe Pre-History of Sound Cinema: Thomas Edison and WKL Dickson Possibly Dickson was lip-syncing live to the moving image, rather than a recorded voice?
