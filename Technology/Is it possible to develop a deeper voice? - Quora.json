            "answer_text": "No, sorry. It's not possible to develop a deeper voice. However, it is possible to do a couple of things that will give the impression of a deeper speaking voice. As far as singing goes, if you are a \"chest voice\" singer, then your voice is probably already as deep as it wants to be. Trying to make it deeper will only cause vocal damage. If you are a \"head voice\" singer, see #1, below. First, why can't you develop a deeper voice? What Sara said is absolutely right: the pitches you use in speaking and singing are limited by the length of your vocal chords. Typically, when people try to force their voice to be deeper, they end up either doing damage or creating habits that will eventually do damage. The most attractive voice is not the voice which is deeper but the voice that is phonating most freely and naturally. The healthiest thing you can do for your voice is to find the speaking and singing ranges that are most comfortable and natural for you. There are a couple of things you can do for both your speaking and singing voice if you are determined to have a deeper voice. Develop your \"chest voice.\" The larynx is an interesting organ in that it has two basic ways of behaving. In voice teaching we use the term \"chest voice\" to denote the lower tones; the manner in which most Americans use their voices for speech, and \"head voice\" or \"falsetto\" to denote the higher (and, in the non-singer, more airy) tones. The chest voice can be developed in such a way that the larynx can phonate freely and efficiently and thus it maximizes the color spectrum of your voice. This gives the impression of a deeper voice. Please do not try this at home. Consult a professional voice teacher or speech therapist.Warm up your singing voice. Athletes typically stretch and start slowly before they begin their activity in earnest. This is because the muscles work more freely and efficiently when they are loose and there is ample blood supply flowing to them. The same is true for the vocal apparatus. When the tissues are loose and receiving ample blood supply the result is a gentle swelling which results in more surface contact and thus more color to the tone. Again, more color in the tone can give the impression of a deeper voice.",

            "answer_text": "So I've got good news and bad news for you. The bad news is that you're not really going to be able to pitch your voice lower. As others have said, your vocal cords have fixed mass and a given singer/speaker/human can only pull and prod them (read: change pitch) so much. The good news is I don't actually think you want to develop a deeper voice. I think you want to develop a darker voice that sounds deeper, but isn't necessarily. Or at least, this is what most people want when they ask about getting a deep voice. To make your voice darker, the only thing you can do is lengthen your vocal tract. There are three ways to do this: from your lips, from your oropharynx, and from your larynx. For the first, try to speak as though you've stolen Patrick Ewing's lips (the basketball player). With your lips loose but elongated, I think you'll find that your voice is already significantly darker. Now feel a yawn-y sensation in the back of your throat. This should push your oropharynx back, elongating the middle of your vocal tract. Even darker, right? Now breathe in through your nose as though you were smelling amazing flowers. Your larynx should go down, so when you speak after breathing in, your voice should sound much, much darker. It's pretty cool. Kurt Moll, the very famous operatic bass, was artist in residence at Indiana University when a friend of mine was a student there. All of the basses signed up for lessons with him, and one after another they came in and asked him how to get a low C like his. One by one, with great patience, he put their hands on his larynx and their hands on their own, noting the size and shape difference, and told them it was impossible. But then he taught them to lengthen their vocal tract, and some of them walked out with amazingly dark low Ds, Es, and Fs. Does that make sense? ",
