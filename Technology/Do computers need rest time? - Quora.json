Mostly electronics tend to function better if you don\u2019t turn them off and on a lot. I\u2019ve had and have computers [most built by me] that have been on for years. As long as you keep the environment as cool as possible and the individual components are well cooled there should be no problems with leaving them on all of the time. Further, I\u2019ve had so called \u201cserver grade\u201d components break down more often than \u201cconsumer grade\u201d parts, perhaps because they get more stress do to more intense use because they are being \u201cpounded\u201d by many more users. Those are just my experiences. ",

This is why workstation components are available. The service life of a consumer computer will be greatly diminished if running full power all the time. However, server grade components are much more stable over longer duty cycles. ",

Each power cycle causes a little stress to components from power just being applied in addition to a cycle of expansion and contraction due to heating/cooling, whereas a constantly running machine will not suffer from the cycle.
