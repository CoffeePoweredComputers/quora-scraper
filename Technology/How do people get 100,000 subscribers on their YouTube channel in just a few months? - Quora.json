Get out there and be social, share your content on all your social media channels, but, give people a reason to watch. People don\u2019t want to be sold to, or just watch someone making content to make money, it\u2019s obvious to the viewer you\u2019re not bothered about the content. Just create vids on something you\u2019re passionate about and have fun. ",

An efficient way of assisting is through shout-outs (telling people to subscribe to another channel) . Bigger channels usually do this for the smaller ones. ",
