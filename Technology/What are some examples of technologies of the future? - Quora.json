            "answer_text": "A Futuristic View of the 21st Century During the current century, all or most of the following will take place: \u2022\tWithout an infusion of young, family producing immigrants, the US will grow old like Japan. So will China. Fortunately, technology will support both older populations and immigrants re-vitalizing society. \u2022\tThe Healthcare system will be revamped over a 10-year phase-in, treating BigPharma, Hospitals, Health Insurance companies and other healthcare companies as utilities. As such, these companies will be entitled to a reasonable return on their investments excluding certain costs like advertising. All residents will be entitled to low-cost, high-quality healthcare. \u2022\tArtificial Intelligence (AI) will grow at an exponential rate to the point where, coupled with \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT) technologies, will make even AI-driven flying cars, governed by IoT, common by 2050. \u2022\tEducation-pre-K through College, will be disrupted through the cloud, through AI, and through video, virtual reality and other technologies. Young children will be taught universal values like generosity, kindness, gratitude, and forgiveness. They will also be taught thinking, problem-solving and other non-rote skills instead of memorization, which will be reserved for high school and junior high grasses levels and above. \u2022\tUniversities and their huge tuition increases will become either extinct or reserved for the ultra-rich when the government seeks to limit such increases by limiting student loans. In addition to all of this, many more companies will create their own \u201chigher educational institutions\u201d. GM University is an example. Companies will do this to ensure required skills by employees to handle new and older technologies. In return for low-cost or no-cost training, employees will guarantee a minimum of five or so years service to the company, much like the military academies require of its graduates. \u2022\tWorkers across the country will have many of the amenities now enjoyed by Silicon Valley companies such as child-caring, meals, and continual skill training. Remote-site working will become common as 3D hologram virtual reality will support much of the communication. \u2022\tRobotics will replace much of the workforce by 2050. This will initially cause a huge increase in unemployment in future decades before then until other technology benefits come into being. \u2022\tEnergy eventually will be close to free. Fusion, much better solar, superconductivity, biological advances and other forms will reduce costs substantially. Before 2075, anti-gravity will be unlocked using magnetism as a catalyst. All of these cost reducing technologies will mean costs in most areas (construction, manufacturing, healthcare, even everyday services) will drop significantly. The cost of living will be manageable for all with skills, even with part-time work only available. \u2022\tMost of the solar system\u2019s planets and their larger moons will be colonized. Technologies to terraform them will be developed. \u2022\tRobotic travel to nearby stars will be underway. \u2022\tScientists will have discovered additional dimensions beyond time and space through further understanding of quantum energies. Quantum entanglement will be fully understood, linking all matter. \u2022\tEventually mainstream science will find a way to detect and measure energies related to thought and perception. Science will finally admit Nikola Tesla\u2019s claim that Consciousness lies beyond the realm of current science. \u2022\tForms of consciousness, whereby such entities communicate or make decisions will be detected by science. Cells communicate, water and other molecules have memory, even electrons and quarks and photons make decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "Virtual Reality for Art Though at first Virtual Reality seemed to be exclusively tied to video gaming, it has since spread to films, education, and even retail. Now it also holds a world of possibilities for the art industry.  When we were just starting out, we chose e-commerce in general and fashion e-commerce in particular as our target because at the time it was evident just how quickly this market would evolve and how expansive the demand for innovative solutions for online retail would be. As a scalable platform for creation, embedding and analysis of 3D and AR/VR content meant to erase the line between brick-and-mortar and online shopping, our solution has proven to be commercially successful. 3D Imaging solution for Art is a new project, born as a result of our partnership with the New York Academy of Art and our mutual desire to prove that fast and qualitative production of virtual museums, galleries, and exhibitions is possible and can help convert online visitors into physical ones. With a VR headset and compatible software, it is possible to replace your surroundings with the virtual gallery full of paintings, sculptures, and installations. At the moment we plan to offer virtual and augmented reality tours of the Academy\u2019s major exhibitions and galleries, allowing viewers all over the world to \u2018virtually\u2019 visit the Academy. Right now you can access a basic version of this tour as a demo on Steam. The creation of an easy-to-use digitization platform for 3D artworks has allowed New York Academy of Art sculptors and mixed-media artists to accurately showcase their work like never before. The experience gained with the NYAA partnership was meant to bring the exhibit to those who for some reason are unable to attend, be it financial constraints or physical limitations. The initiative now continues with us becoming an official sponsor and partner of In Dante Veritas, an interactive multimedia exhibition by artist Vasily Klyukin that will be open for viewing from May 8th to November 24th in Venice. We regularly update the software and at the moment plan on releasing the plug-in for Unity, which will allow for autonomous creation of 3D, AR and VR experiences. We are also experimenting with visualization of different art pieces, such as sculptures and paintings. Perhaps we\u2019ll create our 3D digitizing software to make this type of visualization easier. Another aspect of the solution is its ability to serve as a valuable archive for past exhibitions. If a show has been run in partnership with us, it can be preserved online, allowing for visitors to access it again even after the physical show has ended.  ",
