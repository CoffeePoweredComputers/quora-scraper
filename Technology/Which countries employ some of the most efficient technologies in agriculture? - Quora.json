            "answer_text": "Israel is certainly a major player in agricultural technology. However, so are many other countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and the UK. Agriculture in the Gulf region, where water is scarce (like in Israel), is currently developing very rapidly, though mainly by multinational R&D companies brought in from elsewhere. The Wolf Prize in Agriculture, which is awarded in Israel to agricultural scientists, has been awarded most frequently to Americans (31) followed by Britons (8). Israel has had one winner. Similarly, the World Food Prize, which is awarded in the US for contributions in any field involved in the world food supply, has been awarded most frequently to Americans (16) followed by Indians (7). Again, Israel has had one winner. ",
