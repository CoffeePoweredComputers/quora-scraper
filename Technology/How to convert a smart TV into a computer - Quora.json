            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want to do on your Smart TV. A computer is nothing but a machine that can be instructed to carry out operations automatically via computer programming. Your smart TV is already doing this and uses some kind of OS. However, these TVs are programmed to do what it is designed for. TVs are designed to watch content. They can play all your saved files, files from your network drive and run most applications meant for entertainment purposes like YouTube, Netflix, etc. They can also run some games if you would like to spend time with casual gaming. The hardware and software on these Smart TVs are designed to do this. If you want additional tasks like working over Work, Excel or Email then you need a different type of computer. Yes, some Smart TVs can do this as well by connecting a Keyboard/Mouse to the USB ports and using Google Sheets and Google docs for your work. You can also use the inbuilt browser to check your Emails. If you want more, then get a different kind of computer which is suitable for your kind of work. Smart TV is a computer meant for entertainment and it can do it well. A normal PC is meant for work + entertainment - and it can support your additional needs. If you still would like to use your Smart TV for this purpose, then you need to buy additional hardware to support your Smart TV. You can get a Raspberry Pi device - you can even install Windows 10 on it and do you work. If you are ready to spend a little more, then go for an Intel Compute Stick or Asus VivoStick. If you are ready to spend much more, then build yourself a computer on the smallest possible PC case and use your TV as a display device. ",
