            "answer_text": "There is another answer at this point, and it is not incorrect, but the simple answer, I will assert as \u201cYes, but very little.\u201d And if anyone is really interested in science, the question then becomes ,\u201cHow much,\u201d not whether the effect exists or not. There is some work tending to indicate that the equilibrium state of a column of gas in a gravitational field will create a temperature difference (very small) between the top and the bottom of the column, thus appearing to contradict some interpretations of the Second Law of thermodynamics. Those experimental results are still controversial, but set that aside for a moment. Suppose that such a very small temperature difference exists. By making the column very tall, it would seem, the temperature difference could be increased, and then, it is proposed, used for power generation. Yet to do so requires a conduction path that is also influenced by the gravitational field. If the voltage induced in the connecting wire shows the same potential difference as is represented by the temperature difference, there would be no current. So the voltage per meter of elevation in a gravitational field, which we must expect from general principles, becomes important to see, when attempting to interpret what are very small effects over small distances. (It is quite difficult to set up a thermally isolated system to measure what I will call the Graeff effect, though it was first proposed in the 19th century by Loschmidt, in a discussion with Maxwell, in which Loschmidt calculated a theoretical temperature difference and Maxwell rejected it entirely as a Second Law violation, which is circular. I would say that the fundamental principle of the Second Law is that energy cannot be extracted from an equilibrium condition, by definition, and if equilibrium can be formed without temperature equalization, which appears to be possible, then a more sophisticated Second Law would refer to an actual equilibrium, which can include the effects of gravity, as one example. This Second Law agrees with some formulations, not with others. Maxwell\u2019s claim was apparently accepted by many without actually being tested, so we see that temperature is exempted from being affected by gravity in, say, a current Wikipedia article. However, then, if there is a temperature difference, the immediate assumption is that there is available work, and so one could make a perpetual motion machine. (And there are people proposing that, and people rejecting the temperature gradient found, on that basis). In the presence of an external gradient where temperature increased with elevation (normal in a room), Graeff, isolating his experiment within concentric vacuum flasks, found a reverse gradient, on the order of 0.07 K per meter. This is a difficult experiment because of the possible confounding factors, but his results appear well-measured, and there is no real violence being done to a more sophisticated understanding of the Second Law. He also measured thermoelectric power, but over a much smaller time interval and with only one reported test. It is that power that would be more \u201crevolutionary.\u201d However, look at this example and consider extraction of energy by thermocouples. If there is also a voltage gradient in a vertical wire, depending on magnitude, there may be no possibility of energy extraction of the system at equilibrium, and \u201cno perpetual motion machines\u201d is a circumstantial finding from centuries of effort. One step at a time. If the temperature gradient exists, then what is incorrect is a common interpretation of the Second Law, requiring equal temperature at equilibrium. However, a consideration of the larger system, including the \u201cenergy extraction device\u201d may, if tested, show a preservation of the more carefully expressed Second Law. Reference, \u201cThe production of electricity out of a heat bath,\u201d Roderich W. Graeff, p. 193 in SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS: STATUS AND CHALLENGES, in AIP Conference Proceedings 1411, 1 (2011); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3665227. The title is unfortunate, because Graeff, having spent years measuring the thermal gradient, showed only one short period of \u201celectricity production,\u201d roughly one-half picowatt. Nevertheless, what I find remarkable is the temperature gradient, which does not necessarily create an energy source, that is a largely untested, though routine assumption. Normally, a temperature gradient may be used to generate power, but if the temperature gradient is from an equilibrium state, perhaps not. Thermocouples are inefficient for power production. A simpler test would be to connect the top and bottom of his cylinder with a pipe, free for the temperature difference to create convection, which is work. My very tentative analysis is that, no, there would be no convection, and the same temperature gradient would appear in that pipe. There would be no air flow, only heat conduction. (The main cylinder was filled with glass beads, perhaps hollow, to inhibit convection, so the difference between the pipe and the main cylinder would essentially be that filling. I think unwarranted conclusions are being drawn, but the point here is that some interpretations of the Second Law may be incorrect.) ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly yes, but only a very tiny effect. Consider an approximation of a 120 volt supply providing 8.5 amp to a load for 1 hour, or 1 kilowatt hour. 8.5 x 1.6 x 10^19 electrons / second = 8.5 amp. 3.6 x 10^3 seconds per hour. 10^-30 kg / electron. So a mass of (8.5 x 1.6 x 10^19) x (3.6 x 10^3) x (1 x 10^-30) = 4.9 x 10^-7 kg / hr of electrons. IF the electrons ONLY traveled straight down for 10 meters to supply the load, THEN they would arrive at the load with an additional energy of mgh (mass in kg x gravitational constant of earth surface x height in meters), = 4.9 x 10^-7 x 9.8 x 10 = 4.8 x 10^-5 joules per hour. 3,600 joules per hour = 1 watt, so gravity adds 4.8 x 10^-5 / 3.6 x 10^3 = 1.33 x 10^-8 watt hours = 1.33 x 10^-11 kilowatt hours to the energy provided, or approx. 1/100,000,000,000 th of the energy provided by the electrical force. The REAL issue is that nearly all electrical systems run electrons in a CIRCUIT of wires, so for every electron which descends to the load, another electron must ascend back to the supply, so the net effect of gravity on the circuit is nill. The above discussion would only have any relevance to an electron accelerator shooting a beam of electrons down a mine shaft where the cathode charge could be dissipated to earth at depth without needing to return to the surface.
