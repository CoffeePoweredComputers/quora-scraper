            "answer_text": "It really depends. Let\u2019s start off by pointing out that $200 for a laptop is considered entry level\u2026 BUDGET entry level. Almost to the point of being a Chromebook. Not hating on that particular device, but it should be noted that it is limited when compared to an actual laptop computer. That said, if the refurbished device you\u2019re considering has better specs than the new ones for thew same price, and it\u2019s from a reputable source (Newegg, TigerDirect, what have you) then by all means go ahead. If it fails within that companies specified return period, they\u2019ll swap you a new (refurbished) one. I have made 2 such purchases. One, made almost 10 years ago was a Lenovo Z61t that I still have to this day. I\u2019ve had to replace the keyboard, battery, and ribbon cable that drives the display in that time. In all fairness, that could have just have easily have happened with a brand new unit in that time frame. That unit cost me under $200 from Newegg. It still does everything I need it to do. About 2 years ago, I purchased an Acer\u2026 Thing. Not really a laptop, not really a tablet. Has a touchscreen and a detachable keyboard, so I guess it\u2019s more of a tablet. I got it refurbished for $160. This was right around when Windows 10 came out, and updating it killed it. They sent me a new (refurbished) one with minimal headache. Purchasing refurbished items really is a crap-shoot. Something to consider is whether or not you can live without the device if it fails and you have to wait up to 3 weeks for yours to ship back so they can determine that you didn\u2019t dump a soda into it, and send you a new one. You wouldn\u2019t want that if this was your daily driver. One last thing: If you do go the route you\u2019re considering, I have one piece of advice. Buy a SSD and max out the RAM. You\u2019d be surprised to see the huge difference these two things make. They\u2019re super easy to do yourself, don\u2019t cost much (although RAM has really spiked lately) and the performance boost is staggering. YouTube search your model number and the keywords upgrading RAM, or installing SSD and you\u2019ll find an applicable video. It literally takes under 15 minutes. Good luck! A ",

            "answer_text": "Friend you can get an incredibly powerful laptop called Dell m 4600 off of eBay it's got a 2 gig graphics card you can get them with up to 32 gigs of RAM you can put a solid state drive in it and you can get it all for under $325 they have i7 processors you can get them as fast is 3.1 gigahertz off of eBay for under $325. If you go to what department store with $325 you're going to get a cheap plastic toy not a real workhorse a laptop like the Dell precision m4600. Yes it weighs 7 lb. But the case is made out of real metal not plastic. And it's made to actually work all day. It's not created to look cool it's created to work. if you want a really nice laptop buy one of them that's one of my favorite products to sell because there's such good laptops for such little money ",
