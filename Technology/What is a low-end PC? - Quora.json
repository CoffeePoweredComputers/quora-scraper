            "answer_text": "Low-end PCs were put together using cheap components with the purpose of saving money. They usually have 4 GB or less RAM and always lack any dedicated GPUs (they use the much less powerful integrated graphics) and have passive cooling (only 1 fan) and a low capacity 5400 RPM hard drive. They're good for home/office use, don't expect too much from them. High-end PCs, on the other hand, are very powerful and expensive. They are usually gaming PCs built using 32 GB RAM, multiple dedicated GPUs, a high performance CPU and a massive PSU, often with two M.2 SSDs and a 1TB hard drive, multiple fans and in some cases, liquid cooling. These PCs can do anything you can throw at them from running AAA games on 4K with 60+ FPS to fast video editing. Edit: here's s little math: High-end PC + a few years = low-end PC For example, take a high-end gaming PC that runs the newest AAA games on 4K with 60+ FPS with a few of such games and put them into a time capsule for 5 years. After the 5 years have passed, start the PC and verify that all the games you put next to it still run with 60+ FPS on 4K. Then install the latest AAA game on it and see whether it runs at all. 5 years in terms of an average human's life is not that much but in terms of computers it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. I visited Iowa in August to attend my sister\u2019s memorial and found myself trying to convince a cousin that she needed urgently to buy a new computer. Her desktop is based on a dual-core Pentium processor and it takes 40% of the processor\u2019s power just to draw the desktop. I said \u201cOn Amazon today you can get a good basic computer for $750. This includes an SSD for the operating system and a nice separate graphics card.\u201d Her eyes got wide. \u201cDo you really think that a $750 computer is cheap?\u201d, she asked. Yes, I did and do. How about this? $395. Acer Aspire TC-885-ACCFLi3O Desktop, 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8100, 8GB DDR4 + 16GB Optane Memory, 1TB HDD, 8X DVD, 802.11ac WiFi, Windows 10 Home This would have been an easier sell to my cousin and $395 is kind of astonishing. No SSD but it does have a bit of Optane memory for a little boost. And it would have run rings around my cousin\u2019s Pentium based antique. ",
