            "answer_text": "Why would you want to stop or reduce challenges that the future generations will face? Part of the current problem is that, until these past few weeks, so few of the younger generations have ever in their lives encountered a truly difficult time, time when their movements and actions were curtailed. They have no idea what it is like to have restrictions of any kind - food, travel, entertainment, social life - the only restrictions they\u2019ve encountered are governed by finance but jobs have been out there if they were prepared to do anything that was offered to them. Maybe the coronavirus is a wake-up call for us all to take stock of who we are and what we are doing to each other and to the planet. To learn that life is not all about me, me, me but about how \u2018me\u2019 can live with other people for everyone\u2019s mutual benefit. Maybe behaviour will be modified - I\u2019m thinking cheap holidays where the one aim is to sleep with each other and get \u2018blathered\u2019 - or whatever the word is nowadays. Maybe people will realise life is not all about themselves and the money they have, it\u2019s much more than that. Whether things will change when this pandemic crisis is over, only time will tell but challenges will always be there. Who, six months ago, would have believed the world would be as it is today? Who could predict what is going to happen in the next twelve months? We can never stop challenging times - either personal and global - but by meeting challenges head on when young gives you a good grounding to cope with them if they occur when you are an adult. We need to learn to meet head on any challenges we face throughout our lives, whatever they are; only by being prepared are we able to overcome them. We will come through this current crisis wiser and able to cope - but, because we have lived through it, we will never be quite the same again. ",
