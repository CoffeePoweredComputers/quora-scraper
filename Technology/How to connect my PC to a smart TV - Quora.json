            "answer_text": "If you prefer to do it wireless and on Windows 10, I may have something in store for you. I would first suggest you to be on the same network as your TV and make sure your PC is set to project a duplicate screen. (Select Win+P and you will see the options to project). When you\u2019re done with the above settings, just select the option \u2018Connect\u2019 from the notifications bar to your right to connect your PC to an external device on your network and select your Smart TV from the list of devices listed. PS: The \u2018Connect\u2019 option will look something like this with the verb \u2018connect\u2019 on it.  ",
