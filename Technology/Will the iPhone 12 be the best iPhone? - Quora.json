            "answer_text": "In this day and age where new technologies are often leaked to oblivion months before their release, it\u2019s very difficult to be genuinely impressed when they eventually come out. Many new features of the iPhone 12 lineup were already anticipated two, three, even four months ago. We knew about 5G. We knew about MagSafe for wireless charging. We knew about LiDAR. We knew about the \u201cnew\u201d flat-edged design. We knew about iPhone 12 Mini. We knew about A14 Bionic. We knew that Apple was removing the charger and earpods from the box. But all the leaks also came with another drawback\u2014 they made us anticipate for features that never happened. Almost all of the mainstream tech media were teasing supposed \u201cactual renders\u201d for the iPhone 12, which appeared to have a smaller notch, four rear cameras, and even USB Type-C\u2014 none of which actually happened. A 120 Hz refresh rate display was highly anticipated since the beginning of 2020. That didn\u2019t happen either (I\u2019ll get into this later).  That\u2019s not to say that the iPhone 12 lineup didn\u2019t impress. Let\u2019s start with the \u201cHOORAY!\u201d: iPhone 12 finally has OLED.OLED has also made it possible for Apple to shrink the bezels around the display, which is a significant improvement over iPhone 11\u2019s ugly thick bezels.iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s ProRAW image format is genuinely impressive. At last, the \u201cPro\u201d naming scheme is no longer just marketing jargon\u2014 it now actually means something.Similarly, live Dolby Vision video recording is also really impressive. Now, I don\u2019t think this is quite going to \u201crevolutionize the film industry\u201d like Apple claims it will, but nonetheless it will certainly make amateur videos much higher quality. Then there\u2019s the \u201cMEH\u2026\u201d: MagSafe is a bit of a mixed bag. Personally, I have never had any issues aligning phones to wireless chargers, and I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s a real problem for other people as well. Furthermore, the name really bothers me, because \u201cMagSafe\u201d was originally the name of a very useful MacBook feature that prevented users from tripping over the charging cable, thus causing the MacBook to be dragged off the table. So why is this new wireless charging feature called MagSafe? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me.What is good about MagSafe is that is allows accessories to magnetically attach to the back of the phone. That wallet attachment is particularly nice.Right now, 5G is a gimmick for 99% of the population. I have a 5G phone and I live in a city with 5G towers everywhere, and believe me, it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. So far, I have never been in a situation where I\u2019ve been thankful to have 5G. No doubt that 5G is the future, but the way I see it, we are at least a few years away from seeing any practical mainstream use for 5G\u2014 and in a few years, you\u2019ll be upgrading your iPhone anyway, so\u2026On one hand, I love the look of the \u201cnew\u201d flat-edged iPhone. On the other hand, I can\u2019t help but feel like the sharper edges will make the phone less comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Then again, some people might argue that it\u2019s a good idea to discourage people from being on their phones all the time.Ceramic Shield is supposedly \u201ctougher than any smartphone glass\u201d, but let\u2019s not forget, this isn\u2019t the first time Apple has made such a claim. Apple has previously made similar claims about their Sapphire Glass on the Apple Watch, but scientific tests have proven it to be no more resistant to scratching and cracking than regular glass. So until independent durability tests come out, I am skeptical of the Ceramic Shield. Lastly, there\u2019s the \u201cFUCKING HELL!\u201d: There\u2019s really only one genuinely bad thing about the iPhone 12 lineup\u2014 60 Hz refresh rate displays, all across the board. Even without the constant tech media pressure to upgrade to 120 Hz displays, the fact that even mid-range Android phones have higher refresh rate displays should\u2019ve been a sign to Apple that this is a must-have feature. Because, when you walk into a Best Buy or a Verizon store or a Target, and you see the iPhone 12 Pro demo right next to the Samsung Galaxy S20 demo (120 Hz) and the Google Pixel 5 demo (90 Hz), the FIRST thing that consumers will notice is that the S20 and Pixel 5 displays look so much smoother. Even the difference between 60 Hz and 90 Hz is palpable. And the excuse of \u201cthey had to choose between 5G and 120 Hz to preserve battery life\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it, either. The Samsung Galaxy S20 manages both, and still has decent battery life. We gave Apple the pass for not having high refresh rate displays in 2019 because very few companies were doing it, and nobody was sure whether it was a must-have feature for average consumers. But now in late 2020, it\u2019s no longer justifiable to price phones at $1000 that don\u2019t also have high refresh rate displays. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t worth buying if you already have another phone that does what you want well enough that the price of the new phone minus whatever you will get for the old phone (including the hassle of selling it, or factoring in the smaller price you would get trading it in directly or sending it to gazelle) doesn\u2019t seem like a good deal to you. Save this answer and use it again when new phones come out. You can apply it to non iPhones as well. Also with a little replacement you can use it for cars, airplanes, guns, washing machines, sandwitches, and floor fans. For me the new one is new, and since I wrote apps for it and many many people expect it to be fantastic on the new one, well there you go. Worth it. If I didn\u2019t have that reason, well I have the 11. Spec wise the 12 is more impressive in pretty much every way that matters to me, by maybe 20% and also 5x faster at video encode which once in a while I care a lot about, but not frequently, and it has 5G which I do t think I care about. Maybe I would give it a miss\u2026except\u2026it comes in blue and I love blue, and it is styled very much like the old iPhone 4 which I really liked the design of. \u2026so maybe? Yeah, if I had a hunk of spare change I would rather get that then a set of 8 garden boxes or a new rug and a half for the dining room or the other sort of stuff I have been spending that kind of money on lately. Other people can have very different valid situations and choices. Including \u201cI have an iPhone 11 and that seems good enough\u201d, and \u201cI have an iPhone 6 and don\u2019t care what is new\u201d, and \u201cI have a hand me down iPhone 8, and would love the 12, but would rather be able to pay rent and you know buy food\u201d, oh and also \u201cI like android phones better\u201d, and even \u201cI don\u2019t like cellphones and don\u2019t want one in my life\u201d, and well as \u201ccan I eat it\u203d does it smell like a butt\u203d (presumably this is the option of a dog) However all the stuff that goes into that choice is personal. If anything is improved on any product that is reason for someone to buy it, but likewise if near everything is improved on a product there is someone out there that it will be utterly wrong for. ",
