            "answer_text": "Some of the most intriguing technologies are already out and about in the world. While these technological developments are being explored, it is making way for the innovation of new technologies. Let me tell you some of the ones that I believe could shape the future for us: The technology of Autonomous Things (AuT) will provide gadgets like drones, robots, vehicles, electronic appliances with the ability to coordinate and cover different areas of the environment. They won\u2019t have the capacity of decision-making and learning, but they will be able to assist humans in multiple tasks.The concept of Digital Twin might not be new, but it\u2019s future-facing. It is a simple digital mirror image of a real-life object, process or system. This means that with time, people will be able to manage and control physical systems digitally.We all know Tesla\u2019s Self-drive Cars where all you need to do is enter the end destination and sit back. The car\u2019s ability to judge traffic, follow signals and turn as per map instructions has made it a cutting edge addition to ease human effortsOf course, there are many such developments in the world of science and technology. But these 3 have appealed to me the most! ",

            "answer_text": "I think one of the top technologies that will blow anyone\u2019s mind is Artificial Conversational Entities (ACEs) or conversational agents (chatbots). A chatbot is a software program that can hold a conversation with a human user. They essentially automate one to one conversations. But don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that all they do is talk to you. They can do everything from turning your lights on to advising you on what investments you should be making. Siri is one of the examples. However, Siri or Alexa are examples of virtual agents. Chatbots are more than this.  But you cannot forget the latest on the team - Meena! Google Meena differs from other chatbots in the market is by the complexity of conversations that it is capable of. Meena can conduct conversations that are more sensible and specific than existing state-of-the-art chatbots. Know more here.  Do let me your thoughts in comments. ",
