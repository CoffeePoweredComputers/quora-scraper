            "answer_text": "Apples are like Cadillac. They only build really nice cars. All have at least a mid-powered engine, comfortable seating, and nice, higher end quality throughout. PC\u2019s are like the combined total of all computer manufacturers in the world. There are some Smart cars (cheap junk), some Cadillacs and there are some Bugatti\u2019s. Leaving the analogy behind: The quality of a Mac can be had in a Windows PC/laptop at a fraction of the price. The Windows PC/laptop will also have many times the software selection. Even Microsoft Office on a Mac isn\u2019t the complete Microsoft Office (missing VBA capability that is often used in business). You are very literally paying much more for less capability and less choice. Why buy Mac? Specifically because of the lack of software. I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but it is really the only reason that Mac makes sense. Because Macs are such a small segment of the computing world, virus and malware makers ignore Macs for the most part. You don\u2019t get nearly the selection of software both for the things you want and for the things you don\u2019t. Also, since businesses run on Windows PC\u2019s, I think kids should be taught to use the machine that the real world uses. So, to answer your question: Who should buy an iMac? A person who wants a nice laptop for home use, has few software needs, and is willing to spend more money to buy from a known quality brand and avoid researching the masses of competitors. ",
