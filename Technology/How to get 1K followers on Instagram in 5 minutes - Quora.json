Get Instagram Followers by Joining Instagram Engagement Groups Ever wondered what people who get Instagram followers fast do differently? They join engagement groups (aka. Instagram pods). While it can be tempting to join the biggest Instagram engagement groups, the truth is you\u2019ll get a more targeted list of Instagram followers by sticking to your niche. The tactic is best for entrepreneurs just starting to learn how to get followers on Instagram.  You can find engagement groups for travel, beauty, fashion and more. In these groups, you can get followers and likes from people who have shared interests. But if you\u2019re serious about getting their attention, you should also return the favor by following fan pages for people who join the group. I\u2019ve had friends get 2,000 new followers in only a couple weeks using this strategy. While it might not help with immediate sales, it helps you gain credibility early on so your Instagram page doesn\u2019t show that you only have a handful of followers. Remember, this is more of a short-term strategy for your first few weeks on Instagram, not a long-term one for getting Instagram followers. You can learn other awesome Instagram tricks like this #2. Repost Others\u2019 Content to Gain More Instagram Followers When I was starting out with social media marketing and building my store\u2019s Instagram following, my entire posting strategy revolved around reposting other people\u2019s content. While doing this, I made sure to credit the original poster in my descriptions, every time. It\u2019s the only way to gain followers without getting flagged. When I first started, I\u2019d take screenshots and add the pictures to my Instagram. What really helped my page take off was the Repost app. It allowed me to start reposting video content on Instagram. One of the biggest home runs I had was when I re-posted a video that amassed 52,862 views, got 1264 comments and 9,147 likes. At the time, I didn\u2019t even have 10,000 followers so this was a big freaking deal.  Why\u2019d I repost other people\u2019s content instead of posting my own? Because I knew that it was easier to repost content. Plus, my visual and video content would never be as good as someone else\u2019s. Hey, at least I\u2019m honest about it! How did I know what to repost? I\u2019d peek at the numbers. Hashtags are a great way to get new followers. I was pretty active on Instagram so I\u2019d browse the list of hashtags I came up with and used daily to find the top performing posts that weren\u2019t posted by other fan pages (so not my competitors) but by individual people. I\u2019d then watch the videos and look at the pictures to see which ones I had the biggest reactions to. If I felt the urge to share someone else\u2019s post, I knew I had to repost it onto my page. So if you\u2019re just learning how to get followers on Instagram, this high-impact strategy is simple enough for a beginner. Important: Instagram has now updated their policy and you\u2019re required to ask for permission before reposting. #3. Get Promoted on Buzzfeed to Grow Your Instagram Followers To get that Instagram followers boost, you need to find a way to tap into a massive audience. And no one embeds Instagram posts into their content as much as Buzzfeed. A Buzzfeed staff member wrote an article about how she grew her personal brand as an Instagram influencer. She currently has almost 8,900 followers, but the article she wrote on the platform might\u2019ve helped. So if you want to experiment with Buzzfeed, head over to its Community section where anyone can post their own content onto their platform. Of course, you\u2019ll need to follow their guidelines to get visibility and build trust.  Is Buzzfeed not right for your niche? That\u2019s cool. You can also use a tool called HARO where you get emails three times a day filled with requests from reporters who\u2019re looking to get content and expert quotes for their stories. Most HARO reporters allow a website link and social links. So you can hit two birds with one stone by getting a link to your store and Instagram account. #4. Ask Customers to Share Their Photos to Build Instagram Followers When you\u2019re just starting out, getting followers on Instagram will be a lot easier with customer photos in your feed. Why? It helps increase social proof.  If you\u2019ve never had a customer before, reach out to in your niche with under 5,000 followers. I know the number seems low but influencers with few followers on Instagram want to monetize their accounts and will be willing to take pictures with your products at a much lower rate. for every sale they score with their customer referral link. If you\u2019ve already had a couple of sales, reach out to customers and offer a free gift or cash incentive for taking quality images with the product they purchased. Offering incentives isn\u2019t going to be your long-term strategy but for the short-term, while you try to build your brand, this can help you grow. As more customers start seeing customer photos on your Instagram, they\u2019ll naturally start tagging you in posts when they receive their products. In a nutshell, if you comment on customers\u2019 posts, repost their content and follow them, you\u2019ll likely get them to follow you back. Though some will follow you after tagging you in their post on their own. Get that word-of-mouth going! ",
