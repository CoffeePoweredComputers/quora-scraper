            "answer_text": "China is a big, powerful country and now is the second largest economy in the world. Known as the People\u2019s Republic of China which was established in 1949 when the Chinese Communists defeated Chinese Nationalists in a bloody civil war and took control of all China except the island of Taiwan. After being defeated by the communists, the Chinese Nationalists retreated to Taiwan and some small outlying islands and continued to exist as the Republic of China, a.k.a. Taiwan as a separate, independent political entity from China. Since 1949, China has been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to this date, with tremendous economic progress since it changed the course from socialist planned economy to the market economy system in 1980. Taiwan on the other hand, carried on with the implementation of the market economy and transition to a full blown liberal democratic society. Politically, Taiwan has been heavily suppressed and pressured by China to be united under China\u2019s terms which Taiwan rejected so far. Now, let\u2019s examine the two societies. In comparing China vs. Taiwan, Taiwan is doing better than China in many areas that you may not notice, but are crucial for a modern, progressive society that may shed some light for the future of China. COMPARING TAIWAN vs. CHINA: CONSTITUTION The foremost and most importantly, Taiwan enjoys political freedom in a liberal democratic society, while China is under the absolute rule in every aspect of people\u2019s life of the Chinese Communist Party. Why is this important? Because this aspect alone defines how the society and government functions for the people. This is the first two articles of the Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China:   As you can see, even the first article of PRC\u2019s Constitution raises many questions: (1)\tThe PRC is .. led by the \u201cworking class\u201d and on the alliance of \u201cworkers and peasants\u201d?! No one in the right mind believes that China is led by \u201cworking class\u201d, \u201cworkers\u201d and \u201cpeasants\u201d any more. On the contrary, the working class of workers and peasants are on the bottom of Chinese society as many of them are the poorest and most oppressed class in modern China. On the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is high above even the state as the ruling class of PRC and is only perceived on \u201c alliance of workers and peasants\u201d on paper.  There are 300,000,000 migrant peasant workers in China. Do you think CCP is in any way alliance with them? (2)\tThe Article 36 of the Amendment to the Constitution of PRCC in 2018 which added one sentence, which specifically named the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as the absolute ruler of the country and defines the socialist system as the basic system in the PRC. Do people of China have any choice in this? (3)\tThe third sentence reads: [\u201cSabotage\u201d of the socialist system by any organization or individual is prohibited. ]. This is the most terrifying words as you can get in any constitution of any country in the world. It actually means that any Chinese citizen says or does something that is not in line with the view of the absolute ruler, the CCP, at its sole discretion and determination, is subject to punishment. The first sentence of the second article of PRC\u2019s Constitution declares solemnly, that: \u201cAll power in the PRC belongs to the people\u201d. Now, question: (1)\tIf all power belong to the people, isn\u2019t this in contradictory to the first article, where it says the absolute power resides with the CCP? (2)\tIf the power belongs to the people, then shouldn\u2019t the people have the power to choose the type of society other than socialism? (3)\tIf the power belongs to the people, then the citizens of China should be free to say what they want and do what they want as in a democratic society. But, do they have this freedom? Now, let\u2019s look at the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan)   Three Principles of the People was first proposed by Dr. Sun Yet Sen, who led the revolution to overthrown the last dynasty of Qing and founded the modern Republic of China in 1911. The constitution is centered on the Three Principles of the People (Chinese: \u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9; pinyin: S\u0101n M\u00edn Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) are Minzu (\u6c11\u65cf), Minquan (\u6c11\u6b0a), and Minsheng (\u6c11\u751f), roughly defined as nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people, which called for the establishment of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. A government of the people invoked the idea of civic nationalism of China. A government by the people sought to create a Western parliamentary democracy and a separation of powers. A government for the people means that the government to a certain extent must provide services that are essential to the well-being of society. Taiwan, since 1990\u2019s has developed into a fully liberal, democratic society based on rule of law with multi-party parliamentary system. The people of Taiwan enjoys more freedom than the people of the PRC. Below are the results of global studies and research where all of the global indices depicts that Taiwan is ahead of China in many areas that are important to the livelihood of the people. Comparison between political hierarchy of China and Taiwan  In China, the CCP is the absolute ruler of the country, and controls the military force directly and is above the STATE and PEOPLE.  The People\u2019s Liberation Army is UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE CCP, NOT THE STATE! The PLA is the tool of the CCP to solidify and maintain its power, and is used to control and suppress Chinese people when necessary. The June 4 1989 incidence of PLA\u2019s tanks crushing the peaceful student demonstrators demanding political freedom is a vivid example. On the contrary in Taiwan, the PEOPLE is on top of the political hierarchy. Citizens of Taiwan have complete freedom to assemble and form political parties, which in turn compete in political campaign and the elected wining party forms a government for the people as in a liberal democratic society. One of the most important and achievements and often overlooked in Taiwan\u2019s peaceful transition to a liberal democratic society is the NATIONALIZATION OF THE MILITARY FORCE.  Taiwan\u2019s military force is a national asset and upholds a position of political neutrality which means it is not associated with any political parties. Throughout the five thousand years of Chinese history, the military force or army is the most important private asset of the emperors, feudatories, tribe heads, warlords, and political parties. The army is employed to protect its ruler, not the people. It is until July 15, 1987, when the ruling party of the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Nationalist Party (\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8), announced the abolishment of the Martial Law, that Taiwan began her transition from an authoritarian to a liberal democratic society. What followed the political transformation in Taiwan since, was a peaceful transition of government with different political parties some times have complete opposite political views. Taiwan has achieved one of the most remarkable accomplishment in Chinese history : the Nationalization of the military force. Today, Taiwan\u2019s Army is independent of any political parties and its sole mission to serve and protect the people of Taiwan.

Taiwan out ranks China by 165 places in the Freedom in the World 2019 ranking! China is not a free country, and is one of the least free countries in the world, ranked number 191 out of 212 countries. 2019 Index of Economic Freedom, The Heritage Foundation  A measurement of 12 different economic factors from property rights to financial freedom.

However, one of the reasons that Taiwan is not ranked higher is precisely the external military and security threat from China which pulls down the ranking, but Taiwan is still way ahead of China (placed 110th). COMPARING TAIWAN CHINA: ECONOMICS Taiwan vs. China : GGP Per Capita Growth Analysis from 1960 to 2019  In comparing GDP figures between Taiwan and China, the total GDP by each does not make any sense because China (1.4B) has much larger population then Taiwan (23M). So, the GDP per capita makes a lot more sense for analyzing the development of economy of each country. The GDP per capita figures shown above was taken from the Statistical authorities of Taiwan and China from 1960 to 2019 in U.S. dollars. A number of observations can be extracted from above GDP per capita chart as follows: GDP Per Capita (c/p) US$ Item of Comparison\t\tTaiwan \t\tChina \t Remarks\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 GDP p/c in 2019\t\t$25,909\t\t$10,098\t Taiwan is 2.5x of China GDP p/c in 1960/2019\t$163/$25,909\t$89/$10,098\tTaiwan grow by 159x, China 113x 25 years of fastest growth Taiwan: 1968-1992\t\t$319/$10,716\t\t\t\tTaiwan grow by 34x China: 1989-2014 \t\t\t\t\t$310/$7,651\tChina grow by 23x In Summary, by comparing the GDP per capita of Taiwan and China: By 2019, Taiwan\u2019s GDP per capita is 2.5 times of China (US$25,909 vs. US$10,098) From 1960 to 2019, Taiwan\u2019s GDP per capita grew by 159 times and China grew 113 times Comparing the fastest 25 years of economic growth ( both starting from about US$300 per capita) Taiwan from 1968-1992, GDP per capita grew from $319 to $10,716, a growth of 34 times. China from 1989-2014, GDP per capita grew from $310 to $7,651, a growth of 23 times. No matter how you look at the economic performance, Taiwan out performs China by a wide margin starting from 1949 to this date. GDP per Capita (PPP) 2019 World Ranking:  Data Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook database, April 2019 World ranking of GDP per Capital 2019 in current international dollars reflecting a single current year\u2019s exchange rate and PPP adjustments, of selected countries of 191 ( US$, ranking in brackets): Taiwan ($55,078, #17), Germany ($53,567, #10), United Kingdom ($46,827, #27), Japan ($45,546 #28), Korea ($44,740, #29), Italy ($40,470, #33), and China ($19,504, #69) In terms of GDP Purchasing Power Parity per capita, Taiwan is one of the top 20 richest countries in the world and is, surprisingly, ahead of many wealthy countries like Germany, France, UK, Japan and South Korea. Taiwan is 2.8 times higher and way ahead of China by 52 places. Foreign Exchange Reserve per capita  In terms of Foreign Exchange reserves, China is undoubtedly the world leader with more than three trillion dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. However, in comparing foreign exchange reserves per capita basis, Taiwan is doing much better then China: Foreign Exchange Reserve per capita in US$: Taiwan: US$20,217 China: US$2,176 Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserve per capita is more than China\u2019s by a factor of 10! Doing Business 2020, World Bank, Comparing Business Regulations in 190 Economies  Ease of Doing Business World Ranking of selected countries ( in brackets): Taiwan(15), Germany(22), Canada(23), Japan(39), China(31) It is much easier for both local and foreign companies and corporations to set up business and conduct business in Taiwan than in China as Taiwan ranks 15th place in the world in the world by the World Bank, and China ranks 31th. Health Care Index by Country 2020 (Numbeo.com) World Ranking of Health Care Index by Country of Selected countries of 93 ( in the order of best health care systems)  Taiwan (1), Korea(2), Japan(3), UK(13), Germany(17), Singapore (25), Hong Kong (42), China (47) TAIWAN RANKS NO. 1 IN THE WORLD in terms of health care system for her citizens. At the time of this writing, the entire world is facing the Coronavirus Pandemic. We all know that the Coronavirus outbreak started from China in Jan. 2020, and has over 80,000 infected cases by mid March. Many world health observers and analysts predicted in the beginning of the outbreak that, because of Taiwan\u2019s proximity and high number of travelers with China, Taiwan was expected to have the second highest number of infected cases after China. Now, 2 months later in mid March, Taiwan has done extremely well because of her excellent health care system, technological advancement, as well as cooperation of her entire society and people.  As of March 21, 2020, Taiwan has only 153 infected cases of Coronavirus, and over half of them were imported by travelers from overseas. Worldwide, Taiwan ranked 59th place in terms of number of infected cased. It\u2019s also worth noting that during this period, Taiwan did not have any lock-downs of any communities, cities, towns or hospitals. People were able to go about their own business as usual with some added cautiousness. Some of the reasons why Taiwan is successful in containing the Coronavirus: (1)\tTaiwan did not follow completely the advice of the World Health Organization whose information were just too little, too late, and started taking actions as early as Dec. 31, 2019. (2)\tTaiwan quickly organized a command organization headed by a group of dedicated, experienced professionals from various cognizant organizations such as health care, medical, transportation, foreign affairs, education, administration and any other may be involved to combat the spread of the disease. (3)\tThe Command Center conducted daily news conference with updated information on the situation. (4)\tUsing the latest technology in health care, digital device, big data, etc. to track, trace suspected cases and distribute necessary supplies such as face masks. (5)\tCooperation from Taiwan\u2019s citizens. In short, Taiwan did quite well in stopping the spread of coronavirus. The Global Entrepreneurship Index 2019  World Ranking of the Global Entrepreneurship Index 2019 of selected countries of 137 ( in brackets ): Taiwan(18), Korea(21), Japan(26), Singapore(27), China(34) One of the key drivers of economic growth in Taiwan is the entrepreneurship of the people. Therefore, the environment for people to take on the opportunities to engage in creative business activities is very important for the growth of economy. In the area of entrepreneurship, Taiwan is ahead of South Korea, Japan, Singapore and China.

Here is one English young man posted one video comparing Taipei vs. Beijing. Enjoy. Youtube: Taipei vs. Beijing  Taiwan is far from perfect, and has lots of room for improvement. However, I hope by now you may have some idea why Taiwan with many flaws is still better than China. This is why Taiwanese want to keep their freedom and lifestyle at any cost, and resist any forced \u201cunification\u201d efforts by China in spite of Taiwan is constantly facing military threat, suppression, and coercion from China.

            "answer_text": "-Food : As a bigger place, Mainland has more variety of food, but Taiwan, despite being small, also has many variety of food and some of them are very exotic and alien to me. Mainland foods are generally more oily (Don\u2019t know why ?). In this aspect, I give it a draw. -Accent : Taiwanese accent is close to the province of Fujian, where it tends to be soft with very strong static sound when pronouncing \u201cs\u201d/\u201dx\u201d/\u201dsh\u201d. As for Mainland, it\u2019s very diverse, but if we talk about majority, they tend to be louder than Taiwanese with a tendency to be more in-throat. Personally, majority of Mainland accent is more pleasing to hear for me, but I don\u2019t like their loud voice volume, so I prefer Taiwanese ultimately. -Music : Taiwanese music is much, much better, and its music is very well known among Southeast Asian Chinese. I think Mainland China has younger history of modern music due to restrictions in the past. -Behavior : Mainland tourists are known for talking very loud and it is not uncommon to find Mainland tourists who like to skip queue, littering, and spitting on the sidewalk. These things are rarely found among Taiwanese. -Politics : This is a bit bias because I support democracy and freedom of speech, so it\u2019s Taiwan for me. Also, I don\u2019t like how the Mainland government is banning YouTube, Facebook, and other international sites, which I believe is crucial to let their people know what foreigners think of them. And then there\u2019s the cultural revolution, which I think is a disaster for China, except for the part where foot binding is finally banned. -Hygiene : Overall, Taiwanese people are more hygienic due to the absence of spitting and dirty toilets, as well as the lack of people who let their kids to poo on public space. -The people : China is a huge country and very diverse, so it\u2019s very unfair to generalize. But if we talk about the majority of Mainland Chinese that I encountered vs majority of the Taiwanese I met, I would say Taiwanese put heavier emphasize on politeness and are more likely to be concerned of human rights/animal rights. I also think the Taiwanese society is more egalitarian which I find ironic because Taiwan is capitalist while Mainland is socialist with communist legacy. Mainlanders, in my point of view, are funnier because their behavior is more \u201cexotic\u201d. Mainland has just been opened to the world outside in the 80s, so they\u2019re not as globalized as Taiwanese. As the result, much of their behavior, mentality, and taste are more exotic in the eyes of foreigners. For mentality and behavior, I prefer Taiwanese, but for entertainment, I prefer Mainlanders. -Military : Obviously Mainland is a lot more powerful. -Technology : Both are relatively advanced and have given a lot of innovation in modern times. However, considering how small the population of Taiwan is relative to the amount of modern inventions that they made, I think the Taiwanese deserve more praise in this aspect. -Women : On average, Mainland women are prettier. Some of the prettiest women I\u2019ve ever seen are from the Mainland. To be honest, I don\u2019t like the beauty standard of both places, but if we consider natural face, Mainland wins. -History : Taiwanese history is interesting, but compared to Mainland ? Not even close. -Living standards : Chinese cities are very advanced, but many of its rural places are still very backward when compared to Taiwan. Also, the pollution problem in Mainland cities are so much worse than Taiwan. The food safety standard is also a lot lower. I\u2019ve eaten snacks from both places and I\u2019m more likely to get mouth ulcer when eating Mainland snacks. Food scandals are very common in China and this is very well known among overseas Chinese. I heard that when Starbucks planned to operate in China, they didn\u2019t have to change anything in order to maintain the foreign impression given that locals are more less likely to trust local brands when it comes to food/drink safety. -Tradition : Taiwan didn\u2019t suffer the Cultural Revolution like Mainland did, so Taiwanese are more likely to be connected to their ancestral tradition. -Language : I prefer Taiwan\u2019s traditional Mandarin letters because they look more artistic and carry more heritage, but I also like Mainland\u2019s simplified version for being more practical. -Politics : What I like about Mainland\u2019s single party system is that because it keeps being ruled by the same party, the policies and programs that are made will not be compromised by change of political rulers. This is especially important for policies/programs that require a long term process. However, I still prefer Taiwan for the freedom of expression and the lack of censorship, as well as more concern with human rights. -Fashion : I prefer Mainland\u2019s sense of fashion because it\u2019s more likely to be unique and innovate, whereas Taiwanese fashion is more like Japanese/French fashion where everything looks more conventional. -Modern culture : Mainland\u2019s modern culture is more interesting because it\u2019s more unique. This country has just opened itself to the world outside in the 80s and as the result, they have a lot of uniqueness. For instance, the car brand Buick is unpopular in USA, but very popular in China. Mainland also has many unique trends, which I believe is the result of the ban of foreign social media. For instance, growing armpit hair for women used to be a common trend in Mainland some few years ago. To the eyes of foreigners, this is very exotic and unique. Taiwanese trends are more globalized.
