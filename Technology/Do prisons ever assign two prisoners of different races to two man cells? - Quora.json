            "answer_text": "\u201cDo prisons ever assign two prisoners of different races to two man cells?\u201d Yes, this is very common. They also do so with people serving drastically different sentences, for drastically different crimes, different religions, different nationalities, different sexual preferences, etc. If there is an obvious conflicting situation then it is the responsibility of both prisoners in the cell to request some sort of housing assignment change. That request doesn\u2019t have to be honored by the prison, but generally it is if it\u2019s a mutual request and there are specific cell transfers included that suggest exactly what shuffle game would be a more appropriate housing assignment. However, if the prison put two people in that housing assignment intentionally (because they didn\u2019t like one or both prisoners) then the prisoners are going to have to deal with it by either learning to co-exist or by other means.
