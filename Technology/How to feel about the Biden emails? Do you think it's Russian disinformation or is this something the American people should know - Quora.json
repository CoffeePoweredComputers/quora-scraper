            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do you feel about the Biden emails? Do you think it's Russian disinformation or is this something the American people should know?\u201d I think it is something that should not be suppressed by the liberal media and Democrat Elite. The people should be allowed to make their own decisions. Keep in mind, it will not, at this late date, hinder Biden\u2019s chances of becoming President of the United States. Most Democrats don\u2019t believe he is corrupt, no matter what damning evidence. Those who do believe he is, don\u2019t care. They would rather have a corrupt Joe Biden than have a Donald Trump. Now to the Russians being behind it. It\u2019s amazing how Democrats give so much clandestine credit to the Russians. Russian collusion was debunked by the two year Mueller Investigation that cost $25 million, involved 19 Democrat lawyers trying to implicate Trump, and dozens of subpoenaed testimonies. And the reason for all of that was Hilary Clinton and her gang setting up a fake Steele dossier to implicate Trump to better her chances to become President of the United States. It all came about because of a crooked Hilary tried to make it seem Donald Trump and his family were colluding with the Russians to win an election. And still, today, despite the Mueller Investigation, multiple Congressional hearings on the same subject, the Democrats are not satisfied. Everything to them is that Russia is behind it. And when their darling, Joe Biden, is implicated in corruption. But it\u2019s not his fault, the Russians did it. Oh, wait, maybe not the Russians, it\u2019s Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u2019s attorney, or maybe some Trump crooks who set Biden up. Then, of course, the liberal media that controls 90% of all information to the public in America, suppresses the information as fake, and so do the Democrat Elite politicians. Yep, anything about their darling is fake; anything about Trump, which was actually fake, is TRUE!. Talk about a double standard, there it is blaring at you. ",

            "answer_text": "The emails sound legitimate to me. The rush to claim them as fraud seem to me to be a matter of protesting too much. They could be an attempt at a \u201clate hit\u201d aka \u201cOctober surprise\u201d which could be suspicious, but still only circumstantial. A lot of objections (e.g. Hunter lives on the west coast, the repair shop is in Wilmington, Delaware - the Biden\u2019s hometown) can, and I expect will, all be investigated and either confirmed or debunked. To me the two things that lend credibility to the emails is the fact that the source is American, the owner of that repair shop. If he is part of some sort of fraudulent or foreign (especially Russian) effort to interfere with the US election he\u2019s involved in a serious crime for which he can wind up being held accountable. This is opposite the situation that surrounded the Trump-Russian collusion imbroglio where the sources of the accusations against Trump were foreign-based, one being British and the other, the primary source, Russian (also a suspected Russian intelligence agent (figure that one out!). The second thing is the FBI\u2019s sitting on the emails from December 2019 until August. If the FBI suspected Russian meddling and fraud it should have been all over it. For instance, if the hard drive was brought into the shop by an agent of a foreign power impersonating Hunter, that would be a serious incident requiring follow-up. Why didn\u2019t the FBI pursue this thing? It apparently never again contacted the shop owner after he gave it the hard drive and provided access to it. Maybe it was frozen into inaction out of fear of getting dragged into another election controversy. Did the local FBI office just camp on it just hoping nothing would happen before the election? not an unreasonable hope. After all the owner waited until August 2020, before he contacted a number of Republican sources, and then, according to the NY Post only after hearing about the Hunter Biden-Ukraine connection in the news and connecting that in turn to what he\u2019d seen in the emails. Here is the timeline as laid out by Miranda Divine in her New York Post column: \u201cOn April 12, 2019, a man who calls himself Hunter Biden enters a Wilmington, Del., Mac repair shop with three \u201cliquid-damaged\u201d computers just before closing time. The owner says one computer is beyond repair. Another has a fried keyboard, so the owner gives Hunter a spare keyboard. The third laptop, a MacBook, is salvageable. Hunter signs a work order to confirm he wants him to fix it and provides contact details. The owner \u2014 whom The Post promised anonymity, even though he has since been named by others \u2014 recovers the content of the laptop and transfers it to his server. He calls Hunter and asks him to bring in an external drive, onto which he can transfer the content. Hunter arrives at closing time with the external drive. He never sets foot inside the store again. The owner makes frequent attempts to contact Hunter to pick up his laptop, pay the $85 bill and return the keyboard and cord. No reply. After 90 days, as per the work order signed by Hunter, the laptop becomes the store\u2019s legal property. In August (2019), the computer repairman hears news reports about the leaked phone call in which President Trump raises Hunter and Joe Biden\u2019s Burisma activity with Ukraine\u2019s president \u2014 the call which sparked his impeachment. The repairman does a word search of Burisma on Hunter\u2019s laptop. Bingo (emphasis mine). Four months later, the impeachment is big news, so he decides to contact the FBI, via a friend, in case the material on the laptop is useful. On Dec. 9 two FBI agents take away the laptop and hard drive. In August this year, the repairman sees Giuliani on TV talking about Hunter and Burisma and decides to contact him via an e-mail address he finds online. This is how the repairman explained his actions in an e-mail to Giuliani on Aug. 27, 2020: \u201cAs I read deeper into the drive, I started to realize what I was sitting on and who was involved and at what level. I figured the safest thing to do was reach out to the FBI and have them collect the drive and the Mac so I could wash my hands of it and they might be able offer me some level of protection should someone come looking for it and come after me because I knew what was on it. The FBI did show up and . . . over the next few days they contacted me for access to the drive . . . because their tech guys didn\u2019t know Macs. \u201cThat kind of threw up a flag . . . \u201cThey also said nothing ever happens to people who don\u2019t talk about this stuff so that got me a little concerned . . . \u201cThere is some very incriminating videos on the drive . . . \u201cI live and work in [the Bidens\u2019 hometown] Wilmington, Delaware and my life here as well as my business would be destroyed if people found out what I was involved in. \u201cI have been trying to keep things quiet . . . but I feel time has been running out.\u201d The e-mail was compelling. Within two days, a copy of the hard drive was FedEx\u2019d to a Long Island address where Giuliani and his lawyer examined it, and verified the material was genuine. Bannon, a former Trump adviser, was only peripherally involved. He was brought in by Giuliani in late September to help decipher the China material. Shortly thereafter, Bannon alerted The Post to the existence of the material, although he did not have a copy. On Sunday a week ago Giuliani provided The Post with a copy of the hard drive. It is not hard to believe that Hunter would be as reckless as to abandon a laptop at a repair shop. In October 2016, he left a crack pipe in a Hertz rental car in Arizona, along with a white powdery substance, credit cards and his driver\u2019s license, as widely reported.\u201d One of the both tragic and terrifying things about this Hunter Biden email affair is that if it is true, the profound lack of interest in them on the part of most of our fourth estate, and the huge number of people posting on Quora and other discussion sites insisting, right away, that they\u2019re fake. This strikes me as a rush to judgement, somehow \u201coverdone\u201d and a possible attempt at damage control by Biden partisans who are concerned solely about heading off political damage to their guy.
