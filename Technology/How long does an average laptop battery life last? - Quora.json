            "answer_text": "There are two kind of battery life. One is how long will the battery last before it\u2019s no longer an effective battery. That\u2019s pretty much the same for all modern laptops \u2014 about 300\u2013500 full charges. That\u2019s what you can expect from today\u2019s Li-ion batteries. The good news is that most people don\u2019t let their laptop die every day, to they typically last longer. But not forever. My daughter used her MacBook quite a bit on battery. I bought her that for college. She graduated this past May\u2026 her MacBook hasn\u2019t been able to be battery powered in over a year. Yes, we could get Apple to replace it. The other is how long you expect a laptop to run on a battery. That\u2019s actually a pretty wide range, even for the same laptop. The battery management software, the CPUs, etc. are so clever about battery life, a laptop that runs 2 hours on heavy use might last 6\u20138 hours just doing email or Quora. Even changing the brightness of the display can have a real-world impact. So how you test it matters. Laptop Magazine is one that does these things. In their standard battery life test (How We Test Laptops for Review), their top 20 laptops for battery life (Laptops with the Longest Battery Life) range from 10\u201317 hours. I have a pretty high powered laptop, with an i7 quad core processor, 4K screen, nVidia GPU, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD\u2026 I can get six hours on it, but not doing CAD or video all those hours. It is the case that more expensive laptops usually have larger batteries, but also, they eat more power. My Samsung tablet can go over 11 hours on a charge, but it\u2019s not a Windows PC\u2026 can\u2019t use it for work. Even those long-lived Lenovos in the Laptop wouldn\u2019t be useful for my work \u2014 low rez screen, not enough RAM, slower CPU, etc. But for others, just dandy. The laptop I replaced with this current ASUS Lifebook, a 17\u2033 HP model, got me abotu 2\u20133 hours on a charge. And that one became too slow for work after awhile. So we have seen progress. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the laptop. to figure out what your specific laptop should get find the model number and look up reviews online for your laptop. You might also mean how long will the laptop battery hold a good charge and that a different question ill answer at the end. A low power laptop with a decent sized battery could last 12+ hours doing work, web browsing or playing a video. A high power gaming laptop with a small battery might only get 1 or 2 hours of web browsing or work and maybe only half an hour of gaming. Most laptops fall in the 2\u20136 hours range, a lot of thin and light laptops are pushing 8hours now, and gaming laptops tend to get fewer than 4 hours unless they have massive batteries. That all assuming you are doing a moderate task like web browsing, media consumption (watching videos), or office type work. if you do something heavy like 3d rendering or gaming, your battery life will be greatly reduced. As far as how long a laptop battery will keep holding a good charge, this depends a lot on how you use the laptop. In general, you can expect 2\u20135 years of good usable battery life out of most laptops built and sold in the last 10 years or so. That range of 2 - 5 years is so large because it depends on the use patterns you have. generally, lithium battery has a limited number of cycles (200 - 1000 depending on the battery), so the more often you fully charge and discharge your laptop the shorter the battery. Most laptop batteries will get around 500 - 800 full charge/discharge cycles before the battery loses 80% of its capacity, and will usualy get several hundred more before losing 50% of its capacity. if you drain and charge once per day, then you'll likely get 2 solid years out of the battery then another year with worse performance. If you charge less frequently or charge every day but dont use the whole battery you can expect a longer life span. Leaving your laptop plugged in all the time does degrade battery life a tiny bit but not putting those cycles on will actually extend the lifetime of the battery significantly more than leaving it plugged in most of the time. Very old laptops and other types of devices used to have issues being plugged in all the time, it's really not a big deal for a modern laptop thought. all of this battery cycle life also applies to cell phones as well.
