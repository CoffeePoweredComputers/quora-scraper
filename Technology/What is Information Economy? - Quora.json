            "answer_text": "An economy based off of the creation, sale, trade, distribution, and consumption of knowledge products. A knowledge product are intellectual properties (books, software, electronic games, specialized information, data mines and data warehouses).  They can also be specialized ways of doing something, or an invention, or a pharmaceutical bestowed a limited form of monopoly, as manifested by patents. They can be intellectual ideas behind trade secrets and specialized operational process, or genome sequences. Notice that these aren't \"things\" made by human hands. This isn't industrial, or, agricultural, or dependent upon \"labor\".  An information economy is built on the backbone of a solid computing and networking infrastructure. In our modern example, this is created from inexpensive client/server computing, scaled data and cloud services from capitalists and vendors, fast broadband connectivity, and mobile network coverage. A portion of the US economy could be described as an information economy, and the workforce within it as \"knowledge workers\" which is an idea/phrase from the 1950's, actually, but it represents the fact that most of us work on computers and information than actually trade our labor for wages. Thus, knowledge workers must have good education and training. An information economy depends upon and thrives with a well-educated workforce. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of the Information Economy is more often than not used metaphorically:  it means that it is useful to consider information and related phenomena in ways similar that Economics is about money, and goods and services.  This includes the following assumptions:  Information is a Commodity that can be standardized, traded, owned, transferred, etc.There is a large market of buyers, sellers, and clear ways to assign value to the goods and services.Buyers are basically similar. The value of a commodity is similar for most buyers.There are a large number of buyers interested in any commodity, and a large number of sellers providing any particular \"type\" of commodity.There are mechanisms for matching buyers and sellers.Buyers and sellers are assumed to be rational agents.... and so on.  This is a good source of ideas about business models, but we should beware of when these assumptions break down.  You might hear the term \"Knowledge Economy\".  The assumptions are more true for Information than for Knowledge, because some knowledge is tacit (not representable as information, therefore cannot be stored and transferred).  Moreover the value of knowledge is highly contextual.   For example:  I was employed by an R&D company that had some products, some intellectual property, and some expertise.  It was acquired in a hostile takeover.  The staff \"walked\", the acquiring company found themselves holding a mostly empty vessel, and suddenly learned the difference between knowledge and information. ",
