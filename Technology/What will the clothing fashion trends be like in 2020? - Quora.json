            "answer_text": "Grunge / UnisexThe style of the 90s returns, and with it the trends of the \"antimode\" as a symbol of protest return: Normcore (from the end of the last decade), and sport chic (Sporty Chic) - have become a symbol of clothing of the last decade and together with that hallmark of street fashion. We observe how the industry adapts to customer needs, covering jeans with embroidery, pearls and buttons, producing T-shirts featuring rock bands and a variety of denim work shirts. Chokers, velvet and hoodies have not been left without attention and add to the image the fun that young people are seeking to spread (this has made brands such as Vetements incredibly popular). WGSN says that we can observe the revival of grunge in Justin Bieber and Kanye West's concert tours \"Purpose\" and \"Life of Pablo\", where they show off clothes of oversize and, of course, hoodies who became mast-hev this season . Of course, consumers play with both layers and volume, all in order to demonstrate their aesthetic freedom. 2. Leather clothes Effectively, shockingly, stylishly it will look like leather clothes, which became a trend in the autumn-winter season and will remain in the trend according to the forecasts of fashion houses and magazines. Well-retaining heat, fashionable clothes made from matte, varnished and turned leather are represented by such styles as skirts of simple and asymmetric cut, jacket-coats and leather jackets, trousers of wide and tailored sewing. It is impossible not to mention such fashionable women's trends 2018-2020, as leather coats and trench coats, perfectly suited for autumn and spring. Things made of leather can be worn with other textures, for example, velvet, knitwear, tweed, etc. 3. Decor, ornaments, decoration, embroidery Every year in magazines and on fashion websites you can read that fashion trends in clothing include embroidery, decorative elements and interesting ornaments, etc. Yes, in fact, the fashion is cyclical, and there is nothing surprising in this. Nevertheless, every year there are very original and unusual styles of clothing with a delicate or catchy embroidery, floristic, animals and geometric prints, decoration in the form of fringe, lace, minimalistic patterns, etc. The most fashionable trends in clothing in the form of decor can be viewed in the styles of evening and cocktail dresses and other evening sets, for example, overalls.

            "answer_text": "The 20 fashion trends of 2020 that will conquer you  The new year also brings us fresh air in fashion; decades back, unexpected colors that illuminate our closet and new silhouettes to update your look. We bring them all (with tips to take them according to the experts) so you can choose the ones that work best with you. You're fed up with the party dresses and you need fresh air, check out what we'll see next. We anticipate that some garments such as baby necks and puffed dresses will continue to boom. The new year is full of trends; some we had already noticed and others are really new and surprising. But something has changed from a few years ago to now: there are so many and so varied that it is difficult to establish an exhaustive list of 'what is and what is not'. Now romantic dresses coexist with military boots, the 70s saw you one day and the next 90s inspired you more grunge, the colors are mixed without rules and very few are assigned only to one style. Everyone chooses and shows the ones that best match their taste and personality and, more than ever, fashion is the most fun game. However, those of us who spend hours among the street style photos know that there are common fashion gestures that stand out and attract attention, and those are the ones we have collected here: the special bags, the total leather look, the new silhouettes of jackets and pants ... If you want to take the pulse of what's coming, write: The bullfighter blazer  The short jacket turns out to be the ideal tandem of high waist pants, bomber and slouchy, because it allows you to remove some visual weight and stylize. The brown one of Zara has us in love. The 'slouchy' is (definitely) the new cigarette  With a high waist and wide leg, it combines perfectly with jerseys, blouses, jackets and, of course, heels. If there is an essential right now in the closet, this is it. The reign of the 'pouch'  Bottega Veneta's most successful model declines in new colors such as squeaky and metallic. It points: the tendency will continue being to carry the bag under the arm. A touch of feathers  The feathers always remind us of long nights and celebrations but now, we will use them with a subtle touch in daytime clothes, to instantly raise the look. Knitted jacket  It has always been an essentially austere garment but now, worn directly on the skin and adjusted to the body has managed to become one of the most exuberant and appetizing in the closet. Combine them with high leather pants or midi skirts and high boots. The huge dresses will make us dream  Victorian aesthetic or Disney princess, fancy or regal appearance but always with extra dose of flight and volume. Accompany them with military boots and you will have the winning formula. READ MORE: ",

            "answer_text": "From retro comebacks to new color palettes for the Spring 2020 season, designers including Gucci, Paco Rabanne, and Fendi gave their all to set fashion\u2019s 2020 agenda. Here are our favorite inspirational trends from next Spring\u2019s runways. Disco Collars  That\u2019s right! The 70\u2019s made a fresh comeback on the runway this year. The strong and widely pronounced disco collar modernized collections by Victoria Beckham, Paco Rabanne, Saint Laurent, and Salvatore Ferragamo. This collar sensationalized the majority of outerwear in bright and contrasting colors, such as neon and pastels. Crochet This year\u2019s fashion forecast centers around all things 70\u2019s vintage, and that includes crochet. These pieces from Salvatore Ferragamo aren\u2019t your grandmother\u2019s usual doilies. Crochet has evolved in its styling since the early 2000s. Designers have woven it into bathing suits, midi dresses, and even evening wear. The integration of crochet also signals the fashion industry\u2019s increased focus on sustainability. That\u2019s because crochet: Demands less yarn than the fiber counts making up more traditional fabricsCan be easily made using eco-friendly or vegan yarn fibersEasy upcycle Crochet is a statement making slow-fashion alternative to fast fashion trends with a quick production and even faster wear cycle. Retro prints Revitalizing retro became a pattern that designers showcased at fashion week. And speaking of patterns, this Spring 2020 runway trend on our list is \u201c1960\u2019s wallpaper\u201d. While it\u2019s clear that prints have made a major comeback, who would have thought that the one on your grandmother\u2019s old wallpaper would make the cut? These \u201cpsychedelic wallpaper prints\u201d are new patterns made famous by Marc Jacobs, Fendi, and Prada on this year\u2019s runway.  Bermuda Shorts  This year\u2019s runway shows have taken the classic business suit to a whole other level. We\u2019re talking about vacation shorts once considered cringe-worthy. This Spring, collections from Tom Ford, Givenchy, Altuzarra, Chloe, and once again, Bottega Venetta, have embraced the art of versatility with the Bermuda short as their vehicle. Paired with a professional nine-to-five blazer, Bermuda shorts represent that \u201ccool Californian\u201d vibe just in time for spring. With bike shorts also in season, Bermudas explore the idea that suits aren\u2019t limited toformal wear, but work for ready to wear as well. Leather  Harper\u2019s Bazaar claims that \u201cSpring Leather\u201d is the \u2018in\u2019 thing for 2020. Although leather typically takes center stage on the fall and winter runways, \u201cIt\u201d designers Marni, Alexander McQueen, Coach 1941, and Bottega Venetta created innumerable styles beyond handbags and outerwear for the Spring season. These included skirts and pants in bold colors, with painted floral prints sent strutting down the runway. Bra Tops  One thing about the bra top trend: \u201cless is more\u201d. Sheer, crochet, and ruffle embellished bra tops appeared on the runways of Fendi, Dior, and Givenchy. The near-lingerie garments bring a daring feminist element to collections nowadays, so don\u2019t be afraid to embrace this trend in your future collection, paired with high waisted midi skirts, shorts, an oversized sunhat, or a pair of flip flops. Which of these popular trends inspire you for next year\u2019s private label collection? Comment on our blog what you want to see next! ",

We are based in New York City, receiving requests from people all over the world. We source and purchase in the USA and deliver to doorsteps worldwide. While we do not carry goods, and are a service, we LOVE fashion and are really excited about the future! Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball in the office, but we do talk about current and future trends every day! Here are some of our thoughts and opinions: There will be more companies like Modern Meadow and the product which Modern Meadow offers will be more commonplace. (We are super excited about what they do, and can\u2019t wait to see how they will revolutionize the leather industry.)\u201cSewbots\u201d and other types of automation in the garment creation industry will be more commonplace. Garments will be made even faster than today.We already see so much customization being offered by various companies such as Adidas and Nike but we believe this will be ubiquitous very soon, whether that is in-house offerings from the sportswear companies mentioned or specialists such as DTLA Custom (we are huge fans, and we have used their services many times.)We believe fashion shows and Fashion Weeks (New York, Paris, etc.) will still be in full swing \u2014 these are spectacles which allow labels to really \u201cshow off\u201d and garner all kinds of attention \u2014 but we also think that \u201cdirect to consumer\u201d will be more common. Rather than waiting for six months for items which appeared on a runway to arrive in stores, we believe consumers will be able to purchase items from the runway directly from the retailer.Just our two cents\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "Men wearing skirts has been gaining traction and will continue to do in 2020. More and more men are taking the daring step of trying on a skirt and realizing what they have been missing out on. More and more Social Media are discussing the subject, experts in the fashion industry say there are no reasons why men shouldn't wear skirts, and history shows that men have worn short skirts far longer throughout history than women so it is not new. Men have been \u201cSocial Conformists\u201d without realizing it due to their upbringing but that is changing fast with the millennial generation which appears to be much more open minded than previous generations. Skirts will not need to be designed special for men since so many styles already exist and they fit both men and women equally but it will be more about being \u201cSocially Acceptable\u201d to wear skirts once again. I see this more as making skirts \u201coptional\u201d just as pants became optional for women in a big way some 55 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "The 20 fashion trends of 2020 that will conquer you  The new year also brings us fresh air in fashion; decades back, unexpected colors that illuminate our closet and new silhouettes to update your look. We bring them all (with tips to take them according to the experts) so you can choose the ones that work best with you. If you're tired of party dresses and need fresh air, check out what we'll see next. We anticipate that some clothes such as baby necks and puffed dresses will continue to boom The new year is full of trends; some we had already noticed and others are really new and surprising. But something has changed from a few years ago to now: there are so many and so varied that it is difficult to establish an exhaustive list of 'what is and what is not'. Now romantic dresses coexist with military boots, the 70s saw you one day and the next 90s inspired you more grunge, the colors are mixed without rules and very few are assigned only to one style. Everyone chooses and shows the ones that best match their taste and personality and, more than ever, fashion is the most fun game. However, those of us who spend hours among the street style photos know that there are common fashion gestures that stand out and attract attention, and those are the ones we have collected here: the special bags, the total leather look, the new silhouettes of jackets and pants ... If you want to take the pulse of what's coming, write: The bullfighter blazer  The short jacket turns out to be the ideal tandem of high waist pants, bomber and slouchy, because it allows to remove some visual weight and stylize. The brown one of Zara has us in love. The 'slouchy' is (definitely) the new cigarette  With a high waist and wide leg, it combines perfectly with jerseys, blouses, jackets and, of course, heels. If there is an essential right now in the closet, this is it. The reign of the 'pouch'  Bottega Veneta's most successful model declines in new colors such as squeaky and metallic. It points: the tendency will continue being to carry the bag under the arm. A touch of feathers  The feathers always remind us of long nights and celebrations but now, we will use them with a subtle touch in daytime clothes, to instantly raise the look. Knitted jacket  It has always been an essentially austere garment but now, worn directly on the skin and adjusted to the body has managed to become one of the most exuberant and appetizing in the closet. Combine them with high leather pants or midi skirts and high boots. READ MORE: ",

Men and women will be wearing baseball caps, jeans and t-shirts. How revolutionary!  Women will re-embrace their love of Chanel handbags. Wearing black will still be popular and crossbody bags will be seen everywhere. Jeans will still be popular, although in different cuts. Skinny jeans will become more of a trim fit, adding about 1/2 inch of fabric from the knees down.  Colors and patterns will be worn together. Body suits will still be in style, and athleisure styles, consisting of leggings, yoga pants and track suits will still be widely visible in public. In short, 2020 will look very much like 2019.

I think some trends I\u2019ve been seeing recently will continue in 2020. For men\u2019s jeans, I expect skinny jeans to remain fashionable and popular. However, I think they\u2019ll lose some of the extreme popularity they\u2019ve had to other modern styles of jeans, such as the new tapered jean styles which Levi\u2019s has been advertising. Another new style I\u2019ve started to see is men\u2019s ankle length jeans. Leggings have become very popular for men for working out and all kinds of sports and athletic activities. In addition, as a clothing trend, a small number of men have started wearing leggings casually, with or without shorts over them. Those men have discovered what many women already know, that leggings are one of the most comfortable kinds of clothing you can wear on your legs. I expect that trend to become more popular as more men give leggings a try for some reason and discover how comfortable they are. ",

We\u2019ve already seen updated \u201920s-style headbands on women, and maybe men will sport slicked-back hair, pencil mustaches, etc. By and large, the trend of timeless fashion will continue as it has for some 20 years. The casual clothing of today is pretty much what it was 15 or 20 years ago. Jeans and T-shirts won\u2019t go out of style in the foreseeable future. A friend of mine is of the opinion that when it comes to music, the musical styles of each decade of the 20th century will be updated in the corresponding decade of the 21st. We haven\u2019t seen that with the \u201900s or the \u201910s, but who knows? ",

There are also a lot more women choosing to go braless these days, and I also expect that trend to continue. Also for women, cropped tops and Mom jeans are back, and since they were due for a revival based on the 20-year fashion cycle, they should be around for a few years. Skirt hemlines seem to be dropping, too, so expect fewer short skirts and more clingy long skirts. For men, the recent trend toward wearing more color should continue. I think men are starting to feel liberated in their clothing choices. And besides, wasn\u2019t it long overdue when cabana wear came back in this summer? The necktie is on its last legs. Young men simply don\u2019t wear ties. GOOD. Worst longstanding male fashion trend EVER. ",
