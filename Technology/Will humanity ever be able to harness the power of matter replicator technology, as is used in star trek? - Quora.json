            "answer_text": "You can't say that something is impossible, because that would require infinite knowledge of all potential technological paths. On the other hand, I think it's fair to say that replicator technology seems improbable, based on current knowledge. If it were possible in the future, it's likely to be the far distant future. The implicit idea of the replicator is that it converts energy into matter, based on stored patterns. Now, we know in principle that matter and energy are interchangeable, but we have no idea, even in principle, how you'd go about converting energy into matter. Even if we did, you have to consider the vast complexity of even the simplest matter. In order for the replicator to work, it would have to chart out an object to the last atom. That's possible, but hugely data-intensive. One can imagine it being easily possible in the future, but not now. Consider, too the amount of energy we're talking about. The energy required to make a glass of water would require the combined output of every electrical plant in the United States for several hours. To create a power generation system that could make and control that much power, that quickly, on a regular basis, is difficult to even imagine at this point. As I said, one hesitates to say \"impossible\", but I doubt it will happen in the forseeable future. More likely is the use of nanoassemblers, which could put together matter atom by atom into the requested pattern. That would mean you'd already have to have the necessary atoms there, but it means you could turn a pile of organic waste into anything you wanted that was made of organic material: a delicious steak dinner, a brand-new suit, a plastic toy, a new kidney, whatever. That is also likely to be far in the future, but at least we know, in principle, how we'd do that. If technology continues to advance, I have to assume it will happen sooner or later. ",

            "answer_text": "Just about everything man has ever imagined, we created.  400 years ago it was impossible to make a flying machine, yet it had been imagined. At this moment in human history, most everything imagined has been created, except for the \"3 t's\", which are all related, but conceptually separate technologies...  teleportation -- due to the nature of teleportation being the conversion of matter to energy and the conversion energy back into matter again, replicators in Star Trek are a \"related\" technology, just as the Star Trek holodecks. time-space warping -- this should cover, just not the warp drive from Star Trek, but also the stargate from the Stargate franchise.time travel -- due to the invention of vehicles that travel far in excess of human walking speeds, certain aspects of time travel already have been invented, as the following video attempts to explain...  But yes, we all want to go into the past and see dinosaurs.Judging from the replies so far, those who have tried to seriously address this question approach it from what is possible today, instead of what might be possible in the future.  Given the human ability to turn what we imagine into reality, given enough time, I feel we'll also solve the riddle of the 3 t's and bring it to reality too. ",

The reasons are very similar to the reasons why I declared that a Startrek type of transporter is impossible (See my answer to: Is teleportation possible?) Some say, that you cannot say that something is impossible. I disagree - if the currently known and well tested laws of physics say that something cannot be done, it is safe to say that it is impossible.  If we ever discover new laws of physics that allow the impossible then we can change our statement, but for now it is impossible. ",
