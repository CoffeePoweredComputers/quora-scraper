            "answer_text": "It's easy. Edit 1- I realised that a picture would be much beneficial. So adding picture for your help. Tap on recent (leftmost key) and there you will get option of split screen on Top left corner. Tap on it and drag the application you want to use in split screen mode. Enjoy.  Thanks for asking. I would love to know if it was helpful or not. Note- The split screen will only work if you have device having Android 7.0 or above. Edit-So now, almost every Redmi phone has MIUI 10, this is how you can enable this feature. Tap on recent (leftmost key) and there you will get option of split screen on Top left corner. Now drag the application you want to use. It will look something like this  Now select the app which you want to use along with the first one. If you want to interchange the app, just tap this twice.  And here you go!  That's it. Edit 3- Since nowadays, Xiaomi has started rolling out latest MIUI 11, you can use the split screen in the same manner as in MIUI 10 (BTW it looks cool in dark mode ;) Touch the recent keyTouch the split screen option on the top left corner 3. Select and drag the apps which you want to use  Cheers! ",
