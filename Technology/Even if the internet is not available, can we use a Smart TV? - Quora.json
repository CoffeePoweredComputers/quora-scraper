            "answer_text": "Yes and No - If the internet is not available, you can still use a smart TV as regular TV (connect an antenna, cable, satellite, DVD/Blu-ray player, VCR, etc\u2026), you just won\u2019t be able to access the smart features that require access to the internet such as watching Netflix and other streaming services. You also won\u2019t be able to download and install any firmware updates to correct any problems or add new features. However, there are a few models that may require a smartphone or connection to the internet to set up. If you are shopping for a TV, since most TVs are smart TVs, you might want to touch base with the manufacturer\u2019s customer support to find out if a specific model you are looking at requires connection to the internet for initial setup.

            "answer_text": "Can I use my smart TV without the internet? Yes, you can use it as a TV and you can use any apps that do not require the internet. My current TV is a smart TV that I can use to access numerous web sites to stream video and even has a basic web browser and email client. I only use it as a TV. I never use any of the apps and it is not connected to the internet by wire or wireless. So, why did I get a Smart TV? Well, for several reasons, among them: I wanted a lot of HDMI ports and this TV has 1 more than I needI wanted good video quality and this TV had significantly better quality than any of the other TVs that had enough HDMI ports at the time I bought itI prefer to use other devices for accessing the web. I have an Apple TV, a PC, and a PS/3 attached to HDMI ports which give me better access to streaming apps than those built into the TV. I could use the Netflix app, for example, but it\u2019s not anywhere as easy to use as the Netflix app in my Apple TV.",
