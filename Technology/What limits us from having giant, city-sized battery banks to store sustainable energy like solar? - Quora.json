            "answer_text": "Energy Vault Storing renewable energy produced by wind and solar plants is still prohibitively expensive. To address this issue, Energy Vault has proposed an innovative alternative to storing electric energy in conventional batteries. This new technology was influenced by the energy retention strategies of hydroelectric power plants. When there is a low demand for electricity, they use the excess electricity to pump water into a cistern on higher ground. Once the demand rises, they let the stored water flows downwards into energy turbines, thus converting potential energy back into electric energy. Innovative storage technology Instead of using water to store potential energy, Energy Vault uses 35-ton blocks of concrete. The system consists of a nearly 400-foot tall tower with six steel cranes on the top of it. The towering structure manages the placement of 35-ton blocks of concrete in response to drop-offs in demand and fluctuations in environmental conditions. As the power demand decreases, the structure surrounds itself with concentric rings of the concrete bricks lifted by the leftover power from surrounding wind and solar farms. Once the demand increases, the cranes begin lowering the bricks. Generators transform the kinetic energy into electricity, which is pumped back into the grid. The following figure shows how the 400-foot tall tower organizes concentric rings of concrete blocks according to energy demands - maximum storage on the left and minimum storage on the right.  (Image courtesy of Energy Vault) Main advantages Energy Vault solution is based on proven, reliable, safe, and cost-effective technologies. The system does not rely on chemical storage solutions or high-cost materials. Recycled materials from preexisting construction sites can be used to make the blocks, which can last for up to four decades without a decrease in performance. At a parity of energy storage capacity, a tower costs much less than a battery storage facility. Furthermore, this solution is very safe. In fact, even in extreme conditions, the concrete blocks would never catch fire, explode or leak toxic chemicals as traditional batteries could do.  (Video courtesy of Energy Vault) ",

            "answer_text": "Cost. Here is a quick survey of the options for grid scale storage of intermittent power: Lithium ion batteries. The South Australia (Hornsdale) installation touted above is the best known example. It is apparently quite cost effective for grid stability and load management, but not even close for storing enough power to convert an intermittent source into a continuous one. The storage facility alone would cost substantially more than a conventional combined cycle gas power generator. This is very unlikely to change. The materials needed for lithium ion batteries are too expensive for this kind of application. Pumped hydro. This works and is cost effective or nearly so, but it does not provide a general solution. To make this work at the needed scale requires a steep elevation change of hundreds of feet with a lake sized reservoir at the top. Too few locations in the US (and elsewhere) offer these attributes. Still, this may be a growing part of a future solution, perhaps using abandoned underground mines to provide the vertical drop. Redox flow cell batteries. These have potential for affordable grid-scale storage, but at a very early stage. Batteries with the right combination of low cost, durability, and storage density are still on lab benches in places like MIT and Stanford. Much R&D is needed. Mechanical. These include an assortment of clever spinning and lifting devices of very large scale. Not even close on cost. More of a fun engineering game. The future of wind and solar depends primarily on storage. Without affordable storage, intermittent power sources will remain relatively small contributors, for reasons explained elsewhere by Vincent Maldia. This is where renewable energy advocates should be spending their resources and energy, but too rarely do. ",
