            "answer_text": "This is not a simple question. There are a number of pros and cons. All of which are important. Using technology is important in education because it allow for much more self directed learning. Students are able to work to their ability and focus on things that interest them. As the world around us becomes more and more computer based it is important that schools keep up with the technology so that what we are teaching is relevant and the way of teaching is relevant. Information technology means that it is easy to communicate with people all over the world as an educational exchange. Or you can engage in asynchronous learning. On the down side, writing is still an important skill and the dexterity it teaches is important in many areas. Too much screen time can be bad for posture and eyesight. Many student like to have a change from using computers all of the time, I know because I have asked them. It is important that people remember in this \u2018information age\u2019 that information does not equal knowledge, understanding or wisdom. The use of technology in education is great when used as a tool. It is not so good when teachers/school systems are lead by the use of technology. ",
