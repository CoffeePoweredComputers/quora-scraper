            "answer_text": "Well, if you are a tourist you want to visit any country and be able to ask for directions and places easily without learning the language of thag country, then the technology already offers you apps and devices that directly and easily translate what you say so that people can understand you and vice versa. If you want to live in a foreign country, then technology can never offer you something thag obviates the need to learn the language because if you use the apps or devices as mentioned above it can never be convenient, it will waste a lot of time while translating. Besides, if you were ever able to bare the time taken to translate each sentence you say by using apps or devices (or technology in general) it will be literal translation that wouldn't be able to help you convey the meaning you want, so you can't rely on it 100% That's why you'll have to learn the language of the country you want to live in, to clarify and choose the suitable words for the meaning you want to convey and because it's more convenient in time. Unless you're just visiting the country, in that case technology already helped you to obbiate the need to walk with a dictionary or learning the language before travelling. ",

We\u2019ll always need a human eye or ear to check the validity and quality of machine translation and interpretation, unless we want the technology to think for us, rather than just work for us. ",
