            "answer_text": "What Will Phones Be Like In 2019/20? So what about the future? What will the phones of 2019 and beyond look like? Should you buy the flagships from this year or perhaps wait it out a little longer? To get a good idea we can use company road maps and trend analyse to help estimate roughly what can be expected. One thing that\u2019s abundantly clear is that starting in 2019 5G Mobile LTE will become mainstream. With the first real 5G specification being completed in 2017 by 3GPP and Qualcomm already doing extensive testing with their Snapdragon X50 5G Modem it\u2019s only a matter of time.  While the first versions will \u2013 like the early 4G modems \u2013 use up considerable battery power the Snapdragon X50 is supporting up to 5 Gbps download rates. That means a 2019 flagship phone is likely to be almost five times faster than this years one! This is of course if your carrier and data plan support it. Looking towards other specs such as CPU, RAM, Battery, Camera and Screen for 2019/2020 flagships we can extrapolate the following rough guide from historic technology trends: 4K UHD 120 Hz Screen ResolutionsCPU\u2019s Breaching 3.2 GHz+RAM Around 8-10 GB4000-4200 mAH Batteries5K \u2013 Possibly Even 8K \u2013 Video RecordingOne final ever increasing new feature will be Machine Learning support. The Snapdragon 845 already supports more hardware accelerated AI. Google is also said to be further developing their own chips too. This should lead to AI programs being able to run on the phone using very little power rather than through cloud services. Next Level Up Beyond the standard specifications improvements that all phones always get each year here are a few things that I\u2019d really like to see. The first of which isn\u2019t really a future technology, it\u2019s just the same USB Type C connector we already have on many phones. What I\u2019d like to see though is dual USB Type C connectors. One on the bottom where it usually is and another on the top. The biggest advantage to this is that you can use some USB Type C headphones and charge your phone at the same time. You\u2019re also able to charge your phone from either end which I\u2019m sure would come in handy. It\u2019s a small addition but one I think would be most welcomed ever since they removed the headphone jack. Next up is something a little more futuristic, a molecular spectrometer. This has already been developed and demonstrated in a real life phone called the Changhong H2. However I\u2019d love to see this be as common as GPS is now. While a spectrometer \u2013 a device capable of measuring chemical composition \u2013 sounds super scientific and unneeded for an everyday smartphone it has some very interesting applications. Spectrometers work by sending out a pulse of near-infrared light that causes materials in an object to vibrate. From the returned light, the exact material composition of an object can be obtained. \u2013 Digital Trends  You could get accurate body fat percentage results for fitness apps. Food could be scanned and nutritional content accurately defined. It\u2019s even capable of telling you whether or not fruit is fresh or if your medication is really what it says on the bottle. As you can imagine, the sky is the limit for something like this with 3rd party developers capable of endless new applications. ",
