            "answer_text": "Generally when we compare smart devices with non-smart devices, we can see that most smart devices come with powerful hardware and advanced software that allow running apps like Netflix or Hotstar even YouTube. Your normal TV does not have powerful processor or large RAM like your Smartphone. So it cannot run apps like your phone or other smart TVs. The solution here, as recommended by many other on different questions on Quora itself, is to use some kind of device like those streaming sticks or dongles. Good examples would be Amazon Fire TV Stick and Chromecast. You can also buy the smart TV boxes like the one from Jio. How do they work? These devices have powerful enough hardware and software to run apps like your phone and they use your TV as a display output device. It is quite similar in concept to making a Desktop PC and using your TV as the monitor. Also, you can use a HDMI cable to mirror a Laptop display onto a TV or projector. ",
