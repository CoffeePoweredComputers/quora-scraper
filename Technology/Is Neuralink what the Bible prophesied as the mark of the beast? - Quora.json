            "answer_text": "Why would it be? Actually, forget I asked that. I already know the answer. So the Mark of the beast thing comes from the Beast of Revelation, Chapter 13, Verse 18 of the Book of Revelation. In the typical roughshod manner of early translations to English it has been accepted that 666 is the number. The faithful don\u2019t really seem to care that their holy text was mistranslated into ancient Greek and it should have been 616, but hey, not my monkeys, not my business! So anyway the beast thing is this, the original text was (as I\u2019ve just shown) open to mistranslation. It turns out that Byzantine text was full of abiguities. This is the passage in question, translated from Greek \u201cAnd that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count (also reckon, vote or decide depending on the translation) the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.\" One of the \u2018many\u2019 interpretations of the passage is that it associates the act of commerce (buying or selling) with the beast. It\u2019s possible that this is because of the Roman practice of stamping coins with the faces of emperors which could potentially be seen as a form of idolatry. Another interpretation links it with the Jewish practice of tefellin where Hebrew Bible texts are bound to the right hand and forehead during daily prayer. This one\u2019s a little zany but it\u2019s important for the Neuralink question. The thinking goes that if binding the Bible in those places is \u2018holy\u2019 then anyone pledging their allegiance to the mark of the beast would put the mark in one or both of those places. Part of the problem is that the word that was translated as the mark (of the beast) could be used to describe any stamp, engraving, coin or document. So; fresh from the word salad of the Bible we have a passage that appears to possibly link the act of combining a \u2018mark of commerce\u2019 with the right hand and the forehead. Also tied up in that mess somewhere is a story of Nero who was seen as the Beast at the time and had scared the Christians sufficiently that they feared that he would be reborn soon after his death. With some convenient ignoring of actual dates and some spendid cherry picking of numerology we can learn that Nero was the Beast. Never mind that he died some 30 years too early for the numbers to work, we\u2019ll shoehorn it in anyway! Then along comes Elon Musk, an avowed technologist and non-spiritualist. He believes the worlds problems can be solved through the application of science. He also believes that one of the likely necessities of the future is to harness the power of AI to stop people being quite so stupid. I admit I\u2019m taking liberties on that last point but it seems pretty obvious to me. Anyway, his goals aren\u2019t so important to this story as his methods. Neuralink, of which Elon is the CEO, wishes to build brain-machine interfaces by robotically printing electrodes into the human brain that are capable of reading and potentially sending neural impulses. This would potentially allow access to nearby computers and, of course, the Internet. So we have everyday computing functions implanted in peoples heads at the behest of a charismatic and powerful atheist. What could be worse? Well, what\u2019s the second most common use of the internet (after porn)? That\u2019s right! It\u2019s banking! So now we have a powerful and charismatic atheist who wants to place a machine of commerce in peoples heads. That obviously means that he is the reincarnation of Nero. He\u2019s here to herald in the apocalypse that some interpretations of Revelations 13:8 NKJV say is prophesised. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. In summary; thanks to some really shifty translations and retranslations of some super old texts. Thanks to some historical grudge match between ancient Romans and Christians. Thanks to some certainly not mainstream interpretations of Biblical passages in the most common biblical translation to English. Also, last but not least thanks to a healthy dose of paranoid conspiracy theory we have \u201cNeuralink is the latest Great Satan.\u201d ",

The real reason he wants to build a city on Mars is so that he can use it as a base to launch an attack on heaven, which is just next door. Tesla\u2019s are tools of the devil, and solar power is against god\u2019s will, since it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s divine will that we continue to burn fossil fuels so that we can hurry up the blessed armageddon agenda.
