So, it comes with a ugly pill shape cut out again (as per the pics I've seen) . Which is the kind of design I'd prefer in a smartphone. Rumours say that it will with same 20+2 mp camera system. I hope at least now they won't add the useless depth camera again. Which also distracts me while doing something on phone. I\u2019d pray God that they will add a wide angle camera now. ",
