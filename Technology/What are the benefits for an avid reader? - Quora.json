            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A :) I think the most important benefits would be:  Being creative/imaginative. When reading, especially reading fantasy, you are in a world that's not your own. Take Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings as an example. Thanks to Harry Potter I became much more creative, because I got introduced to a world that's not real, and therefore I got to know the world of creativity: creating things that didn't exist before. This plays a huge roll in my (love for) art, my favourite kind of art is surrealistic art.You understand others better. While reading, you get introduced to a lot of different characters, who are all different. You get to understand those characters and their personalities, the knowledge you gain from reading about those people can help you understand people in real life better.Your own writing skills will improve. I love writing, which is mainly because I love reading so much. I love to create things, be it art or stories (although art can also tell a story, of course). I believe that, if you read a lot you will get knowledge about how to write, since you get to see/read how other writers write their stories. I see this a lot with my friends: the ones that love reading and read a lot also like writing and are good writers as well, the ones that don't like reading are pretty much bad at writing. You get to enjoy the smell and the feel of books. This one doesn't really need an explanation, but I just really love the smell of new books and I love how they feel when I hold them.",

            "answer_text": "A critical reader is one who not only reads to comprehend the surface, obvious facts, but also reads to understand the deeper meaning being put forth. The benefit of getting below the surface or \u201creading between the lines\u201d, is a fuller more complete understanding of what the author has tried to convey. For example, let's examine fairy tales and fables. Far from just being stories told primarily for the entertainment of children, they were intended as a means of protesting against the people in power that the peasants felt were taking advantage of them. By couching it in a story for children, they could be openly critical without receiving retribution because it was impossible to prove their real intent. Because we in the US live with Free Speech, we can be openly critical of our government without fear of being singled out for punishment. Most countries in the world are not blessed with our Constitution's Bill of Rights. Therefore it is important that as readers we learn to read critically in order to understand other forms of government and be able to comprehend the importance of our own. ",
