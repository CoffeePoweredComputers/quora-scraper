I have a couple dozen projects, some of which are done in a 3D drawing system, some of which are written in Java, some of which are written in Python, a couple of which are written in English (they are called \u201cnovels\u201d). I\u2019m not sure what an expo is, and even if I did, I don\u2019t see how it applies to totally diverse projects. ",
