            "answer_text": "When you went to school crying, you took help of your teacher to teach you words. When you went to play on the ground an older kid helped you understand the game. When you were confused about your career, you asked your dad about the choices. When you were cooking for the first time, you called up your mom to ask for a recipe. When people get stuck, they seek help of someone whom they believe have the solution to their problems. When you present your problem, you \u201cconsult\u201d them what could be the optimal solution to it. Consultancy firms, over the years, have gained expertise in domains by working with clients all across. They apply knowledge obtained from one field into the other. ",

            "answer_text": "Most firms provide very specialized expertise for short term engagement. For example, my firm specializes in defense strategies. We solve problems related to the national defense. That can be anything form how to structure an organization, to how to equip it, down to how equipment should be built to meet the needs of the warfighter. We have another division that focuses on all things healthcare. Most firms have a specific niche they can provide solutions to and hire for that niche specifically. Now, there are firms that call themselves consulting firms but are in reality staff augmentation firms. That is, they provide staffing to fill a temporary or sometimes long-term need for which your firm may have difficulty staffing or hiring for. Specialty IT is one area this fits in nicely with. You might need a COBOL programmer for a few months, but not permanently. So you hire a \u201cconsultant\u201d to do the work. The term \u201cconsultant\u201d has come to specify anyone who is not permanent staff at a firm and who comes in to fix a specific problem. Sometimes that problem is not enough staff. True consultancies fix problems that are more strategic in nature, not put butts in seats. Hope that helps! ",
