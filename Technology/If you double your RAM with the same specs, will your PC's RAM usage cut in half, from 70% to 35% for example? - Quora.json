            "answer_text": "Yes and no.Yes, the overall usage is cut in half since you double the supply.No, the actual usage is the same since the use itself does not change. It depends on how you word it.If you have 16gb and upgrade to 32gb, yes, you are using 50% less of your total RAM than you were before.If you have 16gb and upgrade to 32gb, no, your usage is not literally halved. I have 8.7gb committed rn and that would have been 35% or so at 16gb since some gets used naturally for caching. at 33.9gb total allowed from 36gb, I\u2019m using 18% at 8.7gb committed. That\u2019s 18%. 18x2=36% so checks out. Note: My actual usage is only 5.7gb, or 8.7gb \u2018committed\u2019, 17.5% of 33.9gb. The difference between in use and committed is how much background apps have reserved. If you are multitasking 32gb is nice, otherwise 16gb is enough for most things. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1/2 perfectly NO. Windows will use some of the extra memory for caching, and other programs might feel free to use more memory since there\u2019s no pressure to do otherwise. Also where windows might have used the swapfile/pagefile, but now it has real memory to use and will prefer that to the slooow swapfile. ",
