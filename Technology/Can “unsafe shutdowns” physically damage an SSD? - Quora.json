            "answer_text": "Physically damage? 99.9999% not (shutting down via holding the power button is a normal hardware shutdown so it cannot damage things, shutting down by unplugging with absolutely zero battery backup if you have a broken battery has a minuscule chance of causing physical, hardware damage). Software damage and damage to the data? Well that is the real risk with all kinds of unsafe shutdowns. That's what you should be careful of. You can corrupt files that you're in the process of writing and lose data. The risk of corrupting OS files is essentially 0 unless you're in the middle of a system update (in which case you can destroy it in funny ways I cannot even diagnose) ",
