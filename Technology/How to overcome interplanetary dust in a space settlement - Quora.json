            "answer_text": "space is such a hostile environment that any settlement will have to be perfectly insulated against it, viz, near vacuum, freezing cold, near zero pressure, etc that effectively,in sealing against these, dust from external sources which is presumably u mean by interplanetary dust,is automatically excluded. as the smallest of particles are capable of puncturing the shielding, thanks to their great speeds, these might make their way in through weak spots in the settlements outer shell. This may be avoided, or at any rate reduced, by double walling, regular and thorough inspection for weak spots and immediate reinforcing of these, and increased investments in high strength materials and their applications. the pressure gradient being outwards,will work in favour of the settlement, as u call it.
