            "answer_text": "In an ideal world, no forms of energy should be subsidized by the government. But, in the real world, ALL forms of energy are subsidized by the government. In numerous direct and indirect ways, adding up to billions, if not trillions of dollars. Coal is subsidizedNatural Gas is subsidizedNuclear is subsidizedGasoline is subsidizedElectricity transmission and distribution is subsidizedPipelines are subsidizedEnvironmental clean up from fossil-fuel related disasters is subsidizedWars to protect access to fossil fuels are subsidizedMedical costs from the health effects of pollution from fossil fuels are subsidizedBut, you never hear anyone complaining about these subsidies. However, try to give renewable energy somewhat of a level playing field via a tax credit, or some other mechanism, and people revolt. How dare we try to give clean, abundant energy a little help to compete in a playing field that has been tilted towards fossil fuels for centuries! Who do these people think they are?! In an ideal world, no forms of energy should be subsidized by the government. But, if you are going to subsidize all of that list above, you should be intellectually fair and honest, and subsidize renewable energy as well, even though that industry does not have the profit and wealth yet to significantly contribute to your political campaign.

            "answer_text": "Ask yourself \u201cwhat is the Constitutional basis for the government to either force utility companies to accept the \u2018excess\u2019 energy from your solar panel, or to pay you to install the solar panel in the first place?\u201d Dig into it and you will find that there is none. The Federal and State governments have zero authority to interfere in this marketplace, and their track record for doing it shows that they have done considerably more harm than good. Now ask yourself \u201cwhat is renewable energy?\u201d I am an engineer in Oil & Gas and I\u2019ve installed thousands of solar panels on remote wellsites. When I\u2019m doing a new project I build a future budget of replacing half the batteries every year and 1/3 of the panels every year. My projects have rarely been under budget at year 5. These things get stolen, sand blasted, or just short out. At 20 years, there will still be some of the original panels (none of the original batteries) but some sites will be on their 6th or 7th panel. Even with that track record the projects have been cheaper than building grid power to the locations. When we declare a panel or battery to be irreparable (or they\u2019ve been stolen), all of the components of the item must be mined/refined/transported/manufactured all over again. My definition of \u201crenewable\u201d does not include frequently going back to the earth for resources. Methane. Now there is a renewable resource. Biological waste will be created. Some of it will be captured in an area away from an air source and anaerobic bacteria will convert it to methane that can be harvested and used. Renewable. Wind and Solar are only \u201crenewable\u201d in the sense that their fuel is not mined. Disingenuous. ",
