            "answer_text": "Life in Ancient Egypt: what was it like? 1) The family Egypt had the highest birth rate in the ancient world. And yet, things were far from perfect. Illnesses and accidents could not be avoided, and there was no welfare programme to protect the unfortunate. The family provided the only reliable support mechanism and was therefore an institution of immense importance, with marriage a practical rather than a romantic bond, designed to create a viable economic unit. Everyone, even the gods and goddesses, married. An unmarried man was seen as incomplete, and schoolboys were advised to wed early and father as many children as possible. Destined to follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps, boys were trained in the trades and professions by their fathers and uncles, while girls stayed at home to learn from their mothers. In their early teens girls would marry and the cycle would start again.  Mural of women with children, from the tomb of Khai\u2013Inherkha, Thebes.

While the husband worked outside the home, earning the rations that would feed his family, the wife or \u2018mistress of the house\u2019 ran the household, providing food, drink, clothing and cleaning services as needed. To reflect this traditional allocation of duties, the Egyptian artists depicted women as pale skinned \u2018indoor\u2019 people, while men appeared as darker skinned \u2018outdoor\u2019 workers. Childcare, cooking and cleaning were considered important, but they have little impact on the archaeological or written record. Consequently we know less about Egypt\u2019s women than we do about its men. One thing we do know, however, is that women had the same legal rights as men of equivalent social status. This allowed them to own their own property and to live alone without the intervention of a male guardian. 3) Childbirth Most married women spent much of their lives either pregnant or breast-feeding. With little medical advice available, amulets and charms bearing the figures of the pregnant hippopotamus goddess Taweret and the dwarf demi-god Bes were used to protect both the mother and her unborn child. The mother prepared for birth by removing her clothing and loosening her hair. In a wealthy household she may have retreated to a specially constructed birthing hut; this was a privilege available to few. The mother squatted on birthing bricks for the delivery, and a midwife used a sharp obsidian or flint knife to cut the umbilical cord. If something went wrong, there was very little the midwife could do to help. Mothers breastfed their babies for up to three years.

Building with this material was both cheap and fast, but unfortunately, over time, almost all the mudbrick houses and palaces have crumbled and dissolved. Fortunately, the workmen\u2019s village of Deir el-Medina \u2013 home of the royal tomb-builders \u2013 has survived relatively intact. Here the terraced houses were long, narrow and dark, with a wooden front door opening directly onto the main street. Each house included two living or public rooms, a storeroom or bedroom, and a kitchen equipped with a mud-brick oven. The roof over the kitchen was made from matting that would allow smoke and cooking smells to escape. Stairs gave access to the rest of the roof, which could be used as an additional living space. 5) Food and drink Egypt was a very fertile land, and under normal circumstances no one went hungry. Food could be homegrown, earned in the form of rations (there was no money), hunted, fished or bartered at market. Water could be obtained from wells, the Nile, or irrigation canals built by the Egyptians. Grain \u2013 wheat or barley \u2013 was the principal source of carbohydrate. Everyone ate vast quantities of bread, even the gods, whose temples received daily offerings of hundreds of loaves. Vegetables and fish were widely available, and the typical peasant family ate a healthy diet rich in bread, fish, onions and pulses supplemented by occasional small game and fowl. The elite ate meat on a more regular basis. Chicken, which is consumed in vast quantities in modern Egypt, was not available. Beer, a mild, thick, slightly sweet beverage best drunk through a filtering straw, was the main drink of the masses, consumed at every meal. Wine made from grapes grown in the Nile Delta was a privilege of the elite.  Painted limestone mural showing the preparation and baking of bread.

This is very much an idealised image. Archaeological evidence indicates that most women dressed in practical, plain, sleeved dresses similar in style to the simple galabiyahs worn by modern Egyptian villagers. These dresses were made from linen; cotton and silk being unknown in ancient Egypt. Woven sandals and a shawl for warmth completed the outfit. Men had a similar wardrobe, although the long outer garment would be removed and replaced by a kilt when working in the fields. These simple garments would have been very valuable; they would have been handed down, patched and darned, until at the end of their useful life, they were used as mummy wrappings. Laundry was done in the canal or the Nile, with natron, a salt-rich mineral, as a cleaning agent. 7) Health Egypt\u2019s doctors were considered the best in the ancient Mediterranean world. They employed a combination of scientific techniques (observation and diagnosis) and magical rituals (spells and charms) to bring about their cures. Patients might be treated with a prescription \u2013 human milk being considered a particularly effective ingredient \u2013 or by minor surgery. There was some specialisation among doctors, with Egypt\u2019s gynaecologists offering not only the treatment of female illnesses, but also the provision of fertility and pregnancy tests and (unreliable) contraceptive measures. Although mummification made the Egyptians aware of the arrangement of the internal organs, their understanding of the body systems was inaccurate. They believed that there was a network of \u2018canals\u2019 centred on the heart, which included the blood vessels, tear-ducts, and nerves. Obstructions within this system would cause floods and droughts in different areas of the body.

(Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images) 8) Religion The Egyptian pantheon included several thousand deities. These gods might be arranged in a loose hierarchy, with nationally recognised state gods at the top, locally significant gods in the middle, and demi-gods and supernatural beings at the bottom. While the king and his priests worshipped the important state gods in their state temples, his subjects were almost entirely excluded from state religion. Instead, they worshipped an eclectic mix of local gods, demi-gods and supernatural beings; the spirits and ancestors who never developed formal cults, but who undoubtedly had an enormous influence on the lives of the ordinary people. Magic was, at all levels of society, a real and potent power that could be used to protect the innocent and ward off harm. It could not be separated in any meaningful way from either formal religion or science. 9) Life after death In Ancient Egypt death was not necessarily the end of life. The Egyptians believed it was possible to live again, if the corpse was preserved in a lifelike form so that it might form a bridge between the spirit of the deceased and the land of the living. So, as soon as possible after death, the body was taken to the undertaker\u2019s workshop. Here it was laid on a sloping embalming table, stripped, and washed. The brain was immediately discarded. This was usually achieved by breaking the ethmoid bone (the bone separating the nasal cavity from the skull cavity) and poking a long-handled spoon up a nostril. The heart, in contrast, was left in place. Next an incision was made in the left flank, then the stomach, intestine, lungs and liver drawn out. The finger- and toenails were tied in place and the corpse packed with natron salt. It was left for up to 40 days, until entirely dry. Finally the desiccated body was washed, oiled and bandaged. Not everyone could afford this treatment, however. The vast majority of the population were buried unmodified, in simple desert graves. What kind of an afterlife did these Egyptians expect? We will probably never know. source-Historical facts, features, quizzes and podcasts ",

            "answer_text": " The ancient Egyptians loved life as were blessed with a very rich land and beautiful climate. They considered their life to be perfect, to the point that they believed that their afterlife was the eternal continuation of life on earth. Daily life in ancient Egypt was focused on enjoying the time they had and make it memorable as much as possible. And through their observance of the harmony and the balance of the universe, they were encouraged to live in peace and happiness with themselves and others. Social Classes During Life in Ancient Egypt The population of Egypt was divided into social classes in the shape of social pyramids based on their profession and role in society. At the top of the pyramids was the king as he was the god\u2019s chosen man and his royal family who enjoyed an unimaginable amount of status, wealth and luxury. Second to the top, is the educated professional class like the doctors, the accountants, priests, and scribes that were believed that they were chosen by the god Thoth. Then comes the working class like the sailors, the craftspeople, and soldiers who played a key role in providing and protecting the life in Egypt. And in the lower class was the servants and the farmers that worked in the lands owned by the king, the elite which produced the goods that helped the entire culture to thrive and were the necessary labor force for the construction of the pyramids and other monuments of Egypt. All of the jobs and position in society was passed down from father to son. Families During Life in Ancient Egypt The concept of family was very important during life in ancient Egypt. Most of the marriages in Egypt were arranged by the parents and girls were usually married around the age of 12 and boys at the age of 15. Girls would stay at home and learn from their mother, while the boys would train in the profession of their fathers and uncles. Also, most marriages were polygamous with the husband having several wives, one of the wives was considered a chief wife who was considered higher than the other ones. Divorce also existed in life in ancient Egypt but it was highly rare because the Egyptians were committed to the sanctity of family unity. An unmarried man was seen to be incomplete and boys were advised to marry as soon as possible. The structure of the family is very simple as the wife is the mistress of the house that looks after all the household and the husband work outside the home to earn enough money to feed his family. The Role of Women in Life in Ancient Egypt Women in life in Ancient Egypt were often treated as equal to men as they were allowed to own property, conduct business dealings just like men, even testify in court and some women were able to rule Egypt like Cleopatra, Hatshepsut, and many others. Women had the ability to obtain high-ranking jobs like administrators, supervisors, and priestesses. But their main responsibility was to be the caretaker of the home and the children above all else. Home and Shelter in Life in Ancient Egypt Ancient Egyptians built their own houses, temples, and tombs out of adobe which is mud-bricks made of sun-dried mud. This material was fast and cheap and almost all the mud bricks have crumbled and dissolved the houses were filled with decoration, amulets and ancient religious artifacts. The houses were cool on the inside and had a flat roof, so in the summertime, people could sleep on the top on them. Most of the townhomes were divided into two floors, the first floor is reserved for reception and the top floor is reserved as a private housing for the residents. Houses were built around courtyards, and all the cooking was done outside in the courtyard. All of the noblemen houses were larger as they had three areas while the rest of the farmers lived in modest houses. The Nile River\u2019s Role in the Daily Life in Ancient Egypt The Nile represents the bloodstream and the life force of Egypt. It was considered to be the main form of transportation for goods, materials, and people. The Nile was a line on communication between Upper and Lower Egypt and provided a very fertile land to the ancient Egyptians so they could grow all that they needed like wheat, barley, papyrus which was turned into paper, rope, and baskets and other crops. The Nile also played an important role as a religious entity because of the public view it as a gift from gods like the \u201cGod Sobek\u201d who is credited with creating the Nile. You can cruise the Nile River on board Egypt Nile cruises to witness the most famous landmarks in Egypt. Food and Drinks in Life in Ancient Egypt Finding food and water in life in ancient Egypt was not that hard to grow as the soil was very fertile, the Nile was filled with nutrition water and that\u2019s why many crops like wheat and barley were easily found. Bread was considered the source of carbohydrate and was seasoned with honey, herbs, fruits and sesame seeds. Their diet was mainly vegetarian as they lived on a combination of wheat and vegetables, and fish was their main source for protein as the meat was more expensive and difficult to come by and can only be found at the house of the elite. A lot of the animals were ritually slaughtered and extremely hard to keep the meat fresh within the Egyptian climate. The beer was also the main drink of life in ancient Egypt and was consumed at every meal. Wine also was found at the tables of the wealthy noblemen. Entertainment of Daily Life in Ancient Egypt The ancient Egyptians tried to live their life to the fullest as they engaged in everything from hunting crocodiles and hippopotamuses, and playing board games like Senet and Hound & jackals, they even had toys for children in the shapes of animals. There were also a lot of sports that included athletics the early versions of teams like swimming, hockey, handball, wrestling, rowing, archery, gymnastics and many water sports like water jouster which was a form of sea battle played in small boats on the Nile River. The noblemen and the wealthy would throw extravagant parties filled with the finest foods and beverages. Music and dancing also were found very common in ancient Egyptian culture and were considered to be art forms. Festivals in Life in Ancient Egypt All the festivals in life in ancient Egypt had a unique felling depending on the nature of the events. Most of the festivals in life in ancient Egypt had a religious nature as all the Egyptians celebrated the gods birthday. The religious festivals were held in conjunction with the lunar calendar in temples like the festival of the valley in the honor of the god Amun, the feast of Hathor at Dendera, the festival of the goddess Isis at \u201cBusiris\u201c, and the celebration of Bastet at \u201cBusastis\u201c. There was also another kind of festivals like individual birthdays, the anniversaries of great deeds of the king, funerals, and house-wearing events. There were also of other festivals that had a unique religious nature like the \u201cWepetRenpet\u201d which marked the beginning of the year in July at the annual Nile flooding, \u201cThe Sea Festival\u201d was held in the third reign of the pharaoh\u2019s reign to celebrate his kingship and \u201cThe Festival of Khoiak\u201d which honored Osiris death and revival. The Egyptian would indulge themselves in every kind of excess in these festivals despite the fact that self-indulgence wasn\u2019t appropriate at every gathering. You can read more also about the festivals and public holidays in Egypt during these days. Clothing and Fashion The ancient Egyptians wore clothes made from linen, which is a light and cool fabric woven from cotton. Both men and women wore the same material in the shape of linen kilts. Most women dressed in plain sleeved dresses. Servants and lower-class women are often shown wearing a kilt while the royal and the noble women are shown wearing fitted dresses from the shoulder to the ankles and the noblemen are seen in skirts and blouses. All the little children in ancient Egypt didn\u2019t wear clothes until the age of ten. All of the social classes went barefoot to imitate the gods who didn\u2019t need footwear. But when someone was on a long journey or a place where they would hurt or injure their feet, they would wear sandals. The lower class would wear cheap sandals made of woven rushes while the nobles and the rich would wear expansive sandals made of leather or painted wood. Men, women, and children wore cosmetics like Kohl which was considered to be the most popular type of makeup and it also helped protect the ancient Egyptians from the sun. The ancient Egyptians like the lower class wore jewelry like rings, pierced ears, necklaces, and amulets while the higher and wealthier class wore jewelry made of gold, silver, and electrum for both fashion and religious purposes. They also were very civilized as they took extra care of their hygiene, they would cleanse themselves in the river or a bath at home. They didn\u2019t have soap but they used a cleansing cream made of oil, lime, and perfume instead. Health in Life in Ancient Egypt The ancient Egyptian medical condition was heavily affected by the religious atmosphere. They used a combination of scientific techniques like observation and diagnosis and magical rituals such as spells and charms All of Egypt\u2019s doctors began their training as scribes as they needed to read medical texts to figure out the right cures. Most diseases were thought to inflicted by the gods as a form of a punishment for commuting a certain sin and that\u2019s why they had to know which supernatural presence was responsible. In order to do their job, they had to read a lot of religious literature works on surgery, the setting of broken bones, dentistry and the treatment of various illnesses. The ancient Egyptian gained a great deal of knowledge in the field of anatomy due to the practice of removing the human organs and understanding the afflictions and the remedies of the human body. The cared deeply about their dental hygiene as they developed the toothpaste made of eggshells, ox hooves and ashes and the toothbrush to keep their teeth healthy and clean of sand and grit, they also invented breath mints to cover their bad morning aroma. Religion in Life in Ancient Egypt The ancient Egyptian mythology had thousands of deities over the years. Their religion was polytheistic as every town and village had its own god or goddess. Every deity or religion had its own temple, rituals, ceremonies and other special practices that had a powerful influence on their life. They believed in life after death as the body was preserved in a lifelike form through the mummification process. They confused magic with science and believed it\u2019s only in the power of gods to create or destroy. They had many myths that explained the way the world and beyond like the creation of the universe, and the afterlife. Most of our information comes from the book of the dead as it was written throughout Egypt\u2019s history and contained text, hymns, formulas, incantations and magical words to help the dead arrive safely to the underworld to be judged and explain the origin of the gods. Technology in Life in Ancient Egypt The ancient Egyptians were natural born explorers and inventors. They made the earliest inventions that we still use today. They were the first to create a writing system in the form of hieroglyphics which was drawing portraying a story, they used it to keep accurate records of their lives, discoveries, and religious dogma. They also developed a sheet on paper called papyrus which they personally created and black ink which they used in writing and painting, it also came in various colors. The ancient Egyptians use the knowledge of astronomy to develop the lunar calendar based on the cycles of the moon and the star Sirius, which we still use to track the days until today. They were the first people to divide days into equal parts 12 months, 356 days, 24 hours units through timekeeping devices like obelisks, shadow clocks, water clocks, and sundials. The position of the sun determined the passing of the days and the passing of the night was determined by the rise and fall of the stars. There observation of the sun, the night sky, and the stars affected their religion and way of life. The ancient Egyptians had a talent for geometry and math as they used it to accurately to build pyramids, temples and other buildings as well as for record keeping and business transactions. They also created the ox-drawn plow and an irrigation system using hydraulic engineering principles in order to improve their agriculture.

The local court or \u201cKenbet\u201d was made up community leaders who would hear the cases and decides who\u2019s guilty and who\u2019s innocent. The court could be even held in the marketplace or on the street and there was also an administrative building called the judgment hall which existed in any city. In the new kingdom, there were no lawyers or appeals, the priests of Amun were the ones who decided the verdict as the people trusted them to give a just hearing and to make the right judgment. Minor offenses were fined but major crimes like rape, assault, murder or tomb robbing were punished by mutilation, incarceration, forced labor or even death in some cases. All the convicted felons were used for manual labor in Karnak and were held in the great prison of Thebes. It was also known that the guilty will face a far worse fate in the afterlife. ",

And as Egypt was one of the greatest civilization of the time it certainly would have a great business scope of that time. Ancient Egyptians were great artist so there would be a lot of things to get amazed you can see a lot of big construction of that time going on and on.There markets would certainly full of the best product which come over all around the world. Even today when we go to a city as an outsider we come to expose to a multi cultural environment so that experience would be the same even that time zone. I personally wish that if there would be something like a time machine then i would go to ancient Egypt and would experience it. ",
