So here's a small list so I don't bore you to death: Cameras on phonesIt all began in the 90\u2019s with JPL (jet propulsion laboratory). And how they had to create cameras small enough to fit into the spacecrafts and provide scientific quality. Scratch Resistant LensesYep. Again space exploration technology applied to our daily basis. It all began at the Lewis Research Center when they were trying to create diamond hard coatings. CAT ScansAgain JPL had a key role at developing this technology. LED'sThe space industry used red LED's to grow plants in space and heal humans on the Earth. Even the medical device known as Warp 10 was developed because of it. Remove landminesNASA discovered that the surplus of the rocket fuel could be used to produce a flare that in turn can be used to safely destroy landmines. Athletic ShoesAgain another thing that comes from our friends at NASA. Foil BlanketsThe technology used by NASA to protect the spacecrafts and the people on it was what then gave origin to what we know as foil blankets. Water PurifierIn the 60\u2019s NASA developed an electrolytic silver iodizer to purify the water of the astronauts.  And now let's pick up the pace\u2026 Air DustersHome IsolationEar ThermometersWireless HeadphonesMemory foamSmoke detectorsFreeze Dried FoodBaby FormulaProstheticsPortable Computer + MouseAnd a lot of other stuff.
