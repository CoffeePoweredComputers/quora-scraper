            "answer_text": "No. But it\u2019s not really a yes/no answer. You need to separate Samsung the phone maker, Samsung the bespoke supplier, Samsung the component maker and Samsung the Patent holder. Complex electronics products like smartphones are built from hundreds of individual components and no manufacture makes all of the components used in these products. A complex product will be a varied mix of: Original designOff the shelf componentsBespoke to order components (outsourced)Bespoke components (self manufacture)Outsourced assemblySelf AssemblyOwned PatentsLicensed PatentsSamsung are a high quality manufacturer of electronic components, both off-the-shelf components and bespoke to order components and you will find their components in virtually all consumer electronics, and if not the components, probably some patents. This applies to Apple, Sony, Huawei, Google, etc and also applies to Samsung too, in terms of using other companies components and patents. For the camera sensor (at least the main camera) Apple have usually outsourced the manufacture to whoever has the best (for given criteria) sensor technology at the time. This has certainly included outsourcing to Sony, but it\u2019s possible Samsung has been somewhere in the mix too, along with others. But even then, if Apple designed/specified the sensor and then had Sony or Samsung fabricate it for them, it could still be incorrect to call it a Sony or Samsung sensor in some contexts, it depends on how the spec changes the base model it derives from. Having said that, the underlying sensor tech does play a large role in many of its capabilities and so when comparing in those contexts it would be fair to consider them broadly \u2018the same\u2019. In general, Apple don't like being dependent on too many other suppliers, and so for key components, they have been know to switch from outsourcing to internal manufacture, often by buying smaller companies with the required technology. This happened with the main processor which is now Apples A chip (with A13 Bionic being the latest). In 2017 they bought InVisage Technologies who were working on producing (and have patents for) something they call \u2018Quantum Film\u2019, which in theory will allow for higher quality and thinner camera sensors. So it\u2019s not difficult to assume they may now be looking to make their own sensors too, at least for the main camera. However even then, there are likely to be other patents (or fabrication processes) involved in the full sensor architecture, and those patents (or processes) could be from Samsung, Sony or a variety of other companies. That\u2019s the current nature of production. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s wrong Apple never use Samsung sensors. Moreover Samsung uses Sony sensors remember that IMX586 in S10 lite Oneplus 7pro oppo and realme everyone using but other than that Samsung also uses there GM1 and GW1 sensors. Where as Apple never officially told what sensors they are using but it was unofficially known for older iPhones like 5 series age around Apple use to get there sensors from Sony but Apple orders as per there custom design and specifications that mean those sensors are more over only assembled by Sony and they are only available to Apple. This practice also extend to Apple Retina displays the LCD display called Retina or Retina HD displays were custom made for Apple by LG and Japan displays and the OLED panels called as Super Retina and Super Retina XDR are custom made by Samsung.
