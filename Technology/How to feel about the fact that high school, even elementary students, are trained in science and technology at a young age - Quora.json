            "answer_text": "That is a good thing. Without that we wouldn\u2019t have children inspired to become astronauts, doctors, researchers, chemists, inventors, and so many more. Science teaches reasoning and often allows children to have an island of secularism in a sea of toxic Christian beliefs. It truly sounds like you dislike all this which I can only assume is because it gives children and teenagers information and the ability to dissent. If we didn\u2019t have science, I wouldn\u2019t want to be an Antarctic and marine researcher, and so many other people wouldn\u2019t have other dreams or goals. STEAM is a good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "As long as it remains in balance with other things it is great! Actually science and math research show us that young children already come with skills in there areas - we just need to support their use and growth instead of squashing them. A study was done that shows babies around 6 months can subitize - if three piles of blocks, with various numbers are laid out and they are given a verbal number - they look at the corresponding pile - that\u2019s before they\u2019ve even learned to count. Children are natural scientists - curious, anxious to learn and explore. Additionally, and most importantly - 90% of brain development occurs in early childhood - by age 5. So actually, elementary school is a bit late to start - the foundation of our entire lives in all areas is set by the time we are 5. We are doing children a disservice if we don\u2019t give them a well rounded educational experience at any age. ",
