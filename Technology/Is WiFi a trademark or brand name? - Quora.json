            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity. It is a wireless network technology that allows devices like Smartphones, tablets and computers to be connected to internet without wires. An example of Wi-Fi at work is when you go to a place that has internet connectivity and your device is able to join that place\u2019s internet network to get connected to the Internet without having to connect your device to any wires. Your device at this point is accessing internet connectivity via wifi technology. Wifi being a technology means it is indeed a product whose name wifi has acquired a brand status in the eyes of consumers. So it is a brand of technology that has come to represent any technology that delivers that functionality of accessing internet without wires just like the ipad is often used to refer to a tablet even if the tablet in question is Sumsung. Google search engine is also often used to refer to all search engines even if the engine is Bing. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but it is a trademarked name, belonging to the Wi-Fi Alliance, which ensures products meet certain standards in order to be labeled wifi. Wi-Fi is derived from Hi-Fi, which is short for high fidelity. In the early days of vinyl recordings some sound reproduction products were labeled Hi-Fi to indicate their sound was \u201cfaithful\" (hence: fidelity) to the original musical performance. People's stereo systems were often called hi-fi's. Note that Wi-Fi does NOT mean \u201cwireless fidelity.\u201d ",
