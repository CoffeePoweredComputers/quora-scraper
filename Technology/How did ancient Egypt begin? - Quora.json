            "answer_text": "Ancient Egypt was ethnically African. Not from Asia or Europe. It grew from the Upper Nile. Understanding the pre-dynastic history is key to knowing who the ancient Egyptians were. Ancient Egypt was founded by successive state formations that began in Qustul (Ta-Seti) and peaked in the conquest and cultural subjugation of the Delta region.  There were at least 10 Pharaohnic Monarchs from Qustul before the first Scorpion king from Hierakonpolis. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/oine3.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjQwuagrtreAhVHKBoKHUPMDMwQFjABegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw2gl2jnYLHImdKyWXF0QE3B&cshid=1542421058394 Qustul was located in Lower Nubia present day Aswan and it has been archaeologically proven to be the origin of the White Crown of Upper Egypt. The state formation began in Qustul and then to Hierakonpolis and then to Abydos. Which saw the founding of Upper Egypt as a Kingdom. Then around 3150 BC, Upper Egypt invaded the North and Delta region. Subjugating the regions culturally, religously and politically. According to the ancient Egyptian Mythology Osiris was the first King of the Kingdom.  Osiris was always depicted wearing the White Crown which originated from Qustul. Also according to the ancient Greek Historian account, Diodorus\u2026. LacusCurtius \u2022 Diodorus Siculus  Many ancient Egyptian Pharaohs went to Jebal Bakal in Nubia to pay homage to Amun. According to the ancient Egyptians they claim that Amun\u2019s birthplace was from Nubia.  Also in the ancient texts of the ancient Egyptians, they claimed that their ancestral land was Wawat (Lower Nubia). Ancient Egyptian Literature Also the ancient Egyptians called Punt Ta-Natjer meaning the Land of the gods. Punt is further South from ancient Egypt. There are no ancient texts, historical account or reference that links the origin of ancient Egypt to Asia. Except several conquests, invasions and settlements by Asian and European kingdoms that occurred on a later date, maybe 2000 years after the founding of ancient Egypt. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe oldest human fossils have been found near North Africa, but the land was very different 200,000 years ago. 10,000 years ago North Africa was a grassland with many plants and animals. North Africa took its current desert form around 6000 BCE. Around 6000 BCE the climate began to change, which might explain why humans changed from hunting and gathering to farming. Before civilization, early humans came to the Nile River to hunt, fish, and gather food, but gradually as people learned to farm and domesticate animals (about 7000 BCE and 5500 BCE), and therefore live in permanent settlements, areas around the Nile became more crowded. Several towns grew and eventually kingdoms developed. The change from nomadic hunter-gatherers to civilized living followed the same pattern as other places around the world: farming provided extra food, which allowed the division of labor, which allows the development of government and religion and creates social classes. \u201c Source-Learn more about Egyptian Civilization development here. This would mean the Nile and it\u2019s great plains attracted African hunters in the Africa to start hunting as some of them lived in caves and eventually learned farming and started developing tribes and civilization,These cave people eventually gathered,created a village then a group of villages then a small civilization then a technologically advanced civilization for it\u2019s time.The nile is the main reason for Egypt\u2019s modern 90 Million population as 90\u201399% of the Population lives on nile region or coastal and barely anyone lives in the desert.
