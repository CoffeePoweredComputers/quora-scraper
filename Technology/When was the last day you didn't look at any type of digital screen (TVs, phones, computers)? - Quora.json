            "answer_text": "Before they were around, and I was watching analog screens then. I probably didn\u2019t have my own digital screen (not counting calculators or early app-free flip phones) until sometime after 2005. All my screens, including my first 1080i HDTV, which I know I had in 2005 when the Xbox360 was released, were analog and not digital. I probably got a digital PC monitor around that time if not slightly earlier. I also feel like I got digital displays earlier than most people around me. Digital displays beyond simple number readouts etc. were pretty uncommon. I suppose the Game Boy counts, though green and black - if so, then that was my first digital display around 1990. ",
