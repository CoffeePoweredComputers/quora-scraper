            "answer_text": "No. Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Stegosaurus, Mamenchisaurus, Compsognathus, Ceratosaurus, Apatosaurus, and Dimorphodon are all Jurassic. Velociraptor, Parasaurolophus, Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus, Gallimimus, Pachycephalsaurus, Ankylosaurus, Pteranodon, Mosasaurus, Spinosaurus, and Corythosaurus are all Cretaceous. Jurassic is used simply because it is a shorter, easier to pronounce, and cooler-sounding word than Cretaceous is. Words beginning with J also I think have s rather exotic sound to them, something Michael Crichton wanted to employ when he named his book/fictional amusement park. He may have also been subtly conveying how little the creators knew about what they were doing\u2014 both the novel and the first film are better and deeper than they are often given credit for. But in any case, most of the iconic dinosaur and pterosaur species are from the Cretaceous. ",

            "answer_text": "Are all the real species shown in the Jurassic Park franchise from the Jurassic period? Nope. The T-Rex is from the Cretaceous period, as were the Velociraptors. Of course, Velociraptors don\u2019t look like in the movies at all. They were about the size of a turkey, not the human height monsters we all know and love. They also had feathers, but there are in-universe reasons why they don\u2019t in the movies. I\u2019m sure several of the other dinosaurs and plants weren\u2019t from the Jurassic either, but they weren\u2019t meant to be either. \u201cJurassic Park\u201d was just a cool name, not meant to imply that everything in there was from the Jurassic period.

            "answer_text": "No, in fact most of them are not. The Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptors and the Triceratops are both from the late Cretaceous Period, which was actually about 54 million years after the Jurassic Period. Some species, though, were from the Jurassic Period, such as the Dilophosaurus. So, Jurassic Park really had a mixture of species, from many different time periods. I assume it was called Jurassic Park because it just sounds better and is easier to pronounce. I mean, Cretaceous Park really doesn\u2019t have a ring to it, does it! ",
