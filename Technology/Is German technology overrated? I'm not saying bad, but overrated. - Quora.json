            "answer_text": "Not really: generally German technology is world class\u2026 yet the government and the EU are doing their best make sure Germany will be left behind. There is so much bureaucracy and regulations in all sectors of industry that German companies are not even trying to compete in some industries. When Germany then becomes world leading in some niece technologies (e.g. fuel cell membranes) the government instead of trying to promote the use of it it appears to work in the exact opposite direction. It appear to me that the country and the unit are increasingly led by jurists that have no idea of how economies and industries work, which is in turn strangling research and development. ",
