            "answer_text": "Before taking admission, you have to know what is the difference between CSE and IT. I have CSE background but I don't think that there is any difference between both of them. Even the syllabus structure is much more compact compared to the CSE syllabus structure. I give you a basic example, CSE covers c++ as a practical paper where IT covers c++, practical and theoretical both. Another one is software engineering, which is very much important for interview, CSE has this paper in 7th sem where interview processes are already started, where IT department has this paper in 6th sem. So they get one sem to cover this paper for interview. But in CSE you will get advanced computer architecture. In reality, people has misconception about IT stream over CSE where 90%+ syllabus is almost same. Due to this misconception, good ranked students are taking admission into the CSE department, so automatically campusing percentage is more than the IT department. Now your second question, which college is better RCC or AOT? I completed my b.tech from AOT. I don't know what are the disadvantages of other colleges but I can tell you what are the advantages you will get in AOT. Very strict rule, you have to maintain 75% attendance,this is actually not a tough job because you have to attain practical classes unless you will not perform in lab internal (yes, in AOT, there is internal lab exam), your semester lab marks depends on your daily performance, as well as internal performance and also depends on the semester practical exam. You cannot enter into the exam hall where it is internal or semester, depending on the cheat paper. Because the guard is very much TIGHT. You will be benifited from this at the time of interview. You have to attain all the classes because you don't have any scope to go any good place after doing college bunk. There are no false promises regarding the placement related proces. You will get aptitude training, technical training and also the English training. College tries it level best. Rest is upto you. AOT cse has high demand due to the placement. There is NO STRIKE due to the campusing ( this is the answer which college is better) AOT is not a so-called semi-govt college but fee structure is same maybe less than the semi-govt college. I have heard once that the RCC is a semi-govt college but after knowing the fee-structure I think from student or parent prospective, you don't bothered that it is semi-govt or not. Best of luck.

            "answer_text": "CS is hardware oriented. IT is software oriented. A CS engineer can both be a hardware and software engineer. An IT engineer won't be preferred over a CS engineer for hardware oriented jobs. CS students are exposed to theoretical Computer Science that includes subjects like Theory of Computation, Algorithms etc. Usually, these 2 subjects aren't taught to IT people, Only 3-4 such subjects. The placements are similar. There are very minimal chances of seeing a company that allows CS students but not IT students to sit for the placements. No differentiation on the basis of stream. Be it a CS student or an IT student, both have equal and fair chances in placements. Normally, students tend to prefer CS because everyone prefers CS :p (We believe in following the herd). However, it is just a myth. As long as you are good at your work, these myths won't affect your future. Even the GATE exam is conducted together for CS and IT students in the name of Computer Science and Engineering Technology. And, anyone can change their stream from IT to CS or CS to IT through GATE at Masters level. But, most of the IITs do not have a separate stream for CS and IT but only one stream at Masters level. This year, IIT Khgp merged the two branches - IT and CS into one. About RCC and AOT, the training courses are better in AOT, the placements are better too, most of the companies nowadays conduct pool campus so you have to compete with not only your college students but also with others to get a job, the two jobs I got techno students Iem students were there, as for AOT they won't lie you about anything or make fake promise, go through the brochure what ever is written is absolute correct. All the best choose wisely, ",
