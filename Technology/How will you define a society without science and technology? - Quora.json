            "answer_text": "Original Question: What do you think society would be without science and technology? Wind the clock back to pre-industrial revolution times, beginning in the second half of the 18th century, when society was largely agriculturally based, and you\u2019d see what it was like. Virtually everything was done by hand; there was no such thing as mass-production, and society as a whole was far more rigidly structured than today with people falling into definite strata. At the top of the pile was the nobility, below them were the gentry who were not quite rich but they were certainly well off. Below them were yeomen, farmers who owned their own land, usually comfortably off but they often worked alongside their men. Below these three strata came the vast majority of the population; craftsmen, tenant farmers and labourers or serfs. But one of the main things you\u2019d see would be far fewer people. The global population stayed pretty stable, at between 400 and 700 million - less than 10% of today\u2019s figures - right up until the start of the 19th century, by which time it had reached 1 billion. During the industrial revolution period- roughly 1750 to 1850 - it rose to about 1.5 billion, however, the biggest kick-start to global industrialisation, the application of earlier scientific discoveries, and population growth was the discovery of oil in the mid-19th century. With oil, there followed the internal combustion engine, artificial fertilisers, medicines, and plastics, all starting to come in over a relatively short period of time around 1900. At this point, the global population really took off, rising from around 1.5 billion to today\u2019s 7.8 billion. So, take away science and technology and we\u2019d be back to the \u2018good old days\u2019, except they wouldn\u2019t be. Far, far fewer people, mostly living off the land and stuck in a rigid and largely undemocratic social structure. We\u2019d have no electricity, no transport other than horses, no central heating, draughty and poorly insulated homes, virtually no health care, limited law enforcement, no sewage or waste disposal, a very limited and seasonally-based diet, and of course a much lower life expectancy, at birth the average pre-industrial revolution person being expected to live no more than 35 to 40 years. It\u2019s not a society I\u2019d care to live in, not unless I could take both my knowledge and my money, converted to what it would have been worth at the time, back with me! ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such society. We think of technology like an iPhone or a TV but every age of man has its own technology. Muskets, bow and arrows, crossbows, cannons, sailing ships, even spears are forms of technology. It could be argued that making fire is a form of technology. Science is not a physical thing. It is a way of thinking. It involves coming up with an idea, working out the details, testing the idea or doing an experiment to prove the idea is good or not. Imagine a stoneage man sitting down to make an ax head. He carefully selects rocks and then bangs them together in various ways to create one with a sharp edge. He then ties it to a stick and tried it out. He will learn how to attach it to the stick better when it repeatedly breaks off. Eventually, he will hone the design to an efficient killing tool. This is science applied to the creation of technology. We have always had science and technology. ",
