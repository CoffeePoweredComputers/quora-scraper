            "answer_text": "Shifting data processing to the edge of the network can assist companies with exploiting the developing number of IoT edge devices, improve network speeds, and upgrade client encounters. The versatile idea of edge computing also makes it a perfect answer for fast-growing, agile companies, especially if they\u2019re already making use of colocation data centers and cloud infrastructure. By exploiting edge computing, companies can streamline their networks to offer adaptable and solid assistance that will reinforce their image and maintain their clients happy. Edge computing offers a few points of interest over customary types of network architecture and will clearly keep on assuming a significant job for companies going ahead. With increasingly more web-connected devices hitting the market, inventive associations have likely just started to expose what's conceivable with edge computing. ",

            "answer_text": "Edge-Computing is slated to be a 80 billion $ industry, but why all the excitement around it ? To answer this, look at all the Apps and Services that you would want to develop in the future. Most of these Apps would want to provide \u2018Real-Time\u2019 experiences to the users. From interactive gaming, to AI and surreal AR/VR applications \u2026 they all depend on one basic element - low latency. 5G aims to provide very low-latency, reliable communications to facilitate these next-gen apps, but the IP networks which connect the 5G Network to internet add a lot of latency to the communication. Edge-Computing aims to move the Apps as close to the user as possible, making it possible to run these next-generation Apps with much lower latencies. This requires a highly distributed computing framework, capable of deploying Applications on the closest Computing-Node to the user. Applications also need to be developed which can take advantage of the low response times. The Edge-Computing framework needs to offer a smooth, developer friendly interface to the App Developers to deploy their applications, without having to bother with the details of how the framework can identify the closest Edge-Node and assign compute & network resources to the App. Here\u2019s a look at some work being done to bring the benefits of Edge-Computing to Operators and Developers  ",
