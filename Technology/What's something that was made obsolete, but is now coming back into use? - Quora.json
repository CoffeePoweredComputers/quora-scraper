            "answer_text": "At least one technology that was once thought obsolete, but is now coming back into use, is that of the airship. According to the London based writer and editor, Josh Sims, in a piece dated June 8, 2017 for Tech and Design, and writing in respect of the Zeppelin Company: \u201cThe company now runs 12 routes across Germany and Switzerland for short tourist trips. But demand is rocketing: it now carries some 21,000 passengers every season. It\u2019s building an airship for Goodyear and, in the long term, is aiming at operating a fleet of some 10 airships worldwide, with maybe five operating across China alone. \u201cThe fact is that Zeppelin is, once again, an airship manufacturer,\u201d (Michael) Schieschke (the chief operating officer) says. \u201cWe\u2019re not makers of prototypes anymore. And I think there\u2019s a good chance that airships of some sort are about to make a serious return.\u201d Nor does he mean just for sight-seeing either. Indeed, around the world several companies are in various stages of developing new forms of airship, each seeking to capitalise on this form of aircraft\u2019s unique \u2013 and seemingly long forgotten \u2013 benefits.  An airship, for one, can access remote areas without need for a runway; it can travel vast distances at low cost; its lifting capabilities are enormous; it\u2019s low on fuel costs and emissions \u2013 with battery power potentially making it emissions-free \u2013 allowing it to be much more sustainable than jet-powered aircraft; it\u2019s largely noiseless; and perhaps it might even be able to give back to air travel what it lost decades ago \u2013 a touch of romance.\u201d On a personal level, bring it on\u2026 ",
