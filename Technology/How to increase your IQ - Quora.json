            "answer_text": "Well, I can give you some anecdotal evidence. My IQ used to not be measurable. For example, on the GRE, I scored 800 on the Verbal (a perfect score) and 790 on the Math (missed one question.) People aren\u2019t supposed to score that high, and I was head-hunted by universities all over the U.S. I flew out to San Francisco, courtesy UCSF, all expenses paid, for several days. It was a lot like a free vacation. I could have gone just about anywhere I wanted, because just about every U.S. university sent me invitations. I went with Vanderbilt\u2019s offer: total free ride, plus $22K/year. No teaching duties, lots of lab (which I wanted). UCSF has great teachers, but they\u2019re all overloaded on mentoring. They also lack lab and office space. Vanderbilt offered higher quality of life. On IQ tests, I would score 180 and above. In that region, the numbers don\u2019t really mean anything any more. Then I got hit by a truck. (Not my fault.) Now I\u2019m just a \u201cregular\u201d genius, with an IQ of about 150 or so. Still score weirdly high on verbal tests. So, those are some credentials. Why was I a genius? Here\u2019s my best bet: When I was very small\u2014about 2 or 3 years old\u2014my mother taught me to read. It was a wonderful childhood imprinting experience. I was on my mother\u2019s lap, she was paying attention to me in all the good ways, and I was very happy. Every lesson was very enjoyable. I believe any average child could be taught to read early this way. Because of the way I was taught reading, and how early I learned to read, a love of reading was instilled in me. Plus, I soon could read about 1,000 words per minute. When I was 5 years old, I would sit on the kitchen table reading the NY Times. That freaked out my uncle\u2014he still tells that story as if it\u2019s remarkable. All my life I\u2019ve always read far more than the average person. I enjoy it. This may possibly be due to early imprinting, but who cares? So, I know more stuff and have a higher vocabulary than most people. I still always win at games like Trivial Pursuit, even though I never play them on my own. Early enrichment is key, I think. Tiny children are little sponges, wanting to soak up as much information as possible. We know by experimenting with mammals, the more you enrich their early environment (starting from birth) , the smarter AND more able to deal with stress they become. So that\u2019s my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory IQ tests measure your speed of learning. You can change this somewhat: In the short term as much as 50% of the difference in IQ between you and another person is environmental and therefore changeable. However, some of this will disappear when you quit doing whatever you did to increase it.In the long term only about 22.5% of the increase remains permanent.Previously I said \u201cA useful thing most people do not think of is to cultivate friends with higher IQ. It will rub off. But only slightly higher, otherwise it will be too difficult to understand their thinking and learn anything from them.\u201d Based on my research, I\u2019d modify that to say you must place yourself in stimulating environments similar to the ones experienced by people with higher IQ. They will probably have higher IQ people in them. There are some issues: You may not spontaneously enjoy these environments, e.g. working puzzles instead of shooting hoops. How badly do you want to increase your IQ?It comes with a cost. Drinking and partying time will have to give way to IQ stimulation. I\u2019m not talking about a small cost either. You know it takes a lot of time in the gym to increase muscle mass. Well, IQ is more difficult by at least 3 or 4 times.You can only absorb efficiently from environments about 20 to 30 IQ points above your own. At 40 points different you won\u2019t understand what is going on.But you can stage it. You can use a first environment to increase your IQ 10 or 15 points, and then move to a higher environment.This means you will be continually outgrowing old friends and needing to make new ones. The number of people who will follow you on your journey is, sadly, zero. You must decide that there are other values in these old friends. But you will not have as much time for them as before, and they will begin to seem parochial and narrow-minded to you, maybe even naive or slow. You will find yourself alienated from all political parties, and unable to participate in committees because they seem intolerably stupid. You will become unable to tolerate your boss or to manage your subordinates effectively. I suggest you become financially independent before embarking on a serious IQ boost.I also suggest you have children first, because IQ is negatively correlated with having children. However, if you do it while your children are young, they will, unlike your friends, come with you. Your spouse may not understand.You will not be able to get a new spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend, so keep the old one. Above 130, there are simply too few people to choose from, most will not share your interests, and the good ones are already taken. It is a whole different world than bouncing around near 100 where you can relate to nearly everyone.Learn to guess other people\u2019s IQ. Just observe the vocabulary they use, what kinds of things they \u201cfigure out,\u201d and ask them if they have ever had an IQ test. Most people will tell you their score, or hint at it. If you are asking people with IQs over 120, they will be happy someone noticed and happy to tell you. After a while you will be able to guess. This helps you accumulate the required friends. It is also an exercise in thinking and learning.Read everything about IQ. Study population genetics. Study the debate on environmental vs. genetic influence in IQ. Read research papers instead of news articles. Learn to guess what an article will say by reading the abstract. Learn short cut simple techniques to guess at the solutions to mathematical descriptions of problems, especially statistics, without getting bogged down in lengthy computations and lengthy texts.If you start from 100, and place yourself in a 130 environment, you can expect to capture half the difference in a couple of years, up to about 115. 130 people are leaders in ordinary life, excellent at professions such as lawyer, or doctor, but not necessarily college professors or researchers. If you then remove yourself from that environment, you\u2019ll drop back to about 107. Instead, while you are still a fresh 115, find a 145 environment, which is productive researchers (college professors who do more than teach, or people at your company who are consistently able to get R&D funding and produce results, or old-timers who have done these things in the past, or managed large facilities, but now have time to talk and reminisce, but be careful you don\u2019t get stuck just talking and not doing). Look for a variety of people with different styles and opinions, not just people who agree with you. Some of these people will be hard to get along with and eventually get annoyed with you and break contact one or more times. Be polite, but not obsequious. After about 5 years you should again cut the difference in half, and your IQ will now be about 130. But if you relax, it will drop back to maybe 110 or less. If you really want to do it, start a third phase. Locate people with IQ 160 or more. This will almost certainly have to be on the internet. You will by now have written a few research papers yourself, and maybe you can join ResearchGate. It has a few members with high IQ, maybe 5%, more than random people on the street. However, I cannot fully report on this phase as I have not [yet] been able to get very far. If you succeed, you should have a temporary IQ of about 145. If you can keep at it, you will keep this IQ until you run out of energy and can no longer remain in the environment. But it\u2019s also possible you may find yourself hooked, unable to quit opening back doors to the universe and figuring out how things work. Here is a test. If the things you figure out are different than you imagined previously, then they are not the low-to-medium IQ ideas. If they are different than the groups you have passed through, they are not the ordinary 120\u2013140 ideas. Keep an open mind and always look for new angles. If you stay stuck on one idea for a long time, you have probably relapsed. One thing about IQ is no matter how well you understand something, you\u2019ll wake up tomorrow with a new understanding and the feeling that you were stupid yesterday. Then you know you are on your way. Good luck! The world needs you, even if they don\u2019t know it. P.S.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t increase your IQ. It is a specific psychometric quantity which is measured with specific tests, and the theory that goes with it suggests that it is stable throughout a person\u2019s life. You will score roughly the same if you sit the same type of IQ test repeated times (with time gaps so as not to remember the test, and with a new test which is similar but not the same as last time) There are however some temporary psychological factors which may affect the performance in the test during the time of assessment. Simply, if you are stressed, anxious, tired or confused, you may not do well. In other words, it is possible to sit a Mensa exam and score low, even fail, but try a few months later and pass. This variation in score is due to the above. For this reason, when you are about to sit an IQ test like WAIS, it is recommended to sleep well the previous night, and perhaps even take some Rhodiola rosea or a similar relaxing herb/supplement. Some people have also said that they improved their result (failed the Mensa test first, but passed in a latter attempt) by buying IQ puzzle books, such as the ones sold by Mensa and similar publishers, and practiced for a long period of time to understand the approach for solving these puzzles. Example titles (search Amazon): Test Your IQ 400 New Tests to Boost Your BrainpowerThe complete book of intelligence testsIQ MindbendersCambridge Self Scoring IQ TestBrain Flexing IQ TestsThe Big Book of Mind-Bending PuzzlesThe Times book of IQ testsThe Ultimate IQ Test BookMensa Ultimate Mental ChallengeUltimate Psychometric Tests Over 1000 Verbal, Numerical, Diagrammatic and IQ Practice TestsPopular writers of these books include Terry Stickels, Phillip Carter, Ken Russel. Also you will find many titles by Mantesh publishing. Note that IQ testing does not measure the full scale of intelligence. It tends to measure mostly how rational and logical someone is more than anything else. If you want to be more intelligent in another area, this is a different topic. As neuroscience and science overall advances, theories about intelligence are being reconsidered, and even whether one\u2019s IQ can increase is discussed. There is no concrete finding that it is possible. For example, nootropic substances, which did not exist when the theory about IQ was out, exist today, and some of them may improve cognitive performance, resulting in scoring higher on an IQ test. Yet these have not been fully tested on humans officially. If it was easy to become super intelligent, then everyone would be super intelligent. And if anyone knew a secret to how to become super intelligent, they would probably use it for themselves, become extremely successful (which is what you want, isn\u2019t it?), and charge a bucketload of money for petty advice to the super antagonistic Silicon Valley core audience of Quora - not give it away for free, right? Just saying\u2026. Do you think intelligent people are\u2026 stupid? Just saying\u2026 Do you think I am stupid?\u2026 Just saying\u2026 Reminds me of that old quote\u2026. \u201cWhen dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity.\u201d - Dale Carnegie True\u2026 How true! It turns out I\u2019m answering a ton of questions about IQ with the mindset that people want to understand how their mind works in a theoretical sense, and how to measure its abilities, or understand human nature in a scientific way. Utter bullshit! That is how I approached them, it seems. The most appropriate interpretation to most IQ questions apparently is \u201chow can I be better than everyone else, be really rich and successful, and leave my name in history?\u201d On top there is the group of haters who say everyday that people who talk about IQ are losers - requoting Stephen Hawking as a credibly appearing excuse to hide their own vanity - who also think that anyone who talks about IQ equates it with success, and also thinks antagonistically like they do. \u201cYou have high IQ? So are you telling me you are better than me?\u201d - \u201cNo, I was saying that you are an assh+\u2026 oh look, a 100 dollar note!\u2026Sorry, I have to go, I have an appointment with the dentist\u201d Which brings me back to the previous point: You want me to make you super intelligent (so as to become successful, of course)? You gotta pay me for it dude! That\u2019s what I research on\u2026. How is that possible if there is no official scientific answer yet? Well, if you wait for the body of science to agree and publicly announce the answer and make it common knowledge across the world - if that ever happens - wait for 100 years, by the time that it will be a) pointless because everyone will know and b) too late, because well, you\u2019ll be dead. But if you want a solution now\u2026 you have to be bold - and fairly rich! Besides\u2026. The last famous person who tried to help people, teach kindness, cure leprosy, make disabled people walk and stick people\u2019s ears back out of good will was crucified.The last famous person who bought into people\u2019s vanity* became the current US president.I\u2019d rather choose the latter fate on this one. Jesus is slowly losing popularity anyway. + assholes: it\u2019s those guys with high IQ, no? * See Trump University ",

            "answer_text": "You Can Increase Your Intelligence: 5 Ways to Maximize Your Cognitive Potential! What is \"Intelligence\"? First of all, let me explain what I mean when I say the word \"intelligence\". To be clear, I'm not just talking about increasing the volume of facts or bits of knowledge you can accumulate, or what is referred to as crystallized intelligence\u2014this isn't fluency or memorization training\u2014it's almost the opposite, actually. I'm talking about increasing your fluid intelligence, or your capacity to learn new information, retain it, then use that new knowledge as a foundation to solve the next problem, or learn the next new skill, and so on. Any one of these things by itself is great, but if you really want to function at your absolute cognitive best, you should do all five, and as often as possible. In fact, I live my life by these five principles. If you adopt these as fundamental guidelines, I guarantee you will be performing at your peak ability, surpassing even what you believe you are capable of\u2014all without artificial enhancement. Best part: Science supports these principles by way of data! 1. Seek Novelty It is no coincidence that geniuses like Einstein were skilled in multiple areas, or polymaths, as we like to refer to them. Geniuses are constantly seeking out novel activities, learning a new domain. It\u2019s their personality. There is only one trait out of the \"Big Five\" from the Five Factor Model of personality (Acronym: OCEAN, or Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) that correlates with IQ, and it is the trait of Openness to new experience. People who rate high on Openness are constantly seeking new information, new activities to engage in, new things to learn\u2014new experiences in general [2]. When you seek novelty, several things are going on. First of all, you are creating new synaptic connections with every new activity you engage in. These connections build on each other, increasing your neural activity, creating more connections to build on other connections\u2014learning is taking place. Take home point: Be an \"Einstein\". Always look to new activities to engage your mind\u2014expand your cognitive horizons. Learn an instrument. Take an art class. Go to a museum. Read about a new area of science. Be a knowledge junkie. 2. Challenge Yourself There are absolutely oodles of terrible things written and promoted on how to \"train your brain\" to \"get smarter\". When I speak of \"brain training games\", I\u2019m referring to the memorization and fluency-type games, intended to increase your speed of processing, etc, such as Sudoku, that they tell you to do in your \"idle time\" (complete oxymoron, regarding increasing cognition). I'm going to shatter some of that stuff you've previously heard about brain training games. Here goes: They don't work. Individual brain training games don't make you smarter\u2014they make you more proficient at the brain training games. Now, they do serve a purpose, but it is short-lived. The key to getting something out of those types of cognitive activities sort of relates to the first principle of seeking novelty. Once you master one of those cognitive activities in the brain-training game, you need to move on to the next challenging activity. Figure out how to play Sudoku? Great! Now move along to the next type of challenging game. There is research that supports this logic. 3. Think Creatively When I say thinking creatively will help you achieve neural growth, I am not talking about painting a picture, or doing something artsy, like we discussed in the first principle, Seeking Novelty. When I speak of creative thinking, I am talking about creative cognition itself, and what that means as far as the process going on in your brain. Contrary to popular belief, creative thinking does not equal \"thinking with the right side of your brain\". It involves recruitment from both halves of your brain, not just the right. Creative cognition involves divergent thinking (a wide range of topics/subjects), making remote associations between ideas, switching back and forth between conventional and unconventional thinking (cognitive flexibility), and generating original, novel ideas that are also appropriate to the activity you are doing. In order to do this well, you need both right and left hemispheres working in conjunction with each other. 4. Do Things the Hard Way I mentioned earlier that efficiency is not your friend if you are trying to increase your intelligence. Unfortunately, many things in life are centered on trying to make everything more efficient. This is so we can do more things, in a shorter amount of time, expending the least amount of physical and mental energy possible. However, this isn\u2019t doing your brain any favors. Take one object of modern convenience, GPS. GPS is an amazing invention. I am one of those people GPS was invented for. My sense of direction is terrible. I get lost all the time. So when GPS came along, I was thanking my lucky stars. But you know what? After using GPS for a short time, I found that my sense of direction was worse. If I failed to have it with me, I was even more lost than before. So when I moved to Boston\u2014the city that horror movies and nightmares about getting lost are modeled after\u2014I stopped using GPS. I won\u2019t lie\u2014it was painful as hell. I had a new job which involved traveling all over the burbs of Boston, and I got lost every single day for at least 4 weeks. I got lost so much, I thought I was going to lose my job due to chronic lateness (I even got written up for it). But\u2014in time, I started learning my way around, due to the sheer amount of practice I was getting at navigation using only my brain and a map. I began to actually get a sense of where things in Boston were, using logic and memory, not GPS. I can still remember how proud I was the day a friend was in town visiting, and I was able to effectively find his hotel downtown with only a name and a location description to go on\u2014not even an address. It was like I had graduated from navigational awareness school. Technology does a lot to make things in life easier, faster, more efficient, but sometimes our cognitive skills can suffer as a result of these shortcuts, and hurt us in the long run. Now, before everyone starts screaming and emailing my transhumanist friends to say that I\u2019ve sinned by trashing tech\u2014that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. 5. Network And that brings us to the last element to maximize your cognitive potential: Networking. What\u2019s great about this last objective is that if you are doing the other four things, you are probably already doing this as well. If not, start. Immediately. By networking with other people\u2014either through social media such as Facebook or Twitter, or in face-to-face interactions\u2014you are exposing yourself to the kinds of situations that are going to make objectives 1-4 much easier to achieve. By exposing yourself to new people, ideas, and environments, you are opening yourself up to new opportunities for cognitive growth. Being in the presence of other people who may be outside of your immediate field gives you opportunities to see problems from a new perspective, or offer insight in ways that you had never thought of before. Learning is all about exposing yourself to new things and taking in that information in ways that are meaningful and unique\u2014networking with other people is a great way to make that happen. I\u2019m not even going to get into the social benefits and emotional well-being that is derived from networking as a factor here, but that is just an added perk.

            "answer_text": "This is controversial. Twin studies have found that IQ is about 75% hereditary in adults but there is that 25% and this is a random population so doesn't rule out the possibility of IQ increase. And we know that IQ has been going up around the world -- the Flynn Effect. Some of this likely has to do with lower exposure to toxins like lead and alcohol and better nutrition and health, but some of it probably also has to do with a more enriching environment, particularly during childhood. Brain regions increase in size when exercised for a time, e.g., six months, so it's possible that some IQ increase is possible with the right stimulation. Attempts have been made to create games and so forth to do this with results that are still undetermined. I have also become increasingly sensitive to the fact that INTJ's are unusually smart. I have long suspected that this has to do with a *way* of thinking that both exercise the mind and maximizes what it can do given its biology. These skills are basically a result of figuring things out for oneself from an early age and it's possible that with exercise a younger person or adult could hone those skills in himself. Stimulants improve performance on some measures of mental ability -- caffeine, nicotine, study drugs, and drugs of abuse. Except for the first, all have serious potential for addiction and abuse, though. Study drugs and powerful illegal stimulants can, if used to excess, reduce intellectual performance -- in effect, turning you into a blithering idiot who thinks bugs are crawling under his skin. Study drugs have been called the new nicotine, the modern counterpart to the scholar's pipe. Unfortunately, they are no more healthy. Conversely, marijuana and alcohol are hell on your IQ (though those who drink moderately retain their faculties longer into old age than those who don't-- and live longer as well). Finally, I wouldn't overlook the value of serious reading and great art. They exercise your brain and provide the background and understanding without which IQ is useless. I'd swear that after I've listened to Bach, my IQ goes up 20 points. And when I lived in California, it went 20 points in the opposite direction, LOL. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean increasing real intelligence (organically), not just obtaining a higher Mensa score, it\u2019s not an easy feat; not impossible, just not easy. You have to deal with three main problems. #1 - The solidified hardware of your brain, which is most likely becoming wired for life. #2 - Genetics. You\u2019re born with X amount of ability, which diminishes over time. #3 - Input. I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re an American, which\u2026the American lifestyle\u2014work and our superficial society\u2014are not conducive to raising intelligence. I did say, it\u2019s not impossible. If a person really wanted to raise their intelligence, they would have to deal with their hardwired brain. Vigorous exercise, nootropics, and bombardment of new information would be a good start. There are simple things you can do, like changing routes to work, using your non-dominant hand, and doing things in the dark. This is to \u201cupset\u201d the brain\u2019s hardwiring, thus forcing your neurons to make new connections. New connections can lead to greater intelligence. With genetics, there is gene therapy and growth hormones, but a less invasive approach, would once again, be nootropics, exercise, change in diet, etc. There is a mountain of research that supports meditating your way to greater intelligence. Basically, a person would need to flip overall good health into overdrive. Neurogenesis isn\u2019t impossible, but it does require a lot of effort. Now comes the information. To really raise one\u2019s intelligence, a person needs diverse input, and lots of stimulation; our society isn\u2019t exactly great for this. But, never fear, basically everything you have been doing up to now, stop. Turn off the TV (no, not even the \u2018good\u2019 shows are that great), reduce online social time, trade that time with hands on hobbies, outside social events, and reading books. The number one way to provide stimulating input, and gain intelligence points, is to begin an adventure into eclectic reading. The importance of reading books cannot be overstated. There are other methods, like hanging around smarter people, and listening to how they come to solutions, and of course going back to school (free online courses are also great). There is no shame in learning from and emulating more intelligent people. Break out of your routines. Most people don\u2019t bother raising intelligence, because our society doesn\u2019t really reward intelligence. I commend anyone wanting to be better, whether it\u2019s athletically, academically, or professionally. Good luck in your endeavors. ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest change that is likely to improve cognitive performance is in the area of diet. In particular, a proper ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids in the diet is needed for proper cortical brain function. While these benefits have been proven in clinical trials only in young children - incidentally likely accounting for part of the 7 IQ point advantage of breastfeeding, which has also been proven - they likely apply to adults as well. The ideal ratio of omega 3s to omega 6s is about 1:1 or 1:2. These days, most people get most of their dietary fat from vegetable oils which have an unbalanced ratio in the range of 1:20 or 1:30. Getting rid of the vegetable oils in favor of animal fat from pastured animals is ideal. Failing that, getting some omega 3s from fatty fish, the best source, can partially offset the poor fatty acid balance of vegetable oils. For people older than the onset of metabolic syndrome, typically in the 40s, excessive blood sugar levels and swings tends to become an issue. A reduction in dietary carbohydrate intake - less sugar and starch - can help avoid this issue. There may be some additional benefit to going to a ketogenic diet, which provides an alternative source of energy to the brain - ketones instead of glucose - especially as ketones provide more usable energy per unit of oxygen. The next easiest change is exercise. For older adults - again, roughly those of us past the onset of metabolic syndrome - exercise is useful, probably because it helps burn off excessive blood sugar levels and stores. Anaerobic exercise is especially effective since it burns blood sugar less efficiently, and thus uses more of it. Then, there are changes in intellectual habits. In particular, it\u2019s likely worthwhile to do a lot of reading. This is partly because reading builds vocabulary, which contributes to most peoples\u2019 definition of intelligence and also is an element in many IQ tests. In addition, though, critical reading - thinking about what is read and its implications - helps one practice logical and rational analysis. Don\u2019t worry about reading things that you think are good for you; just read what you enjoy enough to think about analytically. Find quiet, undisturbed time to do your reading. Learning math through calculus is probably also useful. Math at these levels - arithmetic through algebra to calculus - is applicable to all sorts of everyday issues. Do you have enough money to make it through payday? Arithmetic. What combination of potluck dishes do you need to make sure everyone has enough main course and dessert at that party? Algebra. Can you make it through the yellow light before it turns red? Calculus. I\u2019m not saying you should break out the pencil and paper and write down equations for all these things, but if you\u2019ve fully learned the math, you should be able to apply the concepts to these and many other everyday problems, even if your goal is not an exact numerical answer. Edit: Finally, there are other people. The more time you spend in the company of people smarter than you are - but not so much smarter you can\u2019t understand them - the more opportunity you have to learn things from them, including thinking habits. Perhaps this one should have been first. Don\u2019t expect an overnight change. Even babies take years to demonstrate the benefits from that initial year of breastfeeding. Keep up the good habits year after year, though, and you\u2019ll likely see some benefits. ",

            "answer_text": "Increase your actual IQ? Sorry,but if you\u2019re old enough to be posting on Quora, you\u2019re pretty much stuck with that number. During pregnancy, proper nutrition helps. Having the mother stay *completely* off alcohol, tobacco, and drugs helps a lot. A stimulating environment the first few years of life helps. Increase your effective intelligence? There\u2019s *plenty* you can do to help there, no matter what your age. Even if you\u2019re a senior citizen, do this stuff - it will help prevent depression and senility (seriously - there\u2019s tons of research on this). If nothing else, it will keep you busy in retirement. Somebody with an IQ of 120 who\u2019s educated and informed will have a far higher effective intelligence than somebody who\u2019s got an IQ of 140 but is uninformed and ignorant (sadly - such ignorance is usually totally intentional and self-inflicted). So how do you do it? Read. Learn things - doesn\u2019t even matter what. A new language, chess, a musical instrument, calculus. Learn what critical thinking is. This seems to be a vanishing skill, at least in the US. What is it? Basically, it\u2019s making sure you have a functioning bullshit detector, and it\u2019s a valuable skill indeed, especially if you live in a country with free elections. When you read a news story, think about whether the person/company reporting the news to you has an agenda or bias. Then, equally important, think about whether the person who gave them the info has an agenda or bias. Do fact-checking - and use fact checkers that are outside your comfort zone rather than ones that just tell you what you want to hear. As a worked example - consider the US President\u2019s press secretary giving a press briefing. Listen to the *full* briefing. Take a quote from the press secretary and fact check it. Did they tell us something that\u2019s verifiably true, or does it sound implausible? Go listen to the Fox and MSNBC coverage of the briefing it\u2019s guaranteed those two won\u2019t report it the same way. What do they say about it? Do they quote accurately, or do they use partial quotes, or take them out of context? Learn to follow the money. Did I mention reading? ",

Now, when we deconstruct IQ and start to look at it from a more conceptual understanding, it becomes a much more complex answer. On one end, IQ can theoretically go to infinity given the human is able to increase brain size while maintaining overall connectivity and preserving all brain portions in terms of their relative percentages. This type of human within a range 10000+ would be (and I am playing a bit of a science fiction hypothetical scenario here since nobody really knows): Able to process and remember millions of data points simultaneously and unconsciouslyProbably would be able to envelop multiple points of consciousness (meaning that their overall conscious could envelop multiple separate completely focused consciouses.)Most likely be able to visualize complex hyperspheres and communicate the data to those below themBe able to create near perfect fits of complex topographical structuresBe able to simulate future trends in the world due to their ability to handle complex sums wellMost likely due to total command of every life form below itself, the human would start to believe he/she was a literal godWould be able to visualize the world mentally just by identifying simple trends and fundamental rules, and be able to simulate it just as well as humans can the real worldWould most likely early on try to control their emotions successfully using drugs, injections, or cognitive techniquesA human with this kind of intelligence would most likely seek nothing from humans given they would be far behind this human\u2019s abilities before the human even became an adult. Generally, IQ needs to be changed in definition as we increase the bounds as long as the initial mean, SDs, and effects of increases or decreases in SD are kept the same. ",

Confidence in yourself can lead you in many directions and certainly Higher Achievements in education, So my answer would be definitely Yes I believe anyone Can Raise their IQ and maybe in areas that they never thought They would be intrested in or my not believe they could accomplish I never could settle for that I always gave my pinion I try not to push it definitely on a person that is very nervous about what they wanna do with your life but you have to feel it definitely or you're not gonna do anything forget IQ forget school you really just have to show up and want to be there And then after that new adventures a new career strategy You just never know what you may end up with hopefully definitely satisfied and happy certainly within yourselves. Am I personal situation for a long time now in my it remains up To the particular person and what they're striving For. it's simple Just try your best and be your best. I know sometimes easier said than done Hey just put your mind to itKnow that you love it no matter what or like it a lot. if you show up Focus On any goal that you Want ! Keeping Your expectations In your vision per say Sorry but that can think of any other expression I'm not a big word person today is a very long answer to a very simple question but I think that means a lot so I want to answer it thoroughly if anybody was deaf and lean on the frets about going back to school or feeling that they were good enough or smart enough for anything that would make you feel that you cat succeed in what you want that's just not cool I think the AMA can do what they want if they put their mind to it and maybe that's how I should have answered but I just want to kind of share a lesson that was taught to me by special man So this is dedicated to my grandpop at what he always told me I probably didn't live up to everything but I know that I definitely carry with me and use it now to the best I Can and definitely in the I'm trying to actually chieved this myself so I thought this was actually a perfect topic to talk about an answer today So as you can tell short answers are One of my strong points On a typical day if I'm passionate about the topic So absolutely go ahead and Back to school or do whatever it is that is on your mind and raise that IQ or just go for that goal that you thought you shouldn't or couldn't Have you may definitely surprise yourself or maybe you just knew and didn't wanna fail it always goes either way but my thing is this if you could be the best you can be then were Living it's Just staying focused and falling through have a great dayI hope that I didn't driving as crazy who's probably yes or no topic but this is our And I don't think our life sums us up in one word when it comes to our dreams or hopes ",

            "answer_text": "When I went through school I realized that you need to learn how to study. They should teach a course on how to study alone! It's a science it really is and if you don't know how to study you're fucked. For lack of a better term. Study takes a certain amount of discipline which I suck at. So I developed study habits that were probably the least burdensome and most efficient to get the job done ( high or passing grades) It depends too on your education. Are you in high school? Then you need higher grades. Are you in college ? Then you only need passing grades unless you're in a graduate program that demands a minimum GPA. I think it's different for everyone. Probably the best thing for you is to talk to people that can show you and teach you in person. But for me it was basically studying my professors and really learning what key words they would use when something was going to be on a test, half of it really is learning how to take good notes. Some professors don't use the text book at all. Most. Some only use the text. You have to really learn how to listen. Listening is half the battle. The professor will tell you how to get an A. It's up to you to believe them and listen for it. To hear it. Every professor I had , would have key words or certain language they would use to indicate that this was important. Write good notes on that stuff. For me too , I think maintaining an almost objective view , like the eagle compared to the mouse. It's easy to get overwhelmed in school and you don't have to. I think they purposely try to confuse and overwhelm you, and if you can rise above that or see through that, it's easy. For example they make a question sound really complicated to hide its simplicity. For example we think we need to memorize things exactly as they are defined in the text book. These long, pedantic definitions that people really try to memorize. Don't. Learn what the word means in your own language in your own head and you'll be able to pick it out just fine or define it. A lot of school is unnessary bullshit like that. Meant to purposely intimidate people and confuse them. It's very tempting in school to overwhelm yourself. Study what you need to know for the tests. That in itself makes things much easier. Use memory tricks. Word associations and the like. Try to step back and understand things on a simplistic level. On a very simple level. Write things out in the simplest equation or least complicated formula or theory. Step back and memorize that. It's still essentially the exact same thing just without all the bullshit they add on. What I would do is when I got home I would go through my notes. I would make myself a test with those notes. All of them from the day. I would go through it and do it till I had every question answered correctly and memorized about three times. The first time I would go through it I would mark the ones I got wrong. Next time just the questions I got wrong and the third time the questions I still got wrong till I answered every one correctly and then I would take the test another time and do the process all over till I missed none. About three times. Usually. For really hard courses like pharmacology, or anatomy, I used flash cards but the best way for me personally was these tests. Sometimes for harder courses it helped to have someone else read me my questions. But to condense my answer - listening is key. Learn how to listen to people. Professors will tell you what will be on the test with subtle ques and hints and key words they will use. Usually the subjects that they spend any amount of time on will be on the test. Second most important thing- note taking. Take great notes. If you're not good at notes bring a tape recorder and always sit in the front row in class. This really helps. It does. Third most important thing- simplify. They really try to complicate the simplest concepts. If you can learn to peel away the bullshit or big words and get down to the heart of the formula or concept it's so much easier. Fourth most important thing- don't doubt yourself. Whether you memorize the word nucleon with the text definition or your own, you will still comprehend it. Which is the point. You won't miss the answer no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t really increase your IQ in any measurable way. IQ Tests don\u2019t measure knowledge. I think there\u2019s a misconception about what IQ is. It\u2019s not a measure of any sort of achievement. It\u2019s a measure of a physical property of the brain. It\u2019d be like asking, \u201cwhat can I do to be taller?\u201d By the time you can ask that question, most of the opportunity to get taller has already passed, but if you want to help your children be taller, you might be able to with good nutrition. I mean, maybe you could wear platform shoes to appear taller. Stand up straight, shoulders back. It doesn\u2019t really make you taller, but it might seem that way. It\u2019d be like taking cognitive enhancement drugs before you take the test. The score might be higher, but for what? Why do you even care what your IQ is? It\u2019s not a competition of scores. Do you need a particular score to do something? Probably not. IQ is just a measure of something about us that we can\u2019t control. Like shoe size. Who cares how big your shoes are? What can you do? If anything? Eat healthy foods containing brain boosters like Omega 3 fatty acids. Learn constantly. It might not make you more intelligent, but it\u2019ll put your intelligence to use. You\u2019ll gain knowledge you can apply to the world around you. You won\u2019t be more intelligent and thus you won\u2019t get a higher IQ, but you\u2019ll be better equipped to manipulate your environment with experience. It would be easier to protect your current intelligence from declining by protecting your brain. Don\u2019t play head concussing sports like football or boxing. Don\u2019t do drugs or drink too much. Don\u2019t hang out with emotionally abusive people. They might not make you less intelligent, but they\u2019ll sap your motivation and inhibit your achievements. You can\u2019t change the number of colors in the box, but you can do more with the colors you\u2019ve got. You can learn how to mix colors to make new ones. You can create amazing works of art. Or you can just leave them in the box. There\u2019s a big difference. It\u2019s not what you have, it\u2019s what you do with it.  ",

            "answer_text": "From an early age (like age 0-5) during the critical time-periods when the brain is developing and growing you can increase IQ by simply eating enough food (calories) and getting certain nutrition (iodine). The brain won't develop properly without enough food and certain nutrition. Also perhaps anytime until age 14-19 or so diet might have a big effect on IQ. Humans reach 80% of their adult brain size by age 2, 90% by age 5, and 100% by age 14-19. Iodine seems to have a big effect on IQ (The Effects of Iodine Deficiency in Pregnancy and Infancy, Iodine deficiency as a cause of brain damage, Intelligence Quotient and Iodine Intake: A Cross-Sectional Study in Children). Multiple studies show that iodine boosts IQ by 10-15 points or so (during early ages)\u2026but I don\u2019t know if it will have any effect after the brain has stopped developing. Seaweed and iodized salt are high in iodine content. Now after the brain has stopped developing and growing much (around age 14-19) there's probably not much you can do except: Temporary starvation has been shown to elevate stem cells in the body, including in the brain which causes neurogenesis (the generation of the new neurons) A periodic diet that mimics fasting promotes multi-system regeneration, enhanced cognitive performance and healthspanCertain mind-exercises allegedly increase IQ (but I\u2019m not sure if any studies have been done on it).There\u2019s one exercise that allegedly allows you to have an extremely high IQ if you practice it enough (like IQ 150+), it\u2019s called image streaming.What you do is for 10\u201330 minutes a day close your eyes and describe aloud any subject in as much sensory detail as possible. It could be any subject or topic like, say \u201cthe beach\u201d. With your eyes shut you would describe the sight, sound, feeling, taste, smell of the beach, the sand, the sky, etc\u2026in as much detail as possible out loud while imagining the sensory details.I tried this exercise once or twice but not consistently (since I was never really interested in increasing IQ) but I noticed that imagining and visualizing things became much easier so becoming good at image streaming really may increase your IQ dramatically. You would be able to visualize and imagine things easily if you became good at it.I wonder what would happen if kids practiced this at early ages\u2026.I wonder if any experiments or studies have been done on the effects on this exercise. What if we could easily make any population have IQs 150+?Nikola Tesla wrote in his autobiography about how he use to see images in his mind and practiced imagining things at a young age (something very similar to image streaming):\u201cEvery night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys\u2014see new places, cities and countries\u2014live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations. This I did constantly until I was about seventeen when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. \u201c (Tesla, Nikola. My inventions. the Philovox, 1919.)My personal guess is that if little kids practiced this image streaming exercise daily until a certain age they would probably grow up to have a super-high IQ, but I\u2019m not sure it would really have the same effect on adults (since their brain stopped developing and is physically deteriorating).It could be that increasing your IQ is similar to increasing muscle mass (nutrition and certain exercises) or it could be fixed and nearly unchangeable after a certain age\u2026who knows.

            "answer_text": "Ron Richards\u2019 answer focuses on whether you\u2019re trying to get a good score on a test\u2014for what reason I dunno. Benjamin Sun\u2019s answer focuses on the process level. To their entries let me add a few bits. First, those of us born with high IQs may not be the best help for you, because your best model is people who made themselves smarter by dint of hard work, while for the rest of us it came naturally without conscious effort. That said, I\u2019ve noticed that people with lower IQs tend to want easy answers; to want certainty at the expense of reality; have lower tolerance for ambiguity; and lack autocognition\u2014self-awareness. For example, when I see a political campaign ad for a candidate/issue/party I favor, I will usually feel a strong desire to agree enthusiastically. Agreement feels good. Feeling self-righteous feels good. But i fight it, even though I feel a kind of \u201cwind\u201d blowing at my back. Because I\u2019m far more committed to knowing the truth than to just feel good. And I\u2019m painfully aware of the many, many times I\u2019ve used my high IQ to rationalize believing and/or doing stupid things. It\u2019s autocognition that saves you from that kind of folly. This kind of self-reflection, the ability to watch yourself doing something, so to speak, that distinguishes smarties from dummies. Then there\u2019s curiosity. The not so smart often don\u2019t want to learn something unless they know how it can benefit them up front (if it isn\u2019t the sort of scandal/outrage/spicy stuff that fills the pages of tabloids). I don\u2019t know if you can learn curiosity, but if you aren\u2019t naturally curious maybe you can train yourself to explore more, just as someone on the austistic spectrum who\u2019s face blind can teach himself to \u201cread\u201d faces\u2014something that comes naturally to the rest of us. The essence of intelligence is disciplined playfulness. I read a book on string theory, every though that\u2019s way outside my areas of expertise. And it was hard slogging. But I didn\u2019t do it to make money at something or to get a higher score on a test\u2014I did it because I wanted to have a better idea of how things work, whether I could monetize that at some point or not. Intelligent people also tend to exhibit a lot of laterality\u2014seeing relationships others miss. Xerox Corporation developed the first graphical user interface, but Steve Jobs was the one who \u201cgot\u201d how it could revolutionize computer use. And they\u2019re also good at filtering out fake connections, which social media are full of (conspiracy theorizing). Now consider this critter:  You\u2019ve probably never seen or heard of it before. If you\u2019re highly intelligent you\u2019ll find out what it is, even though knowing that will probably never make you a cent or enable you to impress anyone who isn\u2019t a biologist.

            "answer_text": "In case of your mental normality, this is a list of proven methods: A safe dosages of methylphenidate, modafinil, amphetamine, nicotine, caffeine+l-theanine, aerobic exercising, proper nutrition and sleep, competitive environment (f.e college), meditation and overall growth-minded thinking. What annoy me is that most of people will see here only drugs, but a small amount of users will notice that the most stable and notable results are provided by sport, sleep and nutrition. No matter how much of Ritalin is taken, your increased IQ will not be wired in your brain. Your D2 receptor is bitten with every dosage you could consume. Smart people are smart, because they know that aerobic trainings will increase D2-receptor density. Therefore stabilise any unwanted dopamine disregulation. So, considering you are smart, what you will do is combining of methyl|amphetamine in a rational quantities, eat protein of animal background as a major part of menus, sleep with melatonin 8 hours, use time-management to challenge your mind. You know, I read Reddit from time to time, and I see many people on adderall and ritalin watching porn all the days. They are death people, do not be the same. Write your goals and establish time-limitation in order to see the working of medication. If you are driving to the formulated goals, then it means some of the psychostimulants are helpful in your case. If really nothing is changed, then do not take it. Remember about sport (Wikipedia - articles - aerobic exercising on the brain (followers of stable IQ know where they have to go\u2026.(A little bit of Russian humor))) ",

            "answer_text": "Before I talk about how to boost intelligence we first have to define the term (but, if you want to go to the best way to boost your intelligence simply scroll down and skip the next 2 parts):  Intelligence is a very fickle term. Most of us think of IQ (Intelligence Quotient) when talking about it, assuming that it shows how smart you are. Therefore, increasing your IQ, or your intelligence, should make you smarter, more versatile in how you use your brain, generally a better student and more adapt to handle difficult situations. But this is not at all what intelligence is. Your IQ is merely a number used to predict how well you will do in school. Nothing more. It doesn\u2019t mean you are smart, dumb, versatile or can handle difficult situations at all. It just means that if you have a higher number you are going to be more adapt to handling the school system.  That being said, if you want to boost your intelligence it depends on what intelligence you want to boost:  These are 9 types of intelligence taken from 9 Types Of Intelligence - Infographic. Here you can clearly see that just having an higher IQ does not determine how smart you are in the world. There are too many things for us to learn and some of us are going to be more intelligent in certain areas than others. Just because the logical-mathematical intelligence is most often used in schools does not mean it is the only type.  That being said, the single best way to increase your intelligence (in any of these intelligences) is to challenge yourself. When you go outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself you obtain experiences that will push you to handle the situation for whatever it is. No matter how much you think about something, unless you experience it you will never know how to handle it. But once you have experienced it you will be able to use that knowledge in every other area of your life. Think about this question: How come most masters in any field seem so smart in other fields? It\u2019s because they can transfer what they learned in their field onto any other area of life. For example, let\u2019s take a martial artist and ask them about how the universe works. If they understand it even slightly they will make analogies with martial arts to explain it better to themselves, because that is where they have the most amount of knowledge and wisdom. They have experienced more in this one field by forcing themselves into countless uncomfortable situations and grew in their intelligence. Of course the martial artist master may not be a master in seeing how nature works and will not have the greenest of thumbs, but they will be able to pick it up more quickly than most because of their ability to transfer their knowledge. That is why the wise are always very old; they just have experienced the most! This has changed with the times, especially since the world the younger generations live is vastly different than the one the older generations lived in, but in older times this was certainly true. Experiencing life, overcoming challenges and solving problems hands on is the best way to boost your intelligence. If you have to fight for survival every day you will be extremely intelligent in survival within no time. If you force yourself to talk to 30 strangers every day, your social intelligence will be astronomical within just a few months. The first question you should ask yourself is in what area you want to become more intelligent in. The second question is: What is the most challenging thing you can do in this field? And then go out and do it! ",

            "answer_text": "An IQ of 100 is average. IQ is not like an exam where 100 is the highest score. 100 means that you have the same intelligence as most people who are the same age as you. An IQ greater than 100 means that you\u2019re intellectual level is above your own age level. Why would you want to be average unless you are well below average? But regardless, what you need to know is that (1) IQ is just a test, and (2) IQ is not fixed. An IQ is just a score given a test much like a test for any other subject matter, and just like any kind of test, one can get better grades if one prepares for the test. If you know the type of test in advance then there are specific techniques that one can learn to improve one\u2019s score during the test, and also learning patterns for the types of questions being asked. As such, having a high IQ in this case simply means that you good at taking that sort of a test. But having a high score is superficial, what you really want is to improve your general intelligence. If what you are really after is becoming truly intelligent, then that can be rectified too, and I don\u2019t mean intelligent in the sense of being educated or simply knowing a lot of facts and trivia. Intelligence is a product of genetics, upbringing, peers/environment and techniques. Nothing much can be done about genetics, and upbringing is a thing of the past if you are already an independent adult. But if you have a normal brain then much can be done to improve it to gain higher intelligence. On the other hand, one has control over both peers and environment. Your choice of the people around you will greatly influence your IQ. It is unavoidable that your peers will rub off on you by your interaction with them. A stimulating and varied environment is also conducive to increasing your general intelligence. There is a well known anecdote about Socrates (real or fictitious) dunking a student under water, click here for the complete story. The main lesson being that one can gain wisdom if one really wanted it. That is why becoming more intelligent is a deliberate choice, there are specific things that you can do and learn to become more intelligent. Technique is actually just a skill to be learned. Intelligent people have the same brain capacity as everyone else but they have learned or discovered more effective thinking techniques. Techniques such as processes, tricks and mental tools that allow you to take shortcuts, think faster or get better results. There are books which teach mental techniques such as the book, \u201cHow to be Twice as Smart\u201d, which is highly recommend. \u201cConfident Decision Maker\u201d shows you a more systematic approach to making decisions as opposed to the haphazard approach that most people take. \u201cThinking Strategically\u201d may be on the higher level but there are many valuable techniques there as well. These and innumerable books like these teach you the techniques that you can use to make more effective use of your brain. But of course, reading them is not enough, the techniques learned need to be practiced and put into practice until they become second nature that one no longer needs to think about them to be of benefit. Techniques can also be discovered by solving puzzles. Many puzzles actually belong to a class of puzzles wherein there are patterns to the solution that can be applied to other similar puzzles. Books by Martin Gardner are a good start. A side benefit of improving one\u2019s intelligence organically is that one will naturally fare better and score higher in IQ tests. ",

            "answer_text": "Read.  Everything you can.  Fiction, non-fiction, newpapers, magazines, Quora, online, offline, everything.  If there's \"highbrow\" stuff that you are particularly interested in, focus on that.  It's easy to find; if you can find a bookstore near you, check out their magazine rack, for starters.  Look online for periodicals like \"The Paris Review\", \"Atlantic Monthly\", \"Harpers\", \"National Review\"; literature anthologies like \"Granta\"; and even things like \"People\", or \"Hello\" or \"OK\", magazines like \"WWD\" (\"Womens Wear Daily\") and \"Architectural Digest\" for a sense of applied art, design, and style and popular trends.  Read fiction - good, classic, amazing fiction (Hemingway, Porter, Twain, Harper Lee); sci-fi (LeGuin, Vonnegut, Tolkien, Orwell, Bradbury, Asimov), classic horror (Edgar Allen Poe, Lovecraft, Stoker, Shelley, et. al); non-fiction (Capote, Krakauer, Larson, Lewis) and even book reviews (like the New York Times Book Review section) to see what people are writing about, and what good writers and thinkers think about what they've read.  Check out the best-sellers list, and read.  A lot.  Find something you love; read a few things you might not think you'd like, on recommendation of others, and figure out why you didn't (or why you actually did) end up liking it.  Maybe even join or start a book club, and invite your \"more intelligent\" friends to be a part of it.   I had a friend in college who was terribly insecure about her intelligence and knowledge.  It was ridiculous; she was a bright, savvy person.  But she felt her \"highbrow\" knowledge was lacking.  So she reads.  Everything.  And she has far surpassed her so-called \"highbrow\" and cultured friends, because she has developed an understanding and curiosity about the world that is astonishing, now, in its complexity and breadth.   There's still lots of stuff she doesn't know, but who knows much of anything, really?  Reading is a kickstart to opening up your imagination and recognizing that there are many ways to see the world. Then you might understand where your friends are coming from, how to contrast their perspective with yours, and have some discussions about what you both learn, know and think about.  Chances are they'll start thinking you're the one who has the highbrow. ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "The original IQ test was designed in 1904 simply to help to distinguish children who were mentally challenged from children who could do the work, but were simply lazy and entitled. When working with children and you encounter problems, the first thing to ask is if they are doing that because they CANNOT do the task or because they WILL NOT do the task. The IQ test is one way to see, but not the only way. The IQ test only tests how quickly we can process and use information. It does not test your strengths socially, emotionally, or anything except intelligence. To say that one\u2019s IQ determines the value of a person is just plain wrong. There is so much more that makes up who you are, and ALL of it is important. If your IQ test measures 99, then it shows that you are right in with everyone else, right at the top of the bell curve.  It means you have lots of company! If you look at the curve, while anything is possible, the IQ numbers are not even listed below 55 and above 145. Personally, I think that your friend (and others) are not being honest, and certainly inflated with his or her own view of themselves. You cannot increase your IQ up to 200. So what? To do that would be like me trying to be six foot tall. No matter how hard I\u2019d try, I\u2019d never grow an inch. In fact, in my seventies, I keep getting shorter every year! But the question is this: what can we do to improve ourselves? Are we becoming more mature every year? Do we have an attitude of love and kindness? Do we push back against injustice and help those around us? Remember, you are uniquely qualified to accomplish some things on this earth that no one else will do as well as you will. Some of those things will be noticed by the rest of the world, and many of them will be done in anonymity, but the truth is that it is all important. The choice is up to you, to be all you are created to be, or to focus on what you cannot control. It sounds like your friend has a bit of growing up to do! ",

            "answer_text": "About improving cognitive function through training, specific training can only improve specific cognitive functions, such as your Japanese Listening Practice can not improve your ability to read Japanese Characters, let alone can not help you learn to draw Manga. It depends on what cognitive functions you need to improve. For example, practicing to memorize some words and retelling them after a while, practicing to memorize a number string and then retell it, can improve your technique of remembering complex texts that have no special meaning. Moving target shooting game can improve the ability to handle complex visual information. Practice mental arithmetic can improve your ability to counting in everyday life, but can not improve your higher mathematics test scores. The best cognitive training is to do your favorite job or have a fun hobby and try to do it best. In this way, you train the cognitive functions you need most and do not waste extra time. For example, learning a new language, learning to draw comics and manga, can improve your multiple cognitive functions. Playing computer games may improve certain cognitive functions, but in order to prevent you from indulging in them, it is not recommended to play too much. Shooting exercises and automobile racing, which are dangerous for yourself and others, must also be done in a dedicated venue.  About preventing cognitive impairment. First of all, we need to maintain good nutritional intake. For example, people who consume too much monosaccharides and too much fat need to adjust their diet to avoid cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injuries. Vegans need to pay attention to vitamin B12, iron and protein supplements. Second, to maintain a proper length of sleep, you can refer to the recommended sleep time for different ages, when lack of sleep need appropriate supplements. Finally, severe depression and anxiety can impair cognitive function. It is not easy to maintain a good mood. The pressure from the outside world and your own genetic factors are beyond your control. What you could do is believe in a transcendental power (For example, G-d). And when you feel depressed, or feel unwell and lost your interest, you should seek help from doctor as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are currently no proven methods to prevent a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. What we could do is to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases through good habits and reduce the damage caused by mood disorders through timely medical treatment. ",

            "answer_text": "I just came up with a possible answer to this, in response to a related question: My IQ is 133. Can I become a genius? So I\u2019ll just quote that in it\u2019s entirety. \u201c Maybe. How hard do you want to try? Are you willing to follow the nebulous advice of some random guy on the internet who everyone thinks is crazy? Because if so, then today\u2019s your lucky day! I have no idea if this will work or not, but you\u2019re free to try, and I\u2019m pretty sure this is the best chance you have. Practice awareness meditation until you can hear your thoughts. If you do it right, this should take a few years. Step 1: practice being aware of something in front of you. Step 2: practice moving your awareness around between multiple things, staying on each thing for a short time. Step 3: practice expanding your awareness, radially, from a single thing; and practice compressing your awareness down to a single point, a sub-portion of a single thing. Step 4: practice moving your awareness into yourself. Step 5: practice becoming aware of a slice of your body, and slowly move that slice through your body, making sure you never lose awareness of the slice. Step 6: practice becoming aware of your whole body all at once. Step 7: practice becoming aware of your base feelings: agitation, annoyance, comfort, etc. If you panic, try to be aware of your panic. If you get in a fighting mood, try to be aware of that. Step 8: practice becoming aware of your general emotions: happiness, fear, sorrow, love, etc. Practice becoming aware of your feelings in response to everything that happens during the day. Step 9: practice becoming aware of your thoughts. Do normal meditation, where you sit down and try to not think, except instead of trying to not think, you\u2019re trying to hear your thoughts. Let your brain think, and follow each thought thoroughly. If you do this right, you\u2019ll notice your wandering thoughts come to an end. Okay, at this point, if you\u2019ve done it right, you\u2019ll be able to have a small amount of control of your thoughts, which should make it possible for you to become smarter. Step 10: practice becoming aware of your subconscious. This is a lot harder to explain, and by this time you should be used to it, so just try and see what happens. Step 11: practice taking a singular thought, and expanding the thought itself into a range of thoughts, or a possibility space of thoughts. Also practice taking a singular thought, and compressing it down to a singular sub-thought. Step 12: practice taking two thoughts, expanding them, and mixing the expanded thoughts together. This should allow your brain to perform indirect calculations on fuzzy concepts. Step 13: practice doing step 12 with everyday things, throughout the entire day. Try having a single thought, like driving, held in the back of your mind throughout the entire day, and let it mix with other thoughts, and observe the results. Also try mixing completely unrelated thoughts whenever something new or weird come up. IF you\u2019ve spent the probably 5\u201310 years it takes to get this far, and IF it even works, then you might very well successfully increase your IQ to just over 150 this way. This is basically how geniuses think, and it might be possible to train your brain to think in the same way. Step 14\u201316: chain expanded thoughts together to make thought ranges and thought sets. Take two thought sets, and let them mingle. This is 170 IQ. Step 17\u201319: chain thought ranges and thought sets together until you get the entirety of available possibility space in relation to something working together in your brain. Take two possibility spaces, and let them mingle. Find the local maximums and minimums of the two. This is 190 IQ. I\u2019ve never tried coming up with an actual answer to this before, so this is the first time I\u2019ve genuinely, consciously thought about this (it\u2019s been in the back of my subconscious for a long time, though). Anyway, good luck. This might very well work, or it might not. I\u2019ve done all of this myself, but I had the IQ that makes it easy to begin with. \u201c If your IQ is 110\u2013130, an additional 3 steps step might be necessary before step 11 where you try to take your thoughts and mix them together to form chains of thoughts without first trying to expand your thoughts. If your IQ is 90\u2013110, an additional 3 steps step might be necessary before the step above where you try to take individual thoughts and mix them together. You may need to pay more attention to your subconscious in order to get results from mixing thoughts. If your IQ is below 90, I don\u2019t know what the additional steps might be. Such additional steps might actually be a part of steps 7\u201310. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many kinds of intelligence: linguistic / verbal, mathematical, spatial, kinetic, musical and so on. Most IQ tests measure a single kind of intelligence - math, verbal, spatial etc. I take your question to mean how can an adult become more intelligent holistically than to improve their score on the dimension tested specifically by an IQ test.    While I do not know if all intelligences (e.g., musical) can be increased even with effort - I suspect not - there are ways to increase \"practical intelligence\" i.e, have a wide spectrum of knowledge coupled with an ability to see the big-picture by synthesizing first principles from various subjects. Here are some things one can do to increase practical intelligence: 1. Take 101 / 201 courses in world history, philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, economics, psychology, corporate finance, marketing, analytical methods, art & theater. 2. Read from diverse sources but learn to differentiate opinion from fact; read one random wikipedia article everyday. 3. Observe, question, discuss: A curious mind is likely to be more intelligent. When you read something, think what are the underlying assumptions that must be true for it to hold. What, if proven false, would break the fact / opinion's validity. Observe whether the theories you read can be corroborated with enough (even if anecdotal) evidence. Discuss with those who are equally / better read and curious. 4. Get involved in mini-projects: What you read, you may forget but what you do, you are likely to remember. Get involved in small projects that aren't in the center of your expertise but related at the periphery. For e.g., if you are a marketing professional, see whether there is a project in sales or after-sales service that you can be involved in. These projects could be at work or outside (whether as a volunteer or on a pro-bono or part-time basis). You'll bring in a different perspective while also learning from the views of others who have had different life experiences. 5. Write a Nostradamus Journal: Every week or two, synthesize all your reading / learning into a few trends / predictions along with an expected timeline. Review your previous entries to see whether trends / predictions panned out as you expected and if not, what factors resulted in the change. Think whether those factors were foreseeable or not. Over time, with this exercise, you should become better at seeing the \"big picture\". ",

            "answer_text": "I believe this: you are born with a genetic maximum IQ that you can ever attain. This I would call your Maximum IQ Potential, and it has to do only with your genes. However, very few people reach that maximum potential, unless their upbringing ( nutrition, education, stressors, poverty, health, domestic violence, country of origin, etc) are just right. Therefore, someone may have a measured IQ of, say, 98. Genetically speaking, that individuals\u2019 maximum possible IQ is, say, 118. If conditions are right, and this person works on developing their intellect, then they may achieve an IQ of 115, 117, or up to 118; never higher. Does race play a part in this genetic scenario? Most likely. Ask yourselves: Does race play a part in an individual\u2019s athletic performance? physical Stamina? Physical strength? Probability of a given disease or organ failure? Yes, it does, and science knows it. So, as muscles, livers, blood and glands are organs, and their performance can vary according to a person\u2019s race, so is the brain, which, ultimately is just another organ. The issue is, of course, how to define \u201crace\u201d. If you study dogs, and muddle the difference between races of dogs and breeds of dogs, you will see that all comparisons between breeds are valid and the results are supported by data. The thing is that there is no discrimination when discussing dogs, but we all know which breed of dog is smarter, which one is fiercer and more protective, which have better scent detecting , hunters, herding, which may suffer from a given illness, etc. Same with pure breeds of all domestic animals, chickens, cows, horses, and cats. I have a siamese cat, Clawy, and the predicted traits of her personality and demeanor per her breed, are spot on. She is the only cat I have had who \u201cfetches\u201d like a dog would. Well, I just read that Siamese cats are known to do that! If you met me, you\u2019d see there is not a less racist person in the world. If studies and publications such as \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d are considered to be prejudiced, racists, and based on poorly made tests, the answer is not simply to discount the theory, but to come up with better tests, like tests that better compensate for social environments and cultural differences, and better publications that don\u2019t have underlying agendas. If any serious study is to be undertaken on the subject, the two main components of the study need to be clarified, established and identified. Those are: What is RACE? And What is INTELLIGENCE?, because, believe it or not, concepts as basic and fundamental as those are not clearly defined. Personally, I believe that this index called IQ, as a measure of brain horsepower is a very poor indicator of success. I happen to have been tested with an IQ that is supposed to be high (135), and I can tell you this: To succeed in life I would gladly trade some of that for perseverance, application and will-power to succeed.

            "answer_text": "Your brain is already greater than the best computer on the earth. It is just operating mechanism that matters and makes difference. So you should only give it the fuel it needs and take care of it regularly. In order to prevent it from getting unhealthy. To maintain the operating mechanism\u2019s efficiency just keep your brain busy with new and effort requiring activities. Because rolling stones gather no moss. Don\u2019t let your brain to gather dust/moss. Here is my personal list: NutritionOmega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids (you can take fish oil daily, but eating fish like salmon 3\u20134 times a week is near OK) They help myelination of nerve axons.Vitamin B12 (ask your doctor about it before taking as suplement)Folic Acid (eat walnuts, almonds and regular nuts, you may use pills but ask your doctor about it before taking as suplement)Fatty diet (our brain is mostly fat so fat is one of the main building blocks of brain, so eat fatty and don\u2019t mind calories. But it should be natural fat, such as homemade butter from a village)Hydration (drink at least 2\u20133 liters of water everyday, if drinking this much is hard for you, then don\u2019t drink with regular 200mL glasses but try 1500mL bottles instead. Because big servings feel less, also don\u2019t fill same plastic bottle more than 3 times)Generally all natural (not so called organic but natural) foods, fruits etc.Exercise (I believe no explanation needed, after that fatty diet, you may want to burn the calories)Sleep (you should sleep no less than 7 but no more than 8 hours, in between is optimal)In order to optimize melatonin secretion you should sleep in complete darkness and complete silence (also from 23:00 to 05:00 you should be at bed)So something like 22:30 to 6:30 is best time to sleep.Meditation (you can try it as a daily 10-20 min habit, in 2\u20134 weeks you\u2019ll see the benefits)Most importantly, Push your brain (you should do things that require high brain activity such as:Playing chessPuzzles such as Sudoku etc.Using non-dominant hand (for better communication between two hemispheres of brain)Brush your teeth with opposite hand.Write with opposite hand.Eat with opposite hand.Change your fingerprints for opening your phone from dominant to non-dominant hand.Put your phone to the non-dominant hand side pocket.(you got the idea, get creative and diversify the examples)Going home through different waysTrying new thingsLearning a new languageMathematics (it is really not as hard as it seems)ReadingLearning in generalDisciplineConstancy bears fruit. Throughout the day have some regular activities like:Waking up and going bed at the same time each and every day.Brushing your teeth three times a day.Washing your face before and after sleep.Journaling before bed or twice a week.Meditating 20 minutes a day.Taking fish oil capsules at 7:00 AM everyday.Eating a handful of nuts everyday.Brushing your teeth/using utensils/using pencil with your non dominant hand.If you continue this discipline your brain will get used to your daily activities and they will become habits. Habits don\u2019t require much mental effort so your brain can use the remaining energy and will power for other more important things.So make your regular things a habit and focus on important things.Lastly keep away from everything harmful. (You know what is harmful and what is not so I won\u2019t give much detail but here is some of things I stay away from)SugarSmokingDrugsAlcoholismTVExcessive Smart Phone usageSocial Media etc.Bad/Junk foodStressI want to finish with one of my favourite quotes of George Carlin.  Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. -George Carlin If you are average then there is no hope for you. Don't be content with mediocrity. Try to be unique, strive to become more. The brain power you may need can be provided by computers these days. When you no longer need that processing power, you\u2019ll realize you already have the ability to achieve great works even without more brain power. Great people aren\u2019t neccessarily the supercomputers of their time. ",

The Dr.s treated me with so many antidepressants on high dosages that have a brain, eye, and heart damage. i TOOK MYSELF OFF ALL ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND the FIRST DOCTOR THAT GAVE ME ADDERALL AS A TEST ALL OF MY DIAGNOSED ILLNESSES FOR DEPRESSION LIFTED IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS LIKE A MIRACLE CURE. ADD WASNT EVEN INVENTED WHEN I WAS A KID SO I NEVER WAS DIAGNOSED.

It's like something built (genetics) improved by a modification brain plasisity as you understand the universe.In a way, it's not exactly your genetics, per se, it's (brain plasticity) how our biosphere evolved with all animals to a greater or lesser degree. It exists in many animals. Instinct vs. learned. Great learning can increase your IQ, even what your absolute maximum that you were born with.",

            "answer_text": "The easiest and quickest way to get smarter is to READ.  The Benefits of READING: Develop your cognition through deep contemplative thinkingExpose yourself to new ideas and conceptsCome up with your own new ideas and theoriesGet information about how the world worksReceive the knowledge and wisdom of successful peopleIncrease your creativity and imaginationMake yourself more intelligent by getting the gist of more ideasLearn from the mistakes of others peopleForce your brain to adapt to the mental stress of having to learn (Neuroplasticity)Expand your horizons and gain competence in a wider range of topicsPut all of that what you\u2019ve learned into action and improve the quality of your life How to Get More Reading into Your Day Make room for daily reading. You have to commit to reading something every single day. The best way is to simply schedule it \u2013 make it a part of your routine.Carry a book with you. Whenever you have a dull moment in your day \u2013 while using public transport, waiting for an appointment or having a break \u2013 just pop out a paperback and bust through a few pages.Listen to audiobooks. It\u2019s incredibly simple and convenient. You can listen to them almost everywhere \u2013 while driving, while walking, while working out, while cooking\u2026wherever.The Dangers of Reading The biggest danger to reading is that you won\u2019t apply the knowledge. You have to put what you\u2019ve read into use, otherwise it\u2019s pointless to invest so much time into it. Instead, I read so that I could apply the knowledge learned into my life. You don\u2019t want to just comprehend \u2013 you want to get the wisdom and wisdom is knowledge that is put into use and gained through experience. You have to take action on what you\u2019ve learned, otherwise it can\u2019t be said that you\u2019ve actually understood it. There\u2019s a very important concept I\u2019m about to share with you \u2013 it\u2019s speed of implementation. In essence, it\u2019s about taking action as soon as possible and not waiting for the perfect moment. This way you\u2019re not only increasing your learning curve but will also get more results. In 2016 I read over 300 books in total. It was the most successful year of my life so far because I not only speed read but also put that knowledge into action. Check out my video how I did it:  If you want to get tips for speed-reading, then read my blog: http://siimland.com/read-300-books-this-year Stay Smart, Stay Empowered!Siim ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote a dissertation on intelligence testing in the U.S. And Mexico. It is a misconception that intelligence is fixed. A particularly interesting study of 8th graders followed over decades found swings of 20\u201330 points in IQ were not uncommon. What explained that? Largely the intellectual stimulation they received. Kids who quit school at 8th grade and became ditch diggers showed drops in IQ while the average kid who stayed in school through medical school saw his IQ rise. What can you do? Stay in school. I\u2019m 59 years old and have four degrees including a Ph.D. And I try to take a course at least once a year. Recently, I completed a course in responsive web design. You can take classes at the community college, online, at a local coding boot camp. It doesn\u2019t have to cost you a lot of money. I have a subscription to Lynda: Online Courses, Classes, Training, Tutorials and take classes on that because it interests me. I'm currently taking a course in Spanish, too. Read. A lot. If you hate to read, then read a little until it gets easier. Watch documentaries. There are tons of them free on youtube, on fedflix (the government site), I think there is even an inexpensive documentary channel on line. Hang out with intelligent people. Your local library probably has book groups you can join, your local university probably has public lectures. When I taught at a couple of major universities they would have the most amazing people speak and I was always surprised how few people turned up. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 people who have achieved amazing results at improving the way people's brain works.  Daniel Amen who studies brain scans and Barbara Arrowsmith-Young who pioneered a method of classifying individual capabilities in such a way that these could be trainable. Here are their 2 very different Ted Talks.     The common thread to both of them is how to find and fix defects in the brain. It is the fixing of defects that produce the fastest and most astonishing results. While this is a common thread, their methodologies are very different. One studies the anatomical structure of brains, the other studies the visible capabilities of people based on what things they can and can't do. Both talks are very apropos and worth listening to, as they tell a story of major advancement with highly specific regimens that are personalized and diagnostic, not one-size-fits-all in nature. But if your brain is already working normally, with no particular defect, then taking it to a new higher level is an ongoing and slow process, one I've been engaged with my entire adult life. But I engage in this out of an interest in continuous improvement, not out of any particular IQ limiting need. The issue to be aware of, before undertaking this ongoing effort is that people are rarely IQ limited in life.  What we know from studying competitive fields, even apparently IQ focused fields like chess, physics, business, finance, investing, is that the top levels are achieved by people who have an over-the-top interest in the field and who practice a particular form of focused practice and study. This concept is outlined in the book: Talent Is Overrated by Geoff Colvin. The whole modern word is set up to make it easy to not need a very high IQ to make your way in life. Even fields like computer science are filled with tools designed to reduce the cognitive load involved in solving hard problems. Even so, here's what you do to advance those skills. First look at both of the talks I pointed you at, and find out more about both of those speakers. I've read many books by them and about them, and never been disappointed, always learned something useful. Beyond their highly directed information, my general purpose approach is to push myself regularly into areas that are difficult for me, and keep pushing myself until the formerly difficult becomes easy, or until I reach a point of vastly diminishing returns. When I take tests, when I read, when I write, when I think, I try to push myself as far as I can. The only way I have to gauge the effectiveness of my approach is to pick up things that used to be hard for me and see how they are now, and most of the time what used to be hard has become easy. Still, nothing is perfect. It is very important to realize the overarching limitation of IQ. How many fingers am I holding up right now? What card am I thinking of? What stock is going to rise the most tomorrow? No pure think-tank IQ approach can answer these questions. You have to collect data, engage with the world, try things. There is one other thing that I was surprised about. My mind is pushed the furthest when I am running my own business, rather than when I am working for others.  And many of the most intelligent people I've ever met were all running small businesses. Once a business surpasses about 25 million in revenue the best approach is to delegate to experts, but prior to that time the wealth of the business usually isn't sufficient to afford good experts and do that effectively. So you often have to task switch constantly, think strategically, push yourself to the highest level. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to hack your IQ, reading dictionaries as suggested is a fine idea. Improving cognitive load is at the heart of that sort of thing, and it's definitely useful. However, I've found that hacking your personality is more at the core of becoming ~smarter~ (in this instance, I mean more capable). Reading is very important. Very, very, very important. Everyone I know who I deeply admire reads a lot, and that's because they have the imagination and abstract-thinking abilities that come from reading. The knowledge in the books almost seems like a byproduct of the real gift you're getting, which is how to think. However, note that having a larger vocabulary than most people is just going to make it harder to communicate with the world. Instead, try expanding your every-day working vocabulary. Push yourself to express your ideas eloquently and powerfully. Become a strong communicator, because really, what else is language good for? Most importantly (in my opinion), seek solutions. Seek knowledge. Looking up words and ideas is a good start, but it doesn't seem like the fastest way to build real-life skills that can utilize your current IQ. Google or otherwise find the answers to any questions you have. Find fields or areas in your life that excite you, and deeply pursue those, no matter how trivial they are. The more you do that, the broader your interests will grow.  If you wonder about which route to work or school is faster, conduct experiments. If you wonder about anything, conduct experiments. Get in the habit of questioning and then, most importantly, following through. Don't just identify problems, find their solutions. The more you do this, the better you'll get at it, and I can't imagine a more useful skill, if only because of how broadly applicable it is to be able to break down any sort of problem into components, and then solve it. Part of IQ is cognitive load (short-term memory) and that can be improved by learning new words, sure, but another part is pattern matching. And when it comes to real-world applicability, the latter seems far more useful.   ",

            "answer_text": "I recently did a semi-scientific analysis to answer just this question. Well, almost this question. I looked at which lifestyle choices most affect cognitive performance. The analysis was for my job as a scientist at Cambridge Brain Sciences, which is a tool for tracking lifestyle and cognitive performance. Cognitive performance isn't quite the same thing as IQ, but it's more important. Your performance changes from day to day, while IQ is generally thought of as more long-term. But I think cognitive performance matters more, because it results in advice better than \"be born with good genes and never get sick or injured.\" When focusing on performance, you can take steps so your brain is at its very best every day, which results in doing more with it, including scoring higher on an IQ test, if that's what floats your boat. Here are the results of my analysis. They're roughly prioritized from highest impact to lowest, based on strength of scientific evidence, widespread applicability, and public interest. Sleep. You'll do better at cognitive tasks the next day after the right amount of good sleep, plus it has long-term protective effects that science is just starting to discover. Exercise. And it goes beyond just getting healthier, which is good for your brain too, obviously. For example, some people do better at brain tests immediately after certain physical activities.Stress. More isn't always worse. A medium amount of stress is usually best for your brain's performance. Mood. Not to be confused with stress, mood can boost or hinder your immediate performance, depending on if you're happy or sad, excited or calm. A lot of other interventions really only work indirectly by putting you in a better mood.Social interaction. Dealing with people can be harder than an IQ test. Avoiding loneliness and regularly spending time with others has been associated with better cognitive performance, especially going into old age. Caffeine and alcohol. Pretty obvious, but finding the right amounts to take or avoid can be tricky. Long-term effects are not always clear either; is caffeine really perking you up, or just bringing you back to where you were before you got addicted?Hydration. A lot of people don't drink enough water, but it can really help. Music consumption. Music can be a distraction or a pick-me-up, depending on the genre and tempo. It may just be an artifact of mood changes, though; playing Mozart for your baby probably won't increase her IQ. Meditation. Science is still fully figuring it out, but there are promising results for certain types of meditation.Nootropics. Smart drugs or supplements are a bit of an unknown. Certain substances do have evidence behind them (someone mentioned blueberries earlier, which have promise), but it's easy to waste money on snake oil if you don't actually seek out scientific evidence and test to see what works for you.Notice that commercial brain training isn't on there. I won't say it can't work, but science has not found a method that does work yet, except when combined with one of the factors above. Of course, not every one of these lifestyle factors will work for everyone. They depend on your current cognitive ability, the specifics of how you implement each one, your age, etc. If you're curious about the relationship between your lifestyle and your brain, you might want to check out Cambridge Brain Sciences (full disclosure: as I mentioned, I'm a staff scientist there). Our service lets you monitor your brain health over time, while tracking high-priority lifestyle habit\u2014like sleep, stress, and exercise\u2014so you can get clues about how your lifestyle is affecting your brain.

            "answer_text": "By \u201craise IQ\u201d, I\u2019ll assume you really mean increase biological intelligence, not cheat on an IQ test. My understanding is that a person can\u2019t really increase his innate biological intelligence. What is possible, however, is to create an environment conducive to maximal brain health. Here are a few things you can do to maximize brain health: Physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, is associated with \u201cimprovements\u201d in fluid intelligence (Can Physical Activities Improve Fluid Intelligence? ). Exercise that involves coordinated movement also seems to help.You can improve your diet. One way is by getting enough essential omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into your diet. However, eating more fish is neuroprotective even when you control for the effect of increased omega-3-fatty acid levels in the blood. Increase your intake of polyphenols, found in cranberries, blueberries, grapes, cocoa, etc. Two dietary interventions which have also been found to help are caloric restriction and intermittent fasting. Proceed with caution if you want to go down that road.Reduce negative stress in your life. You can kill two birds with one stone by doing aerobic exercise, since it helps you to physiologically respond much better to stress. You can also reduce stress by meditating. You can try meditation on steroids, or neurofeedback, if that is more your style (Want to Raise Your IQ by 23 Percent? Neuroscience Says Take Up This Simple Habit).Increase the love in your life. By this I mean maintain a rich and supportive social network.Sleep more. Sleep deprivation reduces neurogenesis and increases neuroinflammation.Here is an open source paper from which I pulled a lot of this advice: Neuroplasticity and Clinical Practice: Building Brain Power for Health Last but not least: I\u2019m not a medical doctor, a psychologist, or a neuroscientist.

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhat are some of the best proven ways I can increase my IQ/Intelligence?\u201d First define the purpose of the mind. The purpose of the mind is to perceive, to pose, and to resolve problems related to survival. Notice there is no \u201cto prove\u201d in this purpose. If one wished \u201cto prove\u201d, or a subject, wished \u201cto prove\u201d something, what means would they have other than using the mind itself? Second, define the word intelligence. I believe the closest fitting definition to the purpose of the mind, for the word intelligence, is this one: Intelligence is the ability to perceive, to pose, or to resolve problems related to survival. So you could examine two or more people and their ability to perceive and resolve problems related to survival. One might rate one better than the other. One person might look at a problem and see something no one else sees. He resolves the problem. Shall we rate him or her more \u201cintelligent\u201d than the others? I had this happen to me one day. I was asked to look at a problem, that had not ever been solved. The person that asked me, said that he had asked (that means he paid them) 5 mathematicians to solve this problem, and they could not. He thought he might try an Engineer. I looked at it and gave him my solution. He did not quite like what I had written. After the fifth revision of this written solution, he was satisfied. I had seen something the other five had not, and I had solved it. He could finally see, that I had indeed solved it. Except, I was now the one who understood what he had received a patent for. I gave him 13 more continuing patent disclosures on his own patent. One person might be good at posing a problem or framing a problem for others to solve. I had this happen to me one day. Boeing Aircraft Company called me up one day and asked me (our company) to stop by and look at a problem they were having with their newest aircraft. Their Engineers had not been able to solve it. I looked at the problem and understood the problem, but had no immediate solution. So, when I got back to our company I asked three Engineers, one by one, how they would solve it. I described the problem, I posed Boeing\u2019s problem, and they understood the problem, but did not see a solution, or even that it was solvable. Each one happened to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t have your cake and eat too.\u201d I was hoping they would solve it for me, as I had no immediate solution either. But I did believe that it could be solved. So I looked at it depth, more like an Inventor would, more like Edison trying 10,000 things before solving the light bulb, and inventing something that works, than an Engineer just plugging in standard solutions. Finally, I had it. I worked out a drawing for Boeing to show them what it would look like. I made a graph to show how it worked. I took it to Boeing and they agreed that was what was needed. But they had not really believed our company could solve what Boeing Engineers had not, so they had just moved on. The aircraft was already moving onto the production line with the problem, not solved. That airplane still has that problem. A certain noise, a 60 hertz (cycles per second) buzz at exactly the same speed the engine is turning, when the aircraft is cruising at altitude when everyone wants it to be the most quite, so they can get some sleep. They said they could live with that. So here are the ways to improve IQ that I would recommend to you, if you wish to observe something for yourself, or others. Or if you wish to pose, or to frame a solution for others. You have to use two-way communications. For example, I might say, \u201cLook at that wall.\u201d Then I look at the person to see what they do. If they do not do it, I might say, \u201cI\u2019ll say that again, Look at that wall.\u201d When they have done it, then they might say, \u201cOkay.\u201d Then I would say, \u201cThank you.\u201d Two-way, a communication goes to them, and then a communication comes from them to me. So the idea is that excellent positive communications, two-way communications, and good control are the effective means. All that may only takes a second. Then your repeat for another wall. The exact wording of what to do, not so much. If a teacher or another student, does this for a entire class, for from 3 to 5 minutes, it has been shown to increase IQ by 5 points average for the class. I did this one time in the Air Force and a man said, \u201cI feel like a light bulb!\u201d Meaning he felt much smarter. That would be a good time to stop. It is really very easy and really light, when it is done right. Too much tension, not good. I would not consider this as a permanent change in intelligence, like some other methods. I would not expect it to work, if the teacher or student had not used good two-way communications, and ended off when the students were very bright and alert. There is a correct time to stop, to get the best results. Without two-way communications I would not expect anyone to improve IQ. Now, each of the means I suggest are in fact repairing when two-way communications have gone wrong in the past. For example, one study by Terman, The Genetic Study of Genius, used 1500 students with IQ\u2019s of 140 or above. He found in six years that his students had lost an average of 9 points of IQ based on his Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, or on his Terman Test. So that is 1.5 points of IQ lost per year of public school. Later research in Johannesburg South Africa about 1960, showed that this IQ loss in schools was occurring each year of school. And that when people located the words the students went past each year, and carefully defined them, the IQ for that year, returned. This is year by year. IQ lost, IQ returned. So a technique was developed to return all of this lost IQ due to words. In Terman\u2019s study the kids were very high IQ, so I estimate that for more normal students that the loss is 1.0 points of IQ per year of public school, including college. So for a high school graduate that would be K-12 or 13 years, or 13 points of IQ loss on the average. For a four-year college graduate, K-16, that would be 17 points of IQ, on the average. Again, there was a failure of communications where the student failed to understand a word, IQ lost. The word was located and properly defined, so the student now, does understand. IQ returns. You can do \u2018before and after\u2019 IQ tests on this, and when the technique is used, this is normally done. So there is lots of experience with this. 10\u2019s of thousands of people have done this. I have done this, I have received this. The technique is called Method One Word Clearing, or M1. For high school student I would say it would take 8 to 16 hours on the average. For college students, a good deal longer. It is normally done as the first action on a study course called, The Student Hat Course. That course teaches you how to study properly and avoid this loss in intelligence, and many, many other things. You should be flying along feeling brilliant after that course. There is a book you can read. It has exercises you can do. My wife and I read this book to each other and the family. The book is: Self Analysis: L. Ron Hubbard: 9781403144102: Amazon.com: Books The goal of that book is to improve your memory and emotional level. I estimate your reaction time will improve. I estimate if you do these exercises exactly per the book, that would increase your IQ. Again, excellent communications are the key, they are vital. You can do before and after IQ tests with this too. If you read these exercises to another for an hour a day, for 40 days, and another reads to you for and hour a day for 40 days, you should see measurable results on your before and after IQ tests. You should be able to measure the change in your emotional level every week or so, say every 8 or 10 hours. The basic way to improve intelligence is to remove pain from the mind. About one in three million people on Earth do not record pain in their minds. They never have recorded pain. They experience pain, but it is not in their minds. Pain is the basic thing one tends to avoid in the mind. These people have photographic memories, actually eidetic memories. But this is not the way this thing about pain was worked out and developed. See the book: Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health: L. Ron Hubbard: 9781403144843: Amazon.com: Books Chapter Two describes something called a Clear. This is a person that has erased the pain in their own minds. The people that have never recorded pain as a perception, are called Natural Clears. These people have a minimum IQ of 135. I estimate an average of 150 to 160 IQ for Clears. There are 10\u2019s of thousands of people that have \u201cgone Clear.\u201d This technology is well proven. One can take a person with an IQ of 70 and Clear them. Their IQ will rise to at least 135. I don\u2019t know how long that might take, but with the technology today, it can be done.

            "answer_text": "How have you gotten such a high IQ? I was born with it for the most part; almost entirely. That\u2019s the fact. As much as 85% of intelligence is heredity and most of the rest is prenatal or very early childhood. [My sister (who is a physicist and smarter than me by a bunch) told me yesterday that when I was 3 I had an intuitive grasp of Physics and explained that if I could fall off the toilet due to gravity pulling me down there must be something pushing me up on the toilet. I have no recollection of that discussion. Perhaps she read more into my answer than I actually intended\u2026] It seems unfair. Well it is I suppose. But Michael Jordan was born with the ability to be perhaps the greatest BBall player ever. He had to apply it and develop it; but the court is not level. He was born that way. I can envy him or admire him but it doesn\u2019t change anything. (And I\u2019m not in THAT league in terms of intelligence!) I put my pants on one leg at a time. I have to clean house and cook dinner and weed he garden. My life isn\u2019t that much different. Before I retired I had a boss and other people who told me what to do or what I could do, etc. On the other hand please believe me when I say that, while being smart is pretty nice and I wouldn\u2019t give it up, I don\u2019t really see it as making me all that different. I am different in other ways. I worked a long career with lots of people who weren\u2019t quite so smart but who knew their stuff and made effective partners in achieving things worth doing. (And at least a few who were smarter than me\u2026) For all practical purposes they knew things I didn\u2019t and my being \u201csmarter\u201d was often irrelevant. They are friends, colleagues and in my mind equals. I bet most of them don\u2019t know how smart I am and think I\u2019m at their level. Most of the time it never occurred to me that I might be smarter as a matter of fact. I have no disrespect for anyone based on their level of innate intelligence. I might as well complain about their eye color. I imagine Michael might be dissatisfied if he was teamed up with me for real, But then that wouldn\u2019t have ever happened. I won\u2019t go into the negatives, because that\u2019s a bell rung too often plus it\u2019s just silly, the positives far outweigh them and they aren\u2019t as bad as people think. And not by any stretch universal. Don\u2019t be jealous of someone\u2019s innate abilities your value as a person is most enhanced by how you use what you do have. Even average intelligence is an awesome amount of brainpower. ",

General intelligence, which may or may not be measured in part or whole by IQ, is probably one of the most important single attributes you can strive to increase or maintain. Ditto for IQ. However, there are other attributes like empathy, knowledge, wisdom, curiosity, intellectualism that are also important and sometimes are more so in different circumstances. Two quick examples before I directly answer the question: (1) Someone with high IQ but no motivation or curiosity probably won\u2019t be as \u201csmart\u201d as someone with high motivation and a hunger to learn with a lower IQ in the run. I think we all know a lot of really high IQ people that sometimes have challenges coping. (2) In many ways both ends of Bell Curve share many sometimes superficial similarities. So, IQ isn\u2019t everything though it\u2019s still a great thing to improve. Here are some scientifically reputable ways to improve IQ (and also memory, cognition, and other important traits) in no particular order: (1) Play puzzle games like Sudoku or take logic tests. Games like Magic The Gathering are also great thinking activities and social. I played that a lot when I was younger and it was a blast. (2) Stay healthy - you don\u2019t need to have a lot of muscle - just stay active, avoid sitting for more than 30\u201345 minutes in a row, give you heart and body some activity. (3) Try some spices like Cumin - that one, in particular has been shown to grow brain cells. Caffeine is also good for a quick increase in alertness (and IQ) as long as you don't take too much. (4) Get good sleep - the brain washes out the connections between neurons when you sleep. Too little and you get build up that can contribute to Alzheimer's and memory loss. (5) Keep stress down by doing things that make you happy, keep strong but not superficial relationships, and don\u2019t smoke marijuana. Doing the opposite can reduce IQ over long periods of time. Keeping many friends is also great but people who lack strong support groups can be detrimentally impacted by stress. (6) Make good decisions. No matter how high your IQ is, it doesn\u2019t if you\u2019re extremely foolish. One must be humble and want to learn to benefit from their IQ no matter what it is. Small changes are great - making one small but smarter change ever day and sticking to it can have huge improvements over a year and life equal to it greater than improvements to IQ. Changes also help to keep one\u2019s perspective fresh. What use is being smart if all you do is EXACTLY the same thing each and every day? We want IQ and being smart to pay off and IMPROVE our lives but the main way for that to happen is to APPLY it in new ways (sorry for the all caps). I\u2019ll add more here if I encounter or think of any! ",

            "answer_text": "20 or 30 years ago perhaps, there was a lot of popular science discussion going on about to which degree intelligence is hereditary and to which degree it is not. Today, these waters have calmed down. Still, the popular perception persists that intelligence is a known entity which can be measured like you measure time, distance, or body height. The answer below about Mark and John is an example of that misconception. But what we call intelligence is a heuristically conceived, not well defined, quite shadowy concept which has a certain use value in certain situations, but not more. It is used so much because a psychological industry, makes us believe into a concreteness which does not really exist.Given this, of course anyone can, and has to develop those talents which we tend to subsume under intelligence (or not): take a musical gift: if you don't have access to an instrument, if you don't find a competent teacher, your talent is likely to wither away.  And people who have a particular gift often strive to develop this, search for chances to improve themselves. And there are geniuses, certainly, in music, poetry, painting, mathematics, philosophy, learning languages, presenting themselves, (mis)leading other people or mediating between them, whatever. Some have multiple talents, some only one, and others just get well through this maze we call life, not becoming famous, but gaining satisfaction from a well-groomed family life, friends, by knowing when to sow and when to harvest, and when to pray. Some routinely cheat in a very inventive way, and make a living from that.All this has been called intelligence - but what do you gain by subsuming all these qualities under one name?  If I would take more time, I might go into Foucault's notion of discourse to elucidate how much a cultural concept intelligence really is, how much is is linked to, yes, well, power, but also modern definitions of the self, grooming those individual values we tend to think about as paramount.

            "answer_text": "There are primary elements involved in increasing your fluid intelligence, or cognitive ability. It would be impractical to constantly practice the dual n-back task or variations thereof every day for the rest of your life to reap cognitive benefits. But it isn\u2019t impractical to adopt lifestyle changes that will have the same\u2014and even greater cognitive benefits. These can be implemented every day, to get you the benefits of intense entire-brain training, and should transfer to gains in overall cognitive functioning as well. These five primary principles are:1. Seek Novelty2. Challenge Yourself3. Think Creatively4. Do Things The Hard Way5. Network Also to increase your productivity and improve intellect level : 1. Minimize Television Watching \u2013  The problem is watching television doesn\u2019t use your mental capacity OR allow it to recharge. It\u2019s like having the energy sapped out of a muscle without the health benefits of exercise. When you feel like relaxing, try reading a book instead. If you\u2019re too tired, listen to some music. When you\u2019re with your friends or family, leave the tube off and have a conversation. All of these things use your mind more than television and allow you to relax. 2. Exercise \u2013 I used to think that I\u2019d learn more by not exercising and using the time to read a book instead. But I realized that time spent exercising always leads to greater learning because it improves productivity during the time afterwards. Using your body clears your head and creates a wave of energy. Afterwards, you feel invigorated and can concentrate more easily. 3. Read Challenging Books \u2013 Many people like to read popular suspense fiction, but generally these books aren\u2019t mentally stimulating. If you want to improve your thinking and writing ability you should read books that make you focus. Reading a classic novel can change your view of the world and will make you think in more precise, elegant English. Don\u2019t be afraid to look up a word if you don\u2019t know it, and don\u2019t be afraid of dense passages. Take your time, re-read when necessary, and you\u2019ll soon grow accustomed to the author\u2019s style.Once you get used to reading challenging books, I think you\u2019ll find that you aren\u2019t tempted to go back to page-turners. The challenge of learning new ideas is far more exciting than any tacky suspense-thriller. 4. Early to Bed, Early to Rise \u2013 Nothing makes it harder to concentrate than sleep deprivation. You\u2019ll be most rejuvenated if you go to bed early and don\u2019t sleep more than 8 hours. If you stay up late and compensate by sleeping late, you\u2019ll wake up lethargic and have trouble focusing. In my experience the early morning hours are the most tranquil and productive. Waking up early gives you more productive hours and maximizes your mental acuity all day.If you have the opportunity, take 10-20 minute naps when you are hit with a wave of drowsiness. Anything longer will make you lethargic, but a short nap will refresh you. 5. Take Time to Reflect \u2013 Often our lives get so hectic that we become overwhelmed without even realizing it. It becomes difficult to concentrate because nagging thoughts keep interrupting. Spending some time alone in reflection gives you a chance organize your thoughts and prioritize your responsibilities. Afterwards, you\u2019ll have a better understanding of what\u2019s important and what isn\u2019t. The unimportant stuff won\u2019t bother you anymore and your mind will feel less encumbered. Conclusion \u2013 I hope you aren\u2019t disappointed that none of the techniques I\u2019ve proposed are revolutionary. But simple, unexciting answers are often the most valid. The challenge is having the will to adhere to them. If you succeed in following these 5 tips, you\u2019ll be rewarded with increased mental acuity and retention of knowledge. 5 Simple Ways to Increase Your Intelligence | PickTheBrain | Motivation and Self ImprovementYou can increase your intelligence: 5 ways to maximize your cognitive potential | Guest Blog, Scientific American Blog Network ",

            "answer_text": "I apologize for this answer as it may upset some readers here, however the answer is no, you cannot increase your IQ, which is based upon some possibly ill conceived standard test. First of all, there are many \u201cIQ tests\u201d in the world, which one would you choose as being the correct one? An IQ score is made up from a standard test. A standard test asks things like how well do you understand that something like 1 plus 1 equals 2, or even something like, if today is Thursday, and Saturday is two days after Thursday, what is two days before Sunday? With the correct answer here being Friday, and you pick that as your test answer, you have shown some form of abstract thinking when it comes to the days of the week\u2026 and you can likely (at least) learn things about how the seven days in a week actually relate to each other when considering the day names. When giving regards to an IQ \u201cscore\u201d, it really only indicates your possible potential for learning new things about common relationships between the days of the week (or other such mundane relationships). I hope that you can comprehend here in my explanation, why there is a possible gap between your learning possibilities, and your actual learning experiences. This is important when considering that you really cannot change your IQ score, because of the IQ score is coming from a standardized test. If you are stubborn and happen to disregard the notion that it really does matter that knowledge of which day of the week follows a given day of the week, and you refuse to learn that Friday follows Thursday and is two days before Sunday\u2026 then even though your IQ is rated \u201cvery high\u201d because you got the test answer correct, your real life ability could be likely rated \u201creally low\u201d. This would be because your IQ test answer does not match up with your real life knowledge. So, I also hope this long and round about way of counting days of the week kind of explains that you cannot change your \u201cstandard IQ test score\u201d, however, it\u2019s fairly easy to change your \u201clife knowledge score\u201d, and recognize that these two things are never going to be one and the same thing.

MemoryDecision MakingKeeping yourself relaxedPsychic powerLogical ThinkingVisualizationBrain StaminaConcentrationAbove are only few but there is many thing brain can do. Which power you want to increase? Assuming that you need to increase the concentration power here is one practice that you can do daily- Tratak Sit in a comfortable chair (or on bed in cross leg position). In front of you, 3 feet apart from your eyes & at the same level as that of your eyes, place an object like a candle, or something bright, in the light background. Light background is essential. Place your hand in the dhyaan mudra i.e.meditative pose ( see below image) close eyes for few minutes and relax your body like this-  Take your consciousness rapidly to different organs of your body (Read Yoga Nidra if want to know more). Upper body- Relax your tip of the head > relax your forehead > relax your eyebrows > relax the middle of your eyebrows > your eyes relax > relax your ears, your cheeks, nose, both nostrils, higher lip, lower lip, chin.Middle body- Now relax your shoulders, both arms till the tip of the fingers > Now relax your armpit > relax your shoulder blades > your buttocks > Now relax your chest, middle of the chest, navel, abdomen > Now relax your waist completely.Lower body- Now relax your hips, your thighs, your knees, your lower legs, ankles, heels, sole of the foot, tips of your toes.NOW, slowly open your eyes and watch the object. Keep watching (don\u2019t blink) until you feel that your eyes are straining or if tears are coming from your eyes. If yes, then close your eyes slowly.Close your eyes slowly and observe the image of that object in the middle of the eyebrows. (For more detail you can visit google)Various thoughts will appear, but its okay.If you feel that you can\u2019t see the image open the eyes and observe the object again. Keep watching as mentioned in the step #1.If thoughts are appearing then its okay, they come and go like fragrance of a flower. You are a flower and they\u2019re your fragrance. You just stay focus on the object- when eyes are opened, & the image of the object- when eyes are closed. Result- You may feel pleasant sensation in the middle of your eyebrow. If yes, then it means that your will power, confidence and concentration is building up. This is a very powerful method to improve self respect, confidence, concentration & turn your attention towards your soul. Start with 5 minutes of relaxation & 5 minutes of Tratak. Practice daily. After 4 days of practice increase the time interval of Tratak for 5 more minutes & then after 4 days increase the duration of Tratak 5 more again\u2026 You can increase the duration after every 4 days or you can keep it constant (say 20 minutes) daily; that\u2019s up to you. NOTE- while relaxing for the first time you may take more than 5 minutes, but its okay\u2026 With your daily practice you will start getting relaxed in 5 minutes. ",

            "answer_text": "an IQ is just a score on a specific test. It may or may not correlate with a score on a different test. The test can be useful in some circumstances, and should be performed by a trained professional, and ordered by a trained professional- such as a psychiatrist, a neurologist, or a provider with additional training. Few things will make you smarter- but getting adequate sleep, eating right, getting enough exercise, and managing your mental health and avoiding drugs is a good step. My parents were life long learners into their late 90s, and took courses in the local college (audit) or actually took for credit. My Aunt started law school upon retirement at 65 so she could fix her own parking tickets! My grandmother did a book group that picked a book for each meeting to read and discuss. My brother decided on a career change and went to architecture school at 40, and didn\u2019t actually finish until 5 years later, My wife started law school in her late 40s, and did fine. It may not make you smarter, but it will broaden your world view, and open up possibilities that certainly will make you act smarter. You may not become a Marine, but you can become all that you can be, if you become a life long learner- you can maximize your potential. I used to own a Porsche- late 50s C. It had a 2 liter motor and only 90 horsepower\u2014- but it was fun to drive and had a proud heritage on the race track. It wasn\u2019t an Indy car or even class dragster, but a really cool car. Your 99 is certainly acceptable\u2014 roughly half of people on the test did better, and half did worse. You should be able to learn whatever you want, and accomplish great things with work. There is nothing wrong with starting out as average. If your friend with the \u201chigher IQ doesn\u2019t keep learning\u201d and you do, you will soon know more that he does. which makes you better informed, more rounded, and in my view smarter. If you really want to test higher on an IQ test\u2014- simply find out what test you are going to take\u2014- then go on line or down to your local university bookstore and purchase the testing material or guidebook\u2014- you might have to look a bit, but if you have the name of the test you will find it. With some practice, and the answers to the questions, you should be able to score a 200. I wouldn\u2019t waste my money as you will not be smarter, but some people might think you are. I think you should attempt to broaden your horizons - be interested in the world, read a lot, and get involved in politics- our world needs a lot of help from all of us. If your friend doesn\u2019t appreciate you, then he/she might not be as smart as they think. abc ",

            "answer_text": "A persons iQ is nothing to do with a persons smartness Instead it\u2019s a level of true intelligence. True intelligence is the capacity to achieve independently without using previously witnessed information from memory (of any kind). The mass majority of humanity only have a simple iQ and are stated to never throughout their lives show true intelligence instead functioning with a copying intelligence process. The only people discovered by psychology to ever show true intelligence always have mental illness or disorders generally passed down, especially common when observed in the disability Autism. Autism and similar mental illnesses are formed due to a person being born with an overdeveloped brain giving positive superiority in many areas but a number will also be a negative nightmare. The higher a person\u2019s iQ the higher true intelligence will be but also the risk of suicide as perfection becomes seen even more vital. The copying intelligence has still played a vital role in developing societies as things such as language. Speech wouldn\u2019t have been formed without everyone being able to learn speech word from word from each other. iQ is quite complex as psychology states it (true intelligence) very different to how the public think it is (just a scale of how smart to stupid a person is). Humanity thinks it\u2019s so much smarter than nature yet psychology states the mass majority (everyone considered normal) have only the intelligence level equal to the animals but no higher. Only a very small percentage are superior due to overdevelopment of the brain through pregnancy. They now think autism goes deeper than is possible to detect/diagnose as all key discoveries were stated made by them never normal people. Other mental conditions may provide superiority as well. ",

Memory activities Reasoning and language are both used as intelligence measures, meaning that memory activities can continue to develop intelligence. jigsaw puzzlescrossword puzzlesconcentration card game, or card matchingsudoku 2. Executive control activities Research suggests that executive function is strongly tied to fluid reasoning, one aspect of human intelligence. Activities that involve executive control training include: ScrabblePictionaryred light, green lightbrainteasers3. Relational skills Relational Frame Theory relates to the development of human cognition and language through relational associations. Research from 2011 has shown that using Relational Frame Theory as an intervention can significantly improve IQ scores in children. A more recent study using this intervention also found improvements in IQ, verbal reasoning, and numeric reasoning. Activities that involve relational training include: language learning books (\u201cthis is a\u2026\u201d and \u201cthat is a\u2026\u201d)object comparisons (full cup versus empty cup)amount comparisons (penny versus dime)4. Musical instruments You don\u2019t have to become the next famous musician to benefit from learning a musical instrument. One study found that musicians have a better working memory than non-musicians. Given the important role memory plays in intelligence, it may benefit your IQ to finally pick up that musical instrument you\u2019ve always wanted to learn.  5. Frequent reading There\u2019s no denying how beneficial books are in human cognitive development. In fact, the benefits of development are even more pronounced when books become part of parental bonding activities. In one recent study, researchers discovered that when parents read aloud to their children, the child had greater language and cognitive development skills.  All the Best. Work Hard and also if you are good in simple maths you are already smart. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not convinced you can raise your IQ even if you raise your actual score. An IQ test is, in my opinion, nothing more than a medium rough assessment of a person\u2019s intellectual potential. We do not even have a good definition of intelligence so we cannot really say we know what we are actually measuring. The closest we can come to a definition is to say that intelligence is defined by your score on a standardized test, but such a definition is what is known in logic as a tautology, a circular definition. The classic example of this is saying that \u201cno true Scotsman drinks anything but single malt whisky. McDougal drinks blended whisky therefore he is no true Scotsman.\u201d Here we say that what shows intelligence? Answer: a high score on an intelligence test. How do we know that the test measures intelligence? Only smart people do well on IQ tests. How do we know they are smart? They do well on IQ tests. Having said this, it is certainly possible to increase your score on IQ tests. If you do such things as ensuring good test conditions (adequate lighting, comfortable chairs, no distractions), practice taking the exams, eating well, ensuring you are well hydrated and getting lots of rest the night before,you may test better, but this does not establish that your actual intellectual potential has increased. Practice, for example, may increase your speed through familiarity alone and IQ tests are timed so more speed will increase your score somewhat, but not a lot. Think of it like this. If you lack the raw talent for a sport, say basketball, you may gain some proficiency from training and practice that might lead someone who did not know that you have never practiced to credit you with more raw talent than you actually possess, but you will not have increased you fund of talent, yo will only have.made the most of what you have. A person with lots of raw talent will get much farther with exactly the same amount of training and practice. There is no evidence that I am aware of that show great increases in IQ scores from any type of training or practice though there may be some quite modest improvement. Anyone who takes the test multiple times will show both increases and decreases in scores among the tests taken, but this is probably foe to random variations in test conditions and the condition of the subject.

            "answer_text": "With few life hacks, you may be able to boost your IQ by one standard deviation. Challenge your brain by breaking your routines, reading, solving puzzles, and seeking new experiences to increase your IQ. Supplement your efforts by getting plenty of protein, vitamin B, and rest, all of which enhance your brain's ability to remain alert. The right diet and lifestyle can do wonders. Are you ready? Part1 Changing Your Routine 1Do everyday things differently. Challenge your brain to form new connections and pathways by doing the things you normally do on autopilot differently. Brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand. Walk around as if you\u2019re going backwards through time. Talk to yourself in a different language. Whatever you can do to mix it up, do it!Doing this forms new pathways and connections in your brain. Quite often we take for granted how easy life is, especially once we get the basics down. When you mix it up, your brain has to relearn the skill, challenging it all the more.2Meditate. Much research has shown that not only is meditating good for stress levels and mood, but it\u2019s also good for brain functioning.[1] It has been shown to improve blood flow to the brain, patience, concentration, and memory. And it's totally relaxing, too.Try 30 minutes each day. You may split this into 10 or 15 minute blocks 2-3 times a day. It is preferable to do when you wake up, after you exercise, and at night directly before you go to bed.3Consider taking supplements. A much safer alternative to taking \"smart\" drugs is taking natural supplements. Just make sure you're taking the right amount by talking to your doctor first. All of the ones below come backed by scientific research:Caffeine[2]Creatine[3]Ginkgo Biloba[4]Omega-3 fatty acids[5]4Start doing regular aerobic exercise. The studies of Win Wenger show that breath correlates to attention span. Try underwater swimming or running. If not, any aerobic exercise should do. Exercise twice a day for 45 minutes when you wake up and before you go to bed. You should preferably couple this with meditation after you exercise.This is good for your waistline, too, and fitness, in turn, can improve your mood. The more endorphins you release in your exercise sessions, the more active your brain is and the better you'll feel.5Sleep when your brain actually wants it. Some people are in their prime thinking zone at 9 in the morning. Some at 9 at night. Even others at 3 AM or whenever they\u2019ve finished their third cup of coffee. Since everyone is different, sleep when your brain wants it. Do you do your best work at night? Then sleep late. You\u2019re not being lazy, you\u2019re being wise!Aim to get a solid 7-9 hours of sleep a night, too. When you're tired, your brain can't function at 100%. It cuts down what it thinks it can, sort of putting you in hibernation mode, and only does what it absolutely has to to keep you alive and breathing. Consistent inadequate sleep also prevents your brain from developing to its full potential, and can lead to various mental and physical illnesses down the line.Part2 Practicing Your Skills 1Read more. Genetics aside, education is a big factor contributing to your IQ. Try reading up on the sciences, such as mathematics and physics. Sciences increase your understanding of the world, which in turn improves comprehension, vocabulary, spatial and mathematical abilities, and logic.You can try MIT OpenCourseware, which offers notes, syllabuses, and tests from over 1800 official MIT courses. You can also go for Coursera, KhanAcademy, or even YouTube.2Do word puzzles and problem-solving games. To stave off dementia and to keep your brain churning away at high speeds, make sure to do puzzles and games regularly \u2013 which means (in this day and age) more time on the Internet and your phone! Download apps like Lumosity[6], What Saying, Quiz Up, and other games that get your brain juices flowing. Put down the Candy Crush and spend some time instead improving your IQ!The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Stanford-Binet do not measure intelligence in a single, simple form. Rather, they have a set of problems which measure your ability to process things quickly, understand what you are told, and recognize sequences. [7]3Take the tests over and over. Just like that chemistry test you had to take four times in high school to pass, IQ tests aren\u2019t all that different. They have the same basic structure and types of questions over and over. Therefore, the more you take it, the better you\u2019ll do.The tests you can take for free online aren't like the actual tests you might take through a career center or a psychiatrist. If you want your real IQ, you'll have to take the real thing. There is generally a fee, so always try your hardest.4Get new experiences. When you do the same thing day in and day out, the brain sort of goes on autopilot. It stops taking in stimuli, comfortable in its surroundings. When you have new experiences though, the brain wakes up and takes it all in, revving up for a change. So instead of popping in that DVD tonight, find a museum, a show, or a new place to check out to keep your mental clock ticking wildly.Even just visiting a new place or trying a new food is a good experience. You're widening your knowledge, making yourself better informed for future decisions. However, the more different they are, the better. Consider it an excuse for an exotic vacation!5Teach yourself something new. Actively learning new things helps your brain learn and may help you make connections that before were not possible. Learning a new skill such as how to play chess or lacrosse, how to juggle, or anything you've never done before for that matter \u2013 may help your brain in ways you never even dreamed of.[8]Learning another language is a great way to get the brain working on new pathways. Not only does it fire up centers in your brain that aren't being used, but it's real-world applicable and impressive to boot.Part3 Changing Your Diet 1Eat plenty of protein for breakfast. Protein has the ability to increase your brain\u2019s production of neurotransmitters, and increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels in turn \u2013 all of which increases your alertness and problem-solving skills.This is especially important for breakfast to get you ready and raring to go for the day. Sugar for breakfast just leads to a crash in a couple of hours, slowing you down, and leaving you even hungrier than before.2Snack on dark chocolate.[9] Dark chocolate is full of antioxidants and loaded with flavonols. It\u2019s also high in magnesium, vitamins A, B1, B2, D, and E.3 It's a powerhouse of antioxidants that helps fight off free radicals. This makes sure our bodies stay healthy and strong.Not too much though, of course. Anywhere between 1 and 5 ounces a day is good.3Get more vitamin B. This little nutrient increases blood flow to the brain.[10] You can find vitamin B in green, leafy vegetables, whole wheat, meat, eggs, and cheese. Just be sure that you don't get too much either! Talk to your doctor about the appropriate amount for you.Folic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, and niacin are all part of the structure of vitamin B. When you get vitamin B, you get a powerhouse of goodies all in one.4Avoid processed and junk foods. Many studies have shown that a healthy diet is linked to a higher IQ, especially in children. To keep your brain firing on all pistons, stay away from junk food like cookies and chips and processed food \u2013 do the cooking at home to help your brain and your budget.[11]Vegetarians have higher IQs on the whole, by about 5 points for both sexes.[12] To get the extra boost, make \"Meatless Monday\" a regular thing throughout the week.5Consider fasting intermittently. IF, or intermittent fasting, has been shown to lead to increased brain power and higher level functioning. [13] IF is where you don\u2019t eat for 16 hours, and eat plenty for 8. It may or may not mean caloric restriction, depending on how you do it.You can also use this technique to manage your weight. Many fast intermittently and see great results in terms of weight loss. Just make sure you're doing it safely \u2013 fasting isn't for everyone (the elderly, expecting mothers, young children, etc.).hope you guys liked thoes ways please upvote and follow me and also comment more stuff i know there's more but just takes along time to write but i will write more and please request answers from me please.",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, the most important thing is to find something that interests you and read about it. I, myself, wouldn\u2019t read about carpentry because I\u2019m terrible at it, and doing or learning about something you\u2019re terrible can affect your self-esteem (it might also make you better at something you\u2019re terrible at). If something fascinates you, start reading about it and if you enjoy reading about it you\u2019ll want to read more. As you read you\u2019ll likely find more subjects that peek your interest, so you can start reading about them too. After a while you might have enough ideas and material tucked away in your head to write a book! As you read you can start making connections between the knowledge you\u2019ve accumulated from various fields. Working on those connections can help you create unique perspectives or theories that have real value in the world. This is how Elon Musk came up with some of his most valuable contributions. I started out reading about subjects that not only interested me, but that promised to help me understand life, why I act and feel a particular way in different situations. I wanted to understand what the underlying master-code was to human motivations and dysfunctions. Having suffered from depression for much of my life I determined that I was not willing to spend my twilight years feeling anxious and sad, so my goal has always been to find the way to inner peace. I\u2019ve been working on the draft of my first book for the past two years. It draws together many of the things I\u2019ve learned in a way that I think will help other people, but there\u2019s a whole lot more I want to say, so other books are in the works. If you think these ideas sound good but you don\u2019t have the motivation to follow up on them, find someone who is happy to help you get over the procrastination phase. Make yourself accountable to them, kinda like a workout partner who will push you to get that 10th repetition lifting the dumbbells. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "My qualifications: for example: I flunked out of high-school, but when I took the SATs, I scored high above 99 percentile.  When I took the GED, I got the highest scores the administrator had ever seen.  When I took college entrance exams, they let me skip first-year requirements.  As a writing tutor at UC Berkeley, I developed an essay-writing-and-comprehsion technique that enables virtually anyone to get \u201cA\u201ds on in-class essays.  In my \u201calternative\u201d children\u2019s programs, I pioneered \u201chands on\u201d learning in the early 1980s - what I call \u201cinterest-based learning,\u201d to promote what I call \u201ccomprehension-developement\u201d - using direct learning in simple material relationships to help children develop confidence in their own perceptions.  This is generally remedial work, counteracting what goes on in most schools, where adult impatience or conformist notions train children to perceive a fuzzy, compromising tension as the be-all and end-all of knowing.  I know what intelligence is, and I know how to improve it - and I assume the difference would register on IQ tests.  My advice is in two simple points. 1.)  Learn to trust your own grasp of plain logic or reason.Intelligence is muddled by a lifetime of emotional pressues to see things in a prescribed way.  Learn to \u201cbelieve in\u201d plain logic, no matter how unusual the results may be.  You don\u2019t have to be quick; take your time and be simple.  I have never been quick with basic math, but when elaborate problems are presented to large groups, to see who can solve them first, I almost always win - by taking my time - one part of the problem at a time - clearly - one simple step at a time. I disagree with those who say life\u2019s topics are complex.  No, they\u2019re all simple.  Sure there\u2019s a special kind of \u201cgenius\u201d with amazing memory or ability to multiply large numers instantly, but the real genius is not the person who can manage complexities; he\u2019s the one who sees the simplicity at the root of apparent complexity - the \u201cgenie\u201d of the thing - in a habit of letting nothing deter him from a comfortable grasp of the obvious.  For example: \u201cthe complexities of the Middle East conflict\u201d have often been cited, along with rocket-science, as beyond ordinary grasp.  Yet, a quick overview shows a plain and basic fact: an expressly \u201cJewish\u201d state is being forced ever deeper into a primarily Arab, Muslim, and Christian region.  It does not take a rocket scientist to see that violent racism does not occur in plainer form than that - and that sort of thing would naturally have grave regional consequences - endlessly complex, but all organized in relation to the initial ethnic-cleansing, like the branches and leaves of a simple tree.  It\u2019s a good example also because we\u2019re all under a lot of political and social pressure to not see that simple problem at the very root.  It\u2019s \u201chard to believe\u201d something so obvious could pass so unnoticed, but the highly intelligent person commonly overrides that notion.  Intelligence must be independent - tuned only to the basics, and always free to change if new data suggests new conclusions or theories.  The intelligent person will often \u201cdisagree\u201d with mainstream notions, but will minimize conflict with them. Consistent with all that, stop getting upset when logic leads to conclusions you don\u2019t like.  Make a quest to overcome those sub-rational drives.  Learn to follow reason freely, wherever it leads, and also learn to entertain new apparent conclusions, without getting dogmatic about them.  See the logic of the thing, rather than trying to form a conclusion.  Stick light-heartedly with apparent conclusions until better logic calls for modification.  All reason, throughout the universe, is logically interconnected: emotionally overriding logic, in order to cling to even just one pet notion, sends its tensions everywhere and diminishes free perception everywhere. Get used to seeing logic and comprehension in that easygoing, light-hearted way - no emotional agenda - simple service to reason. 2.) Exercise your discernment.Some music and movies, for example, are worthy of full attention from the most discerning minds.  Many of the best do not require any special refinement, but are quite accessible, and in many the special quality is flaming obvious, if given anyone\u2019s full attention - and will heavily reward it when it\u2019s provided.  But I mean full attention - not the usual thing.  So start with what you like, but now, just for fun, as part of this \u201cexercising,\u201d start looking for editing and camera-changes in movies, and start recognizing the movies that truly call for full attention.  Not all do, by any means; most modern mainstream movies do not, but put more active attention into noticing the difference, preferably reflecting objective values, not just personal preference.  So appreciate the fight-scenes that use special effects or movie-making tricks, for example, but also notice the difference when great fights show really great martial-arts, with little dependency on special-effects exaggerations. The point is to make a point of looking closer, discerning pro-actively.  Some very popular movies don\u2019t reward that at all, so see the difference for yourself.  The same principle applies to music; listen with full attention; notice what you did not notice before.  Some works reward that way more than others - and seeing the difference is part of intelligence.  The effort is well worth it, in terms of sheer fun or \u201cappreciation of life,\u201d and exercising discernment increases intelligence in general. On perhaps a more personal note, well, we all have our favorite movies, but I just have to say I have never seen any that reward repeat viewings better than the first three Jason Bourne movies; in fact, I haven\u2019t stopped being amazed at how much there is to discern in these movies - how much becomes apparent with repeat viewings - how much effort and seemingly awesome luck went into them.  I think my discernment has been considerably improved by seeing what I had missed before.  And - as is usually true in the smart things - a great deal of it is utterly obvious, yet is still commonly underappreciated.  In this case, it\u2019s the locations (and the great ways they\u2019re used), car-chases, and most of the martial arts - and everything in between.  Even the weapons are unusually cool, yet sensible.  There certainly are some flaws, but seeing the difference does not detract. Another answer to this question suggested getting more actively curious in general, and that\u2019s right.  Pro-actively exploring what\u2019s going on often produces fun results.  In fact, intelligence and fun - or appreciating life - are closely related. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way is to stop thinking about how smart you are or aren't and then to embrace challenges.  There's been a lot of research on this, and Carol Dweck is one of the earliest and most published researchers in the field.  She has a very accessible book that deals with this along with the subject of motivation: Self-theories: Their Role in Motivation, Personality, and Development (Essays in Social Psychology): 9781841690247: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com The basic idea is that people tend to have one of two models of learning (it's probably more of a spectrum from one extreme to the other).  Those with a \"fixed\" model or \"mindset\" think that intelligence is fixed.  You can't improve it.  Such people tend to give up quickly when they can't solve a problem or learn something new.  They simply believe that they aren't smart enough in the particular learning context.  Fortunately for you, your question indicates that you're not a member of this group. Those with a \"growth\" model or mindset think that intelligence can be improved with practice and perseverance.  The research show that they are correct.  Dweck's research has shown that students with growth models of learning persevere longer on tasks, enjoy challenges, don't get upset when they can't figure something out right away or even for long periods of time and continuously get better at learning. I've had many students who illustrate this.  One such student simply never gave up on trying to solve even very difficult problems in physics, and he seldom wanted more than a small hint from me with even the most difficult problems.  He eventually figured out almost every challenging problem in introductory and advanced physics.  His fellow students all thought he was a genius.  However, while he often functions at genius level, once I really got to understand his approach to learning it was clear to me that he wasn't as intrinsically bright as many other students I've taught who didn't achieve as much. In retrospect I've realized that I had a growth model in learning science and math and a fixed model in the humanities.  Once I understood this, I changed my model concerning the humanities and started making much better progress in writing and in learning and enjoying history. Seek out mental challenges, try different approach to dealing with them when your first efforts don't work, persevere and enjoy the ride.  Your intelligence will grow.  You might not see much change at first, but since the effects are cumulative, in the long run you will see big changes. ",

            "answer_text": "I have an advanced degree in Psychology and I\u2019ve been interested in how the mind works for decades. As far as I can determine, there is no way to increase I.Q. I.Q. is a number that represents the results of testing something that has no definition. In a way, it is like testing dark matter. What would you be testing? The gravitational effects on a galaxy? Would that be dark matter? No. I.Q. is much the same. Problem solving? Memory? Measuring something like I.Q. is like trying to sew together a jellyfish. Measure the I.Q. of an \u201cidiot savant\u201d and you get such low numbers you don\u2019t know if he/she is even human, yet they can remember events going back thousands of years, calculate faster than a computer, play a piano without taking lessons, and on and on. The issue really isn\u2019t the level of Intelligence Quotient, it is how well you utilize it. Believe me, there are a lot of people out there with high I.Q.s in their 40s who are still living in their mom\u2019s basement. I shop at a supermarket that hires retarded kids as baggers and cleaners. Those kids work hard, try to please, and seem to be the happiest people in the store - and the most loving. You can see all that in their faces. They don\u2019t count the money they make, they would probably be baggers for free just to enjoy the experience of working, being with people, and being useful. THAT is how to use intelligence. ",

If a goal is to be intelligent, cogent, articulate, and therefore more likely successful, there\u2019s only two things you should do: Read, read, and read some more. Read about everything. The more you read, the more you\u2019ll want to read. Read only about what you\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019re bored, find a better author. Or topic. Just read.Discuss what you read, make sure people challenge you, make sure you have to explain yourself to those who don\u2019t understand. Discuss, discuss, discuss.When you are smart and articulate; you will be very successful no matter what you do, no matter what your IQ is (I do not have a college degree, no idea what my IQ is, and I cannot do any math as I never moved beyond 7th grade pre-algebra. I assure you that I am not suffering). When you are smart, articulate and charismatic, you\u2019ll be rich whether you want to be or not. (you can define \u201crich\u201d for yourself) Charisma is the ultimate quality of brilliance. Because people will like you and they will want to listen to you. IQ doesn\u2019t mean shit with any of this. IQ is a fools errand. I know sales people.. sales people with an IQ that could only be a single digit, and the money they make is multiples of people I know with ivy league computer science grad degrees. And they work way less, vacation way more, don\u2019t have engineering deadlines that keeps them at the office and away from family. Only way to get smart and charismatic is to read like a mad man and engage people when you\u2019re not reading. More interesting is that, by reading and challenging yourself, you can actually thicken the cerebral cortex - meaning that by pushing yourself, your brain will physically respond, which, perhaps, might be a method to perform better with the discredited and archaic IQ test: Nurturing brain plasticity: impact of environmental enrichment ",

            "answer_text": "Effective way: proven! It has been known for some time that our brain is not static but neuroplastic, making new connections all the time, but this would have an effect on the longer term. But since you're talking about IQ, and not necessarily fluid intelligence, so I suggest you want to have better scores, which is possible. I don't know if it can be done with subtests such as short-term memory, processing speed, but certainly linguistic and pattern recognition. How to improve pattern recognition? This is my observation: online IQ tests are far from a concrete measure of your actual cognitive skills. But there are online tests, which provide a concrete objective measurement based on their online sample size (n). This is extremely important to look up for practicing. Because despite they do not give a concrete realistic measurement of your actual mental power, their measuring method is stable, so a higher result is actually a higher result based on their scaling method and not a commercially given result like many tests online. So the point is that absolutely no commercial measurement method must be used, but an objective one based on THEIR sample, representative of reality or not, so that improvement is actually a geometrically analyzed improvement and not a randomly chosen commercial number. This is important because you want to measure progress, despite not improving your G. Okay now that it is clear, now you should never look up answers from the puzzles again, even after taking the test, just don\u2019t do it, never. This is my fact that I observed myself if you take the test once and then immediately again but in half the time without looking up the answers (be super objective and honest with yourself) you will score better on IQ tests with reliable MEASUREMENT METHODS, NOT RESULTS. Really this I have proven myself several times, my explanation is: if you do it first from a lazy state of mind, then you are less effective at recognizing patterns, it's like having to do a warm-up for sports matches, that's why it's going to be the second time better up to 14 points, even if you still didn\u2019t know the answers and it is the same you did 5 minutes earlier. But it is just because you are sharper the second time, and expect more complexity. So do this. But NEVER look up the answers. Also before the actual test the day, do a few tests to get into that state of mind. Test this and tell me if it worked: 2x an objective measurement method, 2nd time in half the time you did before. Did it increase the second time? Manage your expectations: if you have never taken an IQ test, you have lower expectations of the patterns that occur, which will have a negative effect on your time management and on your attitude towards solving the puzzles. Realize that most puzzles go from less complex to more complex, expect this! So for the less complex use intuitive linear reasoning, until it no longer works this way. Then put in what I call: the paranoid mindset: expect more complex patterns, think not only horizontally, but also vertically and also diagonally! Expect all of these. In addition, also expect that within the figures, multiple patterns can occur, up to 3 that are non-linear independent of each other, for example, one phenomenon can go up, the other down, while they slide to the right/left. The other can change color in the next block. Because realize, they do not only appeal to your thinking ability. If you knew the variables you probably had the ability to solve it, most people would have been technical \u2018geniuses\u2019, but the test also appeals to critical thinking: sharply concentrated, investigative ability. But if you search with this intention, you will find them better. But, do not apply this method to the intuitive or easy puzzles: time management. All in all, solve as many puzzles as possible, but never look for the answer: be honest with yourself and measure your improvements, which you do not have to share with anyone, it is for yourself. Important to say: this does not increase your natural critical thinking ability or reasoning ability, pattern recognition ability: it simply puts you in a state of mind for being open to the possibilities that may arise, thereby also making you better at solving the pattern puzzles.

            "answer_text": "I would say it depends of what you\u2019re looking to accomplish when taking a Brain Booster (Nootropic). Nothing is going to make you more intelligent, but you can find supplements to help you boost memory, focus, clarity and learning. I have always gone down the natural path first, so when I started experiencing some brain fog, due to lack of sleep and stress, I tried Gingko Biloba, Bacopa Monnieri and DMAE. It worked well, but after finding a more synergistic blend I saw a marked improvement. Here\u2019s a list of ingredients you should look for: GINGKO BILOBA \u2013 has been a known memory enhancer forever, Gingko helps with sharper, faster memory recall. BACOPA MONNIERI \u2013 Helps greatly with neuron transmission and has been known to improve cognition, reduce anxiety and improve memory formation. PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE \u2013 Also known as alpha GPC, helps cells move and better utilize fats. It\u2019s important for brain health, as fats make up almost 70% of the brain\u2019s structure. Phosphatidylserine is vital for cell membranes, where it helps regulate bio-activities tied to memory and attention. DMAE - assists with the production of acetylcholine, the most widely spread neurotransmitter in the brain. RHODIOLA ROSEA - supports dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine \u2013 neurotransmitters that serve a variety of important brain functions, such as learning and memory. L-THEANINE \u2013 is an amino acid naturally occurring in green tea leaves. It is believed to have excellent nootropic properties, such as improving memory, focus and the ability to learn. B12 - A deficiency here can negatively impact cognitive function. Make sure what ever nootropic you look at has a healthy dose of B12 Two other good ingredients are L-Tyrosine, which can be taken separately. It helps with memory recall\u2026 especially on mornings with little sleep the night before. Also, Choline can help with memory and other cognitive functions. Low acetylcholine levels are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. Here is the latest product I\u2019ve been taking: It\u2019s absolutely worth $19 - It\u2019s on Amazon too! There are many options out there, but this is the one that has been working for me. Hope this helps!  ",

            "answer_text": "Even though IQ can change over time, most tests give you the same answer to a very substantial extent, even over a period of several years. The older you are, the more stable your test score will be. The most volatility in IQ scores is in childhood, mostly in adolescence. Most studies show that lack of adequate sleep and forced changes to the circadian rhythm of the body have a direct adverse effect on the IQ of a person. Have a fixed and healthy daily routine. (Aim to get a solid 7 hours of sleep in a day. When you're tired, your brain can't function at 100%. Furthermore, since everyone's brain is in its prime thinking zone at different times in a day, don't consider yourself dumb to be up late working and sleeping during the day. It completely depends on how you shape your circadian rhythm.)Meditate. ( It has been shown to improve blood flow to the brain, patience, concentration, and memory. And it's totally relaxing, too. About 15 minutes each day is enough)Natural supplements to \u201csmart\u201d drugs such as:CaffeineCreatineGinkgo BilobaOmega-3 fatty acidsHave been backed by research to have had a positive effect on the functioning of the brain. 4. Manage your diet well. Eat plenty of protein. (Protein has the ability to increase your brain\u2019s production of neurotransmitters, and increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels in turn \u2013 all of which increases your alertness and problem-solving skills.)Snack on Dark Chocolates. (Dark chocolate is full of antioxidants and loaded with flavonols. It\u2019s also high in magnesium, vitamins A, B1, B2, D, and E.3 It's a powerhouse of antioxidants that helps fight off free radicals. This makes sure our bodies stay healthy and strong)Get more vitamin B. (This little nutrient increases blood flow to the brain)Avoid processed foods as much as you can. (Fun fact: Vegetarians have higher IQs on the whole, by about 5 points for both sexes.To get the extra boost, make \"Meatless Monday\" a regular thing throughout the week.)Consider fasting intermittently (IF, or intermittent fasting, has been shown to lead to increased brain power and higher level functioning. IF is where you don\u2019t eat for 16 hours, and eat plenty for 8)And needless to say, practice your skills. Read more. Do challenging puzzles and problem solving games. And try teaching yourself something new often. ",

I\u2019d give up this interest in improving your IQ and focus on improving YOURSELF. When I was in the Navy I had alot of time on my hands and spent time thinking about myself and my life. What parts am I not happy with? What kind of person do I want to be? I realized I did many things to make OTHER people happy, not myself. I wanted to accomplish something, I didn\u2019t know what it was but I wanted to do well at something. I spent too much time worrying about what others thought of me and not what I thought of me. You are the best person to know what you are good at and what not. Do you want to change some of those things? Do you want to appear to be more intelligent? I\u2019d say playing chess might accomplish that, if you are willing to spend the time to actually be good at it. I\u2019m terrible at it, myself. I\u2019d like to be good at it but I imagine my brain is not built for the game. Are you as physically fit as you would like to be? Do you care? Are you concerned with your fellow man? If so, how do you show it? Volunteer work? Be nice to others in public? Donate to charities? To be a better person or, be a person you like better is a more worthy goal, in my opinion, that trying to change a number. ",

            "answer_text": "In real terms, IQ scores aren\u2019t very important. IQ tests can be fooled like any other test. They rely on set patterns and question types, by practicing these questions, you\u2019ll be become better at answering them, thus giving you a higher IQ score. In the grand scheme of things I think IQ scores are very misleading. I\u2019ve achieved scores of 135+ before. I\u2019d consider myself to be a little more intelligent average, but nowhere near as intelligent as a score of 135 suggests. I just got good at taking IQ and aptitude tests. If you want to increase your intelligence, I\u2019d focus on improving your memory and honing your thinking processes and approaches. Why memory? There is strong evidence (Tourva et al.), 2016) to suggest that working memory have an enormous influence on the development of a person's fluid intelligence (general intelligence). A high IQ score tends to correlate with a strong working memory. Intelligent people can be poor thinkers and it's theorised that intelligence is strongly related to how many things you can hold in your working memory at once (Bailey H, 2008), not necessarily the processes or mental approaches that those people use. There are a huge number of resources online for improving memory, but from a practical and instantly usable viewpoint, Jonathan Levi\u2019s SuperLearner course and work Anthony Metivier\u2019s magnetic memory methods are your best option. Thinking itself if a made up of a combination of skills and can be improved by following certain processes or thinking exercises. I\u2019d advised looking into lateral / parallel thinking methods as lateral thinkers use information in a different or provocative way and challenge assumptions or accepted concepts. Lateral and parallel thinking that enable such leaps and to identify patterns and causes that no one else can. Additionally a good grasp of situation analysis and strategy will help you to think a step ahead of your peers. Combined with keen observation skills; you'll be able to examine an environment and quickly gather all the relevant information, evidence and opinions. Once you have this information, you can organise it and develop successful and highly relevant strategies. ",

            "answer_text": "Intelligence is trainable about in the same amount that VO2-Max is. If you haven\u2019t been intellectually working out much at all in the recent years, you will get noticeable improvement over a 2 month period. You can improve some over the next few months, but then after that gains will be minimal. For the WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales), some subtests are education-dependent, on the premise that intellect determines the capacity for education and rate of learning. So increasing your math skills, vocabulary, and general knowledge can help an IQ score on the WAIS. If you think your education level is nowhere near your intellectual potential, addressing this could improve your IQ score on the WAIS-IV, particularly on the verbal IQ side. Motivation differences alone can boost your IQ score by around 5 points. If your last test session was neutral motivation (not really aware you were being tested), assuming you don\u2019t have test anxiety issues, coming a new test session aware and fully motivated to do well in it can boost your score a bit. Score boost can be even bigger if you had a anti-motivation on the last test session (kids who don\u2019t care and make pictures out of their filled-in answer sheet bubbles during standardized testing are non-motivated) If you are able to benefit from all three of the above, you could get a 10\u201315 point boost in your IQ result. If you cannot benefit from any above the three (you are in an intellectual occupation, were very motivated the last time you took an IQ test, and you are already well educated) then your IQ will not change much at all, maybe +/- 2. If you want to boost your IQ score and don\u2019t care about its accuracy at all you can buy and practice with an actual Wechsler test kit. There\u2019s plenty of them on eBay: wechsler intelligence scale | eBay . A full WISC-IV or WAIS-III kit will run you $400\u2013600, and are the previous versions, so you won\u2019t get the full benefit of \u2018having all the answers to the test\u2019 that an actual psychologist has to cheat their way into high IQ societies (the Glia family of societies do look out for this though). Frequent re-testing with the same IQ test can also cause score inflation because you\u2019ll remember the items you had before. ",

Read autobigraphies from the Americans who dropped bombs on Japan and the Japanese who survived it. Read popular science books about wormholes, and pseudo-science books about crystals. Read books from Darwin and Dawkins, and books from creationists and zealots. Read Jurassic Park and Game of Thrones, and The Iliad and Beowulf. Read Murakami, Lovecraft, Chaucer, and Hugo.  Learn to solve a rubik's cube in under a minute. Solve a hard sudoku puzzle every day. Play chess against the computer or a competent friend. Solve crossword puzzles, play scrabble, form palindromes and anagagrams. Learn to program. There are a wide variety of programming languages out there, ranging from very simple to brain-exploding. I suggest 'Python'. It is pretty simple but quite powerful. Choose a new field to study. If you are bad at mathematics, change that. Choose between a 'hard' science like physics or chemistry, and 'softer' ones like psychology or sociology. Whatever takes your fancy. Learn a new language. Bilingual people have been shown to have higher intellect on average. Read the news every day and dig deeper. What are the root causes for the problems in the world. What are both sides to the stories? Read right wing and left wing blogs. Who is right? Learn the facts and make up YOUR OWN mind. Do IQ tests. Personally I think boiling intelligence down to a single number is nonsense, but doing practice tests will stretch your intelligence and has the added benefit of making you better at IQ tests. Learn a musical instrument. Increasing digit dexterity increases intelligence. Do sports. Seriously. A healthy body is important for a healthy mind.  Final word. I like to think about this: All areas of study/entertainment are very exciting. Perhaps you are a 'jock' who laughs at nerds playing dungeons and dragons. Perhaps you are a rugged guy who thinks the fashion industry is BS, or a girl who thinks shooty shooty computer games are a waste of time. But if you spent any time actually learning about those mysterious 'other' endeavors, you would grow to appreciate, perhaps even enjoy, them. It's so easy to say 'not my thing' when we have never even looked into them.  So go wild, step out of your comfort zone. You will learn so much. ",

If you search this you will find many other answers about increasing your Max.  Because of this, I'll go over some things that are lowering your iq, keeping you from your potential.   Sleep Wanted for: not enough of it, poor quality, and poor waking time.  Fix: try to find your body's \"Highs\" and lows for when you wake up; trial and error.  For the average person, it's every 90 minutes there's a good time to wake up.   Get enough.   Don't sleep less than 6 hours.  Sleep apnea will tell your body you don't need sleep when you do, lowering your cognitive activity. Sugar Wanted for: over consumption. Fix: well, watch what you eat!  Don't intake too much sugar, as it lowers cognitive activity.  Stress Wanted for: existing?  Fix: being stressed out lowers your cognitive activity.  Learn to meditate and just generally destress yourself.  Obesity (spelling?) Wanted for: being it, I guess? Fix: lose weight.  Eat a proper diet, physical activity.  Multitasking Wanted for: doing it Fix: your brain is not made to multitask.  It can overload your brain, stalling it's activity.   Besides, studies have shown you get more stuff done when you do them one t a time.  (I should probably take my own advice here) Smoking Wanted for: doing it, or being around people who do it Fix: smoking, or inhaling second hand smoke, increases the carbon monoxide levels In your body.  This affects how much oxygen is sent to your organs, such as your brain.  Don't smoke, don't be around people who do/don't let people smoke around you. Excessive travel Wanted for: messing up your internal clock (jet lag) Fix:  this will mess up your circadian rhyme, and you will feel the affects for up to a month.   your body likes consistently, especially with sleep.

            "answer_text": "You need to be one in the first place. A Genius is born not made, it\u2019s in your DNA so to speak. There are certain traits you MUST have naturally in order to think/operate as a Genius. There are fundamental differences in the hemispheric functions within the brain of any individual. The left hemisphere contains all your memories, experiences, education, habits, learned patterns of behavior. Conversely the right hemisphere contains creativity, novelty, chaos, a more real time view of the world and in my view is where the higher intelligence lives. Example there 2 base types of intelligence; First is Crystallized Intelligence and refers to the ability to use knowledge acquired through past learning or experience. This is not much use to you when a new novel/complex problem needs to be solved. The second is Fluid Intelligence refers to the ability to reason and solve problems in unique and novel situations and this is what a Genius has and is very rear. We all possess both types of intelligence, but they don\u2019t operate together simultaneously with one always dominant over the other. It comes down to which one you default to and use most often. Most individuals I\u2019ve observed in my life and I\u2019m now 50+ operate like they are on railways lines/autopilot being very predictable in how they view the world. This is an expression of Crystallized Intelligence at it\u2019s most basic level. The smartest/most intelligent individuals I\u2019ve met express Fluid Intelligence (very few) and are moving targets being mostly unpredictable in positive way. I can count them on one hand! The main problem is how most individuals are in society are over socialized and constantly caring of what other people think of them. What a waste of metal energy. A Genius doesn\u2019t care what you think of them! Here are 2 quotes; 1 \u201cGreat minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people\u201d Eleanor Roosevelt. 2. \u201cAll greatness of character is dependent on individuality. The man who has no other existence than that which he partakes in common with all around him, will never have any other than an existence of mediocrity\u201d James Fenimore Cooper. As you can see it is very easy to become average through over socialization :) ",
