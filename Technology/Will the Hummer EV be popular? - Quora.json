            "answer_text": "Will the Hummer EV be popular? Let\u2019s see. Was the original H1 a success? For a short while, until it was clear that it cost too much to run, you couldn\u2019t get it into anybody\u2019s garage, and you needed a rope ladder to get in and out. So the EV1 will solve the problem with needing to tow a trailer full of gas, and the 1000hp four motor drive will give it plenty of power. But you still can\u2019t get it into anybody\u2019s garage and need the rope ladder. Besides being really ugly (that was a \u201cdistinctive\u201d look originally) it also costs twice as much as just about any other truck. No, I don\u2019t think it will be terribly popular and will suffer the same fate as the Hummer H1. ",

            "answer_text": "** Shakes his Magic 8 ball ** Maybe It\u2019s very hard to tell. That is going to depend on a number of things, cost, features, desirability, etc. So far GM hasn\u2019t been able to hit the right combo with the Bolt and Sparc. Hummer as it was implemented before was big, bulky and costly. While it worked for some, it wasn\u2019t highly popular. If they could make a competitively costing EV Truck and SUV they may hold their own against the likes of Rivian and Fords/Lincoln EV trucks and SUVs. I\u2019m not holding my breath, but I do wish them the best. ",
