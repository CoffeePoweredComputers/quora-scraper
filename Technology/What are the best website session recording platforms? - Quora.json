            "answer_text": "Few platforms are worth your attention: HotJarFullStoryLiveSession (new product)Depends on what your requirements are, you can choose one of the platforms above. Let me present their differences. HotJar has many features but lacks advanced search. You can generate heat maps based on users activity on your website, record sessions, check conversion funnels. I like HotJar because of its conditional recording. It records only pages that you choose. What you can't do with this tool is searching session replays by events (e.g., someone clicked \"buy\" button\"). To do so, you can use FullStory.  FullStory indexes all events (clicks, scroll, etc.), so you can easily search your session replays by them. It's a superb project Have an outstanding quality in comparison to HotJar. But it records everything, I mean literally every action on your website, you can't decide what's important for you. Pricing is based on usage and it costs a lot - $300 per month for 25k recorded sessions.  Let's check the third platform - LiveSession. It indexes all events like FullStory. You can decide what sessions are you interested in and set up conditions for recording. Finally, it costs two times less than FullStory with similar quality.  I encourage you to check all of these solutions and choose the best fit for you. If I can help you with anything contact me on Quora. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are looking for a Session Recording and Replaying tool, you should definitely check out Browsee. Along with session replays, it gives you smart ways to segment your users, so you can only watch sessions which pertain to your interest set. You will also be auto alerted about sessions where users faced any issue like errors or network issues or show frustration in usage. We believe it is critical because only a handful of users complain through support channels so it can help you identify and solve issues even before support brings them up. To sum it up, Browsee gives your site: 1. Session Replays: Ability to seamlessly record all or some selected user session and watch them later to understand what users love and what problems they face. 2. Browsee Circles: By segmenting your sessions based on URLs visited, tags, user attributes, errors, frustration clicks and many more. You can save these segments and get daily updates around usage and issues of your saved Circles directly in your inbox. 3. Error Reporting: Email, Slack or Chrome Alerts on JS, AJAX Errors or Slowness and Frustration Clicks. Prioritize your bugs fixes with by how many user sessions faced those errors. ",
