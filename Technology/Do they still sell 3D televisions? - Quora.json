            "answer_text": "There no major TV-makers that make 3D TVs anymore. The last two TV-makers to build 3D functionality into their sets, LG and Sony, will not build any new sets this year that can show 3D movies and TV shows. DirecTV and ESPN stopped broadcasting their 3D channels in 2012 and 2013. For those that desire to purchase a 3D TV or 3D Video projector \u2013 you may still find some 3D TVs on clearance or on resale sites, and most home theater video projectors still provide the 3D viewing option.
