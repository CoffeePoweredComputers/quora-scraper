            "answer_text": "No. Do NOT think you're idea is inadequate. If you think it is doable, then it is worth it. There could be many others like you thinking of a 'Great Idea' and then dumping it coz it didn't look feasible enough. That means you have chances of doing something, that nobody has ever tried before, in your own peculiar way. With that, no more philosophy. Moving on.  You said, you are a very good programmer. That is good. A tech start up could have a lot to do with programming. But that itself does not build a profitable company. And trust me on that, bro, it feels terrible having a team of 13 people working together on a great tech product and not have money. You would like a company that makes decent money. Now, lets talk about the 'Idea'. 1. Solve something - How about you take the place/country you're in and solve a problem that is not being taken care of either by authorities or others. I come across many problems around me everyday and I am always on the lookout of ways to solve them. And trust me, I have a great ideas/solutions to these problems. But I won't have an app for that.(apologies, just a little upset as everyone wants to make that ONE app/site which is going to solve world problems). No. that is not going to happen unless YOU come up with one. :) 2. Dream. -- Now, I don't claim to be somebody with a lot of good ideas. But, a lot of them have come just because I live in my utopian world where everything flies, energy is free and there are Unicorns. :) Think about the - FUTURE, man. It is going to give you many many ideas.  3. Be happy. - Seriously, if you can, IMPOSE happiness on yourself. Let nothing bother you. And be happy all the frickin' time.And when that starts happening, ideas just flow out of you. Keep looking. eg- Me and my sister are nuts when we are together. We giggle and dance around stupid. And most of the time, we think about twisting and turning an existing thing/idea around for fun. That brings in a lot of cool ideas. 4. Talk - Don't be bothered about anybody stealing your million dollar idea. Nobody is. If you still think that somebody could steal and start hacking it away, then, you, my friend, should start on it immediately. If that is not going to happen, talk to your friends. listen to what they have to say. Most of the time, these are the people who are going to give you traction. Look for advise. If criticized, do not lose it. Keep working on it. Never stop working, man. Everything is possible. ",
