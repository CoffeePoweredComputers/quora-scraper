            "answer_text": "From what I remember back in my DOS days.. One Engineer told me, that Floppy's will eventually be obsolete. Why? I remember him going on about storage space.. Floppies cannot be increased in size as the way they were manufactured, the write /re-write method was not stable and constant read/write would destroy the sectors it was writing to.In order to have more space, the only method was to manufacture larger floppies which meant increasing the physical size of the floppies.(never happened)Quality of the disk made it susceptible to wear and tear\u2026. If it ripped\u2026 goodbye Data!Machines that would read these disks was expensive and costed too much in maintenance.The future of these types of media was evidently leading towards the end of writable floppy media due to its limitations.

            "answer_text": "A2A. They are slow and rather unreliable. The oldest USB flash drives were much faster and many times more resistant to heat, adverse conditions, spills, magnetic fields, static discharges, etc comoared to the average floppy disk. Even CD-ROMs and CD-RW discs were larger, faster and more reliable than the old floppy disk and gave way to the DVD family of media but even they were outpaced and outstored by the flash drive. Not to mention flash drives are smaller and easier to take along. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they got the job done in their day. But I always made a backup and stored my game floppies with care and safety when I was done with them but eventually all magnetic oxide medua succumbs to age, oxidation, heat, or magnetic fields if a spill or some other such catastrophe struck first, like getting bent in a bag, run over, stepped on, or punctured.
