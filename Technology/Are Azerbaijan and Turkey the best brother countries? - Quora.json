            "answer_text": "Yes they are!! Despite there Sunni Shia difference. Because they are much related to each other culturally, linguistically and diplomatically. Turkey was the first state to recognize Azerbaijan's independence in 1991 and has been a supporter of Azerbaijan since then. Also ,both countries share a border of 8 km , the aras river separating Turkey and the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan. And to the left lies Iran . And since 1992, Azerbaijani and Turkish government s have closely cooperated on defence and security.More than 20 Turkish defense industry companies have cooperation and commercial relations with Azerbaijan.
