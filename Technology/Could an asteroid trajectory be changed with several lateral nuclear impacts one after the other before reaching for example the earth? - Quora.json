            "answer_text": "Could an asteroid trajectory be changed with several lateral nuclear impacts one after the other before reaching for example the earth? Yes - that is the most likely and effective way of moving an asteroid so that it misses us You want to do the \u201cnudges\u201d as soon as possible so that the small change in velocity has time to move the asteroid from an impact trajectory The problem with this is that we don\u2019t know how the asteroid will react The idea is to detonate the bombs a short distance above the surface of the asteroid - the momentum change (which is what we are after) is achieved by vaporising part of the asteroid That would work for a solid object - but not if the asteroid is just a pile of gravel loosely bonded together There are 30 million seconds in a year - if we meed to move the asteroid\u2019s trajectory by 6,000 km and we can \u201cnudge\u201d it a year before impact then we need to nudge it by 0.2 meters per second - or half a mile per hour ",

            "answer_text": "Could an asteroid trajectory be changed with several lateral nuclear impacts one after the other before reaching for example the earth? Could it? Yes. But that\u2019s a terribly inefficient way to change the asteroid\u2019s trajectory. Far better to match the trajectory, attach a nuclear powered ion drive engine to the asteroid, and steer it into any desired new trajectory. ",

            "answer_text": "You'd want surface blasts rather than impacts, but that's the technique that is most often discussed. The concept is sound if the asteroid is solid and has good structural strength. If the asteroid is closer to a rubble pile, it's not going to work. We don't know how many asteroids are \u201crubble-like\u201d, but we know the some are. ",
