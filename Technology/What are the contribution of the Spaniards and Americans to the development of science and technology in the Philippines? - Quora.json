            "answer_text": "The Americans contributed more to science in the Phils than the Spaniards. The latter focused on religion, and the Spanish friars (those of the religious orders: Dominican, Franciscan, Recoletos, etc.) committed abuses and excesses to the natives, denying them freedom of association and expression, appropriating land and denying farmers of good lands for farming, burning native religious icons, killing or sending into exile anybody who showed a reluctuance to be a christian. The Americans were unlike the Spaniards. Although they sent Protestant missionaries, these were not as fanatical as the Catholic friars. Once the American rule was consolidated in 1902, and after the 4-year Phil-American War (from 1898), they opened public schools for everyone. Science was taught together with English. Through these public schools, and up to the present, science and technology is taught from elementary to high school to college - in increasing level of technology. Today, science and technology has taken root and advanced in the Phils, but we are still short of scientific research, which would have underlain a science industry. This has not happened - yet. ",
