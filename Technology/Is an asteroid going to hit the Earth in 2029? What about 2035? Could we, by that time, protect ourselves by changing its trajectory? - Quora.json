If you mean 99942 Apophis, it will be closer than geosynchronous satellites on April 13 2029, but no closer than 31,200 km. The pass in 2036 will be about 1000 times further away. There\u2019s a possibility for an impact in 2068 (1 in 256,0000). If it hits, it will impact with a force equivalent top 750 megatons, about 14 times more powerful than the Tsar Bomba. If it hits deep water, there will be a tsunami that will be destructive in 1000 km, and if it hits land, it will make a roughly 5 km wide crater. In either case, it\u2019s unlikely to be long-lasting effects. ",

It could possibly hit either time. As for when we could redirect an asteroid, I\u2019m not sure. That technology is still most likely many decades away. ",
