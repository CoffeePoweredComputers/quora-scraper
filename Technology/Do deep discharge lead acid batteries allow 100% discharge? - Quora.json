            "answer_text": "Yes, in a sense, because 100% is relative, not finite. But, anymore than 60% nominal discharge, and most likely the battery will never charge again to the original rated capacity. It also depends on the battery physical construction and/or type, as to how much cycle stress it can tolerate. Also, there is a difference between typical deep cycle and industrial deep cycle batteries. Look to google in regards, because it is beyond the scope of this forum/question. ",

There are Cylindrical cells that are called \u2018AGM\u2019 Absorbed Glass Matt, and they are packaged in a 6 cell configuration. They look like this:  But as to what happens if you discharge them all the way to zero. Then I believe they are unable to re-charge when they hit 40% or so. ",
