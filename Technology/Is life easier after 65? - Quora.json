            "answer_text": "Yes, No and I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m 66 and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found. The No\u2019s: Physically, the aging process is something you cannot stop. You can do things to lessen the problems and symptoms but aches and pains creep up on you (at least they have for me). My eyesight has deteriorated a lot \u2014 without my glasses I have double vision. My strength has lessened and it\u2019s more difficult to get the top of the pickel jar off. Good sleep tends to elude me \u2014 I wake up around 3:00 a.m. every morning and have trouble getting back to sleep. Working is much more tiresome than it was before and by Friday, I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019d love to retire, but am not ready to drastically change my lifestyle to do so. I find I have anger I didn\u2019t used to have\u2014like a lifetime of slights all of a sudden built up. This is the main thing that affects my life negatively, and I find myself constantly battling it. The Yes\u2019s: I\u2019m more grounded. I\u2019m calmer about just about everything. I find time for hobbies I love and didn\u2019t take time for when I was younger. I\u2019m less competitive and more accepting of my faults. I\u2019m more patient. I take more time to stop and smell the roses. I lead a healthier lifestyle and experience very little stress (with the exception of lack of money). The \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2019s\u201d: I simply will not take crap from anyone anymore. While I deal with it as politely as I can, I won\u2019t stand back and say nothing like I used to. This doesn\u2019t go over well with most people. SO - it\u2019s a mixed bag and I can\u2019t answer a definitive yes or no. ",
