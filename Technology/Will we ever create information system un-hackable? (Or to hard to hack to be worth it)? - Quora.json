            "answer_text": "The cyber security community dropped the ball after remote Windows 95 was introduced to the public and around the world in the late 90\u2032s and early 2000\u2032s. OEM Windows Operating systems are created by computer manufactures who unwittingly hired hackers or knowingly hired hackers to design all Windows image files sold to the public and around the world. After 911 and the implementation of the Patroit Act, the government installed backdoors, government authenicated access security keys and spies was designed in all OEM Windows Operating Systems sold to the public from 2001 to the present. Since black hat hackers know the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in OEM Windows Operating Systems, we are all at risk for cyber attacks. Until the government demands secure Windows image files and security, the public is currently out of luck when it comes to securing our intellectual property(s). As of this date, OEM Windows Operating system is malware, spyware, and Trojan Horses if your system was designed by Geeksquad or other vendors. OEM Windows Operating systems are the most dangerous operating systems in the world if designed by Geeksquad. OEM Windows Operating system FakeCD.99 is a Trojan Horse. Dummy systems or zombie systems can be controlled by the botmaster online or offline, wreaking havoc from a remote location anywhere in the world. Currently OEM Windows Operating Systems affected and included in all versions of the following OEM Windows Operating systems; Windows VistaWindows 7, 8, 8.1, 10Results of OEM designed WindowsSecurity breached by defaultlocalhost file and Services allows unauthorized backdoor access including cyberespionageFirewall breached by defaultMicrosoft Defender surpress cyber threatsUnauthorized remote access by defaultTrojan Horse connection, components by defaultRootkit settings in the registryPoisonous hyperthread in the CPU (hiccup)Backdoor bios access, Intel systems (Southgate on the motherboard) cloned to AMD motherboardUntil all of the above are corrected, the public will remain at risk, global danger cyber attacksbot herder collection (zombies or dummies)bot armies controlled by botmasters (zombies)bot farms, collection of zombie systems for cybercriminal activities",

            "answer_text": "Unhackable - No Hard to hack - yes. Unlimited budget - Desirable but not necessary An open mind - Absolute necessity. Lets start from that everyone hate security and most of then do not understand security. One must remember, security is not a product (definitely its not a single product). People- Process-Technology makes security. Also, one have to keep user experience in mind when applying security. As a general principle, as security increases, user experience decreases. Till today the actual race is who bring the product to the market first. Or who\u2019s product works faster. In other words, if you want a car to run faster (after all the engineering hard work), you strip down your car to bare metal and get rid of any additional weight to make it run faster (with the same engine). This \u201cadditional weight\u201d in information world is security. Also, not to forget that the weakest link in the whole security is the user AND that the governments are forcing companies to add backdoors into their product so that they can spy on a individual/group or a entire nation. These backdoors are then abused by the hackers to hack individual or a company. Most of the Security products are very effective however they have boundaries, they work really well within their own boundaries. For example anti virus do not work very well with encrypted data. So the boundary for Antivirus is that it requires dats in clear for it to make sense. Boundaries for a encryption solution is that when a customer request an encrypted data. He can do anything with it, so you need DLP like solution. However it still do not stop anyone from clicking pictures of your screen using mobile cameras (hence we cannot have 100% security ever. Similarly all other security products have similar sort of boundaries. Anything that is not covered by the technology is covered by process and policies. So, you have to design a policy covering all this. Segregate the network, segregated users at each level, machine, network, application everything. Do the proper pen testing of everything that you put on. Choose new team each time, ask them to treat it as first time audit. Run open hackathon. As I mentioned earlier\u2026. Administrative nightmage and unlimited budget. Most companies are just interested in checking the boxes that saves them from Audits (do not get me started on Auditors). Also, one should start rewarding their security personnel. Anyone who ctreate and better design will with same/ new technology should get something significant. Just want to close with Despite not matter how much you invest in all above recommend, you might be in hacking process right now may be because of a \u201czero day exploit\u201d that you/anyone don't know about.
