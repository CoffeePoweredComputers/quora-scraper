            "answer_text": "Definitely for speed.Robots are not limited by muscle strength or stamina so production of goods could be a place for them but that would take hundreds and thousands of jobs.. Maybe robots have a place among us, working on projects in space, Antarctica or Deserts?A role as scout on our own planet could be useful too, scanning the earth for minerals or lost secrets? If it comes to the standard guy, it would replace people for more $$$ but if it comes toa scientist or someone with vision, then it would probably be to co-operate with us by doing the things we can\u2019t without month\u2019s of preparation like journeys to harsh terrains perhaps?
