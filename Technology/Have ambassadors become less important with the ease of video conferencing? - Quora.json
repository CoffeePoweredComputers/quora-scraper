            "answer_text": "Video conferencing does not substitute with boots on the ground hand shakes. Trump has marginalized the State Department which is either his method of securing further power for the executive or he is a stooge for Russia. Think about it, screwing with State, left vacuums around the globe.Russia and china are exploiting the American retreat. The ambassadors Trump has dispatched have been a joke, basically patronage appointments. The reality is that Trump isn\u2019t welcome in a number of our allied nations.England will absolutely not host Trump, nor Germany, nor France, Canada would be iffy. While Trump has been in power the Republicans have allowed him to isolate power in the White House. This is as far from the intention of the framers of the Constitution as possible. State Departments are vital to the policy dissemination and support of our global goals and challenges. ",
