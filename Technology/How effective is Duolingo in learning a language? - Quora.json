            "answer_text": "I tried to learn with this app and spent hours in the duldrums without ever learning anything. Literally nothing. (side note:Rosetta stone was moderately better in that I could skip the redundant stuff but in the end I spent perhaps a combined total of 6 hours on them) maybe it's great for beginners but at the time I already had an advanced understanding of the language, in this case Spanish. However I went from essentially zero understanding to functional fluency in six weeks. Here's how:First, I learned the basic grammatical rules in about twenty minutes. second: I tackled the vocabulary. I committed to learning no less than 30 words a day using something similar to flash cards. On paper hand write 30 words, column A your native language column B your desired language cover one side and drill it. then cover the other side and again drill it. It doesn't take alot of time you have all day so take two minutes to review multiple times a day until you have a 100% retention rate. Don't pick words at random just yet, it's estimated 50% (check that fact) of all verbal communication uses only 100 words, Google that list, learn those first. Next, lump together similar word groups (colors, house hold items, body parts etc). keep this up for 6 weeks and you've learned over 5,000 words, by now maybe your not exactly fluent but you have a functional grasp over the language. You'll be able to read write, listen to music, watch movies, and flirt with the locals. This is a solid foundation to work from. So switch your phone, tv, social media accounts, girlfriend, thoughts,  everything to German, and fine tune your newly acquired skill. This is how I learned Spanish in 1/4 of the recommended 6 month time. Viel Gl\u00fck! ",

            "answer_text": "Something I think needs to be considered is that Duolingo does some languages better than others. Planning to spend time in the Netherlands, I began learning Dutch using Duolingo. I very quickly discovered that I needed a text book, even to work out pronunciation. On the Android app, there was no feedback on pronunciation, and, although the grammar is simpler than that of German, there were things which needed explanation for an English speaker. I still don\u2019t really understand how to use \u201cer\u201d, for example. A couple of times I was marked wrong for translating a sentence (in either direction) into what I knew was good English, and was pretty sure was good Dutch, but it wasn\u2019t the way the app wanted it done. In reality, in the Netherlands, I spent a couple of days largely confined to my hotel in the company of staff who were anxiously facing their own Dutch language proficiency examinations. I also expected to spend time in Germany, and decided to brush up on that, too. After a brief assessment, I was started in with advanced standing. I found this an interesting experience. The voices (male and female) gave me some variety, which I enjoyed. However, using the voice feedback, I was astonished that sometimes I was marked wrong as soon as I clicked the microphone on, or halfway through a sentence. As my spoken German is generally OK, I was surprised to say the least. But the positive was that it did give me some confirmation that my German was intelligible to the computer \u2014 could be handy for \u201cHi, Google!\u201d I also appreciated, on the computer version, that there was discussion of variant translations. And there were a few occasions where I managed to slip my own way of saying something into the machine and got a pass. I suppose my German, largely learnt from post World War II migrants, is a trifle conservative. I will say, though, that I had the impression that the grammar was slightly better explained in the German version. Although I didn\u2019t get perfect scores in all the exercises, I was often bored by the German despite the better quality, largely because I was covering quite a lot of familiar ground. I might occasionally get a gender or a subjunctive form wrong, but I often felt \u201ctrapped\u201d in a set of exercises, not quite wanting to skip them entirely, but feeling that I was wasting time, when perhaps more work on the pluperfect of modal verbs in subordinate clauses might have been a better use of my time. Overall, of course, nothing compares with conversing with native speakers. ",
