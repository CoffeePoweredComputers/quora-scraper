            "answer_text": "You will never have all the knowledge that you need. What you need in life is to know where to go to get the information you need. When my grandfather was alive, I\u2019d talk to him about old fashioned remedies for easy to solve problems. Alum for sore throat. Everyone knows to gargle w/ warm salt water but warm alum water actually coats the throat. You can\u2019t find that tidbit online. If you\u2019re learning to cook, then call your mother/grandmother that is a great cook/baker and has lots of good advice to give. If you\u2019re wanting to start/learn how to fix a car, know who to call/where to go to before you start tinkering and screw things up more. There are always going to be more questions. You just need to know where to go to find the answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Personal responsibility. This covers educational aspirations, sexual encounters, choosing a date, drinking, driving, texting, chores, academics, self-respect. This is basic to nearly everything a teen experiences\u2014 all encompassed in a single easy to spell word! The only hinderance is peer pressure, which is easier to avoid if you are responsible for what you do and who you choose to associate with, and how you behave. It isn't easy, but it is a great lesson to learn early. The later in life this is understood, the more pain you will experience. ",
