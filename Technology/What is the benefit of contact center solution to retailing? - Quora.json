            "answer_text": "Omnichannel contact centers are here to stay, especially in the retail industry. Customers already hold retailers accountable for providing a seamless service across all of the channels that they constantly interact with. This means that support reps must be able to access complex customer information and purchase histories, regardless of the channel that the client used to communicate with your business originally. Why is it worth the effort? 51% of companies use at least eight channels as part of their customer experience strategies.Companies that manage to offer a strong omnichannel customer service benefit from a 9.5% year-over-year increase in annual revenue, whilst retaining an average of 89% of their customers.Two-thirds of companies already claim to compete with each other in customer experience \u2013 and offering omnichannel customer service is a big part of that. Without a proper strategy, skilled support agents, and powerful contact center tools like LiveAgent, it\u2019s nearly impossible to offer an omnichannel experience. ",
