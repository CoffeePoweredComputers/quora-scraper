            "answer_text": "A mule is simple- average mule prices range from about $3\u20135000. On the other hand, the normal lawyer answer for everything is \u2018it depends', but even a layman would be able to tell you this is especially true of land. The lowest listed average is in New Mexico, where land can be had for $536 an acre. California, on the other hand, lists an average of over $36000 for an acre of land. But land price is all about utility and demand, and the vast majority of land for sale is fairly worthless (except possibly for farming, and even then, you need lots of water and other accoutrements to make it usable). So the real answer to your question is that there just isn't enough information to know without adding more parameters. However, just to put some numbers on the thought exercise, I'm gonna go with rural Georgia as a yardstick, as the phrase \u201840 acres and a mule\u2019 was popularized by General William Tecumseh Sherman during his march to the sea, which took place principally in Georgia, and came from an order intended to recompense freed slaves with confiscated confederate land. A real estate website based in Georgia gives the average range of land per acre in the state as between $1000 and $1500 with improvements. We'll assume just above the low end of average, or about $1175. That gives us a total value of the land at $47,000. Plus the mule, if we assume a middle of the road price of $4000, we'd be looking at a total value for the package of about $51,000. Not really much recovered value for the lives of generations of your ancestors, but then again, if one sold it or lived there, it could certainly change the trajectory of your life. ",

            "answer_text": "My estimate is $1,577, which assumes $1,500 for the mule. See below for my high, low and middle calculations, which are very, very different!!! US land is worth much more today, because infrastructure is always nearby: roads, utilities, and irrigation. In the 19th century, some North American governments literally gave land away to anyone who would improve it. First, an unrealistically high calculation with one of today\u2019s land prices: \u201cThe statewide value of an acre of Texas rural land rose 5 percent in 2016 to an average value of $2,554 per acre\u2014a record high.\u201d So (40 x $2,554) + $1500 for a mule = $103,660. Now, using 19th century Ozarks land value and allowing for inflation: \u201cAdjustments to land prices were made in 1854, and more than two million acres of Ozarks land sold for an average price of 12.5 cents per acre.\u201d 40 x $0.125 = $5 converts to $77 plus $1500 = $1577. Early Settlers | The 1800s Inflation Calculator Since land was plentiful in 1865, it made sense to hand some over to impoverished people who knew how to farm. The founders of the United States pictured a country that was strong because it was full of yeoman farmers. \u201c40 acres\u201d was an economic recovery policy as well as a political one, and not all about restitution for a life of slavery. Even so, in the end, very few people were allowed to collect. Forty acres and a mule - Wikipedia Edit: Using 1870 or 1860 data per Confederate state My low-ball $1,577 only works if the applicants go where land is cheap. Here\u2019s some raw data for if the ex-slaves got what they really wanted: the land they had been farming all their lives. If it had actually happened, the price would have been whatever the North decided to pay when it appropriated land from ex-rebels. That might have been high, low or nothing, depending on politics. http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/AgCensusImages/1920/Farms_and_Property.pdf  This is from page 58 (which is the 38th page of the pdf). Of these 4 columns, columns 2 and 3 are for land AND BUILDINGS per state in 1860 and 1870.Columns 1 and 4 are \u201cLand and Buildings\u201d and \u201cLand Alone\u201d in 1900, the earliest year when both figures are given. In 1900, most places, the land was about 2/3 and the buildings about 1/3 of the value.I think the best estimate is to use 2/3 of the amount in column 2 (1870, after war destruction and devaluation). You can make another choice. Using Georgia as an example, 2/3 of $3.20 is $2.13Multiply by 40 acres is $85.20Multiply by inflation rate 15.46 x 85.20 = $1,317Add $1500 for the mule (even though the mule was merely expected, not in any policy document) = $2,817 in GeorgiaFYI, 40 acres is 30 football fields, including the endzones.
