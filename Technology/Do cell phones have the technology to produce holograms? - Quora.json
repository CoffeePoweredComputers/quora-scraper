            "answer_text": "I think we'll see it - Zebra Imaging has done some great work with their motion display that has laid a lot of ground work ( 3D Hologram Prints and Displays ) --- and light field cameras like the lytro ( LYTRO, Inc. ) have been miniaturized for mobile phone sized by Toshiba. So its conceivable that the enabling technologies will come together. The first phone to do so might be priced like the luxury mobile & cell phones from Vertu by Nokia at around $10,000 ---  where there is $ there is a way.  To follow up on gabriel's response below - yes, it is more likely that you will see volumetric display (holographic-ish) technology come to desktops before handhelds owing to various issues. If you are interested in that sort of thing you might want to check out the video of a prototype of my company's Voxiebox volumetric entertainment system at VOXON --- you can sign up to get notified of the launch at VoxieBox - The First Consumer Volumetric 3D Display .

            "answer_text": "The short answer is: not yet. If we assume that you are talking about a volumetric display of some kind and we take the most state of the art public research as any indication of a potential direction for the future of volumetric displays, it seems the major innovations which would be needed would relate to major advances in battery technology  and laser technology.  Another angle which is a bit more sci-fi could involve a swarm of smart mites (a la Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson). My guess is there will be other applications for volumetric displays besides consumer handheld devices that will hit the market first. ",
