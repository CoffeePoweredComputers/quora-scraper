            "answer_text": "Most businesses don\u2019t address the issue here. Technology is great because it can make statistically significant conclusions and record the results for you without having to do it manually - but they almost always require customers to give feedback AFTER they have left the restaurant. The problem with online surveys is that the customer needs to remember to do the survey at home on their computer. Furthermore, their memories of the experience may be hazy and there has never been a clear motivation to give feedback. Most restaurants that use this get under 30 reviews a month, which is more often than not less than 1% of their customers. Technology needs to be used INSIDE the restaurant. Companies like Buzzer provide innovative point of sale solutions that let the customer fill out the survey in the restaurant on a tablet or their own mobile phone. This increases the quality and volume of feedback whilst still providing managers with the valuable data automatically, and costs far less than you\u2019d think! ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a number of ways a business can use technology to improve the customer feedback experience. Surveys One obvious way to improve the customer feedback experience is to utilize an online survey tool that your customers won\u2019t mind or even enjoy using. It\u2019s also important to prompt surveys at the right times to your customers that makes sense for the product/service you provide. Often times I see businesses bombarding website visitors with survey prompts which can be off-putting. Survey55 (https://www.survey55.com) is one of a few solutions in the survey category (note: I\u2019m the founder) Live Chat The major obvious difference between surveys and live chat, is that with live chat you\u2019re talking with a specific customer. Usually live chat is used to give real-time support and possible gather customer feedback. It\u2019s a good way to engage with a customer. Check out Zendesk Chat Email (email automation) A proactive way of improving the customer feedback experience is to send personalized emails based on a customer\u2019s action(s). For example, when you onboard a new customer, perhaps send an email that answers one or two frequent questions in the form of \u201ctips\u201d. For an e-commerce business, one thing you could do is combine email automation with a survey: When a customer buys something, have an automated email sent when their item ships that contains a survey asking them about their buying experience. Mailchimp has pretty decent email automation platform that we use. There are probably a few more categories I could talk about, but these are probably a good way to start off to cover most of your scenarios. One thing I like to briefly highlight is mobile. It seems that customer feedback isn\u2019t talked about as much when it comes to mobile businesses vs web, however it\u2019s just as important. This is one of the reasons why also full support native mobile apps with Survey55. ",

That often makes the customer hesitant to give their feedback, which lead to less feedback and less accurate information for you. Now in the time smartphone, you can deliver the feedback form to their smartphone and they will spend much smaller resources to fill it because they can do it whenever and wherever they are. Just a few taps on the screen and it will be done. They will be more willingly to give feedback because it is so much easier to do and spend much smaller resources which will lead to more feedback and more accurate information for you. ",

            "answer_text": "1. By measuring customer feedback - the way to start improving customer feedback is to first measure it. A lot of companies, even now, either don't measure feedback at all or use old ways (like paper feedback forms) to understand customer sentiment and feedback. By using a customer feedback software and app, you can digitize the method in which your customers share their feedback with you. Why this helps? Well, for many reasons - you get real-time feedback, you can set up alerts for bad feedback, you don't have to manually collate feedback, feedback reporting becomes automatic, you can reach your customers anywhere - through tablet, email feedback, SMS feedback, online and more. 2. By staying updated of negative feedback - You can use the customer feedback software to set up alerts for bad feedback and use technology to be updated of all issues - all in real-time. 3. By reaching out to customers, instantly - A good customer feedback tool will give you the ability to email your customers instantly and connect with them to close the feedback loop. 4. By sending automated emails to customers based on their feedback - You can also use technology, in this case a customer feedback software, to set up automated emails to miffed customers and to happy customers, based on their feedback. By measuring feedback and taking action, businesses can really shorten their turn around time for complaints and improve customer feedback. Zonka Feedback is a Customer Feedback Software that has all these features and more to help you digitize your feedback measuring and improving process.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny how customer feedback is also often referred to as \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d, yet very few businesses use exactly this source - voice. One way in which businesses can improve customer feedback experience is to stop asking and start listening. Phone calls are still a reality for most giants out there, but few companies utilize their call recordings for anything other than compliance backup. In the meantime, customers are sharing an abundance of information during calls. They will casually remark on your pricing, products, offer, service, particular locations, campaigns, touch points, website performance, customer service. All businesses have to do is listen and collect. I know the reason why most don\u2019t. For a long time speech analytics was expensive, a nightmare to onboard, and well, not particularly accurate. However, in the last 5 years voice-related technology made a bigger progress than in previous two decades (just as Siri). At the moment basic speech analytics programs can jot down the content of the conversation with accuracy above 80% and deliver something that no survey will capture: emotion. Human voice is chock-full of it, and it can be used a source of some mind-blowing business intelligence.  This is a screengrab of the conversation captured by a voice processing engine called EVS. It contains some basic call parameters: transcript, speaker id, time of call, emotion. The companies who use it don\u2019t even look at files like the one above, just feed it into analytical engines that combine thousands of calls to figure out things like keywords, topics/agents/prices/offers that get the most negative/positive ratings. What\u2019s more - every opinion can be traced back to a customer who has given it, and checked for context. So how to make customer feedback experience better? Stop surveying, start paying attention. ",

            "answer_text": "Customer feedback collecting process is much easier and much more pleasant now with new technologies. It has a different level at all. You have a lot of tools, which can help you with this purpose. The one I\u2019d like to mention is MySurveyLab. It enables many methods of feedback gathering and automatic data analysis. The feature, that worth mentioning is ability to add web widget and pop-up surveys. They are fully customizable and can be easily matched to your firm\u2019s branding. It doesn\u2019t take much time to answer and it doesn\u2019t seem so annoying, so it is definitely a big plus for customer experience.  Technologies obviously changed the way of collecting customers\u2019 feedback. now it takes less time and efforts to conduct research of any sizes. With the help of internet, emails and electronic databases and analytical possibilities of survey tools you are able to prepare, launch survey and receive feedback in a single day! While without technologies it won\u2019t be possible. You don\u2019t need to take a lot of time to your customers on interviews. Enough will be couple clicks in survey. Hope to be helpful! Good luck!

Recently, chatbots became a must have for every business website but not everyone is focusing on the response time. This is a basic example of a tech innovation that can be extremely useful for customer experience but requires that the actions are up to date. This is also noticeable with customer care lines. Companies should invest in proper small business phone systems and then continue to provide excellent service. The key is to equip yourself with all the necessary tech and not forget to provide the basic customer support after. ",
