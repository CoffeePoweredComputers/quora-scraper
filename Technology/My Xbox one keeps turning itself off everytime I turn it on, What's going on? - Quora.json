            "answer_text": "Had the same situation. It\u2019s probably because of how either old it is or dirty. Usually when it\u2019s clean it runs pretty well but since your Xbox has a vent in it it\u2019s pretty tuff to clean it off. Either that or it\u2019s to old. Usually consoles start to slow down like mine and I soon needed to just get a better Xbox in a better condition. ",
