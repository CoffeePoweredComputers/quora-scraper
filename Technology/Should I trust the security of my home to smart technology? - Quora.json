            "answer_text": "Q: Should I trust the security of my home to smart technology? TL;DR: Nothing can be 100%, and I certainly can\u2019t say if you should trust it. But you can make it fairly secure with some forethought.  What\u2019s your concern, in regard to considering smart tech? Someone physically breaking in?While the house is empty, and they steal your stuff?While someone is home, and they potentially harm you, or your family?Someone gaining access to your data from the smart tech?Something else, that I haven\u2019t thought about? A bit of general info: A lock can be picked (or an old owner/tenant could have a copy), a smart lock can be hacked (and/or picked, depending on the type). Video surveillance can be avoided and/or disabled, a security guard can be avoided and/or \u201cdisabled\u201d. So the real question, I think, is: \u201cShould I trust my home to smart home technology as much as (or more that) I would whatever my alternative is?\u201d And that really depends what your alternative is. If it is just locking the door and closing the windows, then most smart home security is probably not worse, at least. If your current setup is 50 armed guards always having line of sight to at least 5 of the other guards at any given time, and all communicating via a hardline connection, with 10 overseers at different locations manually monitoring video feed from within and around your home 24/7, but only for up to 30 minutes continuously (so as to not get tired and less attentive), then any smart home tech is probably not up for the job. As User-10423527341772598457 points out, as soon as you connect your smart home to the internet, it is less secure. You can harden you connection by using an encrypted connection, VPN, firewalls (IP fil), etc. But this, like anything, will not be 100% secure. However, even if you don\u2019t have your home/devices connected to the internet, if you use (local) wifi, this is much less secure than if you only use hardwired (LAN cable connected) devices. Especially because many \u201csmart\u201d devices that are not about security are not built to be secure. There have been several cases with a hardcoded default password in a device, and storing/sending the WAN password unencrypted, allowed fairly easy access to the SSID/password. And if someone has that, then they are in. They have access to your wifi, and potentially everything on it. And forget about MAC filtering; if someone can figure out how to access your wifi (without seeing you type the password, or something like that), then they know how to circumvent this. Heck, if they know how to google, they can get around that.  With that in mind, do think about what your concern is. If it\u2019s someone physically entering your home, then a well-considered setup with smart home tech can be useful. I have set up an alarm system that I run locally fro my \u201cserver room\u201d, that uses various door/window sensors, motion sensors, etc. I do have remote access through an encrypted reverse proxy setup, which is a level of risk/convenience that I am currently comfortable with. As smart homes become more common, and potential intruders become aware of this, I might reconsider if this is secure enough. Keep in mind though, that if it happens when you are unavailable (or if someone enters while you are home, and takes you hostage, or something like that), then you have no one to react to any alarm that might be triggered. As far as I know, automatic calling to an alarm central (911 if you\u2019re in the US) is illegal many (all?) places. So you cannot have a smart home security system that will call the police if needed. So that\u2019s definitely not something you should/can trust your smart tech to do. Are you worried that someone will gain access not to your physical home, but instead to data about you? Like gaining access to your camera feed, info about your habits, etc.? Then the above about internet connectivity, wireless networking, and encryption is very much what you should consider. Or don\u2019t have a smart home. Some of the commercial security packages (maybe including surveillance by the company) are easier for you; you pay someone to set it up. And they likely have experience, and know-how. They likely have a monthly fee, though, and you are trusting someone else with your home security. And trusting them not to spy on you, keep your data, etc. So if the consern is your privacy and data, do you trust \u201cthem\u201d more than your smart tech?  On a personal note, I am a technophile, and have set up most of my home as a smart home. However, I don\u2019t think smart locks are ready yet, and I have opted to not have one of these. Yet. Despite the obvious convenience advantages. And if you do think you want one, please do not choose one that can be controlled by voice (Alexa, Google Home, Siri); you are basically letting anyone who can talk loudly enough for your speaker to hear them unlock the door. So this is not a part of smart tech that I trust with my home.  Actually, let me tell you what I have set up, and what I think are the pros and cons of this. What I trust, and what I don\u2019t. I have a computer in the basement that controls my entire smart home. I don\u2019t rely on any web servers for anything. My data doesn\u2019t have to go through Google or Apples servers (this is true for the security part, I do use a few things like Apple\u2019s servers for some iOS specific control). This system gets all sensor information locally, even if the internet is cut, everything security-wise will work (except sending out notifications to me/my girlfriend). This system is connected to the internet though \u201cnginx\u201d, using automatically updated \u201clet\u2019s encrypt\u201d certificates (and DuckDNS DDNS service). I have sensors on most of my windows and all of my doors (more to come). I also have very discrete motion sensors set up, hidden from the outside, but that will detect any motion around the doors, and several other places throughout the house (initially set up for automated lights, but serve a dual function). I have cameras set up that automatically record and save video upon detecting motion. This is saved for a set amount of time, so as to not exhaust disc space. I have (am setting up, we just moved) a tablet with an alarm control panel. We have an arm/disarm code, and a \u201cpanic code\u201d that seemingly disables the alarm, but puts the home i \u201cpanic mode\u201d. Depending on whether we are home or not, the home can be in \u201carmed - home\u201d or \u201carmed - away\u201d mode. When \u201carmed - home\u201d, the indoor motion sensors will not trigger the alarm, but a perimeter breach will (there is a delay, so it won\u2019t go off if we accidentally open the door). When the alarm triggers, after a delay, the lights throughout the house (not bedroom, due to potential of false alarms at night) will blink. If we are \u201chome\u201d, several smart speakers throughout the house will let us know at moderate volume. If we are away, the speakers will give a scare-speach on max volume on repeat \u201cAlarm triggered. The police have been called. Video feed has been recorded, and saved off site\u201d (most of that is true) for the intruder. If it goes into panic mode (can only be activated manually, e.g. if someone is forcing us to disarm the alarm), then every adult home member will be notified - quite insistingly (but giving a coded message, not saying that the alarm is in \u201cpanic\u201d in case anyone can see any of our phones). Any type of alarm triggering will also trigger a notification to all adult home member. My thoughts: Pros: I have full control of everything, I don\u2019t have to trust anyone else.This also means that I can easily tweak and change if I think something should be different.I find it fairly secure. Both in terms of hacking, and in terms of reliability. You would have to know quite a lot about how I set this up (much more than I have said here), to have what I think is a reasonable chance of knowing how to disable this. Most of my things do not use WiFi.\u201cFairly secure\u201d in terms of hacking is based on my assessment of how likely I think it is that someone would be to try hacking my home before trying to enter. I find this highly unlikely at present time.Cons: If my girlfriend and I are both unable to respond, no one will. I cannot trust the system to actually do anything by itself, only make noise/lights, and notify us.The part about calling the police is not true. This cannot happen automatically. Nor, in my opinion, should it. I haven\u2019t had false alarms, but we just moved and set this up (still setting up parts). I know these are common for other people who forget about the alarm. So:Potential false alarms.If this happens too often, it might become a \u201cthe boy that cried wolf\u201d scenario where we don\u2019t react on a real threat. I don\u2019t think that this is as likely with a commercial security/surveillance company.And they are just annoying, especially if they happen at night, or while you are doing something.I have to do slight maintenance (I actually don\u2019t mind; I\u2019m constantly tweaking things anyway. But this might be off-putting to some).So, in conclusion. No, no you shouldn\u2019t. But if done right, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily trust smart security tech less than \u201cold fashioned\u201d security measures. ",

            "answer_text": "Any lock can be picked, just watch youtube. NOW to the better part of the answer. Nothing beat\u2019s common sense. A locked house is a house that takes a longer moment than a non locked house. A house with a dog is more likely not to get robbed if the dog\u2019s are trained to bark only when they get inside the fence line. a well lit house does not get robbed as much as a non-well lit house. Placing your target practice up and around, and cleaning your guns in the back yard so your neighbors can see, will get word around that you have guns, placing you at risk for kid\u2019s that want guns, but a thief that knows a gun is in a home won\u2019t get near it, they will find easier target\u2019s. Some real obvious monitoring equipment makes a house more difficult. So, blending your security reduces your risk. ",
