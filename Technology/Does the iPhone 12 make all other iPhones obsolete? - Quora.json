            "answer_text": " Of course not. The iPhone 11 works as well as it did the day it first went on-sale\u2026 maybe a bit better if iOS14 is an improvement. The iPhone 12 is largely an incremental improvement over that, at least for most features. And in fact, it literally does not obsolete older iPhones, as Apple will continue to sell the older models to fill in lower price slots in their product line. So Apple\u2019s killing off the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, but keeping the iPhone 11 , iPhone SE, and the iPhone XR from 2018. Only Apple can really make an iPhone completely obsolete, and that\u2019s by ending support for it in the next iOS release. Far as I can tell, iOS 14 supports phones back to the iPhone 6S, same as iOS 13.  The idea that the existence of a new thing invalidates all older things is nonsense. Last year, I bought a Fujifilm X-Pro1 camera, shown here on the left, next to my Olympus Pen-F. The X-Pro1 came out in 2012, the Pen-F in 2017, and the Pen-F has slightly higher resolution and a few other, more modern features. But the X-Pro1 works as well as the day it was released. If that\u2019s good enough for what I need, it\u2019s not obsolete. Sure, it\u2019s \u201cobsolete\u201d as a nearly $2,000 camera (with lens) in 2020. As a $300 used camera, though, it\u2019s a perfectly capable camera\u2026 certainly capable of technically better photography than the iPhone 12, for example, in the hands of someone who knows what they\u2019re doing with a camera. Seriously, when it come to technology these days, there are very few big jumps in anything, year to year. I\u2019ve already read that the iPhone 12 seems to be downclocked versus the new iPad using the same A14 chip, maybe even underperforming the iPhone 11 on GPU work. But it\u2019s got twice the AI processor. If you live in a city with hi-band 5G-NR cellular radio supported by your network provider, and if you really have a need for high-speed networking on your phone, the iPhone 12 may do things you couldn\u2019t do on your old phone. Even that doesn\u2019t necessarily obsolete your old phone, unless this specific activity is a new one for you, or you find doing it on a phone to be a huge advantage. Any new piece of tech may prove to be Just That One New Thing I Need for some small number of users. For most, it\u2019s just an expensive shiny object that probably doesn\u2019t change what they do with that tool much at all. ",
