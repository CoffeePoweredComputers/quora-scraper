Any answers to this question are going to be date sensitive, as this product field has been seeing regular product improvements over the past 5 years or so. At this moment, both Tractive and Whistle offer excellent GPS tracking products. I can\u2019t attest to the Fi product, but it appears to meet my standards. I\u2019ve used Findster, but they are NOT a true GPS tracking device. Findster relies on radio signals to communicate with your cell phone, and uses your cell phone\u2019s GPS for geolocating. So finding your dog is limited by the range of the radio receiver that you carry with you. True GPS geolocating does not - you can find your dog\u2019s position, even if they are halfway across the other side of your country! The last Findsters I used, a couple of years ago, also failed on another point - their fastening system. One of the biggest points of failure I have found, in field use of these products, is their fastening systems. Until the past year or so, ALL of the products available failed my standards. My standard is simple. Does the dog ever lose the device when in the woods or field? Recent offerings from both Whistle and Tractive are robust in this regard, and are doing well in daily use. Battery life in both is adequate, with the Whistle doing much better in this regard (one week vs 2 days for the Tractive). The user interface (phone app) is similar. The Tractive is considerably less expensive. Two last points - never buy one of the cheap knock-offs you can find online. They are not worth the effort, and you don\u2019t have a name backing the product up. And do buy the latest products. Older products may be found online, but there has been SIGNIFICANT improvement in the latest models. Buying older products would be false economy. ",

            "answer_text": "My family and I did a lot of research into pet trackers when we bought our Fi Smart Collar. We\u2019d already owned a whistle for a year, and, at the time, it appeared to be the most complete tracker in the market. It worked fine - battery life of about 2-3 days (which is less than we were told), and the location was only really accurate when it was connected to Wi-Fi (which doesn\u2019t help if your dog\u2019s lost!). But it was still the best out there. However, just over a month ago, I saw an ad for another tracker, called the Fi Smart Collar. It looked smaller and sleeker than the Whistle, and was on a new cell network with supposedly better coverage across the US. They also had a 30-day return policy, so we decided to try it out. And I can\u2019t recommend it enough! THIS is how it was supposed to feel with our whistle. It\u2019s amazing the peace of mind you can have whilst having your dogs off leash. A few weeks ago, one of ours got out, and we were immediately notified on our phones and able to see where he ran off to and get him back within half an hour. I could never go back to a whistle after having this. I would definitely recommend checking out Fi. For us, it\u2019s definitely the best in the market. ",
