            "answer_text": "Hi, I would recommend you some steps before starting the coding. Most programmers starts coding a software without knowing the requirement and uses. Study the features required for an ERP. Study about Industry first before creating a software.You may develop an ERP with general modules or modules for specific industry. So streamline what all features you plan to develop.Design a feature document, make a structural model, software requirement, version management  etc.You may develop an ERP from scratch or can use any opensource platforms or other ERP who provides source code. Use such opensource to study the structure which will give you better idea of business flow model.After finalizing structure, features, data flow model etc only you must start programming. Programming is the final step in making an ERP (There are testing, quality check etc but apart from those). Most times what happens is everyone starts coding and ad features as needed on the go. This will make the project halt during some point.These are my views in a brief. Spend some hours daily and learn industry before making a software. This will make software really better. Some software with source code are given below: Odoo ERP: Homepage ERPNext: Free and Open Source Cloud ERP OpenTaps: Opentaps IFapERP: Infygen Technologies, Buy IFAP ERP Simple Enterprise Management Software, the erp with source code I hope above details may help you and some other people. Best Regards   ",

            "answer_text": "Ensure some of the pre-requisites before code   1. Identify/Target your audience (Small, medium, enterprise businesses) 2. Define your functional boundaries (Modules) Requirements to code 1. Choose an architectural style that best suits your functional boundaries (to ensure scalability, efficiency and high performance etc...) Example if you develop a cloud ERP, the most recommended is SOA with REST architectural style (for Server side services layer) and Single page app client (for client side layer) Reference for REST architecture style by Roy Thomas Fielding: Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures 4. Choose design patterns (Design Patterns and Refactoring) to ensure better software design 5. Choose a programming language (Python, Java, C#, etc...) and ensure the program codes are portable 6. Choose big data as back-end (Database) 7. Code for UX/UI design to provide good user interface (Usability of the software) 8. Follow best practices for coding and database design 9. Implement continuous integration or continuous delivery techniques to handle the project/product life-cycle better/easier 10. Test your code using any code analysis tool/unit testing tool ",
