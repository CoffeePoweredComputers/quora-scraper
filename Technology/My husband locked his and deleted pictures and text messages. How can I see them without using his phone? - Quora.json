            "answer_text": "Why would you be so desperate to see whats on his phone? You need to ask him and clear all your fears, take his word instead of spying on the phone. Like it or not its his phone, respect that. If you don't trust him, tell him so. Having to spy on your spouse\u2019 phone, or on social media or even through some third person isn't a healthy thing to do. Speak and sort out everything.. If he is lying speak to him more, find a solution or get seperated. Thinking you will catch him while committing crime and then confront him and teach him a lesson and so on is one road to hell you don't want to take.. Live a healthy life, take on your fears head on.
