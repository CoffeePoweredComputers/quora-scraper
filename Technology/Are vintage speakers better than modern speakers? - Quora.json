            "answer_text": "No, but there is a lot to say about many things of older speakers. They\u2019re not better simply because they were made to be powered from weaker amplifiers (in general), so they have higher sensitivity, but this usually sacrifices quality somewhere. In addition, they\u2019re old, and the old stuff has corroded, paper cones have rotted, rubber surrounds have rotted, etc. Aged things aren\u2019t as supple as young things, so this is definitely a factor. Old capacitors will also have changed by now. But there are some very good things, like the BBC designed crossovers, which have taught us plenty about many aspects of speaker design. Also, the way some full range and coaxial drivers work was pioneered in those vintage speakers, and the results today are excellent. The only place modern speakers fail a bit is that they are generally designed in software, not on paper. The problem with this is that numbers are more important than the whole design. Cabinets can resonate differently to simulations, driver cone materials sound different, and most certainly do not act as theoretical cones. The best method of design is to design on paper, then verify in simulation, and then verify by ear. These days the design process is usually to design in simulation, and then to measure by calibrated microphone. And that\u2019s it. I designed my speakers with certain goals in mind. I experimented with my crossover, and admittedly I also designed largely in simulation because I don\u2019t have the knowledge to start my designs on paper. Although I did design the basic aspects on paper, so to speak. I went through 4 iterations of the speakers, and my ears told me what to change to get to my final design. What I have ended up with is exactly what I wanted, but the interesting thing is the layout isn\u2019t what I would have thought I wanted. Unfortunately it\u2019s expensive to trial and error these days, so we are more reliant on simulations and frequency response curves to make sure the final product should be good. ",

            "answer_text": "Some are and some are not. It depends on what speaker you are comparing to what speaker. These are the Infinity IRS Series V speakers from the late 70s. The IRS was designed to be an internal reference system at Infinity, but the demand of the public for such a state of the art speaker system was so great that Infinity decided to sell them to people with enough money.  These are the Genesis 1.2. The Genesis\u2122 1 version 2 high-end loudspeaker system is the latest iteration of the flagship loudspeaker system from Genesis loudspeakers. It is the culmination of a 30-year legacy of reference-level line-source dipole flagship loudspeaker systems dating back to the infinity IRS\u2122 in 1977.  \u201cThe Genesis is custom-built in the USA for the most dedicated and discerning music-lovers worldwide and the owner\u2019s name is engraved into the external Corian\u2122 cross-over boxes.\u201d These are the LS3/5a BBC design  The LS3/5A was a commercially produced loudspeaker driven by the need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It was derived from the LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood.  Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces. The speaker turned out to be so good that 11 manufacturers were given rights to reproduce it. Falcon Acoustics build the speaker  Rogers also build the speaker  and so do other companies  Harbeth   I could go on with a large number of audio products from the past that can still compete with products from today. These are the CELLO Stradivari Grand Master from the 80s  The Grand Master was designed to be driven by Cellos High Performance Amplifiers, in single or bridged configuration. Because the speaker was/is so revealing, the Grand Master used the Audio Palette Preamplifier to allow compensation for tonal balance problems in the recordings.  And they still sound better than many loudspeakers today. And today you also have speakers and audio systems that will outperform products for years to come such as the MBL Audio Reference Line.  So: \u201cAre vintage speakers better than modern speakers?\u201d With audio, things are never that simple. There were exquisite sounding products in the past and there are exquisite sounding products today. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally depends on the speakers. \u201cdigital\u201d modern speakers can sound tiring to listen to after a while. Dramatic speakers are more tiring (\u201clistener fatigue\u201d) than smooth, natural sounding speakers. There\u2019s no one blanket answer. Some speakers, even in the same heritage, have gotten better with design evolution. And excellent example of this would be the Klipsch Heresy IV, which is now a neutral, natural sounding speaker with great openness AND high efficiency, doesn\u2019t sound \u201charsh\u201d or dramatic and just disappears to let the music through, any kind of music. The basic Heresy design has been around for 50+ years, but the most recent model, the Heresy IV, is the one the critics all agree is a beautiful, natural sounding, spend the money once and you\u2019re done forever speaker\u2026 one critic said \u201cWho needs a $30,000 pair of speakers when you could get one just as good for $3000) Another example of an easy-to-live-with less-expensive modern speaker is the ELAC 6.2. You won\u2019t need a subwoofer for either one of \u2018em. Again: easy to LIVE WITH, and that\u2019s the key. Easy on the ears, natural and smooth, and easy to live with, simplicity\u2026 simplicity\u2026 The big mistake many shoppers make is they get \u201cwowed\u201d by the dramatic speakers, especially when combined with subwoofers\u2026 but is that really how you want to listen to your music in your home, everyday living? Or are you just trying to impress your buddies? Dramatic speakers often sound incredible in a big store or in a specially designed \u201clistening room\u201d but then get them home and you barely even want them on. Or you have to sit in exactly the perfect spot for them to sound great\u2026 who wants that? I want to be able to walk around, live my life, chat w my friends, cook, clean\u2026 see what I\u2019m saying? As for vintage, you have to be careful in your selection, and you have to understand that some might need to be updated with some critical new parts. That said, the limits of actual human hearing were achieved by the mid 1970s. So what if a speaker can play up to 45kHz\u2026 we CANNOT hear that, so\u2026 the most people can hear is MAYBE 20kHz, and that\u2019s with \u201cperfect\u201d human hearing theoretically and not even real world for the vast majority of humans. So, what ARE the good ones, vintage wise? Epi and Epicure, especially their smaller models like the m50, m100, m60, m70\u2026 Epicure model 5, model 1.0\u2026 (NOT the late model epi nor epicure\u2026 you want the smaller ones with the concave tweeter) their smaller models used the exact same tweeter as their most expensive fancy models. For most people, an m50 or an m100 is all the speaker anybody would ever need: sounds gorgeous and can listen to \u2019em all day long every day without fatigue. I have yet to hear speakers that I\u2019d rather have in my home, at any price. They are wonderful. People have kept them for decades, because they are totally satisfied. HOWEVER, you can get that same experience by buying a NEW model from Human Speakers\u2026 and have something that\u2019s updated but still of vintage vibe, with a warranty: check out their model 81 and 61. For about $500 from Human, you could have a speaker that you will enjoy for the rest of your life, no matter how your taste in music changes. Yes, you can build up a surround sound system IF you even want to (notice the trend going towards simplicity\u2026 watching movies in stereo, or even just a soundbar\u2026 and also realize that MUSIC is mastered in STEREO so just stereo definitely sounds best for music). Human Speakers are actually hand-constructed in USA by a guy who actually worked for Epicure and decided his life\u2019s work would be to keep the legacy alive. And no, I\u2019m not a friend or associate of HS\u2026 just an appreciative person who has loved my Epi 100 and Epi 50 speakers for forty years and have no need nor desire for anything \u201cmodern\u201d because I have yet to hear anything that I\u2019d prefer in my home. If you can pick up a pair of Epi 100s or 50s (the 50s are beautiful sounding smaller speakers), you can update them with Human parts\u2026 IF they even need it. And, get this: you will NOT need a subwoofer with the m100 nor even the m50. They sound \u201cjust right\u201d as-is. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAre vintage speakers better than modern speakers?\u201d Definitely not. There were not as many cheap speakers available in the past, so people bought hi-fi speakers. I remember my parents owned a pair of B&W speakers from the 70s. But when they needed replacing, they didn\u2019t buy new hi-fi speakers, they got cheaper consumer level speakers. Cheap speakers are everywhere now and most people are not critical enough to really listen and realize they don\u2019t sound great. Also, they usually don\u2019t have a reference as most people have not really listened to great speakers. So they think these cheap speakers are good. And, to be fair, some of them sound OK. But if you compare the very best speakers from decades ago to the very best speakers available today, you will find they do indeed sound better. The companies making them spend years on R&D to come up with better materials, designs and techniques. The result is incredible speakers of unparalleled clarity. Luckily these technologies trickle down. Maybe not into everyday consumer products, but definitely into entry level hi-fi speakers. The B&W 600 series has inherited more and more of the elements found in the 800 series with every generation, making this great technology available to people with smaller budgets, like me. And I can tell you, my B&W speakers definitely sound better then the ones my parents had, even if those were good at the time and better then the speakers my parents got after those. ",
