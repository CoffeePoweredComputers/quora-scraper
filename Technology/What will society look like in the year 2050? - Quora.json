            "answer_text": "It is hard to say exactly and the only thing you can predict with any reliability are mega trends i.e. trends with real momentum and ability to sustain themselves. In the same way it is hard to predict the weather i.e. daily variation of temperature and rainfall but much easier to predict the climate i.e. average weather over many years. Some mega trends that will have a big influence on how society looks in 2050 are: Renewable energy: energy is critical to our current civilisation we will either develop a sustainable form of energy i.e. one that is plentiful and has low side effects or our civilsation will collapse. So if we manage to keep civilisation going it will be with something like renewable energy.Recycling: We have used up all the easy to get, high quality resources and we are now left with two choices (maybe three). One we run out of resources and collapse or we get really good at recycling. We will need to recycle pretty much everything. We will also probably mine old landfill sites for resources. Recycling will be an industry similar to mining is today. The only third option is if we start mining places like the moon or other asteroids (this assumes we work out how to do that cheaply).Environment: Our environment\u2019s ability to sustain life is collapsing around us, either we find a way to arrest this trend and reverse it or our civilisation will collapse. So we will have many people dedicated to repairing our environment or we will have no civlisation to speak of.Political situation: Humans have far too much military potential, either we find a way to negotiate some sort of peace or we will have devastating wars. We will probably have negotiated arms reduction treaties around the world or we will be in a horrendous war.Information: People will have easy access to huge amounts of information. I predict that high quality education will be available to anyone with an Internet connection and it will essentially be free. We will have the most educated population in the history of humanity.Automation: I do not believe that there will be human level artificial intelligence I do however believe there will be many narrow forms of artificial intelligence used by society in the form of expert systems. This will free up a lot of time for people and provide them access to cheap high quality services. i.e. transport, legal, medical etc. I predict many people will be employed in restoring the environment and things like research and the arts (i.e. things that are hard to automate) rather than in many of the middle class occupations that we see today.Space: If we survive our many problems we are likely to make a move into space. This will take the form of setting a base up on the moon, mining asteroids, trying to deflect asteroids as a means to protect the earth, sending probes to various places in the solar system. And perhaps even a manned mission to Mars (although this a an extremely difficult task and much more difficult than some people make out).Decentralisation: In contrast to what many people think, I believe we will do the opposite of globalisation. We will live in a highly decentralised world. We will essentially live like our ancestors (in small villages) however this time we will have the INTERNET we will be able to access many of the things from how that we used to have to go to a centre (centralised area) for i.e. a city.These are some of the factors that I think will have a baring on how we all live in 2050.

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. I think this is far less about technology than many people think. While technology adds many conveniences to day-to-day life, it hasn't actually changed society much. Note that this is a very US-centric answer. I feel reasonably qualified to talk about changes in US society, but not to talk about other societies that I don't live in. Over the last hundred or so years, these are the actual major societal changes I see that were enabled by technology: A significant decline in the infant mortality rate that changes the way people think about having kids and how many to have.Increased agricultural productivity that allowed more people to move to cities and suburbs relative to the number who live on farms.The rise and fall of skilled factory labor as a significant component of the middle class.Transportation and communication changes that make it much easier to stay connected with distant people and communities (including online communities).The rise of labor saving technologies that make it practical to have middle class households with no servants, and often with both parents working.The way people in a society relate to each other as a society hasn't really changed all that much due to technology. Sociologically, I think the biggest changes have been: The end of segregation.The rapid rise and gradual decline of the middle classThe integration of Eastern and Southern European immigrants into \"white\" society rather not than being seen as separate groups.The growth of Latin@ immigrants as a significant, growing percentage of the population that isn't considered fully \"normalized\" as part of American society as a whole yet.Urbanization and suburbanization.Equal rights for women, as well as LGBT rights.Over the broad scope of society, it's not clear that there will be huge changes in the next 35 years. Here's what I see those changes being:  The decline of the bottom rungs of the middle class looks like it will continue, as the ranks of the working poor in low-pay, limited-advancement service jobs continue to grow. Just as the rise of a vast middle class had enormous sociological impact, the decline is likely to lead to an increasing component of the population that is disillusioned about American capitalism, and a strong potential base of support for populist, reform, and perhaps even socialist candidates who appeal to this growing demographic. It's possible that changes in productivity or economic policy can turn this change around, but it's been quietly  looming as a factor of increasing importance for a number of years now. It will not be something that can be ignored in the coming decades.Normalization of the Latin@ population in the US as an accepted part of society rather than as \"immigrants\" or undesireables. Just as people from earlier waves of immigration became accepted as ordinary Americans.Either something is going to have to happen with the decriminalization of black culture, or this country is going see another major wave of racial upheaval -- or both. The current situation is untenable, and yet a lot of white people don't even seem to realize that there's a real problem. Any solution will also have to address the prison-industrial complex as well. The rate of incarceration in this country is unsustainable and grossly immoral.Other possibilities that I don't predict, but that are possible:  It's possible that there will be a growth in polyamory and different family structures that is significant enough to have a broad sociological impact. If there is, I imagine that another round of cultural wars from conservatives will ensue.It's possible that some kind of technological breakthrough will happen that will have such a broad impact on productivity that it will alter overall societal prosperity and the class structure of society. Things like this are understandably difficult to predict.There could be some kind of medical breakthrough that significantly alters people's understanding of overall life expectance. Gradual changes don't have a huge sociological impact, but a change that brought us significantly closer to defeating old age in general could potentially change how people think about their lives. There could be some kind of society-altering breakthrough in strong AI or robotics. I think this is deeply unlikely, but it's possible.",

America may still be inclined to wage wars around the globe but there\u2019ll be fewer of them.most likely is that China will be the dominant world power with America taking second spotIn scenario #1, vast radioactive clouds will drift across the planet for years causing radiation sickness, cancer, famine, diseases, and killing countless millions of people. Vast swathes of radioactive wasteland will make it impossible to rebuild civilization. In scenario #2, the United States will finally accept China as an equal partner and power. America will finally get its act together and compete with China economically rather than trying to impede China\u2019s progress through trade disruptions and military intimidation. In scenario #3, the world will be more economically united than at any other time in human history, thanks to China\u2019s Belt and Road. As the dominant world power, China will also be the most peaceful. She won\u2019t build hundreds of military bases. She won\u2019t invade foreign countries to spread her political ideology. The United States will likely stand down as the world police. Thankfully, there\u2019ll be far fewer wars and far fewer attempts to overthrow non-democratic nations. ",

            "answer_text": "Super AI that will transcend human intelligence will be created This is simply a matter of time, as computing power on the machines doubles every 2 years, and by 2050 (which is 32 years from now) computers will be 30 thousand times faster and smarter than they are today. Smarter than human AI will be probably created much earlier than 2050, and by 2050 the existence of non-human super-intelligence will be certain. When the robots will replace human workforce two things will happen. 1st: Most people (especially the poorly educated) will be left out of work and without the ability to support themselves. This will lead into the birth of a large class of poor people, with no ability to reach even the basic standard of living, and at the same time it will give birth to even richer group or people who will together own everything. In rich countries the governments may be able to provide a basic income for its citizens, but the poor countries will not have the funds for that. Basically, unless you are very smart and educated, your only chance of making a living will be through business. That is renting your apartment, self-driving car or assistant robot to someone else, given that you have the funds to purchase it in the first place. 2nd: The cost of most services and products will be reduced a lot. Currently, the biggest portion of the cost of product or service is the cost of labor, as it\u2019s usually the most expensive part. But in the future when machines will do all the work, goods and services will be produced much cheaper. Take for example self-driving taxi. In order to provide taxi services you will no longer have to pay the salary of the driver (which is usually half of the expenses) and therefore the companies will be able to offer rides half of the price. LOST CITIES You don\u2019t need to look very hard in a place like Miami to see how cities are changing in the 21st Century \u2013 rising sea levels are gradually making some of them disappear. Fuelled by climate change, not only are floods becoming more common in the streets, but the changing weather patterns have also influenced building design. Aside from more seawalls, the city is requiring all new buildings be built with their first floor built higher. But that\u2019s all a sticking plaster \u2013 if current trends continue, we may have to come to terms with losing whole swathes of cities, islands and low-lying regions such as Bangladesh. The economic impact to regions will be profound, and climate refugees could become the norm. Pressure is already growing on cities, as urban populations grow. If climate change forces mass migration, then existing infrastructure, services and economies may be stretched to breaking point. THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL MEDIA Social media has complicated the way we communicate for the better part of a decade. And it\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon, given that most people get their news from it now. That\u2019s before we even get into the mess of online harassment, as well. What might social media look like in 30 years, and by that time, what are some threats it might pose? A world with no privacy, for one. That\u2019s one problem we\u2019re already seeing. And besides weathering away our sense of and desire for anonymity and privacy, social media brings with it the many problems of cyberbullying too. Many charities and non-profit organisations across the world have mobilised in the fight against internet trolls, but it\u2019s an open question about whether law enforcement agencies and the social media companies can fix it or whether it will get worse. See also on cyber bullying: Cyber bullying and steps to get over it. Then there\u2019s also the problem of our information diet to consider: if the status quo of ubiquitous fake news remains, how will that shape how people see the world? If individuals spend months, years, even decades of their life exposed only to unreliable news sources, it does not augur well for civilised society and debate. That said, given how fast social media has arrived in the world, an optimist may suggest that those problems could soon be resolved. In 30 years\u2019 time we may be dealing with social media issues that we\u2019ve not even considered yet. After all, Facebook is only 13 years old. Weather in 2050: Hot, Hotter, Hottest Read more ",

            "answer_text": "The world will start to re-shape itself with new world powers which are likely to arise by the mid 21st century. keeping in mind their recent growth, future development plans, economic, political influence, strong military, and alliances. Here is a list of the countries which will dominate the world. 32 of the largest economies in the world, will account for around 85% of world GDP. The world economy could more than double in size by 2050, far outstripping population growth, due to continued technology-driven productivity improvementsEmerging markets (E7) could grow around twice as fast as advanced economies (G7) on averageAs a result, six of the seven largest economies in the world are projected to be emerging economies in 2050 led by China (1st), India (2nd) and Indonesia (4th)The US could be down to third place in the global GDP rankings while the EU27\u2019s share of world GDP could fall below 10% by 2050The UK could be down to 10th place by 2050, France out of the top 10 and Italy out of the top 20 as they are overtaken by faster growing emerging economies like Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam respectivelyBut emerging economies need to enhance their institutions and their infrastructure significantly if they are to realize their long-term growth potential. Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh have the potential to be the fastest growing economies between 2018 and 2050 with an average annual growth of around 5%. These countries will benefit from their youthful and fast-growing working-age populations, boosting domestic demand and output. Growth in these countries is driven even more by real GDP per capita growth, suggesting capital investment and technological progress will deliver real labor productivity enhancing benefits. For these countries to realise this potential, growth needs to be supported by sustained economic reforms, strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals, institutions and, crucially, mass education to ensure their rapidly growing working populations contribute productively to long-term economic growth. By mid-century, about 6.3 billion people will live in cities from a total of 9 billion. Aside from overcrowding, the skyrocketing population will likely spur the faster spread of infectious diseases and viruses, from tuberculosis to the flu. Dwindling water supplies and inadequate sanitation will only compound the negative health effects. Global food shortages will occur. Every decade, a warmer planet will decrease the amount of food we're able to produce around the globe by 2%. In case that doesn't sound like a lot, it means that in the next 10 years, we'll lose 4,440,000 metric tons of food. Global food security is also threatened by the emergence and spread of crop pests and pathogens. Compared to rural areas, cities consume about three-quarters of the world\u2019s energy and produce the same amount of global carbon emissions. Therefore, a rise in the urban population will also put pressure on energy demands and generate more pollution, potentially making the air toxic to breathe, similar to the situation in Beijing and New Delhi unfolding over the last decade. According to the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution is estimated to have caused 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012. This will only increase in the future due to a high urban population. The AI and Algorithms will only add more suspicion. Most of the jobs will be taken away and The algorithms are watching you right now will become more advanced. They already are watching where you go, what you buy, who you meet. Soon they will monitor all your steps, all your breaths, all your heartbeats. They are relying on Big Data and machine learning to get to know you better and better. And once these algorithms know you better than you know yourself, they could control and manipulate you, and you won\u2019t be able to do much about it. Still, Unfortunately, since nobody knows how the world will look in 2050, we don\u2019t know the answer to these questions. Of course, humans have never been able to predict the future with accuracy. But today it is more difficult than ever before because once technology enables us to engineer bodies, brains. and minds, we can no longer be certain about anything \u2013 including things that previously seemed fixed and eternal.  Some of the practical applications of Einstein's equations from the theory of general relativity may allow to time travel in the future. To be more precise, for now, we need to find some time travels which will answer the question correctly. Still, here I have put forward some theories based on recent reports that have come to surface. ",

            "answer_text": "Difficult prediction to make.. and predictions are always wrong.. but the scenario one constructs in making one can be useful to approach a certain picture of how current state and trends might be shaped toward a better future. Your question is about society 35 years from now, in 2050. I am not a historian so this is going to be pretty approximate.. please comment to correct me. I look at recent history in 35 year increments going backwards: 2050 - x2015 - Society increasingly globally interconnected, governments with more interdependence and mutual agreements to balance tax and trade, US influence a bit reduced, currency powers balancing, but universal english. Fear of the terrorist \"other\" forces, and the effects that human civilisation could have on sustainability.1980 - Cold war dominated world, there appeared to be a dichotomous choice between two political directions, two spheres of influence. Languages and culture defined the connectivity of society. Fear of the other side, and the nukes that can destroy us all (still today!).1945 - WW2, society dominated by governments manoeuvres to create spheres of influence through violent suppression and fear. A kind of governmental opportunism of sorts with a backdrop of psychosis. This was a society that was paranoid. I submit that connections between people here were across language, family, friendship, shared religion, ideology. There is a deliberate use of identifying groups of people as the \"other\" so as to amplify mass psychosis.1910 - The end period of a relatively happy time, culturally booming in many places. The big cities were becoming rich places, many services, theatres, we are in the height of the benefits from mechanisation. This is the beginning of the automotive industry, Model T in 1908. Connections in this time followed country, language, family. There was no sense that the world was under threat, no sense that the big market crash was going to occur around the corner.What I see is that there is a lot of variability but that interconnections and interdependence between people have increased over this time. We speak more and more the same language, use similar tools, can reach out on to each other on a moments notice. Despite there being big walls of information across different governments there is the potential on a personal level to be in touch with anyone, and this creates a kind of asymmetrical influence of powerful groups on governance, I believe. Society in 2050 will be about a kind of post-network society where the society is so interconnected that elites of different types will try to work to gain control through subtle ways of communication and influence of these networks. In part this is already the case but this is done mostly for commercial interest.. in 2050 I believe the whole human race will be engaged in a sort of constant network rewiring. This will lead to a broader kind of backlash that will put the people that believe the network is the answer to a stable society up against those that believe the network as a kind of spider web that leaves no room. I think society will be stable and generally much like any big city today in the networked society. You will accept being hyper-monitored, and policed to the extreme but will have freedom to do whatever you want in your entertainment system. Outside the network will be people largely of no value to the networked society, they will occasionally enter conflict with the network but will not have the organisational power to win. They will live mostly in poor conditions but the networked people will believe this is the choice that these people made for themselves. Everyone will be nominally \"free\", and freedom will be packaged in what you can experience with your entertainment system, or what you can experience in drugs or extreme spiritualism if you are outside the network. The society of 2050 will be the birthplace of those meta-values that rationalise how humanity should integrate with technology for the long term. Humanity will redefine its culture around this process, and try to bring in the fold the neo-luddite forces according to mutual tolerance. The drive for this will come from elites concerned in the background about security. But the outcome could be a new kind of broad enlightenment that balances humanity as a part of nature in a more stable way. Ok, its just one wild guess! ",

This is because as 2050 approaches, the step changes in climate will not be noticed plus people will have adapted somewhat.

But elsewhere there would be Long, hot periods approaching intolerable (lethal) humidity, including overnight. In the dry places, superfires that regularly enter urban areas.Power outages caused by air conditioner demand, exacerbating the heat effects of 1.Big storms, with injury causing big hail and very high local windsSea inundation and coastal erosionIncreased loss of (human) life. Daily double the 150,000 dying at the moment.Species loss. And we lose large iconic species by 2050, not just frogs.But by 2050 there would also have been some very large storm events. I reckon another 20 Super Storm Sandy type events at various places would have happened. That is, a storm with never-seen damage experienced by people totally not expecting it, nor equipped to manage. Then the affected lands are not rebuilt. And none of the above is entirely new - it\u2019s just going to happen more often and at larger scales. I predict the world will not have gone zero emissions by 2050. Perhaps CO2 emissions are halved. The residual emissions that are up there right now will still be there, with more CO2 added. It is these emissions that are forcing the above events. ",

Putting the global warming paranoia aside, what we should be doing is to make every effort to truly minimise pollution. That is something that starts with individual. Recently I was totally amazed to see a young woman with 1 child in and out of the stroller and another a couple of years older, making her children wear gloves and herself doing so too, to pick up recyclables in the park and putting that in a plastic bag to take home with them and get extra pocket money for her children for that. With herself and her partner in full employment and well-housed, she didn\u2019t need to do that but wanted to do it for the benefit of the local environment. If all still capable retired old people (the grey army) would get one of those lightweight shopping trolleys and one of those pick up tools and, do the same where they walk once per week they may be able to derive dual benefits from that. In the meantime, school teachers and councils must do everything to educate people not to pollute the natural environment. The world is our home, we must look after it as best we can and leave the climate to the solar system that has maintained and evolved it for the past 4.5 billion years to get us here. ",

At no point you can argue its validity because it's something happening in the future that I have no proof for it. If you are concerned about supper powers, well don't keep high hopes. North America and China will fall to their knees. Russia (with peaceful agenda, so no worries) will rise on the other hand. Those (particularly the elite) who are pushing for one world agenda (NWO) will die off, although they will keep hoping to stir a nuclear third world War to save their Asses and double their fortunes. That won't happen anyway. On the scientific side, there are already many scientific advances held hidden from the public by the Cabal. They will come out in the hands of the public anyway soon. The Cabal will be a history. If you are concerned about social life integrity, I feel so stressed to blow the bad news to US citizens. The moral disinfection will make \u201cdog eat dog\u201d scenario. Many US citizens will seek immigration and asylum abroad just like the citizens of the Third World countries nowadays. For acts on behalf of human welfare, many citizens in the western world, whose ancestors happen to be Middle Eastern people will be the most contributing in medical and technological advances that will benefit all of us. Please note: to the best of my knowledge, things may become different in the future if and only if morals are high in any society. The basis of our existence is entirely based on morality alone. ",

Maybe we haven't had ww3 maybe it's just rioting between the left and right political views. Most likely just rioting. The political climate has to heat up at some point. I have already seen some of it happen. People in Pride parade attacking counterptotestors. Telling them to eat s*** and f*** off just because they can't tolerate people with opposing opinion.

From tampering in US elections, they got a great investment, a maniac guiding American foreign and domestic policy like a loose cannon on a storm tossed ship. There is no policy, only chaos. The growing, dangerous US-Iran standoff, explained Instead of trying to figure out how to cool things off and get things done, we create tensions and conflict instead of a way to peace. Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program if sanctions were lifted. The US reimposed sanctions after we pulled out of the nuclear agreement. So, why would we expect Iran to keep their part of the deal when the US has violated the agreement by imposing new sanctions? ",

One example is Dr. David Pearson who predicted that by 2050, minds can already be uploaded in a robot hence being able to live a much longer life since robot can\u2019t have diseases. Scientist and inventor Ray Kurzweil has predicted that digital immortality may also happen by around that year. My own prediction is not specific to those but I see the world in 2050 with highly innovated technology. Flying cars, AI robots walking in the streets with us and yes, not to forget, half of the world\u2019s population may already be living in the virtual world by then. :) ",

It will end world hunger, and it will also end capitalism. Anyone can replicate food, clothing, anything they want at any time instantly. It would only need any generic matter as base materials- such as trash or even dirt. With CRISPR, DNA can be edited. Not just in sperm and egg for a newborn, but in the cells of a living adult. You will be able to become taller, thinner, stronger, younger, healthier. You can change the colors of your hair, eyes, and skin. A sex change procedure would take minutes, and alter the person completely. With this technology, people would be theoretically immortal. Both technologies, mostly CRISPR, will bring about the transhumanist biological singularity. ",
