            "answer_text": "Let's address each part as policy varies by type: Call records - there is a legal requirement to hold billing records for a certain period of time. Most cell phone records today show incoming and outgoing calls because they were billable records in the past but that would depend on the carrier. If the calls aren't listed on the bills they may have some record but it would be company policy. Text messages - most cell bills will provide the meta data for text messages, date, time, sender, receiver. Bills do not display text message content. Text content - depends greatly on the provider policy and most likely just a few days due to the shear volume of text messages that are sent and received by the carrier. Disk space is not infinite. You can usually find out the company policy and retention information by looking at the legal department's web page. It should explain what they may keep and what you would need to get it. Just keep in mind the only thing that is yours would be the bills you receive, information held by the company doesn't necessarily belong to you as a user. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably quite a while. Let\u2019s spitball it, shall we? An SMS message is a maximum of 160 bytes. According to CTIA (2017 numbers), there are 6 billion SMS messages sent in the U.S. per day. 6G * 160b = just under 1TB of data a day. so figure 360TB/year. Double that to 720TB, to account for metadata, which is probably actually just about right. So that 90 8TB disks, or about $17,000 worth of disk drives \u2014 assuming retail, with disk enclosures, which is assuming too much cost, actually, at that bulk purchase. 100 disks will fit in 4 HP AJ941A 25 StorageWorks Modular Arrays, at $275 each, and that gets them another $1,100 in cost, for 8U (2U x 4) of 19 inch rack space. So under $20K to store all of the U.S. SMS traffic for an entire year. A standard 19 inch rack is 42U in height, so figure one rack could put 4 years worth of SMS in a 19 inch rack, and have room for 6U of additional hardware. So say we spend that 6U on 2U of networking interconnect and monitoring, and a 2U slot for all the U.S. telephone subscriber account records that are pointed to by the metadata records for the SMS messages, and to which they have associate lists (call that another 2U). I\u2019m going to say \u2026 \u201cup to 4 years\u201d. And that\u2019s if they keep it all online, spend only a 19 inch rack on it, and don\u2019t have an HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management) system stacked on it, with an optical tape robot. If they had that, why then you\u2019d be talking\u2026 Every SMS ever sent in the U.S.. Forever. And you know what? I\u2019ll bet the NSA splurged, and bought the tape robot.
