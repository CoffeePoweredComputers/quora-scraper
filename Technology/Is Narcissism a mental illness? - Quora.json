            "answer_text": "It falls under the category of \u201cAbnormal Psychology\u201d and \u201cPersonality Disorders\u201d. This group a hundred years ago was called \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cneurotic/psychotic\u201d. It is part of a group of personalities or thinking, believing, behaving abnormally that causes them or others pain and damage. The origin like the others in this category is due to early childhood trauma and other issues in childhood and is formed to compensate, tolerate and survive. In other words it is unformed or malformed and normal steps of growth are not met or finished. Narcisissts have little or no authenticity. They cannot care much about anyone else so they cannot love, forgive, nor appreciate and all the tender and meaningful heart felt feelings that make life good. They can\u2019t connect. They are too busy playing King or Queen to see what the heck is happening. One might rarely see the narcissist as the first or \u201cidentified\u201d patient. More likely it would be their partner or children who end up in therapy as a result of their completely self centred feelings and behaviour. A teenager might be sent to a therapist, and an insightful one under the right circumstance might say, the reason you are depressed sounds like your parents show you very little feelings, I need to see them. Having done so, discovers indeed that one or both parents are narcissistic. That the young person has been terribly neglected and emotionally abused. However it would take a rare narcissist to continue therapy because they \u201clike the way they are\u201d and in fact others are \u201cjust jealous\u201d. Another way the narcissist might end up in therapy is from the spouse or partner being miserable and seeking help. In such a case the N might have invested enough time money and resources to desire some change. Or perhaps everyone in their life has left them, or they\u2019ve been fired from every job, or it\u2019s their 5th divorce. However it is a diagnosis that is hard if not impossible to change. Also few therapists would find the work of being with someone so self-centered bearable. It would take a long commitment. It could get very expensive. And uncovering the reason why they are as they are, is very painful, it was after all, painful enough to create this whole false facade. Note that: I have in my long life, witnessed two people (Ns) who successfully went through therapy and came out much better people. They may be slightly \u201cvain\u201d but they have found their hearts and care about others. On the other hand, they were never cruel Ns to begin with. ",

            "answer_text": "if you are referring to the personality like Obama, Trump, etc the answer is yes\u2026.. however this isn\u2019t narcissism in its actual form, Narcissism in its actual form has one weakness\u2026\u2026.there is none\u2026.. literally everything revolves around them even to helping you out is really about them and those tears? that is just added benefit. What happens is they weren\u2019t disciplined and given praise at the same time as a child and their \u201cinner child\u201d is looking for praise all the rest of their life to where their victims are feeding that lust for praise that they are missing out as a child. While Obama and Trump are full of themselves they don\u2019t have in my opinion the actual Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The good news is that while we may say people such as that are \u201cnarcissistic\u201d we don\u2019t really mean that we just mean they are full of themselves and a good high ego is not a bad thing its only a bad thing when it gets into unhealthy complex. the actual disorder is only 2% of the population.
