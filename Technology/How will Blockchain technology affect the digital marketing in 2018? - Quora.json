            "answer_text": "To answer this question it\u2019s important to split the answer into two (for now) unconnected portions: (1) Digital Marketing as a function (internal, consultants, etc.) (2) The creation of Digital Marketing/Advertising technology For (1), I see literally no way that blockchain technology affects it, other than that digital marketing has become a core competency of marketing ICOs/token sales. Digital marketing, as it exists today, is almost entirely predicated on the gathering and strategic monetization of personal data, which is essentially the antithesis of the benefits created by blockchain. I\u2019m curious if anyone can make a valid argument to the contrary. For (2), some of the other answers explore the creation of new technology for Digital Marketing/Advertising in additional depth. Just like with (1), marketing technology to-date has been contingent on owning user data or touch points and selling those interactions to make a profit. This is the business model of Google, Facebook, and every other advertising company. The remainder of the industry builds tools to support those business models (Ad Networks, Ad Agencies, SEO tools, Marketing Automation Tools, etc.). It is possible that blockchain disrupts advertising to return power to consumers rather than the corporations that own the data. Some interesting companies working on self-sovereign identity solutions (related to advertising or otherwise) are Brave (Secure, Fast & Private Web Browser with Adblocker | Brave Browser), Civic (Civic Secure Identity Ecosystem - Decentralized Identity & Reusable KYC), or Bitclave (mentioned in another answer). My personal feeling is that the advertising industry is especially hard to disrupt because of the concentration of power among just a few parties (Google, Facebook, etc.). I\u2019ve seen 10+ platforms that claim to be adding \u201ctransparency to advertising\u201d by tracking clicks and impressions across the ecosystem of parties that touch advertisements (end-users, ad networks, ad agencies, publishers, etc.). In a perfectly altruistic world, this makes sense, but why the hell would the publishers, agencies, or ad networks, who ultimately would need to participate in this revolution, want \u201ctransparency\u201d? They make a ridiculous amount of money in today\u2019s opaque climate. That being said, the best bet for flipping the paradigm in my opinion is the approach taken by Brave (mentioned above). By creating a standalone browser, Brave is angling to preempt even the large publishers and ad networks in controlling interactions with the user. By owning those touch points, it seems like they have a better chance than anyone of truly using blockchain to transform digital advertising. Until then, marketers will have to settle for slinging ICOs using central tools and leave the blockchain disruption to other industries. ",

            "answer_text": " Because blockchain is a decentralized system, data stored this way has a high level of security. This technology is going to disrupt and overhaul the online advertising industry because it will negate the need for middle men. Currently, businesses run Google or Facebook ads, and both platforms make money off these ads. But blockchain companies, like BitClave, are focusing on search-data privacy, giving users full control over their data. BitClave\u2019s search engine uses Ethereum blockchain technology and eliminates the need for ad service people, creating a direct connection between consumers and businesses. This is the hallmark of blockchain technology: It eliminates the need for middle men in all transactions. When users perform a search, they can select the amount of data they want to be released to advertisers. Then, unlike what happens with other digital marketing services, users can be compensated for their data. So, instead of an intermediary selling your data to advertisers, you\u2019re selling it to them directly -- yourself. Smart contracts assist in helping you exchange money, shares or anything of value in a conflict-free and transparent manner and letting you avoid additional players, like lawyers. These computer programmed contracts operate on blockchain technology that facilitates, verifies and executes the terms of an irrevocable contract that can only be replaced by a brand new contract. These contracts will make B2B cross-promotional marketing much more efficient, especially in the age of influencers and bloggers, who use platforms such as Instagram and YouTube to cultivate personal brands. Digital marketing with this group of influencers can be fruitful but has its challenges since there is no third party regulating the terms of the agreement and each individual determines his or her own costs. Companies can use blockchain to show consumers whom they are selling their data to. And, since this information cannot be changed or copied, companies that use this technology to store their data can rest assured that their information will not be tampered with. ",
