            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there is a standard classification available for Technology companies, mainly because the field is so dynamic. You can classify the companies in multiple ways On basis of what they sell: Products, service or both. Product based companies can then be further sub divided into hardware, software or both. On basis of who they serve: Tech companies can be divided in terms of the industry they serve. For ex. Healthcare, Communications, Retail etc. A lot of big tech companies have products targeted at specific industries whereas a lot of others have found a niche and are market leaders in what they do. B2B or B2C: Are the products/services targeted for business customers or individual consumers. Good example of B2B is Cisco providing networking infrastructure to other organizations. Apple, Samsung on the other hands generate most of their revenue from selling to individual customers directly. There are a lot of companies which are both B2B and B2C, for example Microsoft, Intel, Google etc. These are some of the examples of classification but there will always be overlaps between categories, specially in the case of big companies like IBM and Google who have substantial presence across industries and geographies.

Teachers have had to learn how to use more advanced gadgets in the classroom and incorporate all kinds of different tools in their lessons. In the area of education and learning, there\u2019a site called Brainly which is kind of like a Quora but for students to connect and help each other with homework. The rise of mobile has created a dynamic in the use of apps for everything under the sun. For example; there\u2019s an app called MySize that helps you know your exact measurements no matter what brand you\u2019re buying. I found an article on Entrepreneur that might be helpful for you. It lists a variety of companies that are using technology in unique and innovative ways. ",
