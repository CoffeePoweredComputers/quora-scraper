            "answer_text": "The real answer is: All of the earlier answers, and more. Software (bloatware) - loads of laptops have software included to \u2018help\u2019 the consumer. As a techie, the very first thing I do with laptops is reinstalling windows. They almost always include some anti-virus that just eats all the resources all the time. But other software might be using your resources as well. Like custom software to play DVD\u2019s on the included DVD player for some reason might use your CPU all the time.HDD - Having a traditional harddrive is a lot slower then a SSD. upgrading from an HDD to an SSD will improve your laptop speeds always. There are faster and slower SSD\u2019s however. And they are more expansive. Also, not all laptops are upgradeable.Outdated - I know a lot of people who buy \u201cbrand new\u201d laptops, with specs of 3 - 4 years ago. Well this should speak for itself.Thermals - A computer (it\u2019s components) use energy, and everything that uses energy will heat up. To not let everything smelt and burn computers turn down their energy if they become to hot. This means, they will throttle your CPU power if it becomes to hot. In a traditional desktop, it\u2019s less of a problem, there is loads of room to dissipate the heat. A laptop is quite confined. This is a problem from model to model and might even be a non-issue.Laptops are inherently lower powered - A laptop can\u2019t power the same electronics as a desktop can. They are battery powered so they have a limit on how much energy they can give you at any given moment. Desktops do have a limit as well, but it\u2019s way higher. With the new Nvidia 10-series, the GPU department made some huge improvements however. The CPU\u2019s, even though they have the same number, are slower then their desktop counter parts. In high-end laptops the i7\u20137700HQ is used. This CPU is significantly slower then a i7\u20137700k seen in most high-end desktops. (this point ties in with thermals)Horrible bad and misleading marketing - I can\u2019t tell you how many times I wanted to hit some salesperson when (s)he was trying to sell me a laptop as being able to do certain stuff. Anything using an Intel Celeron or Atom processor won\u2019t do anything more then open up Edge and browse light websites. Chrome or Youtube will lag that thing. Meanwhile, they are being promoted as being perfectly capable to do stuff like light photoshopping, especially if they include some weird graphics card. I\u2019ve seen laptops promoted for gaming because they have an i7 or i5, but without a dedicated graphics card. While you \u201ccan\u201d play AAA (e-sport) titles on the latest i7 and i5 without a graphics card. It\u2019ll play on 30FPS max. It\u2019ll drop to unplayable FPS when anything happens in the game that is more taxing then just walking around. It won\u2019t crash, but you won\u2019t enjoy it.People have way to high expectations for laptops most of the time. Especially when they compare it to an smartphone or tablet. I mean, those devices are a lot smaller and can do it without lagging right? Well.. Yeah, but they are doing things a whole lot different. It\u2019s like saying that you don\u2019t need a car because you own a hoverboard/segway. Yes you can get around on that thing. But don\u2019t expect to move your couch with it. ",

            "answer_text": "I had that general problem in September when I bought my current laptop. Basically, it was a software thing; Dropbox was included with the software suite on the laptop, and when I set it up for my account, the blasted thing insisted on downloading everything I currently have stored in my Dropbox account. I'm pretty sure someone will tell me that I could have adjusted my Dropbox settings to prevent that, in which case I respond \"mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa\". The point, though, is that (especially since my laptop doesn't have a SSD, just a HDD) downloading all my Dropbox files took a long time and a lot of CPU and HDD bandwidth while I was trying to set up various other things. It was pretty darn irritating. ",

On top of that, it obviously depends on the hardware specs of the machine, perhaps the laptop wasn\u2019t that good in the first place.

Is the laptop plugged into power (it will usually run slower if not -- check your power settings). Are you doing more than one thing? Are there background processes running, like Dropbox sync'ing itself to the Internet? Is the program you are trying to run a resource hog (like Adobe Photoshop)? If you don't have enough RAM installed, and if you are running Windows, it may run out of physical memory and start swapping pages to disk, which will really slooooooooooooooooow things down. Check your performance monitor (CTRL+ALT+DEL, Task Manager, Options -> Performance) -- if you are running Windows. Not sure what else you can check. ",
