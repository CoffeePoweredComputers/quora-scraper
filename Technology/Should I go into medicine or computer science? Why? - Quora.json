As a lot of doctors have said, only choose medicine when you couldn't imagine yourself happy in any other career. Here are the pros and cons: Medicine Pros: Status (you're \"doctor\" so-and-so)Improving people's health in a tangible wayYou can be a lifelong learner, there are so many specialties, so much to learn, you'll never get boredAfter grueling, expensive medical school and long residency, you're making a very nice salary (but you're worse off in the long term because of the opportunity cost and debt)You'll never be unemployedCons: Years and years of school, so terrible decision financially. If you put the same effort that a doctor puts into becoming a doctor into your CS career, you'd end up way aheadTons of government regulationInsuranceTons of stressTons of hoursMany regret going into medicine2x more likely to commit suicideGenerally not very happyComputer Science Pros: Better lifestyle/work-life balanceAwesome pay, especially if you work as hard as a doctor and get into a tech company like Google or FacebookTech is the future, software is eating the world. Get into a hot space and you could be riding a steep upward trend throughout your careerTons of arenas to play in. If you want to work in healthcare, you can become a data scientist and help predict cancer earlier and save tons of lives with your computer science knowledge. You can start a startup. Or work for the government. Or work in finance and make the big bucks. Or become a consultant.High demand for your skillsPeople will know you're smart ;)Cons: Potential for outsourcing/automation for certain jobsYou have to always be learningCognitively intense workA degree of stressLess tangibly impactful than medicine in many casesAgism and sexismBest of luck! You know where I stand ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Medicine or CS? How smart are you? Can\u2019t resist your question\u2014my primary jobs (I have several) are in Medicine and I have secondary IT-related roles. I\u2019ve done my 20,000 hours of programming. Answering this is tricky for several reasons. Perhaps the best answer is the question \u201cWhat do you expect of the two?\u201d and following close on its heels is \u201cWhy limit yourself to one?\u201d Most people who start Medicine have wildly unreasonable expectations\u2014and after 40 years I guess the reason why I still enjoy it is the fact that I\u2019ve managed to cling to these wildly unreasonable expectations. I suspect that the same is true for CS\u2014although nowadays I suspect that many or perhaps most programmers see it more as a job than as a passion to indulge. (In any occupation, this dynamic tension between idealism and the pragmatism of money in the bank and putting food on the table is there\u2014ask a passionate chef). Come to think of it, many doctors are the same\u2014and miserable in consequence. This largely wasn\u2019t the case say 30 years ago. I think the things that endear me to Medicine are both the intellectual challenge and the need to help others\u2014but also the enjoyment of human interaction, and perhaps being fairly good at my job. There\u2019s also the control aspect\u2014many doctors are \u2018Type A\u2019 personalities. Can you see that, depending on how you work things out, CS may offer similar privileges? Both have their down-side, but I suspect that having to work insanely hard is shared by every worthwhile discipline, even if you are extraordinarily lucky. I\u2019m in the fortunate situation that I can easily earn twice as much doing Medicine as I could by doing CS exclusively, without now having to extend myself to a ridiculous degree. But perhaps the most important thing to realise is that both Medicine and CS are changing dramatically, and will continue to change\u2014likely in ways that we cannot even imagine. So there\u2019s a stochastic element that you can\u2019t control or even predict. You\u2019re largely buying off-plan. Many of these changes will likely not be the ones people are currently predicting\u2014for example, AI replacing doctors (even surgeons) and AI replacing programmers (even less likely). The important bits of both Medicine and CS lie beneath the surface, and until you\u2019ve done at least 10,000 hours (yeah, that magic number is not far off, despite being disparaged of late), you really don\u2019t grok either. The deep down-sides of both are more philosophical than you might imagine, and remarkably, are quite similar in both Medicine and CS. (I suspect this is an underlying thread that imperils many technical people and perhaps even entire societies, and is hugely underappreciated). In my opinion\u2014and heck, I could be wrong\u2014these relate to what I might call an \u201contological fixation\u201d, the view that most things fall into rigid categories, and can be managed accordingly. Again to me, this disease seems most marked in the USA, but is widespread. In Medicine, this results in the practising of unscientific medicine\u2014unreasonably hanging on to frankly wrong diagnoses, and indeed wrong treatments, way past their sell-by date; and many more faults besides. In CS, I see a somewhat different pathology, where attempts to coerce problems into pre-conceived solutions (or even cookie-cutter solutions) results in bulky and dysfunctional code and entire projects that aren\u2019t fit for purpose. This is a creeping disease in a variety of businesses and institutions too, which are now increasingly managed by short term goals and rigidly defined objectives, and touches on disciplines as widely diverse as psychiatry, social sciences and physics. But it comes down to bad models\u2014and bad science. There\u2019s worse to come. Both Medicine and CS have largely succumbed to managerial bureaucracy, where the managers haven\u2019t understood (or even read) Deming and really believe that management is about telling people what to do\u2014rather than mostly asking \u201cHow can I help?\u201d They seem to see actual leadership as something to avoid, or make subservient to sticking to the rule book and covering your arse. Medicine still has perhaps a bit more wiggle-room here, but I can\u2019t see this lasting. If you\u2019re smart then why not try to bridge the chasm between CS and Medicine? Do both! But beware. Although the two are bound to come together, and there will be great rewards for those skilled at both, this won\u2019t be easy. A lot of the foundational work that claims to act as a bridge is symptomatic of what I\u2019ve already described\u2014arcane, badly put together ontologies like SNOMED CT; poor models of medicine that are frankly unscientific; a stereotyped, managerial focus; and failure to get even the basics right, masked by obfuscation, non-disclosure agreements and hold-harmless clauses. Doing either Medicine or CS right is insanely difficult, so many confine themselves to a tiny, mechanistic, often trivial part of one or the other\u2014but your question suggests that this may not be you. Go into either with your eyes wide open, try to actually experience both\u2014at the coal face, early on\u2014and even have a third string to your bow. My 2c, Dr Jo. ",
