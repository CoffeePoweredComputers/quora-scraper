            "answer_text": "While it\u2019s true, what others have said, that it\u2019s a digital signal and not analog, you still have something called \u2018bandwidth\u2019 to worry about! There\u2019s a lot less going on inside a cable plugged in to a 1080p TV/bluray than there is in a cable connected to a 4K setup; lots more data being transferred much faster! I\u2019ve seen 4K devices that would have intermittent audio and video glitching with old cables and these problems vanished when the newer \u2018high speed\u2019 rated cables were used. Now, I guess what the other people are saying is that in theory if an older pre-highspeed cable was made with high-quality parts and large wire gauges, then sure it might play the newer high-bandwidth content. Don\u2019t fall for marketing gimmicks on the packaging, I don\u2019t recommend buying those expesive $80 cables (I never would) but do understand that there are real limits you might experience with older HDMI cables, that are not made to the \u2018highspeed\u2019 specification, when you are using them with the the latest 4K+ and surround-sound equipment! Not to mention the newer HDMI spec even incorporates networking capabilities! So that\u2019s even more bandwidth needed in modern setups, and some of these digital artifacting issues will happen only when certain factors occur, like when most of the pixels of the screen need to change at the same time for some time in an action scene, which can be tough on the compression codecs and really use up that bandwidth! You can read more about the different HDMI specs and cables of different bandwidth specifications here: HDMI - Wikipedia Bottom line: If you\u2019re getting a 4K gear AT LEAST make sure you get a \u2018highspeed\u2019 HDMI cable to ensure it\u2019s made with materials capable of supporting the bandwidth needed!

            "answer_text": "Not all HDMI cables are the same. It's true that HDMI is a digital signal, and that as long as the signal is passed cleanly, you won't be able to tell the difference between two different cables. However, digital signals are a pass/fail proposition. It's either all or nothing. There is no gradual degradation as there is with analog signals. So, if the transmitted signal is weak, or there is a lot of electrical or magnetic interference nearby, the receiver will have trouble deciphering the signal: it can't tell if the received code should be a one or a zero (actually an \u2018on\u2019 or an \u2018off\u2019). That's where the difference in cables comes in: how well they can preserve the signal in the environment, which also includes the power of the transmitter and the sensitivity of the receiver. I have seen where a particular cable will work between one computer and a TV, but not between a different computer and the same TV. Yet, a different cable works between the second computer and the same TV. For very long cable runs, a more expensive cable can make a difference \u2014 that is, it will actually work where a cheaper cable will simply fail to pass a usable signal. So if a cheap cable passes a good signal, a \u201cbetter\u201d more expensive cable will not give you a better viewing experience. The cheapest cable that seems to work provides the best value. EDIT: Each version of the HDMI specification provides minimum performance metrics for compliant cables. A cable compliant with HDMI 1.1 may be noncompliant with the HDMI 2.1 specification.  The principles above apply to ALL digital signals, not just HDMI. ",
