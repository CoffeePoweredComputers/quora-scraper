            "answer_text": "I felt compelled to write a more comprehensive answer after reading some of the answers: Recycling does not reduce waste, it is the act of processing wasteSending waste to China does not reduce waste, it\u2019s still waste, it\u2019s just in ChinaCompacting waste does not reduce waste it reduces its volumeDeconstructing e-waste does not reduce waste, it is the act of\u2026\u2026.well deconstructionPyrolysis does not reduce waste, it thermally treats organic material; converting it into char and syngasReducing waste is about not casting it in the first place, so reduction has little to do with processing waste, in fact it has nothing to do with waste by definition. Are you following? Some examples of waste reduction technology are: Drinking fountains: reduce the purchase of bottled water and hence plastic bottle wastePlastic moulding technology: can make lighter plastic products which reduces waste. It\u2019s called lightweighting.You could say that the technology to produce rust resistant paint resources waste because it prevents ferrous metal from degrading and being discardedAnything that produces an item that replaces something disposable reduces waste, e.g. a clay kiln makes a ceramic mug which could replace a disposable onePutting a brick in the toilet system reduces water wasteAnything that involves processing waste inherently doesn't reduce waste. Waste reduction involves things that HAVEN\u2019T BECOME WASTE YET - by definition. ",

            "answer_text": "The United States and Europe sends \"trash\" to China.  It's actually more accurate to say China imports these old / used items.  There, people strip wire, deconstruct old cell phones, pull metals off of appliances, and smelt these different metals.  Then theses metals are introduced into new products.  Then resold around the world. ",
