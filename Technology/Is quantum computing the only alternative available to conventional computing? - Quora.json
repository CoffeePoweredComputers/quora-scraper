            "answer_text": "No there are some other potentially good alternatives; one of the is biocomputing, whereby we use DNA and cells to compute in a massively parallel fashion. After all, DNA is a form of digital computation, using essentially a 4 bit code (the bases on the DNA backbone). Another is analog computing; if we figured out how the brain organizes neurons, we could theoretically make transistors which implement similar functions. They would be a million times faster than the human brain, and have enormous density if fabricated in three dimensions rather than just two as is done today. But conventional digital computing has a lot going for it, it is extremely precise and repeatable, so you can build very reliable modules. ",
