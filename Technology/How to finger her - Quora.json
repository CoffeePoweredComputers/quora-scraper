            "answer_text": "Do not try to \u201cslip\u201d a finger inside a woman, since that would be sexual assault. You need to ask a woman if she would like for you to touch her before you put your hands anywhere near her genitals. It really isn\u2019t that difficult. If you are making out, you simply tell her that you want to touch her, and ask if she would like to be touched. If she says no \u2013 or if she doesn't explicitly say yes \u2013 you accept it and go back to kissing. If she does say yes, you might want start by caressing her thighs before you work your way towards her genitals. Be sure to watch and listen to your partner, and stop if you aren't absolutely certain that she is comfortable. Once you reach her vagina, you should not start by sticking a finger inside. Use a gentle touch to caress her vulva until you locate her clitoris. Ask her if she likes the way you are touching it, and change your approach if she doesn't. Do not insert any fingers until she is properly aroused and wet, or you'll cause her pain. Start out slow and with one finger only. Do not pound it into her unless she asks you to. Do not insert any additional fingers until she is comfortable with one, and remember that being stretched too much too quickly will hurt her. Fingering is not going to make most women come unless you find her G-spot, and if she happens to be one of the women who respond to that kind of stimulation, so you may want to focus more on her clitoris. If you ask for permission before you touch her, and if you encourage her to give you feedback, the experience could be pleasant for your both. ",

Don't get too forward by shoving your fingers up and into ANY orifice on her body. Just don't. Unless you want to be a creep. The fact that she's your girlfriend does not, I repeat NOT, entitle you to her body. She is not a living sex doll\u2026\u2026\u2026 Communicate with her. She's the one to tell you what she enjoys, what feels great for her. We can not supply these details, as we do not know her. We are not your girlfriend. It will be much more fun if she is in the mood, don't spoil it. ",
