            "answer_text": "4K resolution really is overkill for consumers. (Ironically, I say this as someone who is really wanting to buy a 4K TV\u2026 but I\u2019ll get to that later.) At normal viewing distances to most TVs, I doubt anyone would say that 1080p looks bad. Especially once you get into a movie or TV show, you tend to get lost in the story and characters and you\u2019re not focusing on the exact level of detail or sharpness in the screen, especially anything over 1080p. Now, the bigger your screen (or the more it fills your field of view) the more likely you are to notice 4K, so many argue that 4K is needed if you have a big screen TV. Well, most movies shown in theatres nowadays are still only shown in 2K, which is just slightly higher resolution than 1080p and less than half the resolution of 4K. (Don\u2019t believe me? Four of this year\u2019s top 5 biggest grossing blockbusters so far\u2014Beauty and the Beast, Wonder Woman, Spiderman: Homecoming and It\u2014were all distributed in 2K. Native 4K copies of these movies don\u2019t even exist.) If no one is complaining about the sharpness of these movies in theatres where the screens are absolutely massive, then why do people think they need twice that detail in their home? With that being said, with the right content and viewing setup, a resolution increase over 1080p is noticeable (but again, noticeable is not the same as needed). However, I would say anything beyond 4K would likely make no difference to the human eye in the vast majority of home theatre setups.  Here\u2019s a chart that shows the viewing distances relative to TV sizes where most people would be able to perceive the higher resolution. I don\u2019t know anyone who sits 6 feet from their 100\u2033 television. Now, this explanation has only touched on resolution to this point as that\u2019s what the question was directed at, but arguably 4K\u2019s biggest benefit (and the reason I want a 4K TV myself) is its color definition. High Dynamic Range (HDR) refers to the expanded color information encoded into the new format. The pixels in a standard 1080p signal can be any one of 16.7 million colors. That sounds like a lot, and it is, but humans are capable of seeing more color definition than that. The new HDR standard for 4K UHD signals allows for over 1 billion colors to be defined, which means that highlights and shadows can have more detail, and colors can generally be more vibrant and/or more accurate. I would guess that this is where the majority of people will notice the difference; the colors on a 4K HDR TV (provided you\u2019re watching 4K HDR content) will look more impressive and life-like, regardless of the viewing distance or screen size. Again, do we need it? I was just watching Planet Earth II on my 1080p non-HDR TV last night and I still felt it looked incredible, so probably not. But 4K HDR exists and it does technically look better (especially with the demo footage that\u2019s crafted specifically to highlight the differences), and that\u2019s what drives so many people to 4K. We almost always want better, even if we don\u2019t really need it. Edited to remove Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 from the list of 2K blockbusters as Terence Riley pointed out it actually has a 4K DI. I must have mixed up my information on that one, sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you generally have no use for the higher resolution, as you can see in following deeper answer about optimal distance, that you easy can test with your own eyes... But a UltraHD set cost about the same as a fine FullHD so don't worry about that aspect! And this answer was updated 2019-05-25 because it's one of my most read. A note to Quora... This is a direct answer on the question (a different answer would simply be missing vital info or even be wrong) originally written by me, based on my deep experience and NOTHING is copied from anyone else! And here have you first a very exact answer about the optimal viewing distance, with help of 3 great methods... 1) The first method is extra easy, made by me and also the only method that work perfect, even if you have extra fine OR bad eye sight... We begin with a special version for 4K UltraHD simply because most screens has that resolution... Stand first so incredible close to the screen, that you really can see some of the pixels and measure then the distance, between your nose and the screen... Then are BluRay films and most HD TV broadcasting max FullHD and people do normally not want to sit that extremely close to the screen (see more about that below) anyhow... So you can simply double the nose to screen distance you measure, to get the best viewing distance for FullHD and there can you truly enjoy the finest details in a Full HD picture... And that is the max distance, even with a UltraHD 4K screen, because if you move back more, will you naturally see less and less of the finest FullHD details... And then the version for a Full HD screen... Stand first so close to the screen, that you just can see the pixels and move then back 6 cm... Then can you enjoy the finest details in a Full HD picture... That is simply the optimal distance, because if you move back more, will you naturally see less and less of the finest details and if you sit closer, will you see some pixels... Yes, most people don't want the screen very close and sit actually too far away, to even see the finest FullHD details... They have normally a 55 inch TV about 300cm from the sofa, when a 55 inch screen should be max 224cm away (if you have perfect eyes) and then is it naturally impossible to see the finest FullHD details... And then have 4K or UltraHD even finer details, which naturally are even more impossible to see, if you sit too far away (as most do) and not extremely close... You must actually sit max 115cm away (with perfect eyes) from a 55 inch 4K screen to see the finest UltraHD 4K details... Which mainly means, that you never have to invest in a UltraHD player or films... And remember that most programs are shown in max Full HD anyhow... But a fine 4K UltraHD screen cost about the same as a fine Full HD and if your kids sit very close to the TV, can they naturally enjoy the extra up-scaled 4K details... And then can you also use a fine 40 inch 4K screen as a giant computer monitor (at the perfect 85cm distance) instead of four 20 inch screens *hehe* 2) If you use method one, with a FullHD screen and have perfect eye sight, will you see that the screens diagonal size in inch x 4 simply happen to be the almost exact optimal distance in centimetres (and cm x 0.3937 is inch) and if you sit further away, will you see less and less fine FullHD details... But this method work ONLY if you have PERFECT eyes, otherwise must you first move closer, until you can see some pixels and then move back 6 cm... And to see the finest 4K or UltraHD details (with perfect eye sight) must you actually sit little closer to the screen, than the screen is wide! 3) Here you have the optimal viewing distance in numbers, to enjoy the finest 1920x1080 FullHD details, with perfect eyes... Because you can see a 1mm object max 346cm away, with perfect vision and then must you move back max 6cm, to not see any pixels and max details! 15.6\" notebook screen (show FullHD pixels max 62cm away) 64cm32\" 704x396mm 27.9dm2 (pixels to max 127cm +6cm) 133cm37\" 814x458mm 37.3dm2 - 152cm or max 76cm for finest UltraHD40\" 880x495mm 43.6dm2 - 164cm or max 85cm for finest UltraHD details! 42\" 924x520mm 48.0dm2 - 172cm44\" 968x546mm 52.7dm2 - 181cm46\" 1012x569mm 57.6dm2 - 188cm49\" 1078x606mm 65.4dm2 - 200cm52\" 1144x644mm 73.6dm2 - 212cm55\" 1210x681mm 82.4dm2 - 224cm or max 115cm for finest UltraHD details!60\" 1320x743mm 0.98m2 - 244cm65\" 1430x804mm 1.15m2 - 263cm or max 134cm for finest UltraHD details!70\" 1540x866mm 1.33m2 - 283cm75\" 1650x928mm 1.53m2 - 303cm or max 155cm for finest UltraHD details!80\" 1760x990mm 1.74m2 - 323cm or max 164cm for finest UltraHD details!87\" 1920x1080mm 2.07m2 - 352cm And an extra tip... A really fine 55 inch smart TV cost often the same as a truly excellent \"budget\" 65 inch from Sony or Samsung... Because 55 inch are the most popular size, so they are normally overpriced and many think wrongly that 65 inch are too big, so they are often under priced! But even 65 inch are too small, to show the finest Full HD details from a normal sofa position... So if you want the best, do you need a 75 inch max 3 meters away and that's why that size suddenly cost TWICE as much! And deeper info about selecting the finest TV set... Many wonder about the best TV brand and that is almost too easy to answer today... * Sony is clearly best, especially with their excellent 65 inch budget TV's and Samsung is also a very fine alternative... Then have Panasonic very fine, but normally more expensive alternatives... And there are also some silly expensive \"design\" brands, but they don't make finer screens... Mainly because the electronics for really fine picture processing, which your TV must have to show a really fine moving picture - without any irritating errors and especially with advanced upscaling (so most DVD's and even standard definition broadcasts look almost as sharp as fullHD BluRays) are very complicated to produce, or very expensive to buy... And many makers like LG don't want to pay extra for finer electronics, so LG only pay for \"rather fine\" picture quality in some very expensive models... And that is also why the otherwise amazing low cost OLED from LG have some irritating picture problems and very bad upscaling, according to many user reviews... But Sony and Samsung have already excellent picture processing technology \"in house\" so you get really fine picture processing, even in their budget LCD models and Sony have also some amazing OLED models, with WhiteOLED panels from LG and excellent Sony electronics inside, which give you the absolute finest picture quality today and they cost anyhow less than LG's rather fine OLED models, but they are naturally a bit more expensive than LG's budget OLED models! * Note that Samsung QLED have nothing to do with OLED and give actually not a clearly better picture than Sony and Samsung very fine 65 inch budget models, with classic LCD panels... * The LED in names, is normally the type / method of white backlight that practically every modern LCD screen have... * Then has it only been a few 1 to 4 inch TV's and game screens made of colour LED pixels... Plus three amazing TV prototypes with Sony's \"Crystal LED technology\" which mainly are colour LED pixels, but they was a lot more expensive to make than OLED so they did not begin to mass produce them... But some companies, including Samsung and LG are recently working on 75 to 146 inch \"MicroLED\" screens, which also use colour LED pixels and that technology seem to become the absolute best alternative, sometime in the future... But maybe never, at ordinary prices... Yes \"MicroLED\" work just like the first version of Organic LED or OLED with pixel groups of three colour subpixels... But the blue OLED subpixel did die twice as fast, so LG invented WhiteOLED which are groups of four white subpixels, with a colour filter over three subpixels and the last white subpixel, compensate then for the loss of light the filter create... And that also mean that every smartphone with classic OLED screens, will die extra fast.* And then have many famous original makers (as Philips) simply stop producing TV's and sold the brand name to factories in China... The Chinese company Hisense produce for example low quality sets as Sharp (who originally made the finest big screens in Japan) and Toshiba for America... And a company in Poland make the last screens (of very low quality) for the Sharp that are sold in Europe... And the Turkish company Vestel make clearly worse quality TV's for Europa, which are badged with over 30 old brand names as Hitachi, Toshiba, JVC, Sanyo and even some budget Panasonic, including the 4k CX400 model! * The same TV can also cost very different in different shops, so use always a price comparison site, even if you want to buy in a shop! * Look then for the right size, so you can view the finest details... A great TV should naturally be just like a clear window to another place and you need both perfect eyes and a 65 to 75 inch screen, to be able to see the finest Full HD details from 263 to 303cm distance... See more in my list below* Then are anyhow extra popular sizes as 50-55 inch extra expensive, compared with slightly bigger or smaller... See more about that below...* And you get normally most smart TV functions, even in a budget 65 inch TV so you get automatically that functionality without any extra cost!* Some shops try to fool you that you need 100hz or more... The truth is that some fine modern 50hz sets, handle movements very smooth and sharp... But not all 50hz sets, of course... And some older 100hz sets are actually worse than a fine 50hz set... A few shops show even special made videos to demonstrate the \"huge\" difference and sets with 50hz look then dramatically worse, sometimes even horrible... Even if exactly the same 50hz TV show movement just as nice (smooth and sharp) as other 100hz TVs, with a normal / ordinary signal, from a film or broadcast... Okay, it may still be a tiny difference, but it's practically impossible to see!* A really fine VA LCD screen must be able to show almost total black (some times after some adjustments) fine details even in dark shadows, details in white shirts and be able to produce very bright white... Any screen use to show great colours right from the front... But VA screens use to dim colours dramatically from the side... And an IPS LCD screen show rather fine colours, even from the sides BUT the \"black\" look then normally like very dark grey, instead... Except with some amazing Sony IPS screens (as mine) which anyhow can show fine deep black... And WhiteOLED combine finally the best, total black and perfect colors even from the side, but the fine are very expensive and the budget versions form LG have both some picture errors and bad upscaling!* Fine upscaling, as you find in every big budget Sony or Samsung TV with UltraHD can make ordinary TV broadcasting and fine DVD films (that not even is in FullHD as BluRay films) almost as sharp as FullHD BluRay films... But budget TV sets from LG and many others, give normally a much worse blurry result with DVD films.* Demo TV's in shops have often strange blue tint settings and too strong colors, but that can you normally adjust at home... Just change to the \"film\" or \"movie\" mode and then will you normally get the best picture.* Turn also OFF all or most of the artificial \"picture improvements\" and change to a \"neutral\" or \"warm\" colour temp setting - for a truly natural picture, that should be just like a clear window to another place...* And the best test films, to make accurate natural settings, might be L\u00e9on / The Professional, Gladiator, The Rock and Titanic. * Finally sound most modern TV speakers rather awful, so you should always connect the set to a hifi equipment or at least buy separate loudspeakers, that may be rather cheap and still give a GREAT improvement! And can you really trust my words? I got this comment from John Randall... \"Having worked for 40 years at Sony in the service side, I have yet to hear such a great report on TV\u2019s. This is very well reported and very factual. Good work and well said!\" Originally written by me, to help everyone find a finer TVAnd I'm from Sweden, so I may write slightly strange... But I hope my answer will be a great help, anyhow! ",

            "answer_text": "If your more than 5 to 6 feet away from your tv and it's 55 inch or less there is really no difference in 4K but if your a little closer and your tv is 65 inches or even 55 if your less than 5 feet then it would make a pretty decent difference. Put it this way, on a 1080P tv you can walk up to within 1 foot of the tv and see all kinds of blobby distortion (try it), but once you walk up to within 1 foot of a native 4K tv playing native 4K format, you will notice no distortion at all. It would look perfectly clear no matter how close you get even 1 inch. So yeah that is really awesome and it looks too stunning to be true, but you need to be at least within 5 feet of the decent sized tv for it to be a clear noticeable difference. Keep in mind most 4K tvs aren't just a resolution upgrade it also has HDR technology, which I describe as having 4 times as many shades to a color (256k vs 1024k shades of red,blue ext.) it also makes it much more easier to see in dark scenes and the maximum brightness is no more than like 200 knits, HDR can go up to 2000 or more knits and so every part of the image on the screen is a different knit brightness making it look very real and diverse. Parts of your display will be very bright like the sun or sky and low lit areas will be perfectly shaded and super clear. It's so life like that you can't research it you need a 4K HDR tv running for you to examine it with our awesome human eyes and you'll forever need it in your life. There is no going back after youve fully indulged and enjoyed 4K HDR it's just beautifully amazing, and when you combine that magic with digital surround sound, with a sub woofer of course, you melt into your bed/chair and you'll wanna watch and play everything in 4K HDR, you'll hate everything else after that lol. It's like going from black and white tv to HD color tv, it's that BIG of a difference and it's only getting better. I just talked about 10 bit HDR they already have Dolby Vision 12 bit HDR out right now already with 8K tvs\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Updating my old answer now that we own a 4K (Sony) TV: We didn't get a 4K TV because we needed or would necessarily benefit from the increased resolution. Indeed, as many have already pointed out, unless you have a 70\" or larger screen at a standard viewing distance (around 9-12 feet), you probably won't notice the increased resolution; 4K content is exceedingly minimal and hard to come by; and what little content there is, is woefully compressed to a data rate below even that of a 1080p Blu-ray disc. The point is, all these issues presuppose that these are the only reasons to get a 4K TV, and I disagree. To wit, these are the reasons we got a 4K TV: we wanted something larger than our old 40\" screenwe wanted superlatively uniform backlightingwe wanted 24p support for judder-free film contentwe wanted superlative color contrast, saturation, and overall picture qualitywe wanted to adequately future-proof ourselves for at least the next 2-3 years+we wanted something in the 50-60\" size class for around $900-$1000we didn't want a curved screen (at this size class; only if we were going 70+\" perhapswe wanted either Sony or -- to our surprise after much research -- Vizio and not -- at that price point -- Samsungwe are anticipating the arrival of 4K Blu-ray in early 2016 more than streaming content such as Netflix / Comcast / Amazon Prime content due to the woefully inadequate data rates for the foreseeable futureThe only type of TV that fit those above requirements -- even excluding the matter about future-proofing ourselves -- was indeed a phenomenally priced 55\" Sony Android TV which, despite its occasionally annoying Android quirks (frequent software updates, occasional crashes and restarts, peculiar, overly-complex UI), is an absolutely incredible screen with spectacular picture quality. That said, to the point of picture resolution, obviously it is true that the current poor compression of 4K is resulting in (relatively) abysmal picture quality for current 4K content, further eliminating any possibility of really benefitting from the increased pixel count, and just as high-megapixel cameras with poor sensor quality are less good than low-megapixel cameras with superior sensor quality. But this is why I'm very much looking forward to forthcoming 4K Blu-ray discs, because despite the fact that I feel moving back to physical media (for a while) is a definite step backward, the truth is, 4K has arrived far too soon, indeed, far ahead of the necessary bandwidth to support it.

            "answer_text": "Buy 4k movies when they cost about the same as HD ones. Don't replace your media because the industry says its outdated; just start buying the new format when it becomes cost effective to do so. The cool thing about 4k over 1080p is that it has a higher bitrate, so would look better even on a smaller screen when there's a lot moving about (I can see HD DVDs break up a lot due to low bitrate sometimes, but that may be because I have an eye that is looking for it... I shoot video). It would also look better if you freeze frame, again because of bitrate Win win situation. The screen is a slightly thornier issue... I do videography, and 4k is useful to me for post production  (If I shoot 4k footage even though I only need HD output, I can digitally crop, zoom and pan in post, as well as make more accurate mattes for color correction/grading/special effects), but the thing that makes footage more cinematic is high dynamic range and not 4k.  Good high dynamic range and well exposed 1080p footage up-scaled to 4k actually looks better than 4k from consumer grade 4k cameras with low dynamic range. Cinema footage traditionally has pretty shallow depth of field, which means that a lot of the screen is actually out of focus and higher resolution do not help. In fact, if footage is too sharp, it ends up looking like video rather than film.  Film itself does not have a property called resolution - it is made out of crystals that vary is size from frame to frame, so an eyelash can be sharp in one frame, but blurred in another. This 'sharp and soft at the same time' feature of film is one thing that makes for the cinematic experience (i,e. the main reason you would buy a 4k screen). Film is not sharp in the same sense that a 4k screen is sharp. Buy a 4k TV playing 4k content only if you want a large screen without obvious pixelization, but be aware that a big high resolution screen in your room is not the same as cinema. That needs a different technology, and you've probably guessed by now what that is; high dynamic range. I'm guessing when/if that comes out, people will be blown away by it, and be looking at 4k and say 'what were we thinking of!'. The reason we have 4k and not High dynamic range is because increased resolution is easier for manufacture (its a case of miniaturization rather than something completely new). Footnote: I am writing this on a large 4k monitor screen (its my video editing rig). Computer screens are one place where 4k rocks! ",

            "answer_text": "I will go against most of the answers given for this question and say: the difference between 1080p and 4K is night and day to me. When watching a 50\u2033 TV from a distance of < 8ft, I can easily find that 4K content is way more lifelike than 1080p - and this is from compressed videos on streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, etc.). The definition is astounding to me. It's like looking through a window. All those \u201ccharts\u201d that tell you 4K isn't worth it at a distance lesser than 3\u20134 ft are either mistaken, or grossly underestimate the ability of the average human eye to perceive detail. My personal experience is in total disagreement with them. Some say that movies aren't released in 4K yet. Maybe not, but a lot of TV series have been released in 4K as of today, December 2018 (some examples are Black Mirror and Jack Ryan). Netflix and Prime Video have a lot of them. So the statement \u201c4K content isn't available yet\u201d is bullshit and not true anymore. This isn't to say that 1080p is not good enough. It's great. It's immersive. Especially if you aren't used to 4K content yet. And if you're sitting at a distance of > 8ft from a 49\u2033 - 50\u2033 TV, maybe the difference would be hard to recognize. If you already have a TV that's 1080p, you don't necessarily need to spend for a 4K TV yet. But if you're planning to buy a new TV or upgrading from a 720p (HD Ready) model, get 4K. It's definitely future-proof and worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideal pixel size is 150ish pixels per degree. From here we can determine that we have both already reached a point of it not mattering, and also still have room to grow. Tv's are getting larger at economical prices. A 4k resolution is great above 60\u2033 and could be better. You don't need 4k or more for small screens like laptops and small tv's. So as long as screens grow, the resolution should as well. Then there will be a point where larger screens aren t practical and we just make better quality images. Then we reach the point of finding other ways for better picture when resolution has no more value. It's hard to say what that is because there is no standard size tv and viewing distance. But doubling resolution again will pretty well do it for consumer size screens. I have an 88\u2033 4k sammy and it's perfect. If it was 1080, or God forbid 720, it would be unwatchable entirely. Even 720 on a 50 is poor, but would be perfectly fine on a sub 32. See the issue here? If you watch your tv closer than you should, then higher resolutions are even more important. Color, speed, and accuracy will dominate when there's no reason to increase resolution. It isn't the resolution that is as important as pixel size so the objective will be to get pixels the size of a 4k laptop monitor on a 120\u2033 screen. Once you're there, and have stuff to watch of course, there's no point going beyond for anything besides business gimmicks. For what it's worth we will likely see 16k resolutions in consumer sized products. I wasn't stating that it won't happen. Just that it's not really needed. ",

A 1985 Ford Escort and a 2016 Ford Fusion will both get you to work, but saying you won\u2019t be able to notice the difference is a bit much for me. I have a Samsung Q8 4K TV and to say it is the same as my old 1080p TV which I loved is an insult to my senses, my charismatic TV and just the world of critic in general. The color combination created by 4K is over 2 million colors, so it is more colors than your eye can see which is why they call it true color. The myth that 4K or 8K is to much for the eye to see is not true. Get some content that is 4K. Go to within a foot and a half of your TV. On flat planes of white or light blue, on the edge of letters, on straight edges of color can you see pixels? If you can than that\u2019s 1080p or HDR. If you\u2019ve seen Avatar you know the aliens have blue skin and wear leather outfits. On a 4K QLED, they are actually blue with faint darker blue stripes, inside arms are lighter blue with little white energy points. Thanos in Avengers has fake pores in his nose. None of this is earth shattering, but it is fun. Science does not have a measurement for how well you can absorb 4K visuals, but be quite assured you can easily notice the difference. Also be assured that a 1080p TV is also enjoyable, but you can see the difference. I worked at Best Buy selling TVs and had people not buy 4K but after showing the differences some said it wasn\u2019t important but everyone could tell. I\u2019m sure 8K will be even clearer, how close you sit and refresh rate or Hertz will also be important, but the myth that TVs resolution is getting too good to matter or see is not true. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to your question is \"yes\". Let me start with your details: At what point does increased resolution make no difference to the human eye? At about 160 pixels per degree of field-of-view. Brightness has some effect on this, as our eyes are more sensitive when in the dark (and adapted).  If you are looking straight ahead, you have about 180 degree horizontal field-of-view (HFOV) and about 120 degree vertical field-of-view (VFOV). So how does this threshold apply to different viewing situations? Let's say you're a VR headset maker and want to build a headset that will fill 120 degrees H and 60 V, and make me feel completed immersed without any visible pixels.  Your display would need to be 19,200 pixels x 9,600 pixels. I have a 24\" computer monitor that I just measured as being 26\" away from my brow. This equates to filling 44 degrees HFOV, which would equate to about 7,000 pixels horizontally.  How about your local movie theater?  THX says the ideal HFOV for a theater is 36 degrees.  That equates to about 5,800 pixels across.  In my living room I have a 47\" TV that I sit about 9 feet from.  The TV is filling about 25 degrees HFOV, which (purely by coincidence) equates to 4,000 pixels. My experience has been that when people see proper UHD TV for the first time they often think it's 3D (without glasses), or they say it's like looking out a window.  The spacial (horizontal/vertical) resolution is one reason for this. (Other reasons are increased color gamut and increased temporal resolution.) Let me answer a slightly different question:  Do we need UHD television? Yes, and here's why, in addition to the resolution boost talked about above. The HDTV standard is defined by Rec. 709 .  It says what is legal and what is \"outside spec\" for HDTV.  All the pieces of technology in the HDTV pipeline follow this spec.  UHD is defined by Rec. 2020 The color gamut defined by Rec 709 is small, and most LCDs can get away with 6-bit (18bpp) color, UHD's color gamut requires 12-bit (36bpp). Rec 709 defines frame rates up to 60fps.  Rec 2020 defines framerates up to 120fps.  (Framerate makes a bigger difference to perceived viewing quality than resolution.) Rec 2020 also gets rid of interlacing, an artifact left over from analog television. ",

            "answer_text": "Do we need 4K video? At what point does increased resolution make no difference to the human eye? It all depends on your eyesight, the size and quality of the television, and the distance you watch it from. I grew up watching B&W primitive CRT tube televisions with snowy images and vertical roll. I was used to watching bad TV and that was fine, because I had not seen better. I get 20/20 vision in one eye and about 20/40 in the other with glasses. As technology advanced, I resisted getting the latest. It was only when 1080p plasma televisions came out that I asked myself, \u201dWhat am I doing?\u201d I saw them lined up in a showroom for myself. \u201dI CAN see a noticeable difference, and it\u2019s sharp!\u201d I had to get one. A year or so ago, I needed to replace a television and since 4K\u2019s were out and affordable, I got a 43\u2033 Sony Bravia (because I fit it in a cabinet) and between 5\u201310 feet, it\u2019s dazzling when showing 4K content. I often walk up to the screen to see all the sharp background details and the individual hairs on people\u2019s heads, though after I settle in for most programming, I forget about the TV picture. I do notice how much sharper the 4K image is over the 1080p. Although, I personally probably wouldn't be able to tell much further difference, unless the screen was bigger. However, 55 and 65\u2033 screens now are now common in so many homes. So I can envision a market for a jump to 8K, especially if the prices stay in line. OTOH, increased detail is not always good. Bad skin on sports players faces can be revolting. ",

            "answer_text": "4K all depends on the size of the screen. In some cases it does make a difference and in others it doesn\u2019t. The thing you\u2019ve got to remember is how much detail a human eye can see. It can see a lot but there is a limit. Now all 4K means is the screen has a lot more pixels on it than a HD screen. A HD screen has 1920 x 1080 pixels so that means the picture is broken up into 2,073,600 squares. A 4K picture has 3840 x 2160 pixels - so that means the picture is broken up into 8,294,400 squares Ok so now let\u2019s put that into a screen sizes on different devices - we\u2019re going to assume all devices are 16:9 ratio a 3\u2033 mobile screen at 16:9 would be 2.6 x 1.5 inches wide - so the screen would have an area of 3.9 sq inches which would mean that each square inch would contain 531,000 pixels in HD or 2.1m pixels in 4k. so now we\u2019ll do the same for a 7\u2033 tablet\u2026 7\u2033 - 16:9 - 6.1 x 3.4\u2033 = 20.74 sq in so therefore each square inch in HD would now contain 99,900 pixels, in 4K it would contain 399,922 pixels per square inch.. 15\u2033 laptop screen - 13.1 x 7.4 = 96.94 sq in - HD = 21,390 ppi, 4K = 85,562 ppi 28\u2033 TV - 24.4 x 13.7 = 334.28sq in - HD = 6,203ppi, 4K = 24,812ppi 42\u2033 TV - 36.6 x 20.6 = 753.96sq in - HD = 2,750ppi, 4k = 11,001ppi IMAX screen - 108ft - 1128in x 636in = 717,408 - HD = 2.8 pixels per inch, 4K = 11 pixels per inch. Ok so maybe the IMAX screen was a bit over the top - but it just goes to show how resolution works. A smaller device like a mobile phone might not need 4K resolution as you\u2019d have to cram in 2.1m pixels for every square inch of screen but on an IMAX screen however each square inch of the screen would only have 11 pixels. So resolution is all relevant to the size of the screen - the bigger the screen the more resolution you need (and btw IMAX certainly doesn\u2019t use 4K - a number of standard cinemas are now using 8K -plus they use special lenses as well to smooth off the pixels) ",

            "answer_text": "Increased resolution alone may not make a significantly noticeable difference to the human eye, specially if one upgrades from Full HD( 1920x1080) to 4K. For instance, a 4K upgrade from Full HD may not be worth it if one usually sits more than 7 feet away from a 55\" TV. However, a 4K upgrade is not just about increased resolution. A 4K TV usually supports HDR( High Dynamic Range). The HDR spectrum includes HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG ( Hybrid Log Gamma- the 4K broadcast standard) and other formats. These formats continue to evolve further. These formats support a wider colour gamut, deeper colour depth, greater brightness and contrast. The end result is incredible picture quality. You may note that some of the budget HDR TVs lack a wide colour gamut. One must look at the 4K TV specs carefully, should one choose to get one. Currently, Netflix offers around three hundred or more movies/ TV shows/documentaries in 4K Ultra HD/Dolby Vision. One needs a stable internet download speed of 25 Megabits per second to stream Netflix 4K ultra HD content. Amazon prime, YouTube and others too have several 4K HDR videos. Coming back to your question, 4K HDR/ Dolby Vision titles no-doubt make a difference to and are a delight to the eyes. They are more impactful than the titles in Full HD not because of the increased resolution(4K) alone but also because of the HDR capabilities supported by the TV. ",

            "answer_text": "4k is mostly a waste but not just for the fact that most people can't appreciate it. Appreciation is a difficult thing and of course when you do some tests people find it better, but these tests don't test just resolution. The EBU ran objective, scientific tests with just resolution and found that most people struggle to see 1080p HD at normal viewing distances and screen sizes. Experience as someone in the business has shown me that many people don't know the difference between SD and HD.  You're welcome to vehemently disagree with the above paragraph based on mathematics, or your own anecdotes. But the EBU tests were done on neutral ground without worrying about manufacturers. And the part about consumers not noticing HD/SD is experience shared by myself at one of the largest manufacturers and also by one of Europe's largest pay TV providers. Your choice to believe it or not. For me, the main reason I see 4k making a difference is that irrespective of simple perception we are delivering more bandwidth. Triple the bandwidth is always going to give some benefit. Most consumer 4k is not suitably aspirational enough, insufficiently powerful to make a real difference. Only Phase II UHD will make a real difference to origination of content at higher quality, but still we will struggle to give consumers much becuase the average person just can't appreciate it. ",

            "answer_text": "We don't need it, but it will be (subtly) better. Glyn Williams has already given a great answer as to what we can resolve, but there are two key reasons why we'll end up with it. 1: We don't sit close to the screen at home, but we do when we shop Go into a shop where they sell TVs. Yes, yes, I know they sell them on the Internet, but let's for a moment assume that you actually want to see what you're buying rather than just read tech specs or reviews - with TVs this is actually a good idea. Don't look at the TVs - look at the customers. Look where the sit to watch. Is it that couch that the retailer has positioned about 9' from the TV? Or does the couch not actually exist, because the shop you've chosen is a mainstream chain rather than a decent specialist? Doesn't matter, because at some stage in the viewing process, that prospective customer is going to walk close enough to the biggest 1080p screen in the shop and see the pixels. At that point they're going to think \"that looks crap.\" And the nice salesman is going to steer them to look at the 4k screen, and they WILL see a difference. They won't think about the difference they would see were the TV in their home, and were they on their couch. They'll think about the difference they can see, here and now. And they'll think that the 4k TV is better.  2: There is actually, though a subtlety about TV viewing sizes beyond angular subtention. Imagine a pair of 1080P TVs. One of them is a 32\" model, and is 64\" (5'4\")) away from you. One of them is a 40\" model, and is 80\" (10' 8\") away from you. Which looks bigger (takes up more of your field of view)?  Actually, they're both the same... ... until you move your head forward an inch, like you do when you sit \"still\" to watch TV.. The effect is subtle, but it's there. Moving your head closer has moved you 1/32nd or 1/40th nearer, and therefore had a smaller proportionate effect on your ability to feel engaged. Sitting 80\" from a 40\" TV is a slightly better experience than sitting 64\" from a 32\" TV... ... and so on up the curve. Having an 80\" TV lets you sit twice as far again, and therefore move your head twice as much, before the differences are as big... ... so, yes, there is a subtle way in which bigger really is better, which combined with point 1 above, means that we'll buy them.  We don't need them. My grandmother lived the last couple of decades with a Black and White 12\" telly, and was happy until the day she died... ... but \"need\" isn't part of the equation when it comes to buying TVs. ",

            "answer_text": "We need 4K video but not for the reason why most people think. With 4K video comes a lot better video compression. 4K videos tend to be compressed with less loss which allows for more details to be shown in action sequences. 4K content also appears to be supporting higher refresh rates in comparison to 1080p content - 1080p content tends to top out at 24fps while 4K content is heading for 60/120Hz territory. 4K content has also seen the rise of HDR which allows for better colour and brightness representations. As for the resolution, well, it is a matter of your screen size, the distance you sit from it and how good your eyes are. My eyes are very average and I can make out the pixels on a 34\u2033 3440x1440p monitor at 2ft. Personally, I think 4K is worth it. 8K won\u2019t be worth it on anything smaller then around 75\u2033 but the additional benefits gained by 8K may make the leap something we all want to do as well\u2026 :\\ ",

There\u2019s no reason to stick to NTSC\u2019s 480i, or 720p, or 1080p, just because someone might think those standards were \u201cgood enough.\u201d I don\u2019t buy new equipment just because a new technology is available, and no one is required to. Blu-ray has been out for many years, but I\u2019ve never bought into it because I never saw the point. I still use a 1680x1050 monitor, and before that I used a CRT, because my work is more easily done on a 16:10 or 4:3 aspect ratio than on a 16:9. If 4K is something that interests you, then buy into it. If you don\u2019t see the point in investing in the technology, then it\u2019s not required. The 1080p standard will be with us for years to come. ",

However there are instances where 4K is not only useful but it also enhances the video.  Personally, due to the current cost, 4K is out of reach for me and my customers so it is not considered a *need* for me but when you look at the difference HD has made to Nature videos a move to 4K is a natural progression. As Andy Schneider also mentioned the 4K makes a difference for larger screens which are making their way into stadiums, arenas and even large churches. There are uses for 4K video; how long before it falls into the hands of common men and becomes a need is hard to say. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Unless you are way into watching a select few movies in cutting edge formats, you won't find that much entertainment content distributed in 4k.  Also, you need a big screen or projector to really tell the difference, especially at reasonable couch to TV distances. You're better off with a big nice 1080p set.  Right now I see 4k as mostly a production format, with some corporate presentation display applications as well. If you do have giant screens, it can be very cool.  Overkill for the living room for several more years. Save up for an oculus rift instead... ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on 3 things: The size of the screen, the distance you are sitting from it, and how good your eyesight is. Up close, a 4K screen can look quite stunning, especially one that\u2019s 70\u201d or more. However, seeing it up-close in the store is one thing, and sitting 12 feet away from it at home is another. It does hit a point of diminishing returns in terms of perceived resolution. Actually, you might find the most notable bump in quality comes from high dynamic range. For this purpose, you\u2019ll want to find a screen that is not only HDR capable, but Dolby Vision capable as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Graphs like this are misleading because they plot out the maximum benefit line.  So when it claims that you need to be sitting at 4 feet to get benefit from a 65\u2033 4K TV, that\u2019s the distance at which you get maximum benefit. Your eyes will no longer see additional detail beyond that resolution at 4 feet. But it doesn\u2019t mean you get no benefit if you sat 6 feet from that 65\u2033 4K TV. It simply means that you only get 1.5 times improvement over a 1080P (2K) at 6 feet instead of 2X benefit sitting at 4 feet or less. It is a sliding scale in terms of benefit. For me I sit 3-feet from a 40\u2033 4K TV because I use it as a primary computer monitor. I get a ton of benefit and I can still see some small pixels on high contrast lines in CAD type drawing applications. So at 3 feet I could actually benefit if I had a 6K 40\u2033 TV. The chart above that people typically cite claims I can\u2019t benefit from 4K 40\u2033 unless I sat 2 feet away and I know that\u2019s false. ",

            "answer_text": "The leap towards 4K (width) or 2160p (height) is similar to what Apple did by doubling each pixel to make a Retina display. The goal is to make the screen mesh disappear, and not shrink everything on screen so you get 2160 fine lines of detail. In this comparison between the iPad 2 and iPad Retina \u2014 This is basically what it feels like replacing a 10-year old FullHD TV with Ultra HD.  With Windows 10, when a particular display supports 1920x1080 pixels, the desktop scaling is automatically set to 125% to compensate for text size. With the iPad\u2019s 2048x1536 display size, the zoom factor was effectively 200%. ",
