            "answer_text": "First of all, all those Africas don't exist and you should add Wakanda to the list. They are pre colonial groupings. All those communities are part of one or more modern African nations, today. Their environments were very different. Nilots were great fishermen that settled along rivers and lakes. Bantus were exceptional farmers, like Hobbits but much taller. Cushites were raiders that roamed semi-arid Africa. Khoi-San is a group of desert folk that adopted to the harsh environment quite impressively. They all deserve acknowledgement for being them. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No, yes because most Bantu people live in Southern Africa which happens to be more developed than most other parts of Africa. But then No because all this development and being advanced was not truly brought by us we happened to be colonised by the brits and germans so we developed because they wanted to have stable colonise etc. Since it was not work of our own doing it cannot be said that Bantu Africa is more developed than any other group.
