            "answer_text": "No, it isn\u2019t theoretically possible to make a real lightsaber. Nothing about it as a weapon works. Even a real-world plasma cutter, which is about the closest equivalent to a lightsaber as you\u2019ll find, needs a source of fuel, which is conspicuously lacking on a lightsaber. Otherwise the magical crystals that are supposed to make the whole thing work aren\u2019t grounded in any real-world material science. Hooking a couple of leads from a battery into a rock doesn\u2019t make a plasma blade. Rather, it tends to cause absolutely nothing to happen. I can go on for a really long time about all the ways that this doesn\u2019t work, and I\u2019ve gone at greater length about it before, but suffice it to say that if you learn even just a little bit about real-world chemistry, material science, and physics you\u2019ll start to realize how little about most sci-fi or fantasy materials and pseudo-technology actually makes sense. We\u2019re talking stuff that gets debunked by a basic High School understanding of any of these topics, to the point that the rationalization offered by the in-universe text might as well just be \u201cit\u2019s magic.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "No. The problem is the lightsaber\u2019s ability to produce a magnetic field to contain the plasma. Furthermore, we still aren\u2019t entirely sure what is used to contain all the heat that plasma emits! Think about this, realistically, if someone were to activate a lightsaber, they and everyone and everything in their immediate vicinity would immediately combust into flames! Plasma is thousands upon thousands of degrees, with no really known way to keep the heat contained to the blade itself. I have theorized that the magnetic field not only shapes the plasma, but also works as a heat shield to anything not touching the blade. But again, we don\u2019t know how to build a field such as that. We know about plasma, we use it sometimes. But the technology required to create containment fields, magnetic or otherwise, is far beyond our reach, currently. There\u2019s also an issue with power, but that\u2019s a whole other headache\u2026 ",
