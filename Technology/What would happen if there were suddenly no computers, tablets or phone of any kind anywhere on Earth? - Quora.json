            "answer_text": "What would happen if there were suddenly no computers, tablets or phone of any kind anywhere on Earth? The simple answer: Civilization collapses. Rural areas in poor countries don\u2019t collapse quite as badly. The full answer: You may end up wishing that it was *only* \u2018Civilization collapses\u2019. WHY are there suddenly no computers? Where did they go? What made it happen? There\u2019s several ways to approach it. First, the handwave; \u201cOh, ignore the laws of physics, it just happens\u201d. OK- so the Magic Queen stops by the planet, sprinkles Magic Anti-Computer Dust on everything. Unfortunately, this dust has a side effect of turning everybody into a My Little Pony. Second, attempting to come up with a reason why. Aliens have invaded, and are taking all our computers as part of their subjugation plan. So how do they do it? How do they find them all? How do they enforce their edict and track down computers that have been hidden from them? There\u2019s a transistor-eating bacteria. Probably going to be collateral damage, as it eats other stuff that\u2019s similar to the silicon in transistors. If it can also eat silicon dioxide, we\u2019re screwed\u2026.. For these \u201cwhat if\u201d problems, usually the immediate answer is nowhere near as interesting as the \u201cand how did this happen?\u201d issues\u2026. ",

First of all power would stop flowing as most power companies use computers to regulate power flow. water would also stop since water pumps are also computer controlled. All EFI cars would stop since they can\u2019t work without their computers, most newers planes would not respond to controls, financial transactions, calls to 911 , etc.. EVERYTHING would stop working. It would be apocaliptic in a strange way. There would be places that would have no problems with that, specially rural areas where computers are rarely found now. ",
