I can think as hard as I can about the problem of cancer, but I\u2019m not going to be the one to solve the problem. Did I waste my time? The power of the unconscious mind also matters to me. The inspiration/perception that led to the discovery of the double helix shape for DNA was the result of a dream had by Dr. James Watson[1]. There are many examples of how unconscious processes led to scientific advancements[2] [3]. \u201cThinking hard\u201d is a solution for certain kinds of problems, but it\u2019s not a solution for everything. Sometimes, it is more important to think with less effort and more insight.

If I don\u2019t have any bricks, no amount of time or effort will see me building a house. It\u2019s the same with thinking. If you have all the information, you can eventually come up with an answer. If you don\u2019t have all the information, you won\u2019t, or you\u2019ll come up with something very different (or, at best, a partial answer - I can still build half a house with half as many bricks).
