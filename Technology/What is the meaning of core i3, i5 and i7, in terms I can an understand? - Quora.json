            "answer_text": "For the sake of simplicity, I will describe the Intel lineup of processors. \u201cCores\u201d are basically processors that can work together to accomplish more, faster. \u201cThreads\u201d are how many cores the processor thinks that it has. Telling the processor to think that it has more cores than it actually does can make it faster in some cases. Celeron processors are commonly found in Chromebooks, and low-end computers to reduce the cost of manufacture. 10 and 11 inch laptops normally have these processors, and they are normally for web browsing, and basic word processing. They commonly have 2 cores and 2 threads. Pentium processors are commonly found in Windows laptops, independent in size. They are again great for web browsing and word processing tasks, and are also low-cost. They have 2 cores and 2 threads. Core i3 processors are found in low to mid cost laptops, and are good for somewhat more advanced tasks, such as making spreadsheets, slideshows, and advanced word processing. They have 2 cores and 4 threads. Core i5 processors are good for lots of tasks at a time, and they can be used for mid-range gaming, when paired with a system that is graphically capable of gaming. These are found in mid to high priced systems. They are commonly found in offices, for lots of productivity tasks. They commonly have 4 cores and 4 threads, but in some laptops, they have 2 cores and 2 threads. Core i7 processors are meant for a heavy workload, or heavy gaming. On a desktop, they have 4 or 8 cores, 4, 8, or 16 threads, but in a laptop, they can have 2 or 4 cores, and 4 threads usually. Intel Xeon processors are mostly used in servers and they have an insane amount of cores, like 16 or something. They are designed for servers, and are very rarely in laptops. They can also be put into 3D modelling computers, but rarely, people have these in their home. If this helps you, I am writing this on an Intel Core i3 laptop, that I mostly use for MS Office, and web browsing at school. It performs well for these tasks. ",

            "answer_text": "In the simplest terms, i3, i5 and i7 are three grades of computer processors, the lowest being of the three being i3 and the highest being i7. (there are actually a lot more processor grades, but the question was asked for only these three, and these three are the most well known.) Now comes the actual features that set the three apart from each other. I will start with the i7 because it makes the i5 and i3 easier to explain. The i7 generally is faster clockspeed (has more GHz, making it faster) and generally has more cores than the i5 and i3 (more cores = better multitasking and processing power). It also has two features that sets it apart from the two lower end processors: hyper-threading and turbo boost. Hyper-threading allows the processor to turn each of it\u2019s physical cores into two virtual cores called threads. Turbo boosting allows the processor to push past it\u2019s base clockspeed depending on how much processing power is required. For example, if the base clockspeed is 4.0 GHz, and your running a very intense game, turbo boosting would push the clockspeed to 4.5 GHz. these are the two major features that i7 has over the i5 and i3, but better processor = big price tag.i5 generally has slightly lower clockspeed than an i7, but more than an i3, and it generally has more cores than an i3, but less than an i7. The i5 has turbo boosting enabled, but it does not have hyper threading enabled. Middle to high price tag, but my personal opinion is that the i5 line has the best output for price, if you find a good i5 processor.i3 generally has the lowest clockspeed of the three, and the least amount of cores. It has hyper-threading eneabled, but no turbo boosting. Unless you are on a very tight budget, or onl6 use a computer for web surfing, an i3 is something you should stay away from. This is simply my opinion though.Keep in mind that I said \u201cgenerally\u201d when talking about clockspeed and cores, because the lines can be blurred when saying \u201can i7 has faster clockspeed than an i5!\u201d An i7 with 8 cores will almost surely have lower clockspeed than an i5 with 4 cores, but the i7 will be more powerful than the i5 due to the larger amount of cores. Although there is more nitty gritty stuff to say about processors, this is a basic rundown of i3, i5 and i7. Hope this helps!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Stranger! The Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 are models of Intel processors. When you see a sticker on the front of a PC case showing one of those it gives you a general idea of what to expect from the CPU\u2019s performance. The Intel Core i3 processor family are CPUs focused at the value-end of the performance spectrum. These are CPUs that are lower cost and are lower performing. Good for browsing the web, and doing basic computer tasks, but not great for medium and heavy workloads, etc. The Intel Core i5 processor family are CPUs targeted at the mid-range performance/price point. These processors are great for general PC use and will do basically everything you need a PC to do. And that leaves us with the Core i7 CPUs. Intel considers these chips to be the higher-end of the range. The only CPUs higher are the Core i9 CPUs, which are very expensive compared to their lower-numbered family members. Keep in mind that the i3,5,7,9 designations are used with all the modern generations of Intel CPUs. Recently Intel announced the 10th generation of processors, all with the same Core i3,5,9 designation but specific model numbers behind them. E.g. Core i9-10900K, etc. In the end, the numbers really give you an \u2018at-a-glance\u2019 understanding of the performance you\u2019ll get if you were to buy that processor. Can i3 chips play games? Sure! There\u2019s more to what makes a great PC than just it\u2019s CPU, but having an understanding of it\u2019s processing power will tell you a lot about what the system\u2019s overall capability and performance is. ~Rich If you appreciated my answer and it was helpful, consider upvoting it!

If you only need Word, Excell, YouTube or other light entertainment, this is all you need. Great for grandparents, for younger kids to do their homework, \u2026 .i5: regular user. If you use your pc every day, you\u2019ll benefit from an i5 over an i3. So everyone who uses their pc professionally, or to play games or do some photoshopping in your spare time, this is the one for you.i7: professional. If you need an i7, you probably know it. Usually the i7 is fairly similar to the i5, and only specialized software benefits from its advanced features. Multimedia editing and engineering applications are the most common use cases.Be aware of the fact that this only holds within the same category: laptop processors are usually a lot weaker than desktops for example.

These CPUs are great for light gaming in 1080p, or other small tasks that doesn't require more cores or threads. the core i5 is a mid range CPU with 4 cores and 6 in the newest generation. These CPUs are great for mid-high end PCs and are good for gaming up to 1440p when paired with a good graphics card. The core i7 is the CPU for high end PCs and usually have 4 core and 8 threads, although in the newest generation it has 6 cores and 12 threads making them better against the core i5 and i3 in things like video editing, or things that are heavy on the CPU. Generally the same thing will apply for the AMD Ryzen CPUs like the Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5 Ryzen 7 and there very high end Ryzen threadripper. ",

Exp. the i3 procesors don\u2019t have turbo boost (overclocking) most of the i5 have. And so the i7 have something the i5 don\u2019t have. And so on. When looking for processor or any other computer thing. First determine you price range. Then look for the best in that price range. In processors look for bigger cache then, the number of cores and then the speed. If you are buying i5 or i7 better go for something with 4 cores than more speed. And lower the architecture displayed in nano meters, the less power it needs. (important for laptops) ",
