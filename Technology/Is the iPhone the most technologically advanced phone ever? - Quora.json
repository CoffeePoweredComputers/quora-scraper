            "answer_text": "No. Androids are, especially Samsung . They are the trend setters in the smartphone industry. They use the latest technologies and apparently some of them have not been incorporated in an iPhone yet. Curved screens, foldable smartphones and transparent devices too are all found in Samsung. iPhones have the best smartphone chip. The A13 Bionic chip which makes it the fastest smartphone but that\u2019s just one feature compared to tonnes that Samsung has over iOS in terms of technology. All these new features in iPhone, were already there in Samsung devices like two or one year back. What Apple does they improvise the small already existing features to fit their loyal customers who of course we will all say it\u2019s a new feature but only in the iPhone. ",

If you take mobile cameras in mind then Google did its job with HDR+ processing and changed the way mobile softwares for cameras and image processing was treated. ",
