            "answer_text": "Like everything else, it depends how we treat sth or how we approach to sth. For example; imagine you have bought samsung smart house, it can spare you hours of cooking, cleaning, turning around, walking\u2026 So you will have a plenty of time for stuff you otherwise simply couldn\u2019t manage to do. But there is also another approach which is simply lying on bed or sofa playing fortnite or watching god knows what useless tv shows while samsung does your chores. So it is neither forcing nor repressing you to do or not to do. It is your choice how to use tech, don\u2019t forget that. Same thing is with AI, if we let it take over all important jobs for us we will eventually lose our entire world. That\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t be afraid of AI if we take care of ourselves and the AI itself properly. I hope it was helpful ;) In case you find it interesting I am open for questions or discussions or just follow me in order to see my future posts (I would be very grateful!!) ",

            "answer_text": "It does, ALL THE TIME. More than anything else, Technology has vastly improved the lives of the people affected by it. The quality of life is markedly raised, the ability to live an easier and more convenient life, the chance for future improvements in our lives becomes assured. We see it in the expansions of medical technologies as they save an increasing number of us, we see it in terms of safer, far-reaching and faster transportation, we see it in an abundance of food for affordable prices. The ability to prepare and forego disasters is also more easily dealt with. Look at the shoddy infrastructure of Haiti, when hit by an earthquake, the massive numbers of people killed. Then, look at Chile, which experienced a worse earthquake, but had a far lower fatality rate because their infrastructure is better prepared by building technology. It still requires a willingness to prepare and properly use technology for the benefits it can reap. Houston has a proclivity for flooding because it is overwhelmingly paved over, very little in flood plains or prepared areas for water to drain. Its a very basic technology to provide for rapid flood drainage unless it is not even implemented. The lives of people in Houston would be vastly improved if they were not so devastated periodically by flooding. ",

Of the two, she rules or your God is kicking our butts for stupidity, intentionally for what we are doing to his creation, and giving His son credit for all of His work. Technology depends on how it\u2019s used and for what purposes. Mankind controls its own destiny and blames its ignorance on divine actions. If you touch fire, you get burned, God has nothing to do with your ignorance in that case. We are constantly, we think, improving our lives using it, until some hacker empties our bank account. There is always and always will be a trade off. We call that humanity. ",
