            "answer_text": "Time is the rate and duration of an observed - and measured - event. It\u2019s just assigning a numerical value for the measurable intervals composing the sequence, it is not a physical thing in itself that can do anything much less fluctuate. But I think I might correctly guess what you could be referring to, which is gravitational time dilation? If so, yes, they strength of the gravitational field determines the magnitude of the change in the rate of actions occurring in the field; that\u2019s the essence of general relativity. The exact range or spectrum of rates have not been determined. One of the problems with the theory is infinities. Where gravitation is generated by the collapsed remnant of a neutron star - a so-called \u201cblack hole\u201d, the condition is so extreme that general relativity might not be applicable anymore. No one seems to take the singularity seriously as a real, physical, tangible thing, yet there it is, right in the field equations, when one works back toward the center of the field. Whether this numerical value that\u2019s of interest to you can be referred to as a fluctuation or as a pressure gradient (that\u2019s how I refer to it), may be a matter of linguistic preferences.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you mean by this question. Maybe Jeffrey Werbock has answered it. But maybe you\u2019re talking about the Equation of time - Wikipedia, the difference in solar noon from one day to the next. In the course of the year, the time when the sun is at its highest point varies by 30 minutes, 39 seconds. For example, today (15 March 2019), solar noon will be at 13:08:58. One hour of that is due to DST, but the 8 minutes, 58 seconds are due to the equation of time. Tomorrow it will be at 13:08:41, fully 17 seconds earlier. And on 15 October it will be at 12:45:50, 23 minutes earlier. These fluctuations are one reason why we don\u2019t use solar time any more. ",
