            "answer_text": "Modern Lithium-Ion batteries used in cell phones contain a chip that is used to control charging of the battery. It also monitors the temperature of the battery to prevent overheating under normal conditions. Leaving it plugged in continuously does not harm the battery because of the intelligence inside the battery casing. Discharging any battery too deeply does degrade the battery because of the chemical process that happens when a battery is deeply discharged. For that reason the chip inside the battery also protect the battery from fully discharging before disabling the battery. Recharging at 40% is a great threshold for Lithium-Ion batteries. Other battery chemistry\u2019s vary in how far they should be discharged for optimal performance but fully discharging is not good for any battery. Cheaply designed battery chargers used with Ni-Cad and Lead Acid batteries are usually the bigger reason for short battery life than the battery itself. These cheap chargers continuously charge the as fast as possible for as long as they are connected. Sadly enough even some laptops have poorly designed chargers in an application where the norm is for the device to be plugged in a high percentage of the time. Modern cell phones are small, need a high energy-density power source, and the cost of the electronics in the device is a small portion of the manufacturing cost. The greatest cost is for licensing of the technology used in the phone. This means that not spending 50 cents to implement an intelligent battery charger is not an option. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Battery memory problems (or more accurately, voltage depression) is an issue primarily for older and now rare NiCad batteries (the newer NiMH and LiOn are also affected but by much less; NiMH are commonly seen as standalone rechargeable AA batteries and LiOn are inside Laptop batteries and the larger 18650 batteries you put in an e-cigarette). Your phone uses none of these. It (and other thin/light devices, such as some very thin laptops and RC drones) use LiPo batteries. LiPos have issues if you have left one discharged for a long time (such as an unused and fully drained phone you go back to after 6 months, or some second hand phones you might pick up from the \u2018bay). You need to charge it for (typically) overnight for a couple of days to bring it back up to normal. The battery will get fatter in the middle when it is on the way out and can damage your phone in this state, but you will know by then anyway (the phone will stop holding charge for more than a couple of hours well before then). The one thing you should never do is to ignore the fact that your phone keeps its charge for much less time than it used to. If you phone used to reach 15% in a day and a half, but now barely makes half a day, you should get the battery changed. The battery will be by now be starting to expand inside the phone, causing a fire hazard and/or causing internal phone damage. ",
