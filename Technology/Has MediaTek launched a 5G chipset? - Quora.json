            "answer_text": "While Snapdragon and Exynos processors were able to get ahead of MediaTek in terms of 5G chip, but MediaTek now has come back strongly. Everyone has been waiting for a flagship chipset from MediaTek and finally we have the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 5G. This will go up against the likes of the Snapdragon 865 and Exynos 990. This is based on 7nm technology, a first from MediaTek. This makes power-efficient and powerful, as a mobile processor can be. Now, let\u2019s talk about the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 phones that will arrive in 2020. Also, we have discussed the best features of the world\u2019s most capable MediaTek 5G Chip. MediaTek Dimensity 1000 SoC Brings 5G to Everyone In the Dimensity 1000, MediaTek went with an architecture called the little-big architecture to form the CPU with eight cores in total. This includes four high-performance Cortex A77 cores clocked at 2.6 GHz, and four power-efficient cores all clocked at 2.2 GHz. Moving on to the GPU, we have the latest Mali-G77 MP9, which can easily run any graphics-intensive game with ease. We have five cores to handle APU related tasks, and the company claims that these five APU setups can perform 4.5 TOPs computational tasks. This five core setup consists of two high-performance cores, two medium performance cores and one efficient core. As per the task at hand, all these cores will come together to provide an optimum result without consuming much power. In the APU department too, we see the little-medium-big architecture, similar to the one in the CPU.  Here Meditek went with the Helio M70 modem for ensuring 5G connectivity on both the SIM. It is the world\u2019s first chipset to have the capacity to run 5G on Dual SIM. The Helio M70 allows for a download speed of 4.7 GBps and an upload speed of 2.5 Gbps. As compared to Snapdragon\u2019s X50 modem, the Helio M70 offers 30 per cent more coverage of network while consuming 42 per cent less battery. This is one of the reasons why MediaTek might just win the 5G war against Qualcomm next year. MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Series Powered Phones 1. iQOO Z1 5G iQOO\u2019s latest 5G smartphone iQOO Z1 5G comes with Dimensity 1000+ SoC. The Dimensity 1000 Plus (+) is the improved version (144Hz Display Support mainly) of Dimensity 1000 chipset. The iQOO Z1 features a 6.57-inch FHD+ LCD screen with 20:9 aspect ratio, 400 ppi of pixel density and 90.4% screen-to-body ratio. We get 144Hz refresh rate display support with an option to switch between 144Hz, 120Hz and 90Hz. It packs stereo speakers and a Smart PA amplifier. The device sports a 48MP (Sony IMX582 sensor) primary camera on the back and a 16MP front-facing camera. It is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery that supports 44W fast charging.  2. Oppo Reno3 5G Oppo Reno3 5G is powered by MediaTek\u2019s Dimensity 1000L SoC which is a slightly lower clocked version (2.2Ghz vs 2.6Ghz) of Dimensity 1000. The Reno3 5G packs a 6.4-inch (2400 \u00d7 1080 pixels) Full HD+ AMOLED screen. There is a selfie camera of 32MP in the waterdrop notch. It features a glass back with a gradient design and vertically placed quad-camera module. We get support for 5G standalone and non-standalone (SA/NSA) mode and sub-6GHz networks. A 4025 mAh (Typical) battery which supports 30W VOOC 4.0 fast charging powers the Reno3.  3. Redmi K30 Ultra Xiaomi\u2019s sub-brand Redmi will soon include a new device called Redmi K30 Ultra under its K30 family. A new report suggests that the Redmi K30 Ultra device might be in the works with the codename \u201cCezanne\u201d. The K30 Ultra will likely be equipped with Dimensity 1000+ processor. Other rumoured specs include a Quad camera with 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor, Amoled Display, a pop-up selfie snapper, in-screen fingerprint sensor, 4,700 mAh battery, and 33W fast charging.While Snapdragon and Exynos processors were able to get ahead of MediaTek in terms of 5G chip, but MediaTek now has come back strongly.

            "answer_text": "Has MediaTek launched a 5G chipset? I think you are just 8 months late in asking this question since Mediatek already launched its 5G chipsets in the last quarter of 2019 and as of now, there are more MediaTek 5G chipsets than the Qualcomm 5G chipsets. MediaTek launched its Dimensity 1000 and Dimensity 1000L 5G chipsets in November 2019 and they went to grab a lot of attention since these had some amazing features while the cost of these chipsets in smartphones is still in the mid-range. MediaTek launched yet another MediaTek Dimensity 800 chipset to capture the budget mid-range buyers and after this, there was MediaTek Dimensity 820 which was one of the best in the mid-range segment, beating many of its competitors. Not to forget, the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus chipset which is the best one by MediaTek till now and this makes it 5 chipsets in the 5G segment. But wait. There is more to add. Mediatek has also launched the new MediaTek Dimensity 720 chipset which is aimed towards the budget buyers and this has some amazing features too, And there are plans of launching MediaTek 600 series chipsets well in the near future, which means you can get 5G chipsets in every budget for your smartphone. Mediatek is really doing great in the 5G segment.  ",
