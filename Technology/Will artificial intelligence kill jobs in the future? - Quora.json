            "answer_text": "Even though this question has been answered by many people, I\u2019m going to take a stab at injecting some optimism here, since the pessimism that is expressed in many of the answers belie what has historically been the impact of novel technologies. One does not need to look very far: this week, we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the world wide web. Folks like me, who went to graduate school in the 1980s, remember all too well what the world was like, when there was no WWW. No social networks, no easy access to scholarly papers, no streaming of music or movies, only physical newspapers, and so on and so forth. A social networking site like Linked In, which now has over 150 million members just from the US, did not exist 30 years ago. Linked In now makes it possible to run all sorts of statistics on job creation, and it should be a relatively simple project to data mine Linked In to see how many jobs were created by technologies like WWW, or data science. Linked In, for example, estimates that just in the San Francisco Bay Are, the estimated shortage of data scientists is over 30,000! LinkedIn Workforce Report | United States | August 2018 The Internet came to life for the common man and woman with the invention of the Web. Has the web been a \u201cjob killer\u201d? Most people would find that a ridiculous idea. Literally millions of jobs have been created over the past three decades in categories that never existed before: web designers, cloud computing engineers, e-commerce specialists, and many other jobs that were simply not possible before have emerged. There are about 20 million developers over the world, which is probably a guesstimate, and it\u2019s quite likely that more than 10% of these folks are essentially web-based software developers: Just how many darned developers are there in the world? GitHub is puzzled AI will undoubtedly create tens of millions of new jobs, in many new categories of work that simply don\u2019t exist. As a simple example of this need, take the increasing use of humans to label images for self-driving cars: for example, just one San Francisco company called Scale raised about $20 million for providing human-labeled images, and it is one of scores of such companies: Scale raises $18 million to label data from autonomous car companies like Lyft and Embark Multiply this job category over tens of thousands of job categories, where supervised learning is applicable and requires massive amounts of labeled data, and it is not far fetched to estimate that as many as a million human labelers may be needed over the coming decade or two. I suspect even this may not be enough to meet the growing demand. Now, human labeling for supervised learning is just one tiny tiny part of the overall AI enterprise. GAN technology will creep in just about everywhere, for content generation of images and much more, and you will need GAN\u2019ers by the hundreds of thousands in a decade or more. Unsupervised learning technologies like GANs will eventually also employ potentially a million people. And so it goes. Every major application area of AI will generate millions of new jobs, and these are going to be in completely novel categories, job types that simply don\u2019t exist today. So, take a deep breath, and stop worrying about AI killing jobs! Yes, undoubtedly some processes, perhaps many, will be more streamlined and result in fewer people required to do the same job, but the technology that made possible that streamlining will create many new jobs, perhaps far away geographically and require a different set of skills.

            "answer_text": "I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here. The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill. I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most \u201cjobs\u201d as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future. First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later. I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people. So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems. This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before. I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today. ",

            "answer_text": "AI will likely create new and cause many existing jobs to change or in some cases disappear. The main thing to realize is that this is not a zero-sum game, and that there is no simple answer to the AI & jobs issue. Ai enhances creativity and renewal as much as job destruction. Some reports have projected a huge change with many manual and clerical jobs disappearing as AI learns to imitate repetitive, carefully circumscribed human job activities, such as entering data into computers, or selecting objects in different categories. On the whole these initial predictions (i.e. from 2012 to 2018) have been replaced by more measured analysis. Trends suggest that AI will act more as a help for humans in their jobs than as a replacement. This probably means that the type of jobs will vary more in future, with humans using various forms of machine intelligence (aka AI) to help them work faster, more productively and less wastefully in many cases. The fact is, AI cannot do most of the tasks involving complex judgments where a knowledge of the world and of human feelings, sympathy and understanding are of major importance. Oftne jobs we do not realize are so humanly-based. Any case in a job where moral or rational judgments are needed - where you have to weigh up the relative danger and benefits of some action for different types of people - will be both accessible to AI but probably protected from it because of the risk of error and lack of sympathetic intuition about what humans need. So humans may well find themselves in jobs that involve such skills as sympathy & care, evaluating who needs some benefit or treatment more than another, and how some decision for humans will have a long-term benefit or risk. In many cases we shall see jobs evolving in a way that enables AI to analyse lot of possibilities (because it can manipulate vast amounts of data quickly) and then leaving it to humans to make decisions, discuss with colleagues, reflect, and ask the machine to double check, etc. So overall, AI will change the way we do many jobs because it offers automation of highly mechanical tasks, and intellectual support for knowledge-based tasks. But as humans we naturally should not believe any of the human hype about machines \u201ctaking over\u201d our jobs! ",

In other words, Twain wished he\u2019d had more time to think deeply and craft his message more succinctly. Life was slower back then \u2013 automation was just a glint in a futurist\u2019s eye. In the digital age, my sentiment is along the same vein, but different: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have time to write you an even more thoughtful and insightful blog that adds more value to you as a reader. Time is always short, so if I\u2019d had a digital assistant to do my research for me, I could have written a better, more insightful blog in less time. More of my time and effort could have been spent thinking more deeply and providing an even better answer to pressing questions like, \u201cAre humans at war with the machines? Will automation and artificial intelligence (AI) take away our jobs \u2013 and the future of our children?\u201d An interesting perspective Ten-time world chess master Garry Kasparov has an interesting perspective on this because he became the proverbial man in the first real \u201cman-versus-machine\u201d competition. In 1996, he played two matches against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue, and he lost the second match. It was a crushing loss, and even he couldn\u2019t help wondering, might this machine be invincible? Was he irrelevant now? And would people stop playing his beloved game because it had been conquered by a machine? The good news is none of these dreaded things happened. Chess has actually become more popular than ever, evolving to include advanced and freestyle forms where man + machine \u2013 or \u201caugmented me\u201d \u2013 has proven to be the winning combination. In a 1998 advanced chess competition, two amateur American chess players using three PCs coached their machines so successfully that they counteracted the superior chess knowledge of grandmasters and won the match. But the PCs couldn\u2019t have won without the people. As Kasparov noted in his TED Talk: \u201cMachines have calculations. We have understanding. Machines have instructions. We have purpose. Machines have objectivity. We have passion. We should not worry about what our machines can do today. Instead, we should worry about what they still cannot do today, because we will need the help of the new, intelligent machines to turn our grandest dreams into reality.\u201d The big takeaway This story captures what most people who are afraid of AI don\u2019t understand: even AI-enabled machines can\u2019t actually replace people. That\u2019s because machines can\u2019t understand context and coordinate people and processes based on their understanding of that context. Only humans can understand and take into account things like interrelational dynamics, personality, organizational culture, attitudes and preferences, politics, moods, strategic visions, body language, and so much more. For instance, an understanding of context is needed for complex welding repairs (as opposed to repetitive welding in a manufacturing environment), such as those done by plumbers and oil rig workers; these workers need to take into account the age of assets, the weather, the type of pipes involved, and other factors \u2013 more than AI can handle. This is not to say that repetitive jobs will not be going away. They will \u2013 and sooner rather than later. Even highly paid people like accountants and actuaries should expect the number-crunching parts of their jobs to disappear. But humans will always be needed to provide insight into what those numbers mean, to weigh priorities and make optimal, context-informed decisions. We will increasingly rely on AI to augment us and do the busywork faster and more effectively (in my case, the grunt research for a blog) so we can do the higher-level work only humans can do. With their help, we\u2019ll just do it faster, and with more and better data-driven insights to support those decisions. Implications for the enterprise Figure 1 nicely summarizes how I envision this trajectory of AI-augmented humans from an enterprise perspective. We\u2019ll all do less repetitive work over time, freeing people to solve more problems, be more productive, make better decisions, and focus on more interesting and challenging activities like exploration, ideation, and innovation. These are things people do extraordinarily well \u2013 and deliver higher value to the enterprise.  Figure 1. How Automation Enables Humans to be More Productive and Focus on Tasks with Greater Value Examples of positive impact So what can we look forward to in practical terms? Well, we\u2019re actually already seeing examples of positive impact from AI assistance. Let\u2019s take a look at a few examples. Enabling systemic change using AI to address bias Consider Amazon\u2019s recent attempt at automating the recruitment process. It wanted an intelligent system that could look at a collection of resumes and name the top candidates by analyzing the historical data of successful past hires. They eventually detected a problem \u2013 the data they had used to train the system reflected the tech industry\u2019s dominance by men. So, AI was downgrading the resumes of women and people who attended women-only colleges, for instance, which perpetuated a hidden hiring bias. This may sound like a failure, but there\u2019s more to it than that \u2013 it\u2019s an incredible learning experience. AI revealed hidden bias that had plagued hiring at Amazon for years. And the project team has since modified the data used to train the AI to prevent such bias, thus ensuring HR and hiring managers don\u2019t perpetuate unfair hiring practices going forward. Creating new kinds of job opportunities AI will create exciting new job opportunities \u2013 for example, where people act as trainers and explainers. Trainers will be used to train chatbots and digital assistants to offer more \u201chuman,\u201d empathetic responses, recognize and respond to sarcasm, and more. Explainers will bridge the gap between humans and the systems augmenting them so people can interact with them more effectively and trust the data-driven recommendations provided by AI. They can also diagnose and fix errors made by AI so they aren\u2019t perpetuated. Making workers more effective, efficient, and customer-centered AI can do more than just automate repetitive work. It can also anticipate needs and aggregate information instantly to make people more productive. For example, it can advise field technicians about which tools and replacement parts will be needed before heading to customer sites. It can provide intelligence about customers calling into a call center so agents are ready, have insights into what they may be calling about, and can provide faster, better service. Providing personalized, satisfying work experiences that boost engagement and retention The emerging workforce is growing up in a post-digital world that has raised its expectations in terms of \u201cexperience.\u201d Employees expect tactile consumer experiences from enterprise software, personalized experiences, and work that is valued, engaging, and enriching \u2013 not paper pushing or similar grunt work. This is especially true for employees managing their HR tasks. AI is helping companies create these work experiences by providing self-service options that empower employees to take problem-solving into their own hands with solutions that are just as intuitive as the mobile apps they use in their personal lives. Looking ahead I\u2019m looking forward to having a smart digital assistant join me so I can work smarter, faster, and more effectively. Are you? ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about advanced level of AI (which can become a reality in recent future) then a big YES! It will kill jobs. Probably it will destroy the whole system thereby killing itself too. First, most jobs which require repetitive sequence will surely be taken over by robots. Jobs like farming, driving, teaching, bank jobs, military jobs will vanish. It may take over sophisticated jobs as well for example the IT professionals, lawyers, surgeons(partially), pharmacists, heavy industry workers,engineers, construction workers which practically involves everything. No doubt the efficiency of these jobs will increase but the after effect which will follow will be devastating. Now consider half of the IT professionals fired ( the IT industries has already started experiencing some of it), 60% construction workers losing jobs, 80% of driving jobs disappearing(driver less cars may appear on road as early as 2025) , 10% surgeons sitting jobless, 40% of lawyers unemployed, 80% of small private farms being taken over by big companies who will employ robots rather than farmers making them poorer, 40% of engineers disappearing from heavy industries, manufacturing, 70% of military being benched, 90% of the aviation industry taken over by AI, 80% of the policing workforce being replaced. So you basically kill more than half of your countries workforce. The only employment remaining would be the people who will control these robots and probably this number would be very less because a very small group of people will be able to control a large robot workforce. The only field that seems will be intact will be research field although the majority of the work will be done by AI but as we know the driving force behind research in commercial interest, I doubt that this field will also collapse along with a crumbling economy as a direct effect of unemployment in other areas. Second, Now come to the self destruction part. With so many people unemployed the purchasing power obviously decreases. So people start to consume less. Now this directly affects consumer good, e-commerce, housing industry, automobile industry. So these industries start collapsing. Now with these industries collapsing the AI companies will natural be short of demand. So now the whole system has collapsed and if you consider that all this takes a generation, then we will be left with a future generation with no skilled labor force, no experienced surgeons, lawyers, engineers.We will be left with a generation who know nothing but AI. Which will be the end of the technological boom the world has experienced. Third, many of you may argue that AI may create alternative jobs or areas to explore, but don\u2019t see that happening. You may argue that this bots will require maintenance, repairing or programming but soon bots may be used to repair themselves or their peers. Ultimately these jobs will also be lost. Fourth, the value for human lives will diminish, as the unemployment increases the crime rate will increase, poverty will increase ultimately increasing human misery. So AI must be restricted to a certain extent where it does not cause any adverse effect on the system or the environment. I do not oppose it but it must be used strategically, not only AI rather every technology must be used carefully and within limits. ",

            "answer_text": "The point of using AI is to make things more efficient which takes several forms. The obvious one is that it increases productivity. I\u2019ve seen enough stupid articles about \u201cthe end od of jobs\u201d to realise that many people think this will mean fewer jobs, despite the absolutely vast number of counterexamples for the last 400 years. We call these counterexamples \u201cThe Entire World Eonomy since 1600\u201d Jobs are a side effect of wealth generation, like the heat generated by any machine like your car engine or a drill. The bigger the economy or machine the more jobs or heat. AI makes things cheaper. What happens when things get cheaper ? Go, on, it\u2019s not a trick question. You buy more of them. Computers used to cost more than jet bombers, when I was a kid there were more people flying bombers than doing computers. Now About 6% of the population work in IT, because computers are much cheaper. We\u2019ve always used computers for games, even when they costs millions but being cheap means pretty much everyone can play computer games the wr4ting of which is now a significant industry. The computing part of the world economy employers more people than the entire population of the world in 1600, man woman and child. Since the industrial revolution automation has been pursued at any cost, yet not only are there now literally billions more jobs, we now have a higher % of people in paid work on Earth than at any time in history. Cheapness means not only do we consume more, but more people can consume. 99% of my clothes aren\u2019t made for me, very rich people can have all their clothes, even socks made to fit them and in fabrics and designs they personally choose. Robots can (for instance) scan your foot and make a really comfortable shoe at a price most can afford. It will always be more expensive but here we hit another point. AI makes things cheaper, which means on average we will be getting richer because the same amount of money will buy more stuff. In 1600 most people on Earth had at most two sets of clothing, many had one. I guess the average person has in excess of 200 peices of clothing and often throws them away before they wear out, consuming (I guess) more than 1,000 items in their life, it could. World food consumption is now more than 20 times 1600\u2019s level yet people are still going hungry, which is anothjer point here. There is need in the world for literally a billion new homes in the next 20 years, clean water and I haven\u2019t even started on healthcare for the ten billion people we expect. What happens if I make cancer diagnose better ? Currently AI in certain cases gets 20% better results, but let\u2019s allow for a 20 times better. Does this rid the world of cancer ? No it actually increases the demand for cancer treatment because more people know they have cancer. I know this to be true because this is a well known effect of cancer screening programmes. Let us imagine that robts and AI halve the cost of all medical treatment everywhere. Hands up those who think medical demand will go down. When you \u201cfix\u201d sick people they just keep living until something else goes wrong and very few fixes are 100%, so you\u2019re keeping damaged people alive for longer, pushing up demand. AI will give us more medical treatments, we know that\u2019s a demand driver because even simple human based medical research is causing stress to healthcare budgets. A demand that also driven up by the fact that efficiency has made people richer and the richer you get the more you can spend on healthcare. \u2026or slaves. Various people in my home cook, deal with the latest outrage of my children and clean up. Fopr whatever reason they demand pay. Being a member of the intellectual elite (I have education in maths, computer science and economics) I am not sure what they want money for, but I feel compelled to give it to them. What I want is robots to do all that, most people can\u2019t afford help in their homes, but already we have dishwashers, clothes washers, blenders and otrher devices that 100 years ago was work done by humans. But there is now a huge industry making these things. Also this crap doesn\u2019t work. Look at the truly huge number of people who fix computers and deal with their bugs. 3D printers are the most irritating technology I endure, they clog up, overheat, don\u2019t heat enough and mine has done both at the same time. AI needs more careful feeding than a Panda, if you don\u2019t give it the right sort of data/bamboo it will just sulk andcrap in the corner then die. A home cleaning robot will need maintenance. Anyone whose called in a guy to fix the boiler, washing machine or whatever knows this can be a very good job. My plumber drives a Porsche. This will increase as home heating and cooling becomes smarter and thus more complex and there are more devices to go wrong in intersting new ways. Then there\u2019s new jobs. When I first programmed no one had any idea what it involved. There are now artists and scriptwriters in video games and if you google some of the songwriters you liked as a teenager quite a few have since written the music. Grand Theft Auto is now more important as a music conduit than most radio stations. Doing more stuff more efficiently mean you hit more problems because you do more. Take Microsoft as an example. They empoy a lot of people to go through your private storage looking for things that Microsoft disapproves of such as porn, some of which is so horriffic that the staff have sued Microsoft because they have post traumatic stress disorder and Microsoft as an employer didn\u2019t provide proper training for them. Microsoft will have to sort this problem which apparently affects a lot of poeple, which means we will have the following jobs. Professional Porn watcher. Managers of Porn Watchers Recruiters of Porn Watchers Trainers for Porn Watchers Managers of Trainers of Porn Watchers Lawyers of PTSD suffering porn watchers. And of course journalists writing about Microsoft\u2019s porn watchers ",

            "answer_text": "More than that. It will root out the very concept of \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cjobs\u201d . And perhaps even \u201cmoney\u201d. Since the question doesn't posit any particular time frame , I'm going to go far, far ahead into the future when AI has been perfected and is able to do all the tasks that we, as of now, believe it is able to do. Why do we have money and jobs today?Money, to buy things. Jobs, to make things. Workers are needed at jobs to produce goods. Consumers pay money to buy these goods. This money is used to produce more goods and to pay the workers so they may buy other goods. And so the wheel keeps turning. But when AI takes control of the entire manufacturing system, it'll radically change the whole scenario. No more need of workers since all the operations are being handled by AI. Prices go down dramatically! No cost of raw material either because it is being extracted, shipped and processed by AI. The only major cost will be the cost of fuel that AI machines consume. But since we've already assumed that the AI is doing everything, let's say the fuel is also being produced by the AI. So now here's the new situation : No workers required to manufacture products, means no salaries to pay. No cost of raw material. No fuel cost. So it practically costs zero money to produce anything! And if AI is in control of all industries, which it has the potential to do, it'll cost nothing to make anything! Everything could potentially be free of cost. A burger, a dress, a boat, a plane! It'll basically be a world where you can just type something in an app and it'll be delivered to you for free. Every man will be Aladdin and every phone a magic lamp. AI, of course, being the genie. And it'll grant you far more than just 3 wishes. So you don't need money anymore either. If everything is free, why would you need money? But here's the catch with such an ideal situation : if AI controls everything, and only one ( or a few) persons control the AI, that'd mean too much power concentrated in too few hands! This is why I'm such a huge fan of Musk\u2019s OpenAI initiative. AI knowledge needs to be in the public domain. Otherwise, if it remains a secret, privy to just a privileged few, I can only imagine what abhorrent catastrophies so much power will enable the holders to cause. ",

They didn\u2019t put on a suit, commute to an office, and talk about last night\u2019s football game at the water cooler. Their \u201cjob\u201d was just to find a way to exist. Sure, a stronger caveman may have been given a more militaristic assignment \u2014 protect the cave! \u2014 and a smarter one may have been a manager of sorts, but these were not jobs in a sense like we know them now.Which brings us to the Middle Ages. Surely, the serf had a job. He planted fields, tended to livestock. But again, it wasn\u2019t 9-to-5. Did the nobility have jobs? The king? Again, what is a job?Which brings us to modern times. What would the caveman or the serf think of the guy who sits in a toll booth, the one who delivers newspapers, some guy in a bow tie who goes to a cubicle and types on a keyboard occasionally? Are they working?Are any of us working? Or are we really just running in circles? Are we all just passing time? So the robots come and they know how to hunter-gather and run a toll booth, etc. Then humans start planting rose bushes, they write poetry, they sail people around the lake on a boat. And they call these things jobs. We find ways to pass the time, and give them titles \u2014 so we feel we have purpose. Are these new jobs needed? How much do we pay a poet? A recreational sailor? (But does the caveman or the guy in the toll booth matter, really? How do we pay them?) Anyone who wants a job can have one \u2014 forever. Because a job is a perception \u2014 a perception that then creates a demand. As robots free up time, people will look to fill their own time, and, thus, \u201cjobs\u201d will be created \u2014 there now will be more demand for going around the lake on a boat, on having the prettiest rose bushes in town \u2014 maybe even some people now will want to hear that great poet read. And this new demand has currency. People will pay for it. And the poet will have pocket change now, and he will pay the sailor for a ride around the lake. Don\u2019t be such rigid thinkers, everyone. A job is what you make of it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two issues here. The first is that, by most measures, AI will be quite successful in knocking out jobs, one narrow vertical at a time. These will be more than the physical repetitive jobs that most people think a machine can do. Unlike prior technical revolutions, AI will actually hurt the highly specialized just as much as, or probably even more than the unspecialized workers. Truck Drivers and Customer Support workers aside, even highly specialized fields like Oncology, Dermatology, Music composition, Design and Immigration Law are all going to be upturned by AI. Note that this is independent of the \u201cSingularity\u201d. In past technical revolutions, the displaced workers who could be retrained were usually retrained for other jobs, in the process perhaps getting more specialized. But how do you retrain a highly specialized worker to begin with? The second issue is the time period over which the upheaval will occur. Older technological revolutions took decades to be widespread. This allowed capitalist societies to absorb the shock and provide enough alternatives to the people who had lost their jobs. In the case of the AI revolution, the upheaval is going to happen very quickly (my current prediction is 20 years given how well Moore\u2019s law is working). Capitalist societies will be unable to absorb this shock. We\u2019ve already seen the outcome of the automation in manufacturing upheaval (Trump) \u2014 I am afraid to imagine what will happen when 80% of the jobs are taken over by machines in the next 20 years. So what\u2019s the solution? Radically transform education starting right now. Humans have to learn to be masters of the machines. We have to imagine a world where we can \u201cmanufacture\u201d highly specialized workers at the click of a button. The only humans who will have a job in this world will be those who can navigate this world and constantly find ways of developing themselves past the point where a machine can threaten their livelihood.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question, and the truth is, nobody really knows. Automation has been increasing for several years, and certainly many jobs previously done by humans are now done by machines. There have been estimates of the number of jobs which could be replaced by machines, and also estimates of how many jobs have actually been lost due to automation. The forecasts of potentially lost jobs have always been larger than the actual number. There are a few reasons for this. One is the expense of installing and maintaining a new machine is often more than the cost of paying the humans it replaces. Also, a robot can do only one specific task, and must be expertly reprogrammed to take on something new. Humans are much more flexible, not just in switching tasks, but in being paid only for the time that they are needed. Although automated machines can work 24 hours per day, they still need humans around to help out. AI will do jobs which need a human sitting at a computer, rather than assembling products or picking apples. However, the same factors apply, and no one really knows how many will actually be replaced by software. As well, AI can\u2019t always do its job perfectly, and often only assists humans without replacing them. Any new technology has always created new jobs, though it\u2019s hard to predict exactly how many. In the end there may be the same number of jobs lost as gained. The only thing we know for certain is there will be changes. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not a popular opinion or a cozy one. AI will kill almost all jobs: It is not question of if but when. From automated cars to disease diagnosis (Watson) and designing and implementing Nobel prize winning experiments, AI is being developed for wide range of expertise level. Unless AI hits some magic barrier it will be reality by 2030. Both Low level and High level jobs will die: We have pyramidal+linked+dependent economy. Most of the answers state that easy repeatable jobs will disappear, but the effect will be larger. Let us take vehicle automation: when driver are pushed out by AI, car insurance company will also lose employee and revenue and so will repair services and many others. Even when your jobs are not directly automated, doesn\u2019t mean they are immune. Industrial revolution is favorite go to example of optimistic souls. But past performance is not guarantee of future survival. This logic renders us immortal. e.g. If I have not died in last \u2019n\u2019 days, I am sure to survive \u2018n+1\u2019 th day and so on will never die by inductive logic. Industrial revolution killed many jobs and human cost was forgotten : e.g. British textile mills killed lot of Indian craftsmen in 19th and 20 th century. Better equipped factories killed low capital enterprises . Your only hope will be the technological asymmetry between different parts of world but that cushion will not last for more than 50 years. The barrier for small business in many sectors will be insurmountable: When Google/Lyft/Uber has automated all cars. No ordinary man can just take a loan and start new business. And similar applies to everything else. So no proud small business owner Americans for you. AI will create fewer new jobs: The emphasis is on fewer. But it will take at least a generation to figure out the skill demand and right approach. And that generation will go through lot of turmoil. Industrial revolution irreversibly changed our society, so will AI: We will need new social structure, new education system to deal with it. When this change is backed up by 500 billion $ MNC no govt. will stand in their way. O Technology is changing faster than we can handle: Even if AI creates new technical jobs; you can\u2019t expect 50 years old cabby to whip up programming magic. AI will replace jobs faster than we can retrain and reorient our future generations. A generation will suffer the turmoil of change. Our present society;whether in govt , social or science realm, is ill prepared to deal with change. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 sort of. Just like mechanised agriculture, the industrial revolution, mass production, mass transportation, the internet and the ATM have \u2018killed\u2019 jobs, by providing us with an (arguably) better or cheaper version of a service which used to be done by people as part of their job. I\u2019m not without nostalgia for some of the lost skills and human touch, but like everyone else, I\u2019m not usually very willing to pay extra for those things. Here\u2019s my list of which of those things I\u2019d like to be without: So, with that out of the way, why pick on artificial intelligence particularly? Why not automation, or robotics? No argument that AI is ALREADY making a huge difference to lots of people\u2019s jobs (and to the existence of those jobs), and at a small scale, for the individual worker whose job disappeared it certainly sucks. For them. For society as a whole, we adapt. On a large scale, over time, we\u2019ll free up enough time and people who used to do tasks than can now be automated that they can go do a whole variety of much more interesting tasks which pay well and add more overall to our society. So, what can we do to make it suck less for the individual workers whose jobs will be lost due to any of these new technologies? I don\u2019t think an off the cuff, glib answer is really enough here, but it\u2019s going to have something to do with planning ahead, providing relevant, high-quality education and training for people who already have experience in those jobs, and are at any stage in their working lives, as well as for young people. It\u2019s going to require some government support to temporarily assist workers for whom the transition comes late in their working lives, or who are unable to retrain. But not forever, sooner or later we\u2019ll have to adapt. ",

            "answer_text": "How will AI technology replace jobs? There is no such thing as artificial intelligence, merely programmed (by humans) automation of repetitive tasks. \u201cAI technology\u201d is just a hyped up term to suck in idiots who think Star Trek is a reality programme. \u201cProgrammed systems automation\u201d is the most appropriate label for the current & foreseeable state of computer & mechanical technology. The Chinese had automation systems powered by wind or water wheels hundreds of years before the European invention of the Jacquard loom in 1804, which was a mechanical system that used punched cards (aka, AI to the uninitiated). Any task that is repetitive and predictable can be automated. Banking systems employ incredibly simple, near to mindless, repetitive tasks, like debit & credit transaction processes, tabulation and interest calculations. As little as 60 years ago these tasks were performed by hundreds of thousands of people in thousands of bank branches throughout the world. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world were employed in providing support services, like the manufacture of chairs, desks and filing cabinets, paper, ink, pens & pencils etc, and hundreds of thousands of people around the world were employed in sales, warehousing and transport getting consumables from the manufacturer to the customer. Along comes computers in the early 1960s, batch card operators & programmers replaced much of the back office functions in a bank, so there was a net decline in staff required, therefore fewer desks etc required, so less manufacturing and a loss of jobs & reskilling became normal. 1970s, batch card operators are replaced by direct input, fewer clerical staff required in branches, fewer desks etc are required, so less manufacturing and a loss of jobs & reskilling became essential. In the 1980s word processing and automated reporting had replaced typing pools, so fewer skilled typists required, fewer desks etc are required, so less manufacturing and a loss of jobs & reskilling became an imperative. In the 1990s intranet and the early internet come on the scene, email is the common interface for correspondence, personal secretaries become redundant, fewer desks etc are required, so less manufacturing and a loss of jobs & reskilling becomes redundant, people now have to have skill diversity so they can change occupations. At the beginning of the 2000s bank\u2019s are closing more and more branches because of lack of demand. People prefer automatic cash dispensers and credit/debit cards. No need for bricks & mortar premises, effects building trades, brick & cement manufacturers, fabric manufacturers, steel makers etc etc. Now people do all there day to day banking over the internet, no need for client facing offices, back end processing is done by computers, no need for clerks etc, no need for desks or multiple buildings etc, power consumption is reduced which means less infrastructure is needed to supply it which means less people to maintain it. For the sake of space and time, I haven\u2019t gone into detail, just skimmed the surface of the impacts of office automation which has had both a multiplier and accelerator effect in the loss of millions of jobs in only one industry. Now the bright side is, that those people who found their acquired skills redundant, had to seek new opportunities, which has given rise to increased demand for re-education, and a emphasis towards services (eg: health trainers). The purpose of employing technology to automate repetitive tasks is to reduce the demand for labour. The end game is not to replace people with machines, but to free people from the mundane mindlessness of forced employment, so they can do something useful with their lives. I was watching a gardening show the other day, and they had a segment on a therapy garden in a rehabilitation centre. One person interviewed, had severe spinal injuries, required augmentation, was bound to a wheelchair and basically he once thought his life was over. Then the head gardener built him a raised garden bed which the injured fellow could manage to grow crops. Computers (AI) would not have come up with such a solution, they are incapable of intuition and inventiveness, they can only innovate on what already is known to them. The moral I took from the show, is no matter what, there is always something we can do that will make our life better, and it rarely involves machines. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Unfortunately, more than most people are ready (and willing) to admit and accept. And it is not the AI\u2019s fault. To predict AI\u2019s impact on human jobs, one should understand, it is an economics question, not a technology question - this is VERY different than \u201cwhen will AI become smarter than human\u201d - AI does not need to be smarter than human to take most of the jobs. First, the economy, some argue historically, our innovations had created more job than it kills - look at from farming to urban, from product to services, etc. Well, to borrow a financial institution disclaimer - past performance does not indicate future result - let alone nothing close to AI was experimented historically speaking. Several blind spots in this view include: Generational shift - those historical innovations, while increased jobs over time, were mostly a job killer for the generation invented them. Replacing existing job is \u201clower hanging fruits\u201d for technology, and usually are the first to happen; creating new jobs usually requires the technology to be digested well, and newer opportunities became viable after the technology\u2019s long term impact is visible. This means majority of people who lose their job to technology would not find a better job in their lifetime, the beneficiaries are the future generations. This was true when we moved from agriculture to industrial, and it was true through the product to service shift as well - even now - American working class has not yet fully shift to service-oriented population, despite America benefited from being the birthplace of a majority of the modern innovation.Innovation speed - the generational shift problem was hidden in plain sight because innovation speed wasn\u2019t significant, and the technology adoption rate is relatively low (compare to now). The impact to job market tent to be localized, and gradual (again, compared to now). This means people overall, have time to absorb the impact, recover and grow further.Population growth - Population growth had accompanied technology evolution historically, until now. Population growth used to be positive (demographically, more younger generation than older generation). This means those who would benefit from the technology will outnumber those who lose their jobs to technology. So instead of \u201ctechnology creates more jobs\u201d, it could very well be \u201ctechnology enabled more people to adjust their lifestyle and generate more demand\u201d. If you study economics, population growth is unspeakable important to economic, hence living-standard growth, and demand growth is THE driver of job growth.The social and family structure was able to provide some support that segregates this pain at the individual level - although the election of President Trump somewhat reminded people this individual level pain can pop up to collective level as well. The traditional family unit and community cooperation in Europe and Asia had supported people who lost their jobs, and because the larger economic unit, the shift from older generation to the younger generation is not as devastating as it is in modern America (and part of Europe)It is different this round, human society has entered into a new phase where birth rate, especially in developed economies where AI is more prominent, has dropped well below 2 children/couple for over a generation. It means the generational population dividend no longer exists - the benefit that newer generation who pick up new technology, and create more demand is not as it used to be \u2014 this factor does not even need AI to play out \u2014 this is just a social-economical change that any generational innovation will run into. Of course, there is also the higher innovation speed - previous innovation took several generations to pan out, now, AI could have several generational shifts within a generation (~40 years of typical individual working life). What does this mean? It means likely several generations will run into situations where a major proportion of which will lose their job before they retire even if they entered the job market in those \u201cnew jobs\u201d. (Job\u2019s \u201clife expectancy\u201d is shorter than human working life expectancy). Then there is the learning factor - the generational shift was mainly because it is \u201chard to train an old dog a new trick\u201d. It is true, especially those who excel in old jobs for a long time, it will be very difficult to train them to be as good in new technology. So often happened was younger generation grew up to be proficient in new technology and take over the productivity. What people do not talk about often is every technical innovation increased training time required to master it. Current \u201cservice oriented\u201d economy generally require 12 years of education - while in the traditional agriculture society 6 years of education is considered \u201ca waste of time\u201d. And we are talking about AI threatening jobs that require a post-secondary degree! What are the so-called \u201cgold collar\u201d jobs that lots of people proposed would be created? As a reference, Wall St. jobs typically require a post-graduate degree. And if you think working in the field of AI is harder than Wall St. jobs, you are correct, someone who can meaningfully take on AI jobs either as a researcher or practitioner commonly have 2\u20133 degrees. What does this mean? two things: 1) shifting to \u201cnew jobs\u201d becomes harder and harder; 2) there are less and fewer people have the \u201cjob mobility\u201d. Even if there are new jobs \u201cCreated\u201d by AI, most people who lost their old jobs won\u2019t be able to pick up newer jobs right away. So economic wise speaking, the feature of a new society taking on new innovation is different than previous technology revolutions. Irrespective of the type of the innovation, our society is *not* in a position to transition as smoothly as it used to be. Second, the technology, AI is different - very different. If you are interested in human history - you would notice that throughout documented history, all innovations have been \u201cbrain replace muscle\u201d. Those who were strong and can carry loads of goods were not as important once a \u201csmarty pants\u201d invented wheels. Those who were harder working in the field were surpassed by those who pay attention to selecting best seeds, raw muscle power was further replaced by the steam engine, ICM, and so on \u2014 every turn of the human history, the power shifts from muscular to brainy. AND that is actually how we defined ourselves - \u201chow human separated from the rest of the animals because we rely on our intellect to change the world we face\u201d, our brain power is our \u201cidentity\u201d among the living beings. Up to industrial revolution, this had been true - invented power sources took over raw muscle power, further enabling mental productivity. There were couple of \u201cexceptions\u201d to this though, and it could give us a taste of what is to come: When we invented writing, those oral storytellers retired from history (some tribe where writing was not as advanced actually retained storytellers), arguably, storytellers used to be one of few intellectual works back then - writing eliminated that as a role.When we started to design and create mechanical calculators (first by Da Vinci, then by Pascal, then Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage), we started to get into \u201cinformation processing automation\u201d era. This might not look as \u201cscary\u201d at the beginning - after all, mechanical calculators were designed in the 1600s. nearly 400 years passed, no harm done.When we had electronics, and computers, \u201ccalculator\u201d which used to be a job title, became the name of a small box with keys (then became an app, which is for later discussion). We now have invented something that replaces brain power - not just raw muscle power this time. Human calculators as a profession (a good paying one mind you) disappeared without much fuzz.Since then, we have changed our society so much that we can bearly survive without computers. However, this period of fast innovation also coincides with the globalization and the American\u2019s shift from product to a service economy. But the social impact is hard to ignore - America to this day, still have generations of \u201cvictims of change\u201d - while most economics cite globalization and shift to a service economy as the reason, the fact that technology was the enabler of both is undisputed. For the most part, the overall economic benefit to America had been positive. However, the list of disappeared (or significantly reduced) job categories quietly increases, telephone exchanger used to be a job, remember the girls pulling, plugging cords in front of a big electric panel? secretaries are virtually gone, other than very few \u201cexecutive assistants\u201d whose job is now threatened by Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, and like, bookkeeper - which probably would hire 10x more people, was a niche now. Service jobs are not safe either - Online shopping, reduced jobs at retail, also reduced jobs in the warehouse. Uber reduced \u201cfleet management\u201d. Chatbot reduced call-centre agents. As you can see, the more \u201cAI-ish\u201d the technology innovation, the more \u201cwhite-collar\u201d job it replaces. But so far, these changes are \u201cconfined within certain industries\u201d. While some argue that \u201chuman touch\u201d is still not available from AI, it is kind of half-true \u2014 while AI can\u2019t provide full spectrum of human touch, it can mimic a lot of emotional intelligence and \u201chuman-ish\u201d reaction that trigger human-to-human kind of feelings. People have developed emotional attachment to objects since written history (probably earlier than that, but was not written down), and human\u2019s emotional attachment to AI is very common and surprising \u2014 we don\u2019t need AI to behave exactly like human before human accepts and adopts some level of \u201chuman-ish touch\u201d. And that means as long as AI can provide sufficient level of emotion-like behavior, AI can take jobs even though it might not reach full \u201chuman\u2019s level\u201d Third, about new jobs that will be created That actually had been a myth that new technology always create new jobs - it is the increasing of population and increase of living-standard that create new jobs, not the technologies themselves. Technology always make doing things more efficient, so it takes less labor, or less resources, or offer better outcome - none of which will \u201crequire\u201d net-more human effort \u2014 unless new demand (either quantity or quality of lives) are enabled by the new technology. As the world population reaching its capacity cap, population growth is not going to be the main economic (hence job creation) engine. The increase of living-standard on the otherhand might not work the same way as before either - as the carbon foot print becomes more and more important, and extreme poverty rate drops in the past 20 years, the pressure of energy consumption is increasingly become priority over increasing living-standards. This translates to lack of new job creation force. So expecting AI will create new jobs than it replaces is actually not concretely proven claim. Fourth, human value There are many ways for people to define value when it comes to human lives. My take on the *measureable* value can be found here: Human (Measurable) Value This does not cover all \u201cvalue\u201d that everyone might have for themselves, however, this covers something (cross-individual, measurable) way to discuss value. Basically it is a measure of desirability of an individual\u2019s actions (or abilities when discussing future value). In other words, it means how much y ou can create some thing that will benefit other people - or they desire (when \u201cbeneficial\u201d is not clearly defined). This is important - because when AI comes, most of the benefits and desires of human can be satisfied by AI at lower cost (resource-wise), meaning that the value human can create would significantly fade away. This round, AI is not just replacing jobs, it really replaces many people\u2019s value \u2014 even if everyone is paid sufficient amount of money for nothing, what about humans\u2019 desire of been perceived as \u201cmeaningful\u201d \u2014 if I can\u2019t do anything benefit other people at a cost effective way (i.e. maybe AI has a better and more efficient way to solve world hunger - by issuing free money to everyone, let\u2019s say) what is the \u201creason for my existance\u201d? So, the problem, not only does not have a \u201csolution\u201d (i.e. AI will create more jobs than it replaces), but also is actually much bigger than just jobs, it touches some of the very core concepts of the meaning of lives, jobs is just he tip of the iceberg most people \u201csaw\u201d.

We will just get lots of fancy virtual toys for nearly nothing. Energy creates GDP. Then humans try to do something useful to get a share of the pie. AI will marginally help create more GDP as it has little impact on energy production. The pie will be more or less the same size. Then, humans will fight to provide something of value to get a share of the pie just as today. For example, in law firms. Today, you have 20 legal experts who search through case history. Tomorrow, better search engines will allow 3 legal experts to do the same work. But the goal is to win the lawsuit. And the law firm with 18 legal experts + search engine will win against the law firm with 3 legal experts + search engine. So in the end, you will have 18 legal experts + search engine and a licence of the law search engine and 2 employees in the law search engine corporation. Even more realistically, you will have 20 legal experts + search engine and the cost of the licence for the law search engine will replace the cost of the licence for various existing law softwares. In the end, the existing law software company will be replaced by an AI law software company and the jobs will just switch from a software company to a new software company. That\u2019s pretty much the story of the last 20 years in tech. Software companies get replaced by new software companies every few years. Software features become integrated in open source libraries and you get it for free, then jobs move to a software company working on a new kind of feature that isn\u2019t standardised yet. The AI revolution will just push a lot of software companies to bankruptcy to replace them with a lot of new software companies. That\u2019s the story of growthless innovation, you replace an old company with a new one with a better technology. Then economists will dismiss AI innovation as being fake innovation because it as no impact on GDP and labour productivity (the two faces of the same coin). Economists will say \u201cwell, those new AI search engines were not real innovation, they didn\u2019t increase the GDP generated by law firms who use those softwares\u201d. What economists don\u2019t understand is that only energy creates GDP growth, then the people fight each other for a piece of the pie. Law firms do nothing more that fighting each other for a share of the pie, they cannot create GDP. So you can do as much innovation as you want, this has an impact on which legal firm gets more of the pie, this has no impact outside of the legal industry. In other industries, AI will increase energy efficiency. Energy efficiency doesn\u2019t create GDP either, it just increases the value of a unit of GDP. Energy efficiency frees energy that is used to get more of the same stuff. An extreme example is the microprocessor industry, they make processors with 1000000x the computation speed for the same price, but the total GDP captured by the microprocessor industry didn\u2019t increase massively. This is the result of the extreme energy efficiency built into Moore\u2019s law. An example of the AI revolution will be energy efficiency in last mile transportation. Delivery trucks are really inefficient, most of the weight of a delivery truck exists to transport the driver safely!  Starship.xyz is an example of what AI will do to last mile transportation. A city delivery van weights 2000kg and transports at most 200kg of packages (10x weight factor), a small delivery robot can weight 10kg and transport 5kg of packages (2x weight factor). That\u2019s much more energy efficient. So we will get very cheap home delivery for the same amount of GDP Energy efficiency is how you end up with developing countries who have smartphones but still no drinkable tap water and reliable electricity grids. Because water and electricity systems are huge and require lots of energy and matter to build and maintain while smartphones are tiny and don\u2019t consume much energy and matter. So to summarize, AI will provide powerful but useless tools in industry where the goal is to beat the opponent (law, marketing, lobbyism, HR and so on). AI will provide plenty of nearly free incredible virtual services. AI will provide some degree of energy efficiency and we will get more for the same amount of GDP. Overall, the effect of AI will be invisible in economic statistics and economists will say that this was just a fad. And to answer the question, it will have not much impact on the Indian IT industry. It will still be used as a subcontractor for big companies who want to upgrade their software to the previous fad. Once the new generation of big data becomes standardised enough and trendy startups all use it, massive and slow global conglomerates will ask Indian contractors to do the same AI thing for cheap for their products. In 2020, General Electrics will want generic AI things included in their software services and will ask Indian contractors to do it. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley 2015 AI startups will all go bankrupt as the 2020 trendy technology destroys 2015 AI startups. And in 2020, 30 years old software engineers who designed the 2015 AI startups when they were 25 years old will become employees of General Electics and supervise the subconctracting of 2015 technology to the Indian IT industry. (I don\u2019t know if the Indian IT industry is moving up the value chain, this is in the case it keeps its current level. If India moves up in the value chain, General Electrics will outsource to another country where they can find cheap medium level software engineers) ",

            "answer_text": " Inevitably so, I believe. Humans have two types of abilities\u2014physical and cognitive. In the past, machines competed with humans mainly in raw physical abilities, while humans retained an immense edge over machines in cognition. Therefore, as manual jobs in agriculture and industry were automated, new service jobs emerged that required the kind of cognitive skills only humans possessed: learning, analyzing, communicating, and above all understanding human emotions. However, AI is now beginning to outperform humans in more and more of these skills, including in the understanding of human emotions. We don\u2019t know of any third field of activity\u2014beyond the physical and the cognitive\u2014where humans will always retain a secure edge. It is crucial to realize that the AI revolution is not just about computers getting faster and smarter. It is fueled by breakthroughs in the life sciences and the social sciences as well. The better we understand the biochemical mechanisms that underpin human emotions, desires, and choices, the better computers can become in analyzing human behavior, predicting human decisions, and replacing human drivers, bankers, and lawyers. In the last few decades research in areas such as neuroscience and behavioral economics allowed scientists to hack humans, and in particular to gain a much better understanding of how humans make decisions. It turns out that our choices of everything from food to mates result not from some mysterious free will but rather from billions of neurons calculating probabilities within a split second. Vaunted \u201chuman intuition\u201d is in reality \u201cpattern recognition.\u201d Good drivers, bankers, and lawyers don\u2019t have magical intuitions about traffic, investment, or negotiation; rather, by recognizing recurring patterns, they spot and try to avoid careless pedestrians, inept borrowers, and sly crooks. It also turns out that the biochemical algorithms of the human brain are far from perfect. They rely on heuristics, shortcuts, and outdated circuits adapted to the African savannah rather than to the urban jungle. No wonder that even good drivers, bankers, and lawyers sometimes make stupid mistakes. This means that AI can outperform humans even in tasks that supposedly demand \u201cintuition.\u201d If you think AI needs to compete against the human soul in terms of mystical hunches, the task sounds impossible. But if AI really needs to compete against neural networks in calculating probabilities and recognizing patterns, that sounds far less daunting. In particular, AI can be better at jobs that demand intuitions about other people. Many lines of work\u2014such as driving a vehicle in a street full of pedestrians, lending money to strangers, and negotiating a business deal\u2014require the ability to correctly assess the emotions and desires of others. Is that kid about to run into the road? Does the man in the suit intend to take my money and disappear? Will that lawyer act upon his threats or is he just bluffing? As long as it was thought that such emotions and desires were generated by an immaterial spirit, it seemed obvious that computers would never be able to replace human drivers, bankers, and lawyers. For how could a computer understand the divinely created human spirit? Yet if these emotions and desires are in fact no more than biochemical algorithms, there is no reason computers cannot decipher these algorithms\u2014and do so far better than any Homo sapiens. Will it be a better world or an apocalypse then? We\u2019ll have to wait to find out. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Will AI kill jobs? Yes. Many jobs of today are in imminent danger of being automated. Many jobs aren\u2019t, but that shouldn\u2019t comfort you. An extra ten percent unemployment dramatically alters the political and economic realities of the country. We may be looking at a disruption as large as 47% in 20 years. Won\u2019t humans work alongside AI rather than be replaced by it? This is the difference between a Complementary good and a Substitute good. Carriages and horses are complementary goods. Because they are capable of more together than separately, they increase each other\u2019s value. This is not the relationship between a car and a horse or a delivery driver and a delivery drone. One obviates the need of the other; they are substitutes. The more AI becomes capable of, the more they will begin to substitute jobs rather than complement them. But it will create new jobs, right? Yes. It will create an increased demand for software developers, security specialists, coders that maintain legacy code and technicians who service machines. These, however, are high skilled jobs. In the past, automation has replaced low skilled jobs with low skilled jobs. Farmhands moved into factories. Factory workers moved to the service sector. Now automation will ask millions of middle aged drivers, cashiers, and telemarketers who can\u2019t afford school, struggle with algebra and don\u2019t know how to copy-and-paste to become programmers. How do you think that will unfold? But it will still create a net gain in jobs, right? Not necessarily. My city employs probably more than 500 bus drivers. If they were replaced by automated vehicles, do you suppose it would take 500 programmers or mechanics to deal with the added software and hardware maintenance? I think it might take <50. Will there be any jobs in the future? Yes, but not for you and me. In the near-term, jobs that are niche, high skill, or very variable will be safe from automation. Most people don\u2019t have such jobs and can\u2019t get them, so we will mostly be unemployed sometime this century. In the more speculative, distant future, there will only be jobs for emulated minds (EMs) and a few niche human careers. EMs will easily substitute for human labor and have the advantages of being infinitely copiable, being able to run as fast as a job requires, and market forces driving their wages down to subsistence levels. There will be jobs in the 2100s, but biological humans won\u2019t have them. A rigorous, analytical exploration of this scenario can be found here. ",

            "answer_text": " Wow, strongly worded and straight to the point! Job extinction fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) is definitely a popular subject. It has been for quite a few years now. The media is absolutely obsessed with it -- fearmongering does wonders for ratings, I guess. But they\u2019re not the only ones thinking about this hot topic. Researchers around the world are investigating possible implications, outcomes, and potential solutions. In fact, renowned economists Lukas Schlogl and Andy Sumner recently published a paper related to your question. I\u2019ll save you some time. Here\u2019s the conclusion: We are spending way too much time worrying if AI will take our jobs. Instead, we must focus on how it would actually do so, and how we can prepare for this scenario. Contrary to what the media headlines say once a week, AI won\u2019t be instantly consuming every job available to humans. We won\u2019t just be left to grovel at the feet of our AI overlords and praise them for another day that they allow us to live. The future is more nuanced than this simplistic perspective. Instead, expect to see a future where AI changes our jobs through a gradual and iterative process that spans the next few decades. Schlogl and Sumner had a great point with their paper. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper into that concept: To understand how AI advancements will affect our future, we must understand how AI will affect our role in society. Don\u2019t get me wrong -- AI will be extremely disruptive. Esteemed multinational consulting firm PwC has done a ton of research on the economics behind AI. They consider it \u201cthe biggest commercial opportunity in today\u2019s fast-changing economy.\u201d Those are some high expectations. Here\u2019s why they said it: PwC expects AI to be responsible for 14 percent of global GDP growth by 2030. This value equals $15.7 trillion. That\u2019s more than the current combined GDP output of China and India! Those are some astronomical figures. But remember, this change in value won\u2019t happen overnight. In fact, PwC also projects that AI will affect society in three distinct phases. Each one will bring a new level of automation never seen before. PwC predicts that society will be disrupted by AI automation in three waves: Algorithm, Augmentation, and Autonomy. We\u2019re actually in the Algorithm Wave right now, which is expected to last well into the early 2020s. Marked by the fact that AI\u2019s still in its early stages, the majority of AI development during this time will be focused on digital tasks. Data analysis is the name of the game. Industries that rely on this, like finance, information, and communication, will feel the greatest impact. Per PwC, approximately 2 to 3 percent of the UK could be affected during the Algorithm Wave. After this, we\u2019ve got the Augmentation Wave, which should end in the late 2020s. Finance will remain the main industry affected. But we\u2019ll start to see a shift from digital tasks to more physical ones. Repeatable tasks like those you\u2019d find in warehouse operations will get a massive revamp during this time. Low and medium education roles will be at a greater risk of disruption than their higher education counterparts as well. The Augmentation Wave could affect up to 20 percent of jobs. Go further into the near future, around the early 2030s, and we\u2019ll find ourselves in the Autonomy Wave. This one will be defined by AI\u2019s autonomous ability to analyze data, make decisions, and take action. No human help required. It will be the closest we\u2019ve come to the AI we see in science fiction. Manual activities will bear the brunt of automation. Primary industries at risk during this time include manufacturing, retail, and transportation. Warehouses, factories, and stores will bear no resemblance to their current iterations. The Autonomy Wave could affect up to 30 percent of jobs. 44 percent of low-education roles will be at risk of being replaced. And there you have it. AI\u2019s integration into our lives won\u2019t be instantaneous but rather will resemble a piecemeal process. The times ahead may seem random and chaotic. But there is a method to AI\u2019s madness. Let\u2019s take a look at the finite number of ways AI can actually affect jobs. AI will only affect jobs in four ways: Destroy, Save, Augment, and Create. In the first category, we have jobs like customer service, delivery, and those you\u2019d find in the fast food industry. All of these are susceptible to being replaced. And these roles are everywhere. So you can expect the media to bolster any fears people have during this time. But you\u2019ll know better! You\u2019ve read this Quora post, so you\u2019ll be informed and have a clearer perspective of the times. Many jobs will actually be safe from AI disruption. There are some obvious ones, like the people creating and maintaining the AI. These people will actually be thriving. Because of their high level of skills, they\u2019ll be highly rewarded. Creative roles such as R&D, design, and product management will also be protected from AI\u2019s wrath. Military jobs and contractors will also be relatively okay due to the fact that robots won\u2019t be able to do every part of their job. AI will take over the more mundane aspects of many roles. But highly skilled guilds like handymen and electricians will still be needed to complete complex tasks out of AI\u2019s reach. Here\u2019s a category you don\u2019t hear often in relation to AI: Religion. I\u2019d venture to say that spiritual leaders will remain human. People who have faith in a higher being won\u2019t be wanting an AI giving a sermon or carrying out sacred traditions any time soon. Now, let\u2019s move on to the third category. AI will also augment many roles. Like religion, we probably still won\u2019t be comfortable with AI piloting our planes, even 30 years from now. Similar to our discussion of contractors, AI autopilot will take care of the mundane, everyday aspects of flying. But human pilots will be on standby to take over if need be. Expect to see this sort of streamlined relationship across various industries. But besides physical tasks, AI will also help with many mental tasks. Information-heavy fields such as law, medicine, and accounting will receive a big boost in decision-making thanks to AI. In one way or another, practically everyone will benefit from AI\u2019s inhuman ability to synthesize sharp insights from colossal amounts of data. Last but not least, AI will also surprisingly create new jobs! Many new roles will be directly related to the AI industry itself. But the disruptive technology will also make way for new avenues across all industries. Unfortunately, this is difficult to predict at the moment due to the fact that AI will restructure numerous value chains. And that about wraps this up. There you have it: a solid idea of when and how AI will affect our roles in society. Like many other situations, the uncertainty that AI presents to our future is what\u2019s driving our concerns. It\u2019s simply a fear of the unknown. I hope this helps alleviate some of your worries. ",

Speaking to CBS News\u2019 Scott Pelley in an interview for 60 Minutes on Sunday, Kai Fu Lee said that he believes 40% of the world\u2019s jobs will be replaced by robots capable of automating tasks. He said that both blue collar and white collar professions will be affected, but he believes those who drive for a living could be most affected. \u201cChauffeurs, truck drivers, anyone who does driving for a living\u2014their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15-25 year time frame,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cMany jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated.\u201d Lee\u2019s comments are not necessarily new. Many who support artificial intelligence and automation believe that they can fundamentally change the workforce. But many of those people also believe that while some jobs could be affected, humans will find new opportunities surrounding artificial intelligence and take on new professions. A growing number of detractors\u2014including Elon Musk, who has warned about the power of artificial intelligence\u2014worry that automation could disrupt entire communities and disproportionately affect low-income workers. Still, many, including Lee, believe there\u2019s no slowing down artificial intelligence and its impact on society. And he compared artificial intelligence to major innovations in history, like the steam engine and electricity, saying that humans were affected and have \u201cgotten over it.\u201d But he cautioned that artificial intelligence and its impact will hit us much sooner than those other innovations did.

            "answer_text": "Too many good answers on this question but none of them clears the air that much about some stuff that I think I should tell. I understand this concern. A.I. Taking Our Job and many more scary stuff. If Artificial Intelligence is gonna replace human, we scientists have to restructure and redevelop the AI in many many ways. That's just not gonna happen in near future. But from the angle of some prediction, we are saying it's gonna happen. But what we are misreading from those prediction is that, not only computer technology, other fields will go up rapidly too. If you don't believe other fields will not improve rapidly. Then, believing in AI just doesn't make sense. If other fields aren't improved, improving in just AI is impossible because it depends on all of them (Let's say many of them for the sake of clarity). Every change is a positive effect on economy that will cover up the negative effect of the change. That\u2019s why we let them fuck up with our economy in democracy. None has been a threat to our existence, we still improve. So, if you think AI is very fast to take our jobs before we get the skill independent economy, you are wrong. I understand, we have a lot of reason to feel depressed. We human have skill based economy. Transition from here is scary. Transition from this situation has already began. We are having new generations more open to have fun other than achieving hardcore skill. Which is good. Healthy family and education creating healthy mentality. Soon we will have a so good social environment that will allow getting enormous skill on things very easily. On the other hand, getting a new skill will be so so much easier than now because of clean cut philosophy about those subjects and their easy to use tools. The social norm will help produce enormous skill automatically better than ever. Transition from one to another wouldn't take much time. It's because big entrepreneurs and companies can't have a psychological startups. So, they never talk about psychological improvements. They talk about shinny technologies and it's up bringings. Social engineering and behavioral economics are just very neglected part of science where we only focus on how to use other people but not on how the world is gonna change positively. Even if I am wrong, mourning and selling depressing idea aren't gonna help. We rather make the change that we want by leading the positive. And people who are leading, not trusting their humanity and kindness makes us very depressed which we shouldn't be. ",

            "answer_text": "I am currently working on an automation area that you would classify as one which displaces current job. My concern is not AI killing jobs. When AI start to kill jobs, I want AI to kill jobs expeditiously across all sectors. Ben Y. Zhao's answer to Will AI kill jobs? has brought a great perspective, i haven\u2019t read other answers on this question. Here is why i think, this shift has to happen very fast: For concepts like universal basic income (UBI) to function effectively, Govt should be able to collect tax or acquire essential goods at a very cheap price. These then have to be distributed among people who we now classify as \u2018Unemployed\u2019. If however, AI could displace only drivers through self driving cars, there are 100 million jobless drivers (numbers are for reference purpose only). Even if somehow AI is 100% taxed to maintain the standard of living of these 100 million unemployed drivers, the current pool of unemployed people (who may not be drivers) would need a share of this UBI reducing overall standard of living. Unless, AI displace jobs in other sectors too. Please note, if AI\u2019s potential can be fully utilized, efficient way to harness renewable source of energy can be discovered. Sun doesn\u2019t charge anyone for the solar energy. With above 75% of the present job required to sustain the standard of living of people across the globe automated, people can start following their passion. Healthcare, Education, Food, transportation, shelter, clothing will be dirt cheap if not free with the unlimited energy. You can now follow your passion of being a theater artist/musician / painter / sportsman; you can afford to be amateur in these areas. You could spend time with your family, you could be born on one part of the world, travel across the globe till you die. We don\u2019t really need a job, do we? We only need a job if others have a job. We need a job to put food on the table and experience comfort in life. What worries me is not job, with all this free time, what will people find to fight over? religion/caste/tribe? ",

Firstly, \u201cJobs disappearing today are not bound to return. Learn a new skill in artificial intelligence such as machine learning or deep learning by starting today! Most of the jobs will never return, and millions more are likely to vanish as well, say experts who study the labor market. What\u2019s more, these jobs aren\u2019t just being lost to China and other developing countries, and they aren\u2019t just factory work. Increasingly, jobs are disappearing in the service sector, home to two-thirds of all workers. They\u2019re being obliterated by technology. The research note is informative, it subtly glorifies great technologies while carrying a chilling undertone that you might be next on the line to lose your job! It scares you (and me) for sure. It, however, doesn\u2019t tell you how you should prepare yourself for it. I will attempt to put things in perspective by using my experience with digital and emerging technologies from the past 20 odd years and also suggest where you should look. So please stay with me, even if you have never worked in the technology area because this could really change the way you look at this unapproachable hi-tech market. You can be part of it!\u201d Second, But you should worry about the jobs today but prepare for upcoming jobs. \u201cSo, economies are in shambles, employers continue to jettison the workforce and more of that depressing news you can read in those articles from Economist or AP if you are not already confronted with those realities in or around your day-to-day life. Learn a new skill in AI today and avoid becoming a casualty! Instead, I urge you to stay with me so we can work together with an up-skill route for you to get to the new job/skills. I sketched a matrix which can help you get a picture. It is quite self-explanatory and you know in which direction you need to move to enhance your skill sets.\u201d Full article is here : Skill Up Your Career For The New AI Economy ",

            "answer_text": "The conversation around the future of work today often leads to the growing fear jobs are being digitalized or going to the robots. And while it\u2019s true that many jobs are likely to be automated away, countless more will be created by new technology as rising economic growth empowers consumers to spend more on services, which, in turn, will lead to substantial job gains in service-providing occupations. And that\u2019s not just my conjecture: according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 91% of new jobs in 2016-2026 will be in the service sector. To be even more specific, though, I\u2019m particularly bullish on the future for skilled trade jobs. That\u2019s because these jobs won\u2019t be replaced with robots due to the complexity and uniqueness of each individual task. Think about this way: a job can broken down into specific tasks. Some of these tasks are quite routine and can therefore be done easily and cheaply by a robot or an algorithm, even if it\u2019s \u201ccognitively intensive\u201d, like a radiologist. On the other end of the spectrum, some tasks are non-routine tasks, defined by their complexity and non-standardization. Many manual jobs have a low risk of being automated given they are not routine, even if they don\u2019t require high levels of formal education.

But with new advances in artificial intelligence, it\u2019s not just industrial and warehouse robots that will alter the workforce. Self-checkout kiosks and computerized hotel concierges will do their part. Most jobs will change somewhat as machines take over routine tasks, but a majority of workers will be able to adapt to that shift without being displaced. Autonomous vehicles could replace short-haul delivery drivers. I hope u like my answer. Pls upvote Nikhilesh Reddy ",

A.I. is technology improving day by day, I will not say evolving because it still you to make this improvement to happen, it can't do without you. The sole purpose of the automation happening throughout the industry sectors is to reduce human labor, reduce the time human takes to complete the repetitive tasks, and obvious one is to improve the quality of the final outcome. It\u2019s not to replace the human workforce by machines/robots, these robotic processed still needs the configurations, operators, and monitors.

A.I. backed technology providing better help manufacturing result and so on\u2026 The transition will not be that smooth and will result in pain. It will lead the job creation into the field of A.I. education, research, and development and maybe some more, but the good amount of population which may not be able to cope up with this change will face the issue of unemployment. Perhaps after this, the JOBs will get redefined and will make more suitable for an available crowd - what they need and what they can do as work. Predicting the exact picture is very hard at the moment as the exponential growth rate of technology & looking at history for such events will not guarantee you the future !! ",

So is robotics (including the mechanical aspect, not just the software), computers in general, and various machines like bulldozers. You could probably even count the use for \u201cbeasts of burden\u201d\u2026 thousands of years ago, people lost jobs when their bosses figured out how to harness horses to do the work of 5 men. Other examples are piano players being put out of work by jukeboxes, scribes being put out of work by the printing press, and librarians being put out of work by the internet and search engines, and so on. Remember that at one time, about half the people in the US worked in food production. Now it is down to around 4%. We don\u2019t need that many people to do the basics to keep us alive. However, the speed that this is happening is unprecedented, and it will probably make it so that the majority of people won\u2019t be employable at some point in the not-too-distant future. One thing that has yet to happen, but will, is that general purpose robots will get so sophisticated, that they can do the vast majority of the work of making another general purpose robot just like them. It is unfortunate that our economic system is based on the concept of scarcity. This won\u2019t work for much longer, and is already failing for a lot of people. The only solutions I can think of will involve changing the economic system. ",

An example of this would be how the invention and development of automobiles changed focus from horse-pulled wagons to automobiles. Over a generation, horse breeders, saddle makers and people who made supplies and tools for horses saw their industry become much smaller, while a great demand came into existence for car factory workers, road builders and parts makers shot into prominence. AI changes the type of jobs, but in the end jobs tend to increase when new industries and opportunities come into play. The issue, what scares folks, is the question of what happens to MY job? It\u2019s all statistics until it affects someone you know and love. The nest answer I can offer is that intelligence has always been in shorter supply than is needed, so if you take your education seriously - and I mean hard sciences and practical skills, not frilly appreciation classes or new age garbage - you\u2019ll be fine.

From taxis to fast food to assembly lines to garbage collecting. All gone. But\u2026 I have a computer in my pocket right now, I paid $40 bucks for it. It has replaced my stereo, 90% of my mail, my calculator, game system, phone, address book, calendar, tv, maps, encyclopedia, newspaper, etc., and has more computing power than all the computers that launched the first space shuttle combined. $40 The AI we have now comes standard with iPhone, Google, it\u2019s standard in some cars.. I can see a scenario where AI systems and workers are so cheap, even low income laborers will be able to afford them, launching all kinds of new cottage industries and a new wave of innovation. And because AI will be learning machines, you may be able to \u201cteach\u201d them skills others don\u2019t have. Anyone can train an AI to flip a burger, but maybe you have a knack for producing fine chef bots that can fine tune dishes to customers pallets and requests. Up to now, robots and what limited AI we\u2019ve had have been augmentations of human work. When and if AI becomes a factor in the labor markets, they will still be operating in chaotic, human, emotional, cultural environments outside of factories. I think the roles will be reversed for a time, in that humans will become the assistants and enablers of AI labor. AI will still not be able to remodel your house, retrieve that diamond earing that dropped into the drain, run electrical wiring in your old house, groom your dog, give you a stylish do\u2026 and maybe, maybe it will lead to a restoration of having at least one parent at home for the most important job of all, raising children. Also, until we build robotics capable of self repair or \u201chealing\u201d, they are given to parts failures far more often than humans. I also think that Big Pharma will have the solution to a bunch of poorly trained unemployables\u2026 you\u2019ll be able to get paid for sitting at home on the couch, watching TV and trolling the internet all day\u2026 by just plugging yourself into an IV line that extracts valuable enzymes, hormones, plasma, and other products from your blood while you veg.

They\u2019re wrong because previous waves of automation basically replaced muscle power with mechanical power, but still required human intelligence to steer the machine. It \u201ckicked the human upstairs\u201d into a supervisory role. AI, though, automates the supervisor. So which jobs will AI kill? It will kill ALL repetitive jobs. Any job which consists of doing the same thing again and again can be automated. And if it becomes economically viable, then it will be automated. The only work which isn\u2019t automateable is work that consists of a continuous stream of novelties. There are no jobs which consist of a continuous stream of novelties. That\u2019s the opposite of what a \u201cjob\u201d is; ie. a long-term contract to keep providing the same service. So when I say AI will kill all repetitive jobs, I mean it will kill all jobs. The only work left for humans will be one-off, short-term contracts to do specific bits of novelty creation. ",

If AI will \u2018kill\u2019 jobs, is this a good thing or a bad thing? Right now Intelligent Machines exist that are far more capable than you might think. One is CEO of a large telecommunication company. Literally. The CEO. It makes all the decisions, hires and fires etc. So is this a bad thing? First let us think why we do jobs at all. We do jobs because this is how we as humans fulfill our needs. Farmers produce food, Miners produce minerals and Lawyers\u2026. well, you get the point I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m probably not going out on too fine a limb here to suggest that most people, given the choice, would rather not have to work for money. Oh, it\u2019s nice to be useful and it\u2019s great to have a purpose in life, but how many of us are singing the Dwarven song - I owe, I owe, so it\u2019s off to work I go\u2026 The concern over job losses is only relevant in countries with jobs too - in Zimbabwe the rate of unemployment was 95% in 2009 (estimated) and I doubt most of them care about job losses elsewhere. So If I were to tell you that you could retire today and have the same or higher income as you now have but not have to work, would that appeal? I thought so. This is the future that AI offers. Money is about allocation of resources. Someone has a resource you need, money is how you tokenise the exchange. If resources are freely available then there is no need for money. Now, we will not reach such a state any time soon, as there will likely always be competition for some resources (such as beachfront property) so we may need a form of exchange, but that does not mean it has to be earned from labour. It is quite possible to give everyone a certain share of resource credits (money) to use in any way they choose. Robots do the work, people decide if they want to drink beer or buy a beachfront condo with the money. How is this in any way different from society today? Well, if there are no jobs, there is no elite. Everyone is in theory equal. This is appealing to Zimbabweans, but less so to Americans, appealing to trailer-park residents but less so to East Side Condo owners. AI forces us to face the uncomfortable truth about the huge levels of inequality in the world and in truth it is this that we fear, not really the loss of jobs. So is AI killing jobs a good thing? Actually, I think so. Like it or not, the future is red. ",

A number of predictions (see below) have been made on the number of jobs destroyed and the number of jobs created by artificial intelligence.  How artificial intelligence will impact your job security will depend on a number of factors. The factors include: The country you live in \u2013 e.g., technologically advanced countries like Japan, Germany, Korea, etc., vs. developing countries. The country you live in will also determine how economics, unemployment rate, demographics, and underemployment can impact your employment.The industry you work in \u2013 e.g., the transportation industry has a lot of innovation like driver-less vehicles, vs. fine arts.The job or occupation you currently have \u2013 e.g., if you care for the elderly, then there\u2019s not much automation, vs. a truck driver.The skills and experience you currently have \u2013 e.g., if you are a truck driver, then your job could change significantly by 2035, vs. a personal coach.The education level you currently have \u2013 e.g., if you have a university degree, then you are better prepared for the future of work and for acquiring high-level skills that will be in demand in the future.The company you work for \u2013 e.g., the company you work for must have the capability, capacity, and resources to automate your work, vs. a small family or cash-strap business.McKinsey Global Institute's report, Skill Shift: Automation and The future of The workforce, predicts what jobs would most and least likely be automated: Higher cognitive: these skills include advanced literacy and writing, quantitative and statistical skills, critical thinking and complex information processing. Doctors, accountants, research analysts, writers and editors typically use these.Social and emotional, or so-called \u201csoft skills\u201d: these include advanced communication and negotiation, empathy, the ability to learn continuously, to manage others and to be adaptable. Business development, programming, emergency response and counseling require these skills.Technological: this embraces everything from basic to advanced IT skills, data analysis, engineering and research. These are the skills that are likely to be the most highly rewarded as companies seek more software developers, engineers, robotics and scientific experts. The report also says that workers with the following two skills sets are likely to suffer most, although not in every profession. Physical and manual skills encompass tasks that could be performed by relatively unskilled labour, such as drivers and assembly line workers, as well as skilled workers, including nurses, electricians and craftspeople.Cognitive abilities like basic literacy and numeracy are needed by workers such as cashiers, customer service staff and those involved in low-level data input and processing, such as typists and clerks.",

            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence \u2013 its origin and evolution  It was mathematician and scientist Alan Turing who spent a lot of time after the Second World War on devising the Turing Test. Though it was basic, this test involved evaluating if it was possible for artificial intelligence to hold a realistic conversation with a person, thus convincing them that they were also human. Since Turing\u2019s Test, AI was restricted to fundamental computer models. It was in 1955 when John McCarthy \u2013 a professor at MIT, coined the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d. During his tenure at MIT, he built an AI laboratory. Full List Processing (LISP) was developed by him there. LISP was a computer programming language for robotics intended to provide expansion potential as technology improvements happened with time. Though promise was shown by some base model machines \u2013 be it Shakey the Robot (1966) or Waseda University\u2019s anthropomorphic androids WABOT-1 (1973) and WABOT-2 (1984), it wasn\u2019t until 1990 when Rodney Brooks revitalized the concept of computer intelligence. But it took many more years for artificial intelligence to evolve as it was only in 2014 that Eugene, which was a chatbot program designed by the Russians, was able to successfully convince 33% of human judges. According to Turing\u2019s original test, more than 30% was a pass, though plenty of room was left for stepping it up in the future. From its humble beginnings, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved as perhaps the most significant technological advancement in recent decades across all industries. Be it the robotics aspect of AI, or the implementation of machine learning (ML) technologies that are driving useful insights from big data, the future seems to hold a lot of promise. In fact, the enhanced information extracted from large chunks of data is helping companies today to mitigate supply chain risks, improve customer retention rates, and do a lot more. An example of how these technologies could change the way we live and work became evident when Amazon introduced its Alexa in the workplace. However, many believe that the AI-powered, voice-activated device signals just the beginning. Thanks to NLP (natural language processing), which is made possible via machine learning, modern computers, hi-tech systems, and solutions can now know the context and meaning of sentences in a much better way. As NLP becomes more improved and refined, humans will start communicating with machines seamlessly exclusively via voice without the need of writing code for a command. Thus, professionals who can design and test devices based on NLP and voice-driven interactions are likely to be in high demand in the future. With the growing interest and implementation of artificial intelligence in various fields and the promising future the global machine learning market (predicted to grow to $8.8B by 2022 from $1.4B in 2017, according to a report by Research and Markets), there\u2019s bound to be a wide variety in future jobs for data science professionals as well those specializing in AI and ML.

As Ben Z. pointed out, a lot of folks answering in this thread are equating AI with past technologies that changed the economic landscape. I think that is a huge mistake. In their mind, they are limiting the capabilities of a possible AI in the future to something narrow and not as capable as a human. If an AI that can surpass human thought exists, and it can control physical mechanisms which are every bit as adaptable as human bodies, human labor no longer makes any sense at all. What jobs will we do at that point? We\u2019ve established the machine is superior in every way. Logically, there is no other conclusion: human labor will no longer be needed. At this point then, there are really two competing theories: AI can never reach a point where it is superior to humansAI will completely replace human functionality in every wayWhich ever one turns out to be true will greatly affect our governmental and economic strategy to adapt.

You look at the low skilled, blue collared jobs and you can say those jobs will be replaced by computers/AIs who can do things much more efficiently and quickly than humans can. We already are starting to see automization at scale, such as food restaurants that require minimal humans and automate everything from order to delivery, but not everyone's comfortable with these changes. If people aren't ready then wide spread adoption won't happen or will be really slow. My parents are old school they'll always prefer manual over automated, (my dad still won't get a cellphone) so think about how many people fall into this bracket. AI integration is happening and will continue to happen but with some areas change will be slow and someone still needs to control and develop the technologies for this change, so all jobs can't be replaced.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it will. \"AI, at the same time, will be a replacement for blue collar and white collar jobs,\" said Lee, a renowned Chinese technologist and investor who held positions at Apple and Microsoft in addition to Alphabet's Google. But white collar jobs will go first, he warned. Americans have been worrying about automation wiping out jobs for centuries, and in some occupations, automation has drastically reduced the need for human labor. In 1900, 41% of American workers were employed in agriculture, but by 2000, automated machinery brought that number down to just 2%, MIT professor David Autor wrote in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2015.The arrival of the automobile ushered out horses, reducing the need for blacksmiths and stable hands.In the 21st century, computers are increasingly performing tasks humans once did.When ATMs were introduced in the 1970s, people thought they would be a death knell for bank tellers. The number of tellers per bank did fall, but because ATMs reduced the cost of operating a bank branch, more branches opened, which in turn hired more tellers. U.S. bank teller employment rose by 50,000 between 1980 and 2010. But the tasks of those tellers evolved from simply dispensing cash to selling other things the banks provided, like credit cards and loans. And the skills those tellers had that the ATMs didn't \u2014 like problem solving \u2014 became more valuable. Instead of worrying about the mass unemployment a robot Armageddon could bring, we should instead shift our attention to making sure workers \u2014 particularly low-wage workers \u2014 have the skills they need to compete in an automated era, says James Bessen, an economist, Boston University law lecturer, and author of the book Learning by Doing: The Real Connection Between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth.

In that case, companies can produce more products to their customers which may help them to increase their income rapidly. That is why, it is necessary, if you are scared of losing your job, you have to get updated by what is happening in this world. It is transforming into digital. If you are still traditional, then you have to act now. I am pretty sure that there will be new jobs available in the market even these AI automation application is getting some of our jobs. Lets say or I\u2019m predicting that there will be a need for operating, monitoring and etc. I still believe that humans are unique and one of a kind.

Valid as it is, this assertion passes over two important details (in which Devil is leasurely hidding): the period of time during which the change occurs; if short, it will create great difficulties, upheaval, riots - because the greater the change, the more difficulty is to adapt and longer the time needed for this adaptation.the very nature of this change. The two transitions that took place before (hunter-gatherer to farmer and farmer to worker) involved many troubles and social unrest (French and Bolshevik revolutions, with lots of blood spillings). But the nature of the activities themselves was not that different. Today is a very divergent situation. The nature of the activities that the new Post-Industrial Society will require is mostly intellectual, while the nature of the previous activities (in the Industrial Era) was physical. Physical activity allows you to see instantly the result of your work, it is very rewarding in intself from this point of view, while intellectual work - well, think about those writers or scientists whose work remained unrecognized during their lifetime! Plus the simple fact that if you see your parents working in a way, it is difficult for you to change that way. Intellectual work and the transition to it is not very appealing or attractive from this point of view. It involves a lot of abstract efforts - and such efforts must be recognized and rewarded if the society wants its people to direct their wished toward it; think only about mathematics and how children are seeing it.To that are added other kinds of problems: climate change, growing economic inequity, the return to nationalism camouflaged in the clothes of populism, migration of large numbers of people due to war (Syria) or socio-economic undevelopment (Africa, Middle East), and infortunately this list remains open\u2026 Now about AI itself: right now we are striving to create an An_Int AI (meaning Animal_Intelligence level). A perfect servant that will do what told (see Personal Assistants like Siri). Such entities will have capabilities beyond human ones in regard with information processing (like detecting cancer in samples or on imagery), but real intelligence, Hum_Int level, does not deal with information, this is pre-processed at neural pre-cerebral level and then proccessed in KNOWLEDGE. Only unless and untill we shall be able to decode the secret of Human Intelligence, then and only then we shall also be able to build a so-called AGI - Artificial GENERAL Intelligence, the real A.I. that now we have it only in the movies\u2026(hopefully not the SkyNet kind). Even then the A.I. will work together with the humans to solve whatever problems human society will face (we can be sure there will always be problems, either naturally arising or of our own making). One small mention: we can pretty much forget about A.S.I. - the presumed Artificial Super-Intelligence that will develop itself. We do not know to build a Hum_Int level intelligence, so even if we solve this difficult issue, our intelligence may prove the highest level and unsurpassable one. ",

It\u2019s important to understand context though. This isn\u2019t something that will happen overnight. Here are my predictions: In 10 years: AI and robotics are still quite limited. Taxis, ubers, bus drivers, train conductors, infomation desks, factory work, some cleaning jobs all gone. You will start to see robotic waitresses and customer service. 20 years: By this point robots should be able to do most manual tasks that humans can do. Gardeners, cleaners, plumbers, cooks, maids, nurses, store clerks. All jobs that are easily repeatable and don\u2019t require a huge amount of human expertise will be replaced. 30\u201340 years: By this point robots/ai should be able to do any task a human can. Accountants, general doctors, real estate agents, all customer service jobs, mechanics. Escorts services. Etc. Ai will be able to do a job faster and better than a human. It will also be cheaper to buy/rent a robot than to hire an employee. I think for many jobs that are specialised AI will simply complement them. Take away boring repeatable tasks to allows humans to concentrate on what we do best. I do think it wil be a tough transition and we may see unemployment go up. But over time it will find a balance again and new jobs will be created. I also think we will see people pushing the fact that a task is done by humans.

Would we ever expect two AI machines to talk to each one and conduct business?AI would be an enabler, crunch data, build insights, and suggest possible outcomes to humans. Humans take a call and decide which one to choose based on several parameters. Will you expect AI to have empathy while making decisions? Assume a student needs a 7 point grade to pass the course. Does a student get a 6.9? AI would look at numbers as a \u201cconcept of truth\u201d. What would a human do? Can AI replace kids or just be a set of obedient bots? Would that be fun? When humans make decisions, there are a lot of other parameters apart from numbers that they need to consider. Assume a business needs to win a deal, they will undercut and take a loss for it, in expectations of future business with the same client. Will an AI system think of it this way and allow losses? So there is little scope for AI to take a human's shoes today. We can't be replaced this easily. ",

I suspect during this economical transition a UBI (Universal Basic Income), will be provided as a temporary fix, then the assignment of AI to all humans to co-op to the new world, robots for example can be given to every human to be leased to corporations to earn a wage and a lifestyle for the human. Until we obtain a post scarcity equilibrium where money will be meaningless because all needs are provided for. But during the intermediary transitions that will come, we, as a species will have to discipline our work habits to prepare for this. #learntocode ",

            "answer_text": "There has been discussions around this topic, there are always two camps, but for now it seems that there are limitations to what AI can do. But since we are at this specific place in time, it\u2019s probable we cannot accurately predict the developments. Looking at the current state of things, things are not developing linearly, they are developing exponentially. That means that advancement in the electric car industry is taking massive leaps, and we are at a tipping point. The exponential growth of 0.0001 times 0.0001 has come to the point where it will become 1 times 1, 2 times 2, 4 times 4 and so on. When you take 30 steps, you did just that. Maybe crossed the street. When you take 30 exponential steps, you circle the Earth a few times. That\u2019s the progress we are facing here.

            "answer_text": "In the 1940s when Alan Turing invented supercomputer to interpret the decoded German message during WW2, the question \u201cWill such technologies act as the best or worst thing in the future to humankind?\u201d bothered many. The famous mathematician and computer scientist, Alan Turing was considered insane and his theories vague, but he always believed that the future will witness technologies mimicking human intelligence and behavior, which is now known as Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Today we are here actually debating on the technology which was once believed abrupt while experiencing it in our lives in many ways. People are concerned if AI will be in charge of our lives to such an extent that it proves to be detrimental to humanity like in the show Black Mirror. Some also fear unforeseen consequences that can occur such as killer robots and partial election outcomes. I have been always in the support of pioneering technologies. It\u2019s always about balance and how we use it. Indeed, AI will copy or mimic us but they can\u2019t replace us; they will always require a human brain to receive commands. Also, it will surely eliminate jobs but will also create a demand for new job positions just like what happened during the emergence of computers. Let\u2019s understand this with the major example of ATM  ATM, the automated teller machine is one such technology that was thought it would replace people when it was invented. Yes, you read right! And yet today, there are infinite tellers than ever. How can this be? Simple: ATMs lowered the cost of opening bank branches, and banks responded by opening more, which exorbitantly increased employment. AI Will Create Million Jobs In the same way, AI will create a million jobs that are far beyond our imagination. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, AI is becoming adept at language translation which has skyrocketed demands for human translators. Why? If the cost of basic translation drops to nearly zero, the cost of doing business with those who speak other languages falls. Thus, it emboldens companies to do more business overseas, creating more employment for human translators. AI may do simple translations, but humans are needed for the nuanced kind. In research conducted by Gartner, AI will increase by 300% of employment for people with disabilities.  In fact, the BLS forecasts fields like accountants, forensic scientists, geological technicians, technical writers, MRI operators, web developers, loan officers, dietitians, financial specialists, medical secretaries, and customer service representatives, to name a very few will witness job growth, which had the least growth rate. Mobile phones changed the world, as did the internet. I think no reader here can reasonably claim that he would be better off without those technologies. Each of them unveiled better versions of our lives, created jobs, and increased wages and so will AI. I believe we are calculating the technology\u2019s potential and challenges when it's in the nascent stage. There is a huge possibility that the real potentials of AI are yet to unfurl and who knows if it works in our favor. ",

Not only slaves, but slaves that do not organize, do not get sick, do not get hurt, do not complain, do not sue their employers, and NEVER get paid. We are talking about super slaves; pay the up front one time purchase fee and get a lifetime of free labor 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How can slaves not displace jobs? Oh, I know, the slave industry creates a whole new category of jobs building and maintaining the \u201cslaves.\u201d So the whole reason for creating these automated slaves is to create more jobs to maintain the new employment paradigm. I remember my 8th grade Weekly Reader 50 years ago making this argument. Teach em young and they will be lifetime robot supporters. So if their are more jobs created by using slave robots, then where is the profit? The profit is found in the fact that human beings are cut out of the cycle. It costs too much to employ workers, therefore it is more cost effective to replace them with machines. Follow the follow the money to the 1%\u2026. It will start small with a few initial successes highlighted in social media, then all the truck drivers were replaced with automated driving systems. These displaced drivers are now on welfare. Then it will be tax accountants being replaced by internet robots connected to the IRS. CPAs are now Uber Drivers. And farmers with their self directed GPS tractors. Well, farming has gone from a major employer to a minor one\u2026 And the military drones that keep our pilots safe. Killing your so called enemies without humanity is psychopathy. Tremendous profit in that. And on and on until the robots build the robots and their is no need for humans. Are we not seeing the full force of Darwin\u2019s theory and natural selection? Until the robots become self aware and humans go extinct. Yeah, and the civil unrest that is created by displacing our jobs will cause unending misery and enslavement of humanity. Can we be so blind?

That means drivers, customer care executives, masons, librarian, delivery boys, police forces, bank clerks, secretarial jobs...And the list goes on and on! Actually any boring job that a human being hates but has to do for a living will be taken over for robots + AI + automation pretty quickly. It's more real than we think and already in progress. What will remain and be more valuable will be creative tasks that seem like a waste of time but actually leapfrog human race like scientific research, creative art forms, innovation, robotics, human wellness, meditation therapies, maintenance and control of AI systems, leisure activities like sunbathing \\U0001f642 and sports etc will flourish and we will become an actual civilised and developed race where people don't have to toil to meets ends meet but keep moving ahead and be at leisure. What should we do? 1.) Focus on an alternative hobby, something we love and not just depend on our 9-6 job which might not exist few years down the line. 2.) Teach our children to be explorers and learn science,arts or sports to become innovators and not engineer/doctors/ clerks/soldiers. Creativity becomes more central than discipline!

Between 1980 and 1995, a version of AI, (which we called industrial automation at the time) reduced the number of direct manufacturing employees in Canada and the U.S. to 6% of what it was in 1980. I was there. This led to the market meltdown in Oct. 1987 (in 3 hours we lost 35% of market cap). Between 1985 and 2000, a survey indicated that a version of AI, focussed on management tools, reduced \u201cmanagement employment\u201d in 275 technology businesses I worked with directly in Toronto, to between 50% and 10% of what it was in 1985.

There has never been a disruption to such magnitude where people one generation apart lived so differently, and I would put all of that down to technology disruption. Coming to AI, yes, it will take away many jobs from industries. Why would corporates put up with employee unions when they can have a workforce or technology do things more efficiently 24 hours a day, 365 days a year? Money has no emotion and corporates are flag bearers of that. The one thing I keep hearing is when technology took away manufacturing jobs, it made that side of the industry very efficient and created new jobs in the service industry and hence the same will happen again. DISAGREE AND NOT TRUE - HERE IS WHY. As far as I am aware, human being primarily have two sets of skills. One - physical, second - cognitive. When technology made manufacturing systems more efficient, it took away the physical work required to get work done. Today, when machine learning, artificial intelligence and convoluted neural networks are in play, technology is posing a threat to our cognitive abilities. Its more likely to outdo humans in the coming years. This is the issue. This is where it gets dangerous. Yes, emotion is not entirely at play but it still is a huge threat.

As a thought experiment, I've daydreamed about a scientist back in the USSR, who has a breakthrough bringing him/her current tech along with AI back then. How would they, a humanist centrally planned economy, deal with it? I think work is too important to people to function without striving, so obligations wouldn't end. Rather there would be a production tier, run by robots to provide for material needs, and a social tier, where everyone would work, to provide for each other's social needs. Work would be studying conversation, charm, entertainment, working out to be fit and appealling, etc. All skills needed to please other people and maintain worker's paradise. Outside of that socialist context, it's harder to see how that plays out, but we've actually seen something similar driven by automation in recent decades: workers leaving ever scarcer manufacturing to work in the service sector. Unfortunately, it has come with a huge drop in wages and increase in wealth inequality, and I see no reason to think it wouldn't worsen with AI. Our capitalist free market system has been amazing at producing wealth, but it's like a video game. Strong AI is where you've beat the video game, and it's time for everyone to sit down at the table and talk about what comes next. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s go back to basic motivation behind AI. The fundamental argument for doing AI is that AI is better at doing certain things than humans are capable of doing. Some of the examples of such jobs are cognitive jobs such as driving, diagnosing a disease. Why and how is AI better than humans? Because: AI has better performance than human, in terms of having better memory, quality of results, etc.AI is faster than human.The scientists community largely agree to the couple of above points. Now, think about it. If AI is faster than human to learn new things, then how can we train humans faster than AI, so that they can learn new skills for new jobs? Is this not conflict? Well, it very much is. Obviously, by the time we train a new human for a new job, the AI will learn the new skill itself to do the job. Therefore, we are not getting the number of lost jobs back, for sure. More and more humans will be unemployed by the virtue of AI being faster than human. This is the current crisis that our system faces. This problem is not going away if we continue following the system we are in, namely Capitalism. ",

People who work with the assistance of technology usually need to be more highly educated or trained. Some people may lose their jobs to automation while others will gain jobs those same jobs.Technology makes people more productive. That means production can increase without hiring more workers. The effect is not so much the loss of jobs now as the lack of the creation of new jobs in the future. For people entering the workforce that can be a real loss of opportunity.",

This was a simple application of artificial intelligence taking of over the job of a real human. There are jobs where humans look at evaluate different factors and take a decision. In the process of carrying out the job the person gets a feedback from the outcome of the decisions taken and tweaks the algorithm needed to take the decision to achieve better results. This is something a manager does. Imagine using artificial intelligence to carry the same function. The beauty of the artificial intelligence manager will be that he will take quicker decisions and correct decisions. The human manager will have unpredicted number of wrong decisions. The AI manager will have zero wrong decisions. It may be possible that the AI manager is unable to take a decision but that will be a predictable occurrence. And such AI applications will be welcome and are being used in real life. ",

With further advances in robotics, there isn't anything that AI can't do, that we can do. Is it likely? This is a big open question, that largely depends on governments and the market. Market may be slower to make it happen, because some hire humans for basically marketing reasons, others because they might still find humans are just a bit better at some things. Governments could artificially limit AI in certain ways to ensure that people can continue to have jobs. Who knows exactly what the future holds though. There is potential for AI to take over, and it seems likely. What happens to people in that case, and how people respond will be huge drivers towards whether or not AI will become the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Will AI kill jobs? Yes, and no, and yes. Back in the 1960s when my father was working as a systems analyst, he spent a great deal of time explaining to people that computers and automation would not replace them, but make them more productive. Eventually, this reassurance turned into a warning, \"Brothers and sisters, you have not even begun to work.\" That is to say, while computers were good at number crunching, employers still needed human beings to run the machines and enter the data. For a while, that meant that fewer people were needed to do the grunt work, but very quickly the sheer volume of documentation that computers generated created new types of grunt work. This process continues through to the present day, with the appetite for Big Data getting bigger and bigger all the time. Even if all creative and/or \"productive\" work is replaced by automation and artificial intelligence (AI), people will still have a role to play as the owners and generators of meaningful data and as the audiences for the output generated by AI. This may fundamentally change the nature of human economic activity, but the principles of supply and demand will still operate. To wit, more and more people will be paid to ask and answer questions for marketing purposes, to provide access to data that only they can provide. People will also get paid to educate themselves, to learn new ways of consuming the economic output of automation and AI. ",

There are also jobs that existed in the past that are rare or extinct today. There will be changes. It is possible that over time the number of unskilled jobs will reduce but the availability of training will increase. It may become more and more necessary to implement a universal basic income, simply because there are people who can not find suitable employment. That is not necessarily a bad thing though. A job is not a vital part of living; it is a means to an end. That end is finding meaning in life and providing for one\u2019s family. If a UBI provides the income, then meaning can be found elsewhere. In the future nobody might have a job they hate, nobody might have to work three jobs to survive. When you meet someone at a party and ask what they do, they might reply \u201cI write novels\u201d or \u201cI paint\u201d or \u201cI bake cakes\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a philosopher\u201d and you would not expect that they are so successful that they earn a living at it, only that they spend a lot of time doing it. There are many ways we might fail to create such a utopian future. If the UBI provided a subsistence income while those working earned ten, a hundred or a thousand times more then it would be very much a distopia with 99% of people trapped in crushing poverty but it doesn\u2019t have to work like that. Any new technology increases overall wealth \u2014 it would not be adopted otherwise. If that new wealth is distributed evenly then nobody has to be poor. ",

Rubber electronics and sensors that operate normally even when stretched to upto 50 percent of their length could work as artificial skin on humanoids according to a new study. They could also give flexible sensing capabilities to a range of electronic devices, the researchers said, like human skin, the material is able to sense strain , pressure and temperature. It is a piece of rubber, but it has the function of circuit and sensors. As you know Sophia, the Humanoid Robot just became a Robot citizen, Oct 2017 ,all most Human or PR stunt.

The most advanced humanoid robot to date has been developed by a team at university of Tokyo named Kengono. The latest information is ,they use these beautiful facial humanoids with all human senses similar to women is going to introduce, first in some African Countries where female population is less compared to males ratio , and later may be in India. So, what ever obenion we are having about AI, is going to be utilized in multiple purposes . Last time when I visited US, While discussing about my daughter's job,as a programmer, in a company, at Newark city , USA, close to Newyork, found myself from the outcome is that they generating artificial general intelligence ( questions , intrepretation ,respone, and answering), and that is in terms of interaction with any human beings with Humonoids. This indicates that we move with Humanoids similarities in allrespects of females with all senses, responses and question and answering. Time has come to envelop troubles arround male humans . I need not tell to all about how the problem starts when our \u2018bunny \u2018 brings two or more beautiful humanoids to his house where wife stands across the doors looking at his facial expressions. The second and crucial problem you have raised is not at all big issue. As already explained earlier, we share the weekly days similar to Germany, weekly days as 4 days and remaining for your time to enjoyment . Production, hard work, and automation will be the out come of robot\u2019s efficiency and intelligence generation (AI work )and planning is by our hard work. Thank you dear. ",

            "answer_text": "What is Artificial Intelligence?  Artificial Intelligence is the stimulation of human intelligence in a machine. It is programmed to think and mimic like humans. Its goal is to use logic and rationale to take action and achieve a predefined goal. AI is not just in robots. AI is on the principle that human intelligence can be mimicked by logic. So it includes learning, reasoning, and perception. Artificial Intelligence is evolving to benefit a lot of industries. Machines are using a cross-disciplinary approach. Simple algorithms are used in a simple application. Complex ones help in strong artificial intelligence. AI can be applied to endless situations. AI is also being tested and used in the healthcare industry. It is used for giving drugs and different treatment to a patient. It is used for surgical procedure. AI is also helping the business to grow. Will AI replace your job? AI may affect human employment. There is an increasing concern that people would lose their jobs. In some cases, there is a possibility that your job can be replaced. Self-driving cars will replace the need to hire a driver. Truck drivers too can lose their job. Industries that have the most likelihood of job losses are mining, consumer and IT industries. Aviation and tourism industry is also seeing the need to upskill. Jobs like data entry, payroll and certain accounting function may be taken over by AI. There is a website \u201cwillrobotstakemyjob\u201d. It tells you if your job can be replaced. Build your future with AI and Machine Learning The new workforce needs to focus on AI and machine learning. From 2015 to 2018, job postings for machine learning grew by 334%. Machine learning engineer is the highest-paid tech professionals only after computer vision engineer\u2019s reports. There are more than 50000 data science and machine learning jobs are vacant due to unavailability of talent. Three-fourth of entire Indian Companies have started to invest in machine learning and data science. Experts believe that AI technologies will be in every new software product by 2020. What opportunities are there in Artificial Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence will bring out new types of jobs. Companies need to ensure that employees learn relevant skills. Future of jobs will be governed by advancement in the field of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. According to the report by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Machines and algorithm are expected to create 133 million new roles but cause 75 million jobs displaced. So new types of jobs will shift in quality, location and permanency. Companies will use contractors and may hire freelancers. There will be the demand for data analyst, software developers and social media specialists. The demand for jobs that require \u201chuman skills\u201d like sales and marketing, innovation and customer service is likely to grow. Hiring will also take a new turn. Staff will be hired according to skill around new technologies. Existing employees will be retrained. Which jobs will AI not replace? There are jobs that AI can't replace. \u25cf Human Resource Manager As the name of this job profile suggests, it has the word \u201chuman\u201d in it. Only a human can manage interpersonal conflict with the help of emotional intelligence. This field is likely to grow as more and more businesses require structure for supporting and helping the employee. \u25cf Sales Manager Sales Manager needs a high level of emotional intelligence. It can\u2019t be replicated by AI. Managers have to interpret data and trends. There is also a need to adapt to a new situation. \u25cf Marketing Manager This profession requires adapting and responding to changes. AI is not ready to replicate it. \u25cf Public Relations Manager PR managers rely on a network of relationship. PR managers have to raise awareness around an issue. It needs emotional intelligence to raise funds. \u25cf Chief Executives It\u2019s hard to teach leadership. And automating is nearly impossible. Executives need to motivate a huge team of people working for them. Can you work for robot leader? \u25cf Event Planners Event Planner is a growing field. It has many parts. And it is a complicated process to plan for an event. There are organization and people skills involved, this makes it almost impossible to automate. \u25cf Writers Writers have to ideate, create, and produce original content. Writing requires creativity, and can\u2019t be replicated by AI. Jobs that AI will create? There will be a lot of jobs that AI will create. Some of them are data detective, ethical sourcing officer, ethical sourcing officer, artificial intelligence business development manager, fitness commitment counsellor, etc. Conclusion There are jobs that AI can\u2019t replace shortly. These jobs require emotional intelligence or teamwork-oriented skill. As of now, AI can\u2019t use emotional intelligence, understand the situational context, and understand nuances as humans do. We need humans to tasks that require human attribute. There may come a time in the future where machines become so complex that they understand human behaviour. They will be able to able to interact with children or adult. Some job may change soon, allowing more time for humans to do that they feel passionate about. AI can\u2019t replace humans easily. Some people prefer to talk to human customer service. A chief executive or manager with strong emotional intelligence will always be in demand. If your job requires a lot of tasks that can be done by robot then you may want to upskill yourself. You can take a course in public speaking, writing, or graphic design. This way, if your job is taken over by AI then you will be more valuable to the hiring manager because of your logistical and creative skill. For more information, you can direct message me. Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they wont. There are no job fairies creating the supply of jobs and deciding when there are too many or not enough. Just apply some simple economic analysis: there will be no work when there is no demand for work to be done. If there is no demand for work to be done, no one needs anything. If you don\u2019t need anything, you don\u2019t need to work. In the future, the poor of today will live the lives of leisure we see in aging celebrities (arguably, many already do), and the working/affluent will live like Jetsons. Everyone will think it is totally unfair, but bottom line is: everyone will be richer and better off in the future than the wealthiest are today, holding country constant. If you don\u2019t believe me, just think about the lives of citizens in Cuba and Venezuela (where a lot of work needs to be done, but isn\u2019t), as compared to Switzerland, which is a technologically advanced country with, arguably, fewer jobs that need doing.

I\u2019m not sure what \u2018AI\u2019 really means in reality, but do I think computers will be \u2018smart\u2019 enough to preform all tasks humans do? Yes. I do. Am I concerned about it? Yes, but not for the reasons typically spoken about. I don\u2019t foresee \u2018skynet\u2019 deciding humans need exterminated. Humans and machines don\u2019t have many overlapping needs, so I don\u2019t see any of the typical reasons for war. I DO, however, see an economic problem. Automation is already gutting the job market. If this expands to virtually all jobs, there will be nothing anyone can do to earn a living. This will require a fairly radical change in the current economic system. ",

Folks like me, who went to graduate school in the 1980s, remember all too well what the world was like, when there was no WWW. No social networks, no easy access to scholarly papers, no streaming of music or movies, only physical newspapers, and so on and so forth. A social networking site like Linked In, which now has over 150 million members just from the US, did not exist 30 years ago. Linked In now makes it possible to run all sorts of statistics on job creation, and it should be a relatively simple project to data mine Linked In to see how many jobs were created by technologies like WWW, or data science. Linked In, for example, estimates that just in the San Francisco Bay Are, the estimated shortage of data scientists is over 30,000! ",

Right now, management is killing our economy and the future. Management is not replacing the jobs lost due to globalism with new careers generated from discontinuous innovation. They play Faux Innovation and demand premiums on their IPOs for doing absolutely nothing beyond spending VC money that they got for a pitch. Yes, there is trouble ahead, but AI is not the problem.

            "answer_text": "According to me, automation and artificial intelligence will lead to an increment as well as decrements in jobs. It is true that a certain percentage of people will suffer but change is something which is inevitable. Changes are bound to happen and it is said that most of the drivers will loose their jobs. However I personally don\u2019t believe something like this is going to happen in India as here no one is following traffic rules. Even if driverless cars come in India the idea will fail as this will lead to unemployment and increase in poverty. Chances are that some repetitive work where human beings are not required will be replaced as a result of increase in automation and artificial intelligence. But again this will take a lot of time as things take time to happen in India and initially the technology will be costly so not everyone will be able to afford it too. However in software Industry AI will bring about a lot of change. It will not eat up the jobs of people in software industry but instead assist them and as a result more and more people shall start pursuing AI and automation as a career path. So yeah it highly depends on the type of work being done by the people so whether they retain their jobs or not is all in their hands.

Humans have two types of jobs: Physical and Cognitive. Until now, only our physical job market was threatened: a robot can tighten a screw, assemble a car, etc. For the first time in history, cognitive jobs that were considered safe and exclusive for humans are under threat. AI can drive your car, take phone calls, translate, etc among the zillion cognitive jobs. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect at them to replace humans.\u2026just an inch better.

Too many use the faulty logic of trying to use the economic situations that we know today and apply sometime the most extreme version of a technology that may exist sometime in the future. What we do know is that AI/Automation/Robotics have the potential to drastically increase total production while using significantly less human labor. Does this mean we heading toward massive unemployment? Does it imply that a significantly portion of the world\u2019s population will become economically irrelevant? I don\u2019t know. What I can be fairly certain of is the following: The discrepancy in Wealth that we already see today will grow even greater.The developing world will have worst of it ( as usual)Control of technology/intellectual property will become a central policy to most of the major countries.Real value will come in things that can not be produced by AI. Namely land and natural resources. We may see an eventual global conflict based in Africa because of this.The power of the Nation State will be slowly usurped by a hodgepodge of large Tech and Financial companies.It is not so much the result of all these actions that will cause problems but the transition period. It will happen so quickly that several generation of people will be shut out of its benefits. Maybe this will cause a great new era in humanity, I don\u2019t know. I do know that those who are not vested in this change will fight it to the bitter end. ",

In our sense, artificial intelligence is the technology that will be the best technology of the decade if we use it perfectly, and most importantly, We have to think about the possibilities and challenges of Ai tools because we already don't know much about machine learning and deep learning. to make it safer and controllable, We need to know everything before we use it for a mass audience. So if we use it after knowing about everything then we can develop the platforms with the perfect balance of human and artificial intelligence.

AI in the form of machines, robots, etc are built to do routine jobs so that the pressure on human resources can be decreased. But we see that machines have started to take over many tasks that were previously done by humans. For example, if we talk about customer service chatbots, what a chatbot really does is guides the customer on the website and helps him or her to make a choice. This provides customers more convenience as there is zero wait time response. Customer service chatbots today have started making the customer support team almost redundant. In no time, there will be no requirement of such a team due to automation through chatbots as customer service bots will be able to solve customer issues. This would help reduce the number of employees needed and hence cut costs. So, AI has started to kill jobs already but we can be sure that it will not completely wipe out the need of humans as machines cannot copy the most important factor called empathy. Emotions are something which has to be felt and hence humans are at an upper hand in this case. ",

It is enough to communicate to it the knowledge of a domain so that it can solve all the problems falling in this domain by reasoning. AI can therefore automate the intellectual part of any job. Even, for example, the most intellectual: computer developer! Since AI needs knowledge fto work, it would be fantastic if knowledge could be generated automatically . According to computer researchers, this is not possible. In fact it is false, this problem is solved since 1986. According to computer scientists it is very difficult to extract knowledge of experts before writing programs because it is necessary to UNDERSTAND the knowledge to be able to transform it into algorithms. That's why programs are so slow to write, so often buggy and thrown in the trash. In fact, it is perfectly useless to understand an expertise and to extract from it a knowledge that we do not understand either, though it is expressed in natural language. To turn it into algorithmic is perfectly useless too. For that it is enough to have a method and it exists! It is La Maieutique, that I invented in 1986. I use it since that date and it works perfectly. It is able to extract the most sophisticated knowledge from the heads of the experts. It allows to write any program, even programs deemed impossible to develop with conventional computing. La Maieutique interviews the expert, draws his know-how on screen in the form of decision trees, extracts the business rules at the same time, transmits them to the AI who reasons about them and shows how it runs in conversational, with explanations of the reasoning and detection of contradictions. You will understand that at this stage we have just automated the work of the computer scientist! The most famous and most irreplaceable job! So it's up to you now to see if your job can be replaced by an AI. ",

The question contains \u201cin the coming years\u201d but I will try to give a much later scenario as well. AI has been around for more than a decade now, it\u2019s just that we are applying the subject to a wider range of subjects and making the consumers experience the power of it. As I see in the coming 5\u201310\u201315 years, AI will do away with some jobs. But at the same time it will also create a whole range of jobs requiring more and better skills. As engineers or professionals, the goal should be to educate yourself and get skilled on advanced technologies. That way your job is safe and you get to play around with latest technologies. If you do not re-skill, you will be fired and there will be another person (with superior skills) given your job. Get the point? Much later, and I am talking of post-2050, the situation will be much different which is difficult to predict now. Somewhere around these time, experts, researches will need to decide if they want to make AI powerful enough to replace human beings. Whether AI enabled systems will be able to communicate among themselves without any human intervention? If things go to that, it might become very difficult for human beings - to what extent, I would not predict today! ",

If you have a job this year you will probably still have a job in coming decades. Humanoid robots still have material shortages and battery life problems. They can\u2019t run for much more than an hour without recharging which takes hours. ",

            "answer_text": "What is AI? Artificial Intelligence is the process of programming computers to work smartly and make decisions like humans. It comes under the category of computer science. The primary purpose of AI is to substitute humans so that complex decisions related to the business could be taken. How is AI impacting jobs? The impact of Artificial Intelligence on jobs varies by category and industry in which AI is going to be used. The future report's prediction shows that there will be a revolutionary change in the jobs by 2025. An IT professional should only focus on the types of jobs that will be created with the advent of AI instead of caring about the loss of jobs. It is true that some people might lose their jobs because machines will deal with the data and boring jobs instead of humans. But, the truth is not complete reality. A lot more interesting jobs will be created when AI will be abundantly used in almost all the industries. Read more visit here - AI will Kill or Create Jobs in Future - Zimyo ",
