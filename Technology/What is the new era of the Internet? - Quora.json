            "answer_text": "A dream, really. The idea of a self-organizing, cooperative mesh network that will just pass any traffic is nearly as old as networking itself. In real life: Device density eventually drops off, and someone has to manage a link to other sections of dense devices. Long haul links ain\u2019t free.Someone has to troubleshoot misbehaving nodes and take them offline. Diagnosticians ain\u2019t free.Someone has to make sure that nefarious devices that intentionally steal data or disrupt communications don\u2019t get in the mix. Security ain\u2019t free.People will abuse any free resource into unusability. Abuse defense ain\u2019t free.Some applications need faster or better quality connections in a network. Managing quality of service ain\u2019t free.Devices that pass more traffic need more electricity. Power ain\u2019t free.Wireless devices need dedicated bands or need to contend with other users in the free bands. Wireless channel plans and audits ain\u2019t free.The list goes on and on. The idea of a free, self-organizing network is seductively attractive, which is why it keeps popping up. Anyone that has spent more than a trivial amount of time managing a Real Network\u2122 knows how unlikely that a \u201cnew era\u201d Internet as envisioned in the linked article will replace the Internet As We Know It.
