            "answer_text": "I worked as executive assistant to a very exacting and extremely wealthy entrepreneur, in my twenties. My job was interesting, if a bit chaotic. I went wherever my boss went. If he was in a meeting, I was there to make sure he had everything he needed, take notes, arrange food for the executives, coffee, whatever they required. I kept his schedule, intercepted calls and people, filed, typed letters, the usual sort of thing. Lots of late nights and skipped meals and too much coffee. He lived onsite, so I drove him to the airport, did his shopping and arranged his meals. I learned a lot from him about the corporate world and the industry. Many years later, I worked for him again, in a different capacity, cooking for his guests at lavish private parties, and also for his construction crew, which was by far the most fun I have ever had in a job. I was a fly on the wall in a house with 10 men for two years. I learned a lot about men, and what gentle creatures they are. It was the perfect job for me at that time in my life. I smile when I think about them. In the intervening years, I also ran a small business for another very wealthy man. He at one time owned a very posh hotel abroad, and several other successful ventures. He was a devout Christian, a humble man, who treated me like a beloved daughter. It was the perfect job for me at the time, running a rural motel. I was left to my own judgement and told to run it as if it were my own. It came to life and prospered and became a place of safe harbour for an ever-changing flow of wonderful people. There was music and laughter and peace. I loved it. My boss would come out with family once a year for a huge party, with great platters of delicious exotic foods, and he and I would sit outside in the afternoon and smoke sheesha and play backgammon and talk about God and the universe. I still miss him. ",

            "answer_text": "The same way it is for working for any other kind of family. Except they have money. For some reason people don\u2019t understand the fact that there is a incredible amount of diversity among wealthy people just as there are among any other economic class. This includes the way they treat people their politics etc. For example I worked for a very wealthy family that knew literally the most powerful people in the country Rockefellers Vanderbilts Politicians from local up to the presidents of the US, etc. And they treated me with them at most respect much more so than I have found what other people of lower classes etc. They were incredibly encouraging they were warm and receptive they were also very liberal and that came in to play with their influence and perspectives on social policy taxation marriage etc. And the taxation thing was cancer present knowing how much they were paying.
