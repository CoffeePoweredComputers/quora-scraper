            "answer_text": "Like the other guy that answered I own Mastercard and Visa. However I recently purchased a small sliver of Paypal. MA and V are trading now at all time highs and PYPL is down something like 10% from it\u2019s most recent highs. They also acquired Honeybee lately and I really don\u2019t know what they will do with it but they paid $4 billion for it. I like stocks that are trading down because of a large acquisition. I figure the lost revenue in the investment is priced in so I should perhaps buy and see if that investment becomes accretive. PYPL also managed to acquire and close on 70% of Gopay. This gives them a foothold in the coveted Chinese market which other fintechs are trying to get into themselves. Over all I own way more MA and V then I do PYPL but I have my eggs in three baskets now. I will continue to slowly add to my shares of PYPL on any over all market weakness and buy any pullbacks. ",

            "answer_text": "Paypal did better than I expected in the past year, it\u2019s up 32.55%. I don\u2019t own it but I think it\u2019s a reasonable investment. I had several choices in the financials/payments segment that I liked better: Visa, which is up 45.25% in the same period, and Mastercard which is up 60.49%. I think for the coming year, Visa and Mastercard still look better than Paypal, and I will hold them, as well as Fiserv, which is up 61.35%. ",
