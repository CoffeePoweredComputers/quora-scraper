            "answer_text": "Starting a career in blockchain technology is not different perhaps than starting your career in any technology and I think I'm case in point for this. I grew up as a person who was naturally curious and that kind of put me on the path of a technical career and whether it was initially creating software, creating teams that solve problems for customers, or creating brands and products, that curiousness stays there. To me it's all about the creative process and the medium is something that you have to spend enough time to master. So for me at first it was programming languages - take the time to collect the experience that you need to really master the craft but also mark your time. You really should be working on something that you feel passionate about! I always say \"your job has to be at least 51% awesome but that means it can be 49% ehhh and that's OK as long as you keep it above the 51%!\" With that said, also realize that as you grow, the real benefit back is leading and whether it's becoming a lead voice in a field or a team leader of a team, your company is going to value you not just for your individual contribution but also for your leadership. So find a podium to stand on and share your opinions. Pick the medium by which you're most comfortable with. Whether that's GitHub contributing code to open source, or another platform, find a way to get what you do out there. I think as a career in blockchain that's probably a good general foundation. The next trait that really helps to keep in mind is that blockchain is a team sport. You can't just be an individualist because with blockchain the technology part is important but it's just one part of the bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, the BLT, the business, legal, and technical sides! It's just the technical part. To be a great blockchain technologist you also have to understand enough about business and legal in the blockchain world. So if you're looking to start a career in blockchain, be curious beyond your current field of expertise and I'd like to say that most blockchain technologists also quickly become economists. So be prepared to stretch beyond your comfort zone and also blockchain is a team sport meaning the value of blockchain is created by the group not by the individual. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow! Everyone here has good answers but they make it seem like it\u2019s an impossible task to find a job in the crypto space. While it does take a ton of learning to become a developer in the space that\u2019s not the only way to get involved. Before working in cryptocurrency/blockchain I was a banker. Cryptocurrency was my passion and I would spend pretty much all my free time outside of work researching various projects and learning more about how they work. I found a project that really piqued my interest and I joined their community. After hanging around I noticed that the team members weren't always around to answers questions from the community and since I had done my research and I was able to answer those questions I did just that. After this went on for a couple of weeks I reached out to the team and asked how I could get more involved. They asked if I wanted to be their community manager! I was not expecting a job offer. I took them up on their offer. This was a great opportunity for me to figure out what my passion was and what I was good at. I honed in my skills and then took a leap to my current job here at Wyre as the Community Growth Lead. If you\u2019re looking for a job in the space here is what I would recommend. Figure out what you like to do and what your skills are? Is it working with people, writing, building websites, do you know about compliance, are you a good designer, do you have experience trading?Find a company or project you are really excited about and join their community.

Jump in and start helping! Companies appreciate the initiative.Check the project's website for any job openings. If there is something that matches your skill set apply for the job!If you want to take a general look at openings in the space head over to http://angel.co and search \u201cblockchain\u201d & \u201cyour interest/skill\u201dSend out some resumes and take the time to write a personal letter to each company.
