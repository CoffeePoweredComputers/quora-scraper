            "answer_text": "Yep - HUGE. IBM periodically reinvents itself, and takes strategic decisions to sell off whole segments while they are still profitable (eg PC\u2019s, hard disks) but unlike (eg) Philips who are focussing on development and brand value, IBM is not only selling off but also buying. I believe that, if the Strategic benefits arise (which is not likely) IBM would not even hesitate to re-enter the consumer market. IBM intends to stay big. Forever. Google for IBM staff numbers and turnover if you want details. ",

They sold that division to Lenovo in 2005. IBM builds and sells large systems. See this answer for more details: Ken Gregg's answer to Why did IBM stop making computers? ",
