            "answer_text": "Hahaahhaha dear friend you have asked a correct question.But well love is subjective. Well firstly understand love is all about feelings and emotions and its nothing like a magic or something out of the world. For some people love is simple like whether the other person wants you in his/her life or not and for some love is to daily proving it by actions. Well some women do fall in love when they are innocent and think you are the whole world for them. But after few breakups things completely change now for them as now its all about securing their life with the best available option. Anyways as you can see from evolution of humans,Men went out for hunting and woman took care of the babies . Earlier things were simple as it was only about food for survival and the woman choose the man according to his physical strength and ability to hunt for the good . Now coming to the present world , the Biology of woman has not changed instead the mode of getting the food for survival has changed. Now woman look for man who has money so her can get food for her and the baby. Well finally what I can say is Love is available for free but Marriage is not :-) ",

            "answer_text": "A heck yes. Just as anyone. But, wait, I can\u2019t generalize. Can I? I can speak for myself not for others. The kind of love we often mistake to be love is the love which is a very static feeling for a very temporary period. It is like a weekend that you\u2019d love to have just because you have week days to attend to. You need sometime for yourself. Likewise, you desire to have someone for yourself. Just as much as any regular other things you\u2019d require to have. I am not underestimating love. I am just stressing on the point that, at some or the other times, everyone experiences love. The difference starts to form with respect to how we deal with it or how we react to it. There is no denying that everyone likes to be pampered, to be cared for, to be someone\u2019s priority always. For the kind of love which has all of these still isn\u2019t sometimes valued right. Well, if you ask me, love is never truly interpretable. You\u2019ll never be able to figure out as to, if you fell for it or it fell in place for you. ",

You won\u2019t find a single person who would say that they don\u2019t ever want to feel the love of a spouse/partner. But more often than not, people don\u2019t get the chance to fall in love. Point it, true love happens only if you have been fortunate enough to find the right person, \u2018the one\u2019. How many women, or men for that matter, do you think are that lucky? So, yes, women do truly fall in love, but only if its with the right person. And the sad part is, most women, and probably men too, go through their entire life only believing that they\u2019re truly in love when they\u2019re actually not. Their brains have been programmed to think that way. And that\u2019s social seasoning for you. ",

And then, that cute boy walks away and they move on with the lives they actually live because fantasies are lovely, but they are not real life. And your fantasy of you and that cute girl is just a fantasy. In real life, she will fart and you will burp garlic and the two of you will not be the two of you in your fantasy. Welcome to real life in which women are human, just like you. ",
