            "answer_text": "Its simple, if you understand how the technology works. To track a phone it must be able to send and receive signals. A phone may be tracked by either wireless signal, wifi signal, or gps signal. If you were to block or interfere the signal from being sent or recieved, the phone cannot be tracked. Signals are electromagnetic waves, it can travel thru all sorts of things, but not everything. A dense enough object can absorb the signal being transmitted or recieved, also enough \u201cstuff\u201d in between the phone and the tower can also block signals. Signals have the most trouble traveling thru concrete, metal, and the earth. This is why you often have little or no reception in tall/large buildings, parking structures, underground, or inside a building with a continuous metal roof. Knowing how the phone works gives you clues how to block its signal. Storing it inside a metal box for example, will block the signal from being transmitted or an incoming one to be received. So it's simple- wrap it in some metal (ie, alumnium foil)- and the phone cannot be traced until you remove it from the metal container. Your location can still be seen when you use the phone outside the metal container, and leaving the phone in the container will also drain its battery super fast because its trying constantly to connect to a tower. A more practical solution is get a new phone with a new number. There\u2019s no law against doing that, and if the cops want to track the new phone and number they'll need to know what number and a court order. The number may be unlisted and private. This is why most criminals have a bunch of burner phones- if they suspect the cops are on to them they'll ditch it for another one. ",

Call no one that are known acquaintances if you do use a burner phone and destroy that phone immediately. Borrow someone elses phone. The POLICE must gave a warrant to tap a phone so chances are good they wont be using voice recognition on billions of phones waiting for you to make a call but then they can tap you mothers lines waiting for you to call her. Do not provide details of your true intentions. So if you want to meet at the mall use prearranged words to indicate that. Or use cryptic words and codes that require itemd the LEO does not possess a book code is good. Remeber that the person meeting you is not skilled in shaking a tail so they might lead the LEOs to you. Best to disavow all friendships with everyone you know. But you can not just right out say what you meant or need as that give clues. Also CASH is king never use credit or debit or other electronic means to buy anything especially the burner phones that can eventually be tracked down and the imei can be flagged for tracing and tracking. In the 21st century if you use tech its hard to fly under the radar. Get ready for life looking over shoulders and trusting no one. Always be ready to move and never settling down with anyone. Once you drop your gaurd you will be picked up. Always destroy a burner phone after its use you wont be able to use it many times before its traced to you. Burner phones need to not have gps this makes tracking and pin pointing them difficult but not impossible. Also DO NOT port your number heck just get rid of it all together. That number is how they will locate you. ",

Simply put, ditch your current cell phone at a bus station where it will be easily picked up and taken wherever and walk away, go to a pre paid phone and use it only when needed to, take out battery if you can when not in use. Best advice is this, if your a fugitive that they are looking for, then likely you committed a major crime; generally most \u201c fugitives \u201c are not sought by law enforcement they are entered into NCIC and the police wait for them to be stopped and info ran on them to catch them; if your being chased as a fugitive, turn yourself in and deal with it, better than running the rest of your life and never being able to let your guard down!

A fugitive could conceivably place his/her phone inside a faraday cage, essentially completely cutting off the phone electronically (including the GPS) and would prevent anyone including law enforcement and your cell phone service provider from tracking the phone or even knowing whether or not the phone was still intact or destroyed. As long as the cell phone remained inside it's cage, it couldn't be tracked by anyone no matter where you took it. However, the moment you removed the phone from it's faraday cage to use it, it's exact location would be instantly pinpointed; which renders the whole effort pointless. As Rick and Jon mentioned, this is where 'one-time-use' or burner phones come into play. ",

Thanks to technological developments in the wake of 9/11, it can be presumed that if the authorities are tracking your cell phone (if they know that you have one in your name or that you commonly use and they know the cell phone number) if you are a fugitive. Obtaining several pre-paid cell phones, along with new SIM cards, are the best route to go. While these can also be traced, unless you call someone who the police know or suspect that you might contact, they will have to use other methods to track you. It\u2019s probably best to buy these in cash and to do so well in advance of your needing them. Again, your personal cell phone will be compromised if you are being tracked. It\u2019s best that you rid yourself of the device as soon as possible if you are seeking to maintain a low profile. ",

You can do this with a password from any xfinity customer. You don't get 100% coverage in all areas but as long as your at home or near a hot spot you don't have to worry about your phone being taped. Google tapes it but they don't release it and when feds ping it it shows a location nowhere near you. ",

Buy burner phones to use, but don't buy multiple at once, as they could track the purchase after the first one is used, and start tracking the others without you knowing they were compromised. Just buy a phone, use it once, and hand it off to someone else to have.  Better to hand it off, than ditch it.  Pulling the battery and throwing it in the rubbish will stop a tracking, but they'll already know where, and a clean line of dots is less confusing to follow than 10 lines all going in different directions without clarity as to when you had it, and when someone else had it.

Turn it off, and even detach the battery, if you don\u2019t want to be traced. Simple. But, the moment you power up again, it becomes visible on the net. For long term invisibility, you will need to buy several prepaid cell phones (referred to as \u201cburner\u201d phones). Use each one once and then discard. Even then, if the number you CALL is being monitored, then even your prepaid cell can be back traced. But, by then, you will have left the area you were standing in when you called. Your best method of communications will probably be by using the internet and familiarizing yourself with anonymous servers. These days it is getting harder and harder to communicate without trace.

Even if you bought a burner they can track your credit cards you used to pay for it they can track what you bought then contact the cell company and get your phone number. If you paid in cash that makes it harder but it is possible because of you bought it locally they can check camera footage and obtain the information that way, if not they can check your family's phone records and see if you called by checking numbers. It is possible though. ",
