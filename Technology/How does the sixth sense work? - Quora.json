            "answer_text": "Humans have way more than six senses, so I'm assuming by sixth sense you mean a paranormal sense.  Apparently it doesn't work all that well. Too bad that, too, because the James Randi Educational Foundation has a $1 million prize available that any person can claim if they can prove in a scientifically controlled experiment that they have paranormal abilities that work significantly better than would be expected by random chance. It's been there to claim since the 1960s and nobody has claimed it yet. Here's how the challenge works. Scientists put psychic's paranormal claims to the test. ",

            "answer_text": "Your existing senses are constantly bombarding you with information that you're not consciously aware of. Some of that gets into the brain, and there's evidence to suggest that it may have an effect on your decision making processes. But your 'gut feeling' may have nothing to do with sensory information; it might just be old ingrained thought processes protesting against new conclusions. ",
