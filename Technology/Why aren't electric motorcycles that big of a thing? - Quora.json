            "answer_text": "They are quite \u201cbig a thing\u201d. There\u2019s a lot happening on that front. Look, I love motorcycling. But I also have a car, because motorcycles are kind of inconvenient for transporting more than myself and a single passenger. They aren\u2019t much fun when there is ice on the road. And bringing home a week\u2019s shopping on a motorbike gets ridiculous really quickly. So most motorcyclists (Relax - I said \u201cmost\u201d, not \u201call) have a motorcycle AND a car. I haven\u2019t looked at the statistics, but I\u2019m absolutely certain that the number of cars eclipses the number of motorbikes on the road. So let\u2019s turn to electric vehicles. Tesla, Zoes, Volts, etc. are now a normal part of the traffic on the streets (in Switzerland, anyway). But they are still a tiny minority compared to IC (internal combustion) engined cars. And if we assume that the ratio of electric motorbikes to electric vehicles is similar to IC motorbikes to IC cars, then we have a small number of electric motorbikes indeed. But there are bikes out there, and it\u2019s no longer unusual to see them. Zeros or electric scooters are quite common. In general, the popularity of electric motorbikes might be due to people actually LIKING the engine sound, and the whirring of an electric motor\u2026 just doesn\u2019t have the same effect. Speaking for myself, I\u2019d LOVE a Zero. If anyone feels the desperate desire to gift me a bike\u2026 \u2192Zero DSR/BF: Zero Motorcycles Oooooo\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say no\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The energy density of fossil fuels is unmatched. Did you know a Tesla Model S p90d weighs 4934lb, and goes (*GOES*) around 300 miles, give or take. A Mercedes CLS 500 fully fueled weighs almost 1000lb less. The Tesla carries all that weight at axle height, so it hides the weight from handling, pretty well. Weight is the enemy of motorcycling, except for big fat cruisers and tourers. So, to make an EV bike fun in anything but a drag race, you have to make it light, and that means a smaller battery, so you get smaller range. I once had a 100 mile range motorcycle\u2014a Honda Hawk GT. My commute was nearly that every day, and I visited the gas station on the way home every stinkin\u2019 day. Oh, I\u2019d have loved to be able to fuel up in my own garage. But that bike was strictly limited to commuting, and very local twisty riding. But it WAS great fun in the twisties, with improve suspension and brakes I gave it, because it was LIGHT. Meanwhile, I was also riding a 1990 Kawasaki Concours 1000 that would get over 250 miles between gas stops. And still was fun in the twisties. Twisties in other states. Heavier, north of 600lb, again with suspension and brake improvements. I can\u2019t imagine an EV bike that weighs what the Concours did, but only gets 150miles, being very much fun. That\u2019s not even mentioning that lots of bikers deeply appreciate clutch manipulation, and whatever rhythm of pandemonium the thing beneath your legs is doing. ",
