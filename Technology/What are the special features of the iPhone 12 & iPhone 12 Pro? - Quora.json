            "answer_text": "The combination of 5G and App Clips. Nobody is Talking About 5G and Death of Apps[1] This would be the first time the iPhone would have the capability of web apps paired with millimetre wave technology. Why is that important? Originally Answered: What feature will fundamentally change the iPhone when the iPhone 12 comes out? Fundamentally, the higher speeds of 5G coupled with other factors (like the decline of apps and rise of web apps amongst others) will accelerate the development of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) into a high functioning powerhouse that can work alongside the native App Clips. This would change the user experience for the iPhone, and also change the idea of app storage. Not only that, it has the potential to shake the travel, e-commerce, and retail sectors by altering the app ecosystem. Superficially, the push by Apple itself will drive competitors to clean up their instant/mini/web app mess. Let\u2019s face it, Apple\u2019s influence on the smartphone market is undeniable, on the level of audio jackless-ness and notches-ness. Moreover, we have governments like the EU commission trying to erase app/play store monopoly; rising aggregator/super apps; and overpowering dominance of top apps, all working against the favour of full mobile app developers. The decline of the (full) apps is not so unthinkable anymore.   In this article, it further explains the impact this might have on gig economy, sharing economy, group purchasing, digital payments, and e-commerce.
