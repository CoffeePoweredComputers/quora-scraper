            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s worth it or not but I\u2019ll give out the differences between Xs and Xr Screen Xs has OLED, which in many ways, superior than Xr LCD, but note that to normal people(not very tech guy),LCD seems just fine. Xs also has 3D Touch where a featured that doesn\u2019t exist on Xr as it is replaced by haptic touch. Most people found it not that useful but for me personally I love it. There were a lot of critics about Xr having the pixels density of 321 PPl and having the resolutions of 828p, I\u2019ve used it and honestly, it\u2019s about the same as iPhone 8 screen. Xr also has a larger screen size than Xs. The border, also known as the bezels are a tad bit thicker on Xr. Camera They both have the same main camera and Xs has an additional telephoto lens, for optical zoom. The addition of second camera also helped in depth sensing as for the Xs, you can just shoot about anything (people, objects, etc) in portrait mode. Where as Xr, can only take picture of people in portrait mode. Also note that when in portrait mode, Xs is using the second x2 lens, so the picture is a little bit zoomed in. The front facing camera is same on both Xs and Xr. Processors Both Xs and Xr have the same A12 Bionic. They are probably the fastest chip you can get in the smartphone industry today. Built material Xs features a steel frame which undoubtedly, much stronger than Xr aluminium frame. According to drop test done by many people, Xs is likely to survive but a drop but Xr might not. However, glass is still glass and glass will always break if enough force is given. Apple did claim that the glass used on both Xs and Xr is the strongest there is on the market.( take it with a grain of salt) So, never drop your phone. Note that Xs stainless steel frame is a scratch magnet. Without a good cover, scratches will surely be seen everywhere on the steel frame. It can also be polished by metal polish and it\u2019ll look just like a new one after polishing. Battery Xr has a slightly larger battery compared to Xs. It\u2019ll last you through a day of normal plus some heavy usage. Water resistant Xr has water resistant rating if IP67 compared to Xs IP68. This means that Xr can survive just 1 meter of water for 30mins, while the Xs can do 2 meters of water for 30mins. Also know that Apple doesn\u2019t provide warranty for water damage. So it comes down to personal reference, Xr starts at $749 for the 64GB, Xs starts at $999 for the same 64GB. Which one do you think is more worth it ?? By paying $250 more, you get a colour vibrant OLED screen, 3D Touch, additional telephoto camera, a tad bit smaller battery which is fine as the phone is smaller, stainless steel band around the phone and better water resistant ( not much tho ) . To be frank, you aren\u2019t losing out much if you chose Xr, plus you get to pay $250 less than Xs and you\u2019ll get a variety of colour choices for Xr. ",

            "answer_text": "Screen The iPhone XR is equipped with a 6.1-inch 1792x828 resolution LCD screen, while the iPhone XS is equipped with a 5.8-inch 2436x1125 resolution OLED screen that supports HDR display. In short, although the iPhone XR has a larger screen, the resolution and screen panel specifications are lower.  Camera iPhone XR is equipped with a combination of 7 million front and 12 million rear cameras, with a single camera on the front and back. The iPhone XS is equipped with a front camera of 7 million and a rear camera of 12 million + 12 million. The specifications are consistent with the previous iPhone X. However, it uses a new sensor and a larger single pixel, which improves the camera experience. The iPhone XR is a single camera, while the XS is a dual camera, which naturally takes better photos and supports portrait mode.  3D Touch support iPhone XR does not support 3D Touch pressure-sensitive touch function, instead of vibration feedback. However, the iPhone XS still supports 3D Touch. For Apple fans who like to use 3D Touch pressure-sensitive touch, there are still certain advantages.  Battery life The iPhone XR's battery life will be better than the XS. Although the iPhone XR and XS both support 18W fast charging and wireless charging, the standard charger is still the same as the previous generation, 5V/1A. To experience fast charging, you need to buy a fast charge charger separately. SIM card support The iPhone XR supports dual cards, but the iPhone XS uses a single card design and does not support dual card. iPhone colour iPhone XR offers up to 6 colours including blue, white, black, yellow, coral, and red special editions. It is the iPhone with the richest colour matching. The iPhone XS is only based on the silver and deep space grey that the previous generation iPhone has already had, and a gold version has been added.  Price Now the iPhone XR is from $599 on Apple official website. The iPhone XS has been removed on Apple official website, but we still find it is selling on some e-commerce and it priced at $1,008. You will see that the price between the iPhone XR and iPhone XS vary a lot. But the used iPhone XS is only $725(The price is from Cellphoneage) which is much cheaper than the new one. From the above comparison, the iPhone XR and the iPhone XS are almost the same. They are both full-screen design with glass fuselage, equipped with Apple A12 processor, support Face ID and NFC functions. So which one is better? This mainly depends on the budget and the demand for dual cards. If you have a sufficient budget and not require the dual card. The best choice is iPhone XS. The Apple XR screen is relatively low and does not have dual cameras and 3D Touch. The experience is slightly reduced, but the performance is not bad. The most important thing is to support dual cards, which is mainly suitable for people that want to install two SIM cards and have a limited budget. ",
