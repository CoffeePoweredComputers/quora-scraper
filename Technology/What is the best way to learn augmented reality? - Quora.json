Let us try and understand some basic aspects of Augmented Reality first and then let us delve into a working project. Definition of Augmented Reality Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are \"augmented\" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory. How does AR work? In simple words, AR deploys a virtual image by using computer vision and tracks it to a physical point in your live environment. Because of this tracking, when you move the camera around, (take it closer or further away) the object is able to sustain, scale and optimize its location in your view of the real world. The simplest form of tracking is achieved by a device through a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope in order to figure out your position automatically. There are applications that combine the power of GPS with AR to give a more realistic experience. Technical details of how AR work? When building your own Augmented Reality-based application, you\u2019d be dealing with 2 things: Vuforia: In simple terms, Vuforia Engine is a software platform for creating Augmented Reality apps. Using Vuforia, developers can easily add advanced computer vision functionality to any application, allowing it to recognize images and objects, and interact with spaces in the real world.Unity: In simple terms, Unity is a cross-platform game engine. Unity gives users the ability to create games in both 2D and 3D.So, the key to learning Augmented Reality is to combine Vuforia with Unity. Let us see a great example of Augmented Reality in action.

Anyway, I can guide through the Augmented Reality technology as Our Incredible Augmented Reality Future is Here - the best way to learn Augmented Reality. As we going towards future, the future of Augmented Reality (AR) has become very bright and very clear as well. AR is a fast-growing field, and has even more potential financial prospects than Virtual Reality (VR). AR apps can be effective both with the use of a head-mounted display, or with just the use of a smartphone.  Definition of Augmented Reality AR turns the environment into a digital interface via placing virtual objects in the real world, and in real-time actually. AR adds sounds, graphics, hap-tic feedback and smell to the natural (real) world as it existsHow Augmented Reality Works We have been entertained with the video games for nearly 30 years. After all, computer graphics have become much more sophisticated, and also game graphics are pushing the barriers of photorealism. AR blurs the line between what's computer-generated and what's real and by enhancing what we see, feel, hear, and smell What to Expect from Augmented Reality The technology is on a quick and speedy rise thanks to the success of Pok\u00e9mon GO. Since then, the public is even hungry for more apps that will add something to their real-world. From gaming to business, we may be entering a golden age for this technologyAR Gaming Market Ready to Surge According to experts, AR game development will fuel a $284.93 billion market by 2023. The huge potential of Augmented Reality games should come as no surprise - also, satisfying the Augmented Reality gaming market will not be easy. But, there is an immense amount of young talent in this field in the likes of AppReal-VR - company that is ideally suited to serve as a outsourcing partner and throughout the years they deliver expertise in every stage of software development. AR apps are usable and executable through the entire process, thus by ensuring that both - developers and clients - alike maintain a full experience and perception of the app\u2019s progress and direction Augmented Reality: Apple and Google's next battleground Well, we all know that this \"rivalry\" will go on a further stages. Apple with their amazing tool ARKit and on the other hand, Google with Tango. Since 2014, Google has announced the Tango project that ended up in specialized smartphones and tablets from Lenovo and Asus - but Apple in the summer 2017 started their ARKit project and since then it become very popular. ARKit is what AR badly needs and this is where the real potential lies",
