            "answer_text": "Does excess energy from solar panels damage the system? Your question is a bit ambiguous. By \u201csystem\u201d do you mean the grid system or the PV electronics system. The next point to consider is where you are located. In California and the 11 or so states that align with them they have implemented a system refereed to as Rule 21. This requires the PV inverters adjust the AC output to support the grid. Adjusting the power to compensate for the grid. When it is fully implemented sometime around June of 2020 the utilities will have aggregate control of the output to support the grid. Adjusting power factor, voltage, power output and frequency as needed. This is defined in UL1741-SA if you want to look it up. If you are referring to damage to the inverter from the array of solar modules then the inverter should protect itself from too high a voltage or current generated by the array. Some inverters clip the excess power other shutdown the array or the inverter(open the circuit) if the array is out of spec. What the inverter does to deal with the power is defined by the design of the inverter. But too much current is usually a simple inline fuse. To much voltage can have a couple of different ways as mentioned above. This is why you should design the system very carefully. The voltage changes with temperature. So the lower the temp the higher the voltage. You should always design to the record low temp and your average high temp for the string voltage. Leave room at the top to accommodate for cloud edge effect and you should be fine. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question when the electrical grid system was set up in the UK . The sources of power were centrally controlled and predominantly large scale big power stations mostly coal burning with a few nuclear in the mix. Along comes a load of solar panels nailed to domestic and industrial roofs . The power produced is connected to the grid without any great control the power generators cannot switch the panels on or off at will . So the panels produce DC power which is passed through electronics to give AC at 230 volts ( used to be 240 but that has been changed ) hidden inflationary. The issue of all this unregulated power is the grid owners can only regulate the big power stations and perhaps some solar farms they have. More or less electrical power in the system used to show up by a change in the AC frequency 50HZ in UK. As power demand increased the old steam turbines in the power stations would slow down as the load increased. Given that the solar power system cannot increase power at will and has to deal with clouds covering sun it is a bit of a variable supply. The only fast response supplying systems are diesel and Gas turbine generation systems. The fastest response generator is/was A pumped water storage system in North Wales that pumped water by electric up to a great big lake and then let it run back down through generators water turbines . This could run for very short durations and was designed to thake care of sudden peak demand ie thousands of electric kettles going on at half time on a Saturday football match on the television back in the days of only a few TV station's.
