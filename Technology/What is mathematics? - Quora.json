            "answer_text": "Math is applied logic. That is the simplest definition I can muster. I realize that this just raises two more questions... Logic is a set of rules for manipulating ideas. The rules begin with a way to represent ideas (for example, statements about the world that can be either true or false). The rules add a list of ways to manipulate those ideas. Then we add a list of postulates, which are basically just ideas that we declare to be true, with no need for proof. When you put that all together, you have a set of rules that allow you to prove that some ideas are true or false. Of course the proof is only interesting if you accept the rules themselves to be true, so selecting the right rules is of utmost importance. Logic is something that you do in your imagination, but long ago, people noticed that if you select the rules carefully, the things that you prove under those rules also end up being true in reality. This is one of the things that make logic so useful and interesting. Applying logic means identifying the ideas that you want to manipulate, and finding rules that allow you to manipulate those ideas in useful ways. \"Useful\" often means \"in ways that match observed reality,\" but that is not strictly necessary. Four-dimensional mathematics had been known and studied for years before Einstein discovered how useful it can be for describing our universe. Logicians have a favorite phrase: \"reason about.\" It's a verb. To \"reason about\" ideas is to apply logic to them, so that you can determine what is true or false about those ideas, and to find new ideas that must be true or false as a result of the ideas and the logical rules that you started with. If the ideas that you want to reason about are quantities, then arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that you will find most useful. (How many apples do I have? How many apples does my wife have? How many apples do we both have? If we and two friends each have three apples, then how many apples do we all have?) If the ideas that you want to reason about are relationships between quantities, then algebra will be useful. (If we have six apples, and I will eat twice as many apples as she, then how many apples should we each take to work?) If the ideas that you want to reason about are changes in quantities, then we start getting into calculus. This branch of mathematics is very useful for ideas involving simple physics. (If I drop this apple, how fast will it be traveling when it hits the floor?) If the ideas that you want to reason about are shapes, then there are two branches of mathematics that might be useful to you - geometry, and topology. Which branch will be most useful depends on what you want to know about those shapes. And so on. If you have an idea that can be expressed precisely, there is probably already a branch of mathematics dedicated to reasoning about those ideas. If you are a religious person, you should frequently and fervently thank the Creator for giving us a universe that behaves logically and mathematically. Life would be far more difficult if we could not use math to make predictions about the world around us. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.\" -Henri Poincar\u00e9. I would define mathematics as the study of structure divorced from context. In mathematics, we study various structures: numbers, groups, geometric objects, etc. We study their patterns and figure out how they work and interconnect. I would make the argument that anything existing in the universe and anything that can be cooked up by the human mind that has some sort of structure to it can be studied mathematically. Of course, what one might argue is that disciplines like physics, chemistry, and biology do the same thing: they search for the physical patterns and structures that exist out in the world. What is the key difference between these pursuits and mathematics? The key is that in all of the above-mentioned physical sciences, any problem that you consider has a certain context, a certain specific interpretation. An oscillating pendulum is not the same thing as a vibrating string which is not the same thing as a spring with a mass attached to it. However, from a mathematical point of view, all of these systems are essentially the same thing. Once you strip away all of the physical details and particular context of a problem, what remains is its mathematical content. The beauty of this is that by considering things so abstractly, you begin to see connections that you would not otherwise recognize. The motion of a pendulum, a string, and a spring are all described using sinusoidal functions. That same periodic behavior might be observed just as well for sound waves, and light waves, and ocean waves. When you have a perspective this broad, you can begin by looking at a problem one way, flip it around, realize that you can contextualize it in a completely different way, and then start using the tools of a seemingly unconnected theory to solve your problem. In my mind, that is what makes mathematics beautiful, and what makes it different to just about every other endeavor that mankind has ever attempted. ",
