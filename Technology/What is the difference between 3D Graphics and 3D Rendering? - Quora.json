            "answer_text": "These terms are certainly open to debate and interpretation, yet I\u2019ll break it down into a flow in an attempt to make it logical: 3D wireframes are the basics of a 3D model  3D models are artificial objects created in a 3D modeling software. They are typically detailed versions of the 3D wireframe such that they contain some base surfaces and textures  3D rendering is the process that identifies light sources, reflections, light interactions, occlusion, shadows, etc and renders those calculations into the textures of the image and surrounding environment. In the cube above, it has already been rendered, (a little), but with monotone surfaces it\u2019s very easy. The output after rendering properly is a 3D rendered graphic aka 3D image aka 3D render  These cubes give a good sense, yet they are very simplistic and take seconds to render. Here\u2019s an example we made for a client that took several hours  Note in order to be 3D, one should be able to move the objects around or even move within the environment, otherwise they are simply called 2D renders. This example is a 2D render of a 3D rendered room! ",

            "answer_text": "What is the difference between 3D Graphics and 3D Rendering? 3D rendering is what you have to do in order to produce 3D graphics. When something is rendered, a computer does a bunch of computations (and magic, as far as I can understand of the code) that will, in the end, produce an image or a set of images in the case of animation.

Rendering is a function of these softwares. 3d graphics on the other hand, is a more general term referring to the images created with 3d software. What 3d rendering is to 3d graphics, is like photo developing is to photography. ",
