            "answer_text": "Scenario 1: They are plugged into the same LAN segment and have IP addresses on the same subnet. Go to Ethernet Adapters, right-click on one and disable it. Then reverse. Scenario 2: They are plugged in to different network segments with IP addresses on different subnets. There is no need to switch. Traffic for Ethernet 1 will use Ethernet 1. Traffic for Ethernet 2 will use Ethernet 2. You can assign both, one, or neither with a gateway address which decides when remote / internet traffic goes. If that\u2019s too complicated, see Scenario 1. ",
