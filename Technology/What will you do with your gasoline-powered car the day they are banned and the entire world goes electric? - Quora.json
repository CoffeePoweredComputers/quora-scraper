            "answer_text": "In a civilised world governments do not go banning anything abruptly. They take learned and consensus decisions. You can own gasoline powered car as long government regulation doesn\u2019t mandate stopping production of new ICEVs in your country. The logic is your car will be allowed on the road till the new cars produced are on the streets. Individuals need not take the issue of gasoline powered cars vis a vis EVs more seriously than the regulators. ",
