            "answer_text": "Augmented Reality Shopping Platform Increase conversion by letting customers interactively view fashion and home products in 3D in the real world in front of them. And letting them compare multiple products side-by-side in their room to make a purchase decision. Augmented reality (AR) has transformed the smart-phone camera into a window through which consumers can engage with interactive digital scenes in the physical world. On the other side of this window, brands are also harnessing AR to serve up creative experiences to delight their customers. But the applications for AR go well beyond showcasing the size and details of your products in 3D. With use cases at every stage of the customer journey, AR can fundamentally change the way people discover your products and how you engage with customers after they make a purchase. With mobile AR, brands can draw customers in with unique marketing activations that bring products to life right in front of them. Without the restraints of physical inventory or set up, the experience of picking up and evaluating products in a retail setting, or discovering a product while passing by an artistic window display, can be actualized wherever your customers are. The beauty of mobile AR is that you decide when and where your AR scenes can be accessed, making them as convenient or as exclusive as you wish. This unlocks the opportunity to use mobile AR in offline marketing activations\u2014such as hiding a product display or promotion somewhere in a city or at a major public event and inviting customers to go out and find it. Retail, especially retail's marketing area, seems to be a perfect environment for the Virtual and Augmented Reality solutions implementation. The reason for that is simple - as you know, one of the biggest roadblocks in implementing AR & VR solutions in practically any commercial field is the lack of the proper business model to keep it afloat as a standalone product. In retail, however, the situation is a bit easier. The thing with retail business is that it doesn\u2019t need VR & AR solutions to be profitable, it's the customer experience that matters. It is about building brands associated with quality, care and a wide range of options. Virtual and augmented reality can help to do just that, reshaping the industry to fit the latest trends and stay modern. Also, the demand for both augmented reality and virtual reality shopping already has been created by the marketing specialists and you, as a retail business man or woman, can ride the waves.
