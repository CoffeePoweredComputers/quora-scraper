            "answer_text": "Waaay too little question, to discover what you are actually asking about. All IEEE and ACM publish is research on technology. I like IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering - but that\u2019s squarely in my job description. Computer Science is all about psychology and linguistics. How do humans understand a problem, how do we express a solution, provably complete sets of operations to solve those problem, and efficient expressions and execution of those solutions in sequenced binary logic. As such the field is rife with research, comparative studies, metrics, statistics of all kinds. Or are you speaking about sociological studies of the impact of technologies? Try SAGE Journals, Science, Technology and Society or Elsevier Technological Forecasting and Social Change. Not really my area, but good articles, interesting studies. ",
