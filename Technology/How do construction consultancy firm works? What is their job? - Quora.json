            "answer_text": "Working in construction trades my entire life, it has been my experience with every single construction consultancy company, that all they are good for are these things:1. To add another level of difficulty in obtaining an answer for a question2. To take up precious jobsite space with a trailer they can sit in and look busy without actually doing anything.3. To keep all blueprint revisions a secret from everyone possible as long as possible4. To come up with ridiculous and the most labor intensive solution to logistical and construction issues5. To schedule subcontractors of various trades and building department inspections haphazardly so trades are not on the project at the optimal time or in the optimal order for efficient progress, and instead creating a clusterfuck where different trades are waiting on each other or are on top of each other and also limiting available resources such as site space, and creating a situation where trades are fighting over access to electricity and water. And so building officials are called in to the site to perform inspections before the work is ready for inspection.6. To delay the progress of construction (see 1,2,3,4,&5 above)7. To increase the cost of a project due to their exorbitant fees and the delays they cause (see 1,2,3,4,5,&6 above)8. To blame every contractor and material supplier associated with the project for delays in construction and increased costs (see 1,2,3,4,5,6,&7 above)9. To direct the contractors how to hide the mistakes caused by the consulting firm from building officials10. To walk around once a day making sure everyone is wearing a hard hat That is literally, all that construction consultants are good for. They might help with some pencil pushing off site, I don't know. If they do, it doesn't justify the headaches and cost increases they cause by being onsite. If you have a good general contractor with a decent site superintendent working fom him, you don't need a consulting firm. Period. ",
