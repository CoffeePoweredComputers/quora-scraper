            "answer_text": "There have been generations of web shooters at this point. Originally a web shooter is a high pressure release system, like a garden sprayer or a CO2 cartridge pellet gun.  Liquified \u201cwebbing\u201d under pressure is stored in cartridges in Spider-Man\u2019s web shooters. Older models required a manual replacement of a cartridge but new versions automatically cycle the cartridges if we consider the gauntlet style web shooter that Peter, his clone Ben Reilly, and perhaps Kaine use as well as Otto Octavius while he was representing himself as the Superior Spider-Man or Superior Dr Octopus. The Tony Stark manufactured Iron Spider armor probably used a modified version of this using electro-mechanical means of storing the liquid version of the webbing but it still amounts to a pressurized release system. This is custom equipment. The cost is measured in its custom components and materials. Since Peter created these when he was a teenager who before he even could become a photographer for the Daily Bugle probably had very little income at all. But public schools often had mandatory \u2018shop\u2019 classes in the 60s and 70s (personal experience) and Peter was a science nerd, so he is understood to have had the knowledge and access to the tools and materials to create his first web shooters without any significant income. He probably had to repurpose some materials and components from cannibalizing devices particularly for those original web shooters. And unfortunately, I can\u2019t really imagine what devices Peter could have built his web shooters from specifically based on the picture above. The webbing is an ingenious material that a high school student with advanced chemistry training from school and self study would be able to make from easily obtainable materials. So, without putting a price on it, let\u2019s say that web shooters are not actually very expensive. How could they be? But if you\u2019re hoping to make them at home, even while there are some neat toys on the market, comics are fictional and the laws of physics and chemistry are different in this realms of our imagination.
