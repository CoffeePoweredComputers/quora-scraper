            "answer_text": "These are the few skills that I have observed. Also, my answer is biased to the Indian culture. Ability to adapt to the changing technology. For example, younger generation do not face any trouble in switching from one operating system (mobile/pc) to another, whereas, it is comparatively much more difficult for the older generations to do so.Ability to accept different cultures/traditions. A person from the younger generation is much more open and welcoming to different traditions and cultures. Older generations lack this.Social media skills. In India, younger generation are much more socially active than the older generations. You will find very less number of people like Bhuvi Jain, the Quoran supermom. Most of the older generation people I know of, lack interest in anything on the internet and consider it a waste of time.Younger generation have better banking skills; but the sole reason of this skill may be the education system which has now incorporated the banking knowledge.These are the only skills that come up in my mind when I read this questions. I will add more points to this answer as and when I observe anything. I hope this answer was useful. ",

            "answer_text": "They're not so much skills as they are driving forces.  Curiosity; pure, unbridled energy; and enthusiasm. Life wears us down in much the same way that time and erosion wears down the formations of the earth. We become jaded - cynical. Locked into roles that we may or may not have chosen for ourselves. We live and learn; while we may grow stronger and wiser, life still exacts a cost.  The young have their whole lives ahead of them and heads filled with dreams. Wonder and curiosity are a potent combination and when fueled by all that restless energy and enthusiasm - well, the sky's the limit. Nothing is yet set in stone and the variables are endless. ",
