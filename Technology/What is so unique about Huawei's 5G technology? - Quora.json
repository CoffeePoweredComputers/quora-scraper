            "answer_text": "Q: What is so unique about Huawei's 5G technology? A: There is nothing unique about Huawei\u2019s 5G products, they simply are marketing them in a way to fool people reading news articles into thinking that there is something different about them, in fact nothing it\u2019s different at all. Huawei\u2019s failed 5G planThink it though, Huawei can't have different technology because then you smartphone could not connect to it and could not use itHuawei was given a massive Chinese taxpayer subsidy to build its 5G cell tower products sooner than everyone elseThis would allow Huawei to advertise that they were ready to accept orders for 5G tower hardware before competitors could get their products readyThe RealityThe Australian intelligence agency discovered that the Chinese government had ordered Huawei to be prepared to deploy a backdoor into all Huawei 5G cell tower products, some time in the futureThat would enable the Chinese military to spy on any and all cell phone calls and all Internet activity that go through their towers, especially all of the towers in The West (the US and the UK primarily)People\u2019s Liberation Army (Chinese Army)PLA Unit 61398 (also known as APT 1, Comment Crew, Comment Panda, GIF89a, and Byzantine Candor )(Chinese: 61398\u90e8\u961f, Pinyin: 61398 b\u00f9du\u00ec) is the Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD)[1] of a People's Liberation Army advanced persistent threat unit that has been alleged to be a source of Chinese computer hacking attacks. The unit is stationed in Pudong, Shanghai.5G in the Real WorldWhat happened while Huawei was bombarding the world with marketing hype is that The West geared up 5G production and passed Huawei in 5G patents as well as massively surpassing Huawei in real world deployments. The United States has the first carrier finish their 5G coverage of the US before Huawei finished 5G coverage in two Chinese citiesHuawei did not invent 5G, The West invented cell technology and invented 5G, Huawei did not contribute to these technologies at all",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is special about Huawei\u2019s 5G technology. Huawei, like the other suppliers (Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE, Samsung, NEC, \u2026) are \u201cjust\u201d implementing the international standard, as released by 3GPP in 2018. There is no \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d here, at least not on a big scale. Implementing the same algorithm by different companies leads to slightly different performance results, usually, and mobile communication is not an exception. But Huawei is not sticking out here. The reason for their success in 5G so far, lies 10 years in the past: With their Chinese State Bank financed and subsidized low cost equipment they took a big bite into the western 4G networks. In addition after the Lehman crash our governments were very keen on getting additional exportation quotas from China, and were very willing to give in to permissions of high volumes of China network kit. With 5G the 3GPP has thought out (innocent as they are) a smooth transition from 4G to 5G by deploying 5G functionality in so-called Non-Standalone mode. Which means that 5G nodes are under full control of already deployed 4G nodes, and thus the incumbent 4G supplier has got a wildcard for 5G. In most networks, Huawei was present as a 4G supplier. And again they came with very low offers to defend their position. ",
