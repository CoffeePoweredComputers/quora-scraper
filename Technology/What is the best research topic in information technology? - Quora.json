            "answer_text": "Solving a problem. And solving it quicker than anyone else has. Applying whatever it is that drives you to create the best possible answer to in the least amount of time and delivers that to people who do anything for a living , giving them what they want and don\u2019t have or have and don't want. Sorry I can't be more specific. Just ponder that for a start while defining what you absolutely love doing. That will provide a path to answer your question. Tools of the day are a fad. Answers to things people are always dealing with are the future, and research to pursue. That is what everybody else does who comes up with novel solutions that change the way we do things. For the better. Just as an example: Look at NextStep and how far it's come! It was the mother of all development platforms for programmers. It let 1 sysadmin handle 5000 users. It was secure enough for military and the top finance firms. What else did it offer? A lot to pedestrian users. Mac OS started with it in the late 80s. As OOP, C was created back in 1970. Then c++. And OOP STILL has plenty of potential for efficiency in applied projects and further development. So\u2026What do we have in the whole world of IT and don't want or want and don't have. Talk to some smart people, the top dog developers or engineers. They're accessible on the intrawebs. Search your heros. Ask them. Tell us, if you think it's appropriate, what you find. I, too, would love to hear what you come back with. My 2 cents worth, and that's all. ",
