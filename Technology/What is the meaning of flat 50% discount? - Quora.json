            "answer_text": "\u2018Flat 50% discount' is a phrase that is often used to attract customers in a sale. These sales are organised on certain specific occasions like festivals or toerk the introduction/ inauguration of new stocks or even for the clearance of old leftover stocks. Often the the goods in such sales are sold on big discount margins. A ' flat 50% discount' means that the item concerned will straightaway be sold in just half of its original price. That is to say that if an item is normally sold in the market for Rs.100 per piece it will now (after the beginning of the sale) be sold for just Rs 50 per piece. ",
