            "answer_text": "Here is the hierarchy as far as I know. I have been outside the company for almost 5 years now. 1. Programmer 2. Programmer Analyst 3. Associate 4. Senior Associate 5. Manager 6. Senior Manager 7. Associate Director 8.Director 9.Senior Director 10.Associate Vice President 11.Senior Vice President 12.Executive Vice President 13.President 14.Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer (not sure about rankings between them) 15.Chief Executive Officer. There used to be a Assistant Program Manager post, which was abolished  I believe in 2011. There are different horizontal based names available as I remember, which ultimately map to one of those ranks mentioned above. e.g. Technical analyst - <Horizontal>, Consultant - <Horizontal>, Senior Consultant - <Horizontal> etc.  Then there are carrier path based titles, which come into effect probably starting from the Manager ranks i.e. for Project Management track e.g. Project Manager, Account Manager etc. or Technical track e.g. Technical Architect, Principal Architect etc. I apologize to everyone in advance, if this is inaccurate at some level, as I may have forgotten things, or most probably things have changed since I left the company around 5 years ago.
