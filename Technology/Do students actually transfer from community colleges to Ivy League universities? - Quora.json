            "answer_text": "Although I did not transfer from a community college my path was similar. I began my college career at SUNY Oneonta - a middle-tier New York State funded institutions for those who do not know. My high school performance was less than average (85/100 average with only 1 AP courses). To give some perspective on how average I was, I come from a well-off school district where more than half of my graduating class of 300 were inducted into the National Honors Society \u2013 I was not. Point being, it was not that hard to do well at my high school and even a little effort paid off; apparently I wasn\u2019t willing to make that effort. When I arrived at college and realized I was voluntarily paying for my education I knew I needed to make a drastic change. I then made the decision to completely dedicate myself to my own education. At college I decide the best way to make this change was to throw myself into what I believed were the hardest courses I could take and see what happened (would not always recommended this method but it worked out in my case) . So, I took mostly STEM classes including physics, calculus, chemistry and computer programming. I ended up with decently high grades (3.9 GPA) at the end of my two years through a fair amount of studying and stress. I then decided I wanted better for myself, so I applied to some above average engineering programs including UVA and Columbia as well as some other reputable SUNY programs. Long story short, I got into every school I applied to except Columbia (no surprise there). It has been my experience that what ultimately matters most is the effort you put into your time at your college. If you show yourself to be capable and enthusiastic, college admissions will recognize that. To answer your question: yes, it is certainly possible to transfer to top-tier institution from any college around the world. At least that is true legally speaking (do not quote me on that). Perhaps some universities might secretly black-list some schools from having transfer students from that institution but that is fairly unlikely. Regardless, these things are completely out our control so there is no use in wasting our energy thinking about them. That being said, it is naive to think that the college you apply from will have no influence in the admissions process. Of course, it is more likely for an admissions officer at Harvard to trust the achievements of a Princeton student than one a mid-tier school such as the one I transferred from. You should not let this discourage you though. These schools know better than anyone that sometimes the students these schools do accept are not always quite what they thought they would be and the talent they are looking for can come from anywhere. I apologize for rambling and divulging my life story on here but I hope it may have helped and inspired some - best of luck to you and all others looking for advice! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it happens, though it's probably very rare. I can confirm it happens because I know a person who did it\u2014but only one. I think it's rare because community colleges typically have transfer agreements with state/public universities, where the associate's degree is structured to cover some or all of the state's 4-year college general requirements, such as electives or college writing courses. Some states (like Washington, where I went to college) allocate some 4-year college transfer slots for students transferring out of community colleges. I don't know of any private schools with similar arrangements. Public schools also have different incentives and obligations. They're funded by taxpayer money; they aim to educate state students first, and many state students come through community colleges for economic and other reasons. They also tend to have tighter budgets (no Harvard endowments here!) so the prospect of graduating a student in two fewer years is appealing. Unlike Ivy League schools, these state schools and their governing organizations have had a hand in planning community college degree programs, so they're more confident about what a community college graduate will know, the rigor of their community college coursework, etc. But if you consider top universities instead of just Ivy League universities, community college transfers become more common because many top universities are state schools, including:  The U California schools, esp. Berkeley and Los Angeles.University of VirginiaUniversity of MichiganUniversity of WashingtonUniversity of WisconsinUniversity of North Carolina(That list is obviously not exhaustive.) Disclosure: I completed an associate's degree at North Seattle Community College before transferring to and graduating from UW. ",

            "answer_text": "It's very rare, but possible. I transferred from a community college to Caltech, which is at least as selective as most of the Ivies. There were many factors I had going for me, and I can list some of those if you like. But I suspect that the best way that I was able to differentiate myself was through recommendation letters from my professors. UPDATE: Here's some of the things I could brag about on my application.1) I started calculus in community college when I was 14, and the next year I graduated high school early and took all of my classes there. I aced all of the hardest math and physics class available, despite taking 16-18 units every term. I had a single B on my transcript, from my first English class. 2) Caltech requires transfer exams in math and physics. I aced the math exam easily; the physics exam was harder and longer, so I couldn't even finish it. But then I hadn't yet finished taking E&M when I applied, so they may have allowed for that. 3) I participated in the AMATYC math contest, a national contest for community college students. In my last year, I finished 8th overall in the country. 4) I spent a year in our student government, as a senator for the math division. 5) I worked as a tutor for Calculus II for a year. 6) But I think the most important of all was that I went above and beyond what was required in several of my classes, and then asked those professors for recommendations. In math, I would do challenge problems on the side, or search for my own proofs, and share what I found with my professors. Looking back, nothing I discovered was that special. But the fact that I at least tried showed my passion for math. In one of my programming classes, our final project was to write our own game. I added all kinds of new features to it, long after I could have called it done. It's still my favorite coding project I've ever worked on, and my professor was very impressed. The bottom line is, Caltech is looking for people who will devote themselves to math and science. From when I first visited, I knew I was a perfect match, and I made sure that everyone around me could see that too. ",

            "answer_text": "Of the eight Ivy league colleges (which is an athletic league) Harvard takes less than three CC transfers per year and Yale only takes a total of 24 (total) and the CCs are a small percentage. Princeton takes No transfers. Cornell takes a lot of transfers each year and 28% of those are CC grads.   See:Harvard Lags in Community College Recruitment | News | The Harvard CrimsonandGetting into elite universities - through community colleges Remember, at Cornell it is only the College of Arts and Sciences that is considered \"Ivy League\".  Indeed, two of the many colleges at Cornell are NY State public colleges........   (bet you didn't know that...) And Cornell Loves to stack its athletic teams with CC transfers.  Indeed Bruce Arena was a CC transfer into Cornell and became the soccer goalie for Cornell.  (If you don't know who Bruce Arena is, do Not pass Go and do Not transfer to an Ivy League college.....) So, if you graduated from a CC and are a star athlete plus a good student then you may be able to punch your ticket to Cornell.     However, for you non-athletes, it is easier to get into the Ivy League as a freshman than as a CC transfer. CC graduates are supposed to immediately pass Go, collect financial aid, and start as a Junior at their state's flagship public university.    Then they attend an Ivy League college as a graduate student working on a thesis and paying Nothing.   Win-Win. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "They Ivies are selecting \u201cexceptional\u201d candidates to admit to their school. So, theoretically, it is possible - BUT, you would need a good \u201creason why\u201d you were at a community school - since they get most of their applicants through 1st year applications. Transfers are possible (but few, depending on the school) but why did you not apply to the Ivies as a 1st year? What were you doing that didn\u2019t allow you to apply as a freshman? Were you training for the US Olympics? Were you re-building a refugee camp somewhere? What the heck was going on that you waited a couple of years and want to transfer? How were you going to a community college while you were doing whatever you were doing ? These are just obvious admissions questions. (Most Ivies allow deferrals and gap years - so if admitted as a freshman, they would let your defer a year or two if you had something else you needed to finish up or explore, not a problem.) I guess, in short, you have a lot of explaining to do to convince them that your are \u201cexceptional\u201d (some define as test scores/GPA, others have remarkable personal achievements, or extreme hardships, that limited your ability to apply to colleges). Unless you are \u201cworld class\u201d at something (even something unusual), then, you better have near- perfect GPA\u2019s/Test scores if you are going to go down the \u201chardship\u201d path. Getting accepted to an Ivy is a huge accomplishment and I always tell students to \u201ctry\u201d if that\u2019s what they really want, but be realistic that the odds are not in your favor - unless your can point to something \u201cexceptional\u201d that is attractive to admissions to add to their student body. Average isn\u2019t going to cut it. So, you will have to assess this yourself and be able to write a compelling essay to explain why you are worthy of admissions. -Best o Luck! ",

Getting into the Ivy League is always difficult, and getting in via the transfer process is no different. Ensuring that your application is stocked full of great college grades, high test scores, and some interesting extracurricular opportunities can assist with this endeavor, so be sure you\u2019re able to compete with the best for the few spots available.Some Ivies are more friendly to CC transfer applicants than others. Harvard and Yale for example have less than 10 cc transfer spots together. Princeton has none. However, Cornell alone has nearly 160. Columbia and UPenn are very challenging to get into, but have specialized programs that are geared towards students who took a year off from their education and wish to rejoin academics. (Look up Columbia\u2019s School of General Studies and Penn\u2019s liberal and professional studies program).As a side-note I have personally met someone in Columbia\u2019s School of General Studies program, he had absolutely nothing but glowing recommendations for the program (another friend of mine was considering that program), and deeply encouraged any community college students to give it a serious consideration.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it actually is possible. My cousin transferred from Foothill Community College to Columbia University. However, before he attended Foothill he graduated high school in America early, and went to school at a madrasa in South Africa for 4 years. Because of this, he was able to put together a brilliant and compelling application. He also, himself, is absolutely exceptional. He has a passion for understanding the world and knows 5 different languages. He also scored very high on the SAT\u2019s. Everyone has their own unique circumstances, but it is possible, and you should definitely try! Additionally, Princeton University is the only Ivy League that does not allow transfer students, but Cornell University is known to be a relatively easy Ivy school to transfer into. I am not entirely too sure, but I assume that transferring to Cornell is probably as difficult as transferring to UCLA or UC Berkeley. I know a lot of people that transfer to Cornell. There are also a lot of great school\u2019s that are not a part of the Ivy League, like Stanford University. Stanford actually prefers to admit community college transfer students over university transfer students into their undergraduate school. So definitely give Stanford a try too! Good luck on your academic journey! ",

There\u2019s actually a lot of transfers to Cornell, but as you may be able to guess, many, if not most of them, are from other 4-year colleges. But do you have to be a genius or a prodigy who could\u2019ve gotten into an Ivy League school straight from high school? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t have a perfect 4.0 in community college. In high school, I got rejected from San Diego State because my grades were \u201cnot competitive enough\u201d according to the admissions people there. It will take a lot of time though. There were many nights when I was writing an essay or doing work with extracurriculars and I would stay on campus until security officers would kick me and my friends out. It also helps to have a story, such as being a veteran or other unique things about myself. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s rare but possible. The question is, what are you bringing forward? Also, why is the Ivy so important to you? Is is for a Bachelor\u2019s per se, or it could it be for an Advanced degree? For a Bachelors\u2019 if you have qualifying SAT\u2019s, that helps. Also a compelling letter and LOR\u2019s.What you might consider is transferring to a state/public school for your Bachelors, doing well, and doing well in your career for a few years. Then seek a Graduate degree in an Ivy. At that point, the overall picture changes. The Ivy is looking at you as a whole person. While you are in your career those few years you could take non-credit or certificate programs at the Ivy of your choice, which may help. Many such courses are available online. I do know of two people who received their education through the Military on a Bachelor\u2019s level, served their Military term, were in a career for a couple of years and then both were accepted at Wharton for MBA\u2019s and did very well. A Graduate admissions counselor theoretically looks at a broader picture of you than an Undergrad admissions counselor does.",

MIT is a Tier I college, which means it\u2019s at the same general level as the so-called Ivy League colleges. Some colleges may not accept students with any prior college experience other than dual credit taken during high school. Even at the Tier 1 colleges who do accept transfer students, the percentage of accepted students who are transfer students tends to be very small at such colleges compared to the number of accepted students who graduated from high school and then went directly to the Ivy League or Tier 1 college without first taking community college courses.

I went to Butte Community College in Oroville, CA, then on to Columbia University in NYC, then finished up with grad school at Syracuse University in upstate NY. Columbia is the best option for transfer students as they have the School of General Studies, made for transfer students really. It was initially set up to accommodate WWII vets in the mid 1940\u2019s. The school is still very Veteran friendly to this day (I am a Vet) but looks for all sorts of interesting folks to fill the ranks of GS. Princeton is trying to get something similar going, and I know a couple folks that went to Yale from a CC. The most difficult is probably Harvard, Cornell is good too, they recruited me prior to me choosing Columbia. Here is a link that tells a bit about GS at Columbia: Columbia University School of General Studies - Wikipedia Columbia GS | School of General Studies | Columbia University in the City of New York Hope this helps, and good luck!

I\u2019m a community college faculty member, and I\u2019ve had Engineering students transfer to Cornell, Berkeley, and Georgia Tech. Another former student took all the science courses offered at my college, and spent her summers doing research with our biology and chemistry faculty. She applied to nine very competitive universities (including Berkeley) and was accepted into all nine. These students had near 4.00 GPAs on top of a host of impressive extra curricular activities. Not to diminish their accomplishments by any means, but in the interest of objectivity, I don\u2019t know whether attending community college in Wyoming factored into the admission. And in case anyone is wondering about the issue of ethnic heritage (and hesitates to to bring it up) one is Caucasian, and three are international students from Asia. I know that this post doesn\u2019t address the Ivies specifically, but I hope this is useful information. ",

I am only familiar with the east coast, but this is happening more and more often as tuition in 4 year institutions continues to rise and community colleges become an affordable, sensible alternative for gen Ed courses.  Not only are Ivies accepting CC grads (I know Columbia and University of Pennsylvania do for sure, imagine others do as well) so are the smaller, excellent liberal arts colleges (Swarthmore, for example.). That being said, if the community college has an honors program the student should be in it, be a member of PTK honor society, show interesting outside activities and/or work experience - as you might imagine.  Also, the reputation of the community college is important. Look at the schools administrators came from as a hint about connections.  Good luck, truly hope it works out!  Oh, here is just one example of a good east coast community college and some successes they've had.  http://www.raritanval.edu/pstudents/transfersuccess.html ",

Delhi-SUNY in Delhi, NY, is an example. Those two year colleges have worked with other Community Colleges, like Delhi and Schenectady Community College. SUNY credits are transferrable between the colleges, (not necessarily programs). If other requirements are met, it is possible to enter Cornell from an accredited community college in New York. Another New York Ivy League University, Brown, has an UG/G agreement with Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. So, if accepted into that program, community college to a 4-year school to an Ivy League college is possible. Penn State (PSU), graduates have also went to Ivy League graduate schools, and they have smaller campuses around the Commonwealth similar to SUNY in New York. After degrees from PSU, I was at Cornell and PSU friend, Dan, completed his law degree at Harvard. So, additional ways of getting into the Ivy League are possible. ",

It\u2019s even harder to transfer into most Ivy\u2019s than it is to get in through the freshman admissions process, but I know of two students who successfully did so (neither, actually, to Cornell). A transfer applicant should cast a wider net than just the Ivys, but those with strong applications that are very interested in an Ivy shouldn\u2019t feel discouraged from applying. ",

However, NO does not mean none since I was friends with a transfer student from Westpoint.  Seems he got tagged really well during mandatory boxing training and went into a seizure during his sophomore year.  Unfit for military service.  Thus he was accepted as a junior at Notre Dame. ",

You need to be taking the most challenging course series that your community college offers (if there is regular algebra and honors algebra, be in honors; if there is algebra I or accelerated algebra I/II, choose the accelerated). You need to be able to write well, and you need good recommendations (e.g. from a job, a research experience, or a current or recent instructor). Good luck!

In selecting a university to transfer to, a community college graduate should consider identifying a set of schools, reach (less likely), target (likely), and safety (close to sure thing). Keeping in mind that Ivy League schools are reach schools for all applicants, and that they take very few transfer students, go ahead and apply, but no bets. Instead, I suggest shooting for your state flagship university, which also should aligned with the CC to admit you directly as a junior. A safety school might be a lower ranked state college, again in your own state. ",
