            "answer_text": "Launching a new product in the market could come off as a challenge, at first. But in reality, all you need is to follow five simple steps in order to get it done. By this time, it is assumed that you have already found a niche, developed the product, and put all the development processes to bed. All you will need to worry about is actually giving the product its much-needed exposure. These five phases may be subjective from one individual to another. But it has rendered favorable results to those who have followed them. The first phase would be the actual product development. Once you are done with this phase, you should already be confident enough about the outcome of the product. It will then be followed by the planning stage, where you gather a team of people to help you get it out in the market. This is considered as the most important phase, as it practically dictates if you will end up with success or failure.The third phase is the pre-launch stage. In a nutshell, this is where you begin generating some buzz for your product. It can be done with the help of some created content related to the brand, or with the help of influencers to build more awareness. The fourth phase is the actual launch. This is where you see all the hard work bear fruit, and how the public will perceive the product. Make sure to include social media campaigns, which again, could help boost the brand in terms of promotion.Finally, you will need to go back and review the launch, and see how well you did. This is also the time to see if you made some mistakes and make the necessary corrections, to avoid committing them again in the future.How Foundr Pulled Off Our Successful Product Launch - the Complete Step-By-Step Guide - Foundr ",

Are they currently buying any products similar to yours ?  If any of your responses start with \"Everybody who....\" you do not have a market. You have a generalization. Developing an effective product launch requires a solid and complete understanding of WHO you intend marketing to. Once you have that you can 1. specify your launch objectives, 2. develop practical strategies, 3. select the most effective tactics, 4. develop your timelines and launch plans, 5. produce your communication materials and initiate your launch, then 6. evaluate how it worked, 7. refine your plan and get set to start again.  This process is how I was taught by my mentors at BBDO to \"launch a new product in a (the) market\". Without a sound process you are winging it. Remember. You can't fly a paper plane that's not been folded right. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the best ways to virtually guarantee sales when you launch your product is to launch through an e-mail list. A profitable launch sequence usually consists of adding value to your subscribers in the first few e-mails, then persuading them to buy your product in the last one or two e-mails. Nathan Barry used the following launch sequence formula to get $16,000 in sales from just 1,200 subscribers: Educate your audience. Nathan\u2019s first two e-mails were long-form, educational e-mails that are designed to build up authority among the audience and show them why they should listen to you. You can talk about your background, how you started what you\u2019re doing now, and so on. You can also use these e-mails to build curiosity and get people excited to read the rest of your e-mails in the series.Describe your product. Once you build authority on your subject and build intrigue at the beginning of your funnel, you should start describing your product. The purpose of this e-mail is to tell readers about your product and the hopes and dreams that it\u2019ll help them accomplish, as well as the fears that it\u2019ll help alleviate.The launch. Next, it\u2019s time to actually launch the product. Keep this brief and to the point, telling your readers that you\u2019ve opened your product to the public.The final educational e-mail. After you open your product to the public, you want to reinforce confidence in the product and end it with a strong call to action to buy. You want to show your audience that your product will help them do something or achieve something that isn\u2019t possible with their existing products. One way to do this is by documenting case studies and testimonials.The hard sell. The final e-mail should be a hard sell that persuades readers to buy, and have elements of urgency baked into it. For example, maybe you limit registration to only 10 beta users or close registration at a specific time.This outline covers all the basic elements of a profitable launch sequence - building anticipation, adding value through educational material, and providing a sales message asking readers to buy your product.

            "answer_text": "There are DIFFERENT types of \u201cnew product\u201d\u2026 The 3 distinctions that are important, because they determine WHICH APPROACH is the right one, are identified according to their level of innovation. A Type I Innovation (sometimes called a Continuous Innovation) is a new model with nominal changes to use and appearance (e.g. New model fridge, car or TV). A Type II Innovation (sometimes called a Dynamically Continuous Innovation) is where two ideas that are familiar are joined together to make new category of product (e.g. the joining of a cigarette lighter and a box of matches to make a disposable lighter). A Type III Innovation (sometimes called a Discontinuous Innovation) the idea is new to the world, and has a high learning curve with a significant proportion of the market confused, ill-informed and unable to discern between good and bad features, design, value. (e.g. the internet came out in the early 90s, but even in the early 2000\u2019s some large companies resisted investing a home page). Once you identify your innovation type, you then have to identify about 1001 other factors that will empower you to find the best approach for launching a new product onto the market. I recommend you shortcut the process and invite a TRAINED and qualified marketing professional to respond to a detailed brief if you have a specific product in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my favorite approach. It\u2019s fast and is very lean but only works when the product or service isn\u2019t too complicated or too niche so it\u2019s only relevant for very few people like, say, nuclear power plant cooling tower sensors. This is especially a great approach for SAAS products. You have an idea, a concept that you think has value. Great! Move to the next stepTake that general idea and find some very specific applications for it. When I say very specific, I mean it. When you tell the right person he shouldn\u2019t have to wonder for a second what your product does. It either solves his problem, or it doesn\u2019t.Try to find a minimal way of making a key aspect of that product a reality, without costing you too much. For SAAS, it\u2019s usually pretty feasible to reduce it to a service, with just some labor cost. A product is more difficult, but, solving a small part of the problem with an app can go a long way. At some point this will become impractical, but if you\u2019re creative, even complex products can be minimized to something simple. A wrist gps for bikers? Make an app that does the same thing first. If it already exists, see how you could do better.Depending on the cost of your specific product (for the customer), you\u2019re going to assign a lead conversion time. <250 USD : immediate <1000 USD : 2 days etc. Something that is very strict, and reasonable for a perfect fit. This is your reference timeNow comes the tricky part. You\u2019re going to have to get someone to commit. Not just \u201cSure, I\u2019d buy that\u201d, but really commit. Idealy money, worst case an email.Spend 2-4 whole days trying to sell the minimal product. If someone says no, ask them why. If someone says, not right now, ask for a referral. Be relentless and keep going.Regroup and look at the results and go back to the drawing board.Not sure how this would work for you? Well, the alternative is to just start selling as if it was already there (make sure you\u2019re covered legally) and have people go through the buying process but tell them you\u2019re out of stock after payment. Take into account that this might have a negative impact on how people view your startup, so make sure you\u2019re no picking out people that are too influential. If that\u2019s impossible, don\u2019t do it. ",

            "answer_text": " Launching a product is not an easy thing and hence you have to create a full-proof plan at every step of production and further implementations. Following are some guide to follow: \u00b7 Plan for core audience Properly define your target audience by rectifying that who can actually be your stakeholders. By planning and deciding your audience, it will help you to identify and target the people and pitch accordingly. This will not only help you prioritize the audience but will also help you reach out a number of people of particular section who can become your customers. \u00b7 Be mindful of your product\u2019s value Never underestimate your brand and be mindful of your product\u2019s quality. No matter how many similar product may be there in the market you must prioritize and explore the features and advantages of your product. If you won\u2019t believe in yourself than no one else is also going to believe in you. Hence you will always have to show the confidence and gain the trust of others for your product. \u00b7 Go all in with outreach Start pitching by the usual sales pitch process to each promising audience that you feel can be your potential customer. Prepare proper content, landing page or info graphics to create an impact of your presence and services to stand out of other people.

Media outlet is one of them and it helps you reach a lot of people with less efforts. The conversion ratio is high in this practice and eventually makes you great brand by doing so. Prepare a proper template to showcase your idea and offering to attract more audience through this. \u00b7 Have brand ambassadors Having a brand ambassador of your product has not only become a compulsion but also gives a face to your product. Having a popular and loved by everyone ambassadors opens too many doors for you. Many people following the brand ambassadors would be insisted indirectly to owe your product or at least try once. You must invest here more and properly by choosing an appropriate candidate. \u00b7 Use pre-launch videos to drive leads Now a days many companies earns a lot before even launching their new or subsequent product. This is because of the pre-launch plans that includes introducing the product through social media: TV Ads; Radio Ads; Media Outlets, introductory video of the product with its feature, pre-launch events, etc. These plans helps you gain your customers before the launch itself and there are chances of getting references through the customers too. \u00b7 Technology is your friend It is said that you can do anything using the technology. Yes, technology is ruling the world and it is very certain that people are able to achieve many things easily using the power of technology. You can also use the technology wisely and intelligently for your product. You can consult with someone to get the best suggestion for your particular field and product and plan accordingly. Even Google can also be a great consultant or guide to help you identify the most suitable solution using the latest technology. ",

            "answer_text": "With launching a new product comes a risk of possible failure. But on the flipside, it could also turn out to be a massive success. Whichever the outcome may be, the only way to find out is by trying your luck. But it does not mean that you will go about it blindly, without a strategy in place. When it comes to launching a product, there are five phases that when followed correctly, would lead to better chances to success. The first stage is the actual product development. This is where the brainstorming and all the work comes in, where your brainchild comes to existence. It is then followed by the planning stage for your launch, wherein you put together your team to figure out the strategy of how you intend to put the product out in the market. The third phase would be the pre-launch. Just like how it is in the pre-production stage for filmmaking, this is where you put all the efforts of planning into action. When it comes to launching a product online, this is where you create content for the launch, as well as connecting to your brand influencers who could help build awareness.  The fourth phase is the actual launch. After months of preparation, this is where the product gets its much-needed exposure. It is also supported by social media campaigns that are necessary since we are living in the digital age. The fifth and final phase would be the review of the launch and how it all went down. This is where you recognize the fruits of success, and at the same time, the opportunity to look back and see where you went wrong, if you ever did. https://foundrmag.com/product-launch/ ",

And I guess that your ambition is to have a successful new product launch? As I don\u2019t know what you are planning to launch, I can give you a conceptual answer. Defining a detailed process is the secret to a successful product launch. The most straightforward way is to divide your launch process into three stages: Pre-launchLaunchPost-launchLaunching a product in the market successfully doesn\u2019t start when you have already developed your product. It begins from the outset. With your target customer. To give you more guidance my Go-to-market model might help you to understand the overall launch process from start to finish.

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question is applicable and useful for all sort of business with all series of different products. Steve Jobs will always be remembered for his grand product launch practices. His strategies, as stated by the viewers, were same but he added some salt and pepper to make it different. When a product is launched, it need to be a proper step-by-step process . Launches are important to add a brand value to any product and its a easy approach to gain popularity, if done in a right way.  THINGS TO FOCUS Setup The AromaFirst among your people (staff) and then among your subscribers. It\u2019s similar to a movie release, where talking starts before trailer launch, then comes the trailer and finally movie. It results in grand opening anyhow. Start spreading word about your new project, which is to be launched soon, among your subscribers and in the market. This will work like a survey, whose statistics can be used to decide the launch date, whether to be postponed or preponed (Based on positive response percentage). Choose Your Channels To PromoteDigital Marketing : One of the best and wise option to choose. Digital marketing in itself contain number of sub-channels like social media, email marketing, content marketing, SEO/SEM, mobile marketing, online display advertisements, e-books etc. Online channels provide millions or billions or even more viewers with guaranteed response resulting in high traffic and adding further to brand and product value. Traditional Marketing : This includes newspaper ads, magazine articles, television ads, radio ads, pamphlets etc. There are certain business and products which demand launches and promotions using traditional method. You may choose either of the approach but it will not be wise to ignore 1st one. Prepare the key ingredientsMake a team which will solely work for this launch and who will prepare all the ingredients required. The task is to furnish the full process to appear ready in front of watchers during launch. Let each person handle individual task then handling multiple tasks in order to avoid any possible mistakes and delays due to overload. A full chart must be prepared and presented in front of all core teams (technical, sales, development etc), to handle the process, pre-launch and post-launch. Is your product ready to be launchedLaunching an incomplete product might be lethal. So, better test your products before starting launch process. Circulate among your team for proof testing. This will help you remove bugs and make alterations if required. The last 10% it takes to launch something, takes as much energy as the first 90%. ",

            "answer_text": "Master these five steps: Plan it the launch ahead of time A product launch only succeeds if the planning for the entire launch was done beforehand. Remember this: your launch is just one of the final steps in an established flow of development. You need to already know where to find people interested in your product. You need to already know what will push them to buy from you. You need to already know what potential customers want to see with your product. You need to already know what types of offerings will entice people to take out their credit card and wire you money. The preparation you do must help you demonstrate your credibility and reduce risk for them as potential customers to a new product or innovation: doing the research, pricing the product competitively, finding product/market fit, photographing your project, getting beta testers and testimonials\u2026 this and more should all happen well ahead of the launch. Potential customers want to see you have actual documentation of past work and testing to confirm that your project has real-world staying power. They want to see that your idea makes sense, has proof and has already been tested in the world. That way they can trust you more. And trust, my friends, is the name of the game. Research your market You most likely wouldn\u2019t walk into the jungle without all the tools you need to survive and a map to lead you to your final destination. Similarly, you need to understand the market you\u2019re going into before you do anything else. You need to know where your competitors are talking. You need to know what alternatives your potential consumer has. You need to know what similar products are priced at. You need to know what types of advertising they are running (or if they\u2019re running any advertising at all). You need to know what influencers are talking about your niche. You need to know if press releases move the needle or not. You need to know the complete decision matrix before you can form a coherent strategy around your launch. With research, find what\u2019s currently in the market, what\u2019s missing in the market and how your product can fill that gap. Don\u2019t skip this. Find & activate your tribe A product only goes as far as the people who know about it. You can have the coolest most life-changing product in the world. You can throw as much money into it as you want. But nothing will happen if you don\u2019t find your tribe. Today I spoke to someone who wanted to launch a new product for children via crowdfunding. I strongly recommended against it because that\u2019s not where parents are looking for new toys and experiences for their children. That\u2019s not where they get their information. Public library events, after school programs or parenting Meetups - those are some places their target audience would go to discover new activities for their child. Meet people where they are talking. Here\u2019s another example: a crypto-wallet startup I consulted for wants to form a Facebook community to encourage people to purchase their new product. My question to them: is this where people are getting information on crypto? Short answer: absolutely not. Get into the minds of your audience, find where they\u2019re talking, speak their lingo and activate them by providing value. If you\u2019re offering something truly unique, people will be interested. Channel those interested into your own ecosystem (read: email list) to build a dedicated following. Get those fans so that you don\u2019t launch into the void. Test your assumptions While developing a product, you\u2019ll have your own assumptions on what people like, dislike and how people will react to your product. Make sure to test and confirm those assumptions. Sure you might think people will absolutely pay 10x the market price for your new product that offers 2 additional unique features, but you don\u2019t know that until you test it. Get creative in running small scale tests before you conduct a large-scale launch. Create a dedicated landing page and see how many people actually end up paying you actual dollars for that idea at that particular price point. Go out to meet people in your audience niche and ask questions. Don\u2019t go into your launch with big questions unanswered. Don\u2019t go into your launch with assumptions galore. Build hypotheses, collect information and release your product with a sound reason to support everything. Be persistent, relentless & follow through If you are committed to reaching out to your community, again and again, day after day, month after month, then you will succeed. Hear me out: there are absolutely no shortcuts. No single click solutions out there to launching your product. Launching a product takes time and a boatload of persistence. Think about getting elected for office. What kind of relationship building goes into that? Write personal emails to everyone in your extended network. Then follow up with people who don\u2019t write back. Keep engaged with fans and followers you have. Bring those interested along on your journey. Provide value in the right channel, at the right time to the right people. \u2014 Remember: all new products and brands started from zero. They all needed to find the right niche to fill, the right tone of voice, the right way to interact with customers, the right distribution channels\u2026 they all started where you are now. It\u2019s what you do to build up and prepare for your launch that matters. - Nalin Click here for my most popular Quora answers about marketing, entrepreneurship, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo. ",

            "answer_text": "Study your competition Many business marketing seminars teach learners how to perform a SWOT review (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). You have to start by looking at your competitors seriously. Make a list of the companies that sell similar goods or services to the one you plan to start. Even if you think your new product or service is completely special and without any current competition, it's important to put yourself in the shoes of your prospective customers and consider what they would purchase instead of what you're planning to sell. Study their marketing materials including their advertisements, brochures, and websites until you determine who your rivals should be. Define Your Target Audience Know your target audience.

Generally, multichannel marketers achieve the greatest success because customers who can shop when and however they like to tend to spend more and shop more often. Suppose your strategy is to market a low-cost workout device to people who can't afford gym memberships or high-priced home equipment. You might choose traditional direct marketing plus online sales as your primary channels, and employ tactics including direct-response TV spots and online ads and e-mail solicitations that link to your website. Post Content for all Social Networks Here you 're going to create 10 unique posts for all social channels. The key to successful launch content is its authenticity. This means that people in all the launch posts need to hear your voice. Think about why you've created this product, what problems you're eager to solve, and for whom you've created it. Weaving those specifics into short, bite-sized pieces that resonate with your audience, be as descriptive as you can possibly. Organize a pre-launch giveaway For a product to take off quickly, a feeling of anticipation and excitement must be generated for its release, beginning weeks, or even months in advance. One of the most common strategies for doing this is to giveaways and competitions by pre-launch. Give away your product to an exclusive community of fortunate people, in return for helping them get the word out. There are a variety of options: competitions for art, awards for the most creative ideas, giveaways, etc. Whatever alternative you choose, try to find systems that make it as viral as possible, by making users share their engagement on social media, for example.

You can use KickOffLabs to help with the market research. The purpose of this is to know how your potential clients will interact with your product. Also, you will find out if they are ready to actually buy such a product. Then, based on the reactions of the market to the prototypes (or minimum value products), you can go ahead to create and launch the real product to the market. I hope this helps. ",

So think i can help with this one. I think its a little crazy to write a list of thinks you can do to launch a product. That is a list of options, you need to know what one is right for you. Each product is different and operate in different markets, therefore requiring a different strategies for launch. That being said, I believe these are two thing you should so before launch a new product to insure your going to have a good launch. Test your product repeatedly with potential customers. You dont want to launch a bad your product.Build a audience for your product. This is important so that when you launch people are ready to use it.If you had a good product, and a audience waiting for it, you will have a successful launch. I recently interview Avatoon, they managed to make $5,000 in revenu in their first week of launch. You can read more about how they launched on the Take The Bait Blog. We have loads of interviews about how founder launched and got their first customers so check it out. ",

The most common mistake many companies make is that they *think* they know what the market wants, they launch a massive product development effort and launch the product, and find out that their assumptions were wrong and the product fails. The Lean Startup approach is based on making some *hypotheses* of what we think the market wants, recognizing those as hypotheses, and designing an incremental launch process that is designed to test and validate those hypotheses before committing to a full-scale launch.
