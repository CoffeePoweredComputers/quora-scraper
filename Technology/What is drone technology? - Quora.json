            "answer_text": "What is a drone and how do drones work is answered here in this easy to understand article. Drone technology is constantly evolving as new innovation and big investment are bringing more advanced drones to the market every few months. Below, we discuss UAV technology on the most popular drones on the market, which have all the latest drone technology. Most drones will have very similar systems incorporated. Unmanned aerial vehicle technology covers everything from the aerodynamics of the drone, materials in the manufacture of the physical UAV, to the circuit boards, chipset and software, which are the brains of the drone. One of the most popular drones on the market is the DJI Phantom 3. This drone was very popular with professional aerial cinematographers. While slightly old now, it uses plenty of advanced technology which is present in the very latest drones. This UAV is ideal to explain drone technology because it has everything in one package. It includes the UAV, gimbal and camera and uses some of the top drone technology on the market today. In only a few months since writing this article, some new and highly advanced drones such as the DJI Mavic 2, Mavic Air,Phantom 4 Pro, Inspire 2 and Walkera Voyager 5 have come to the market. The fast pace of drone technological innovation is tremendous. I\u2019ve included these latest drone technology advancements in the below article. So this article is right up to date including all links. How Drones Work A typical unmanned aircraft is made of light composite materials to reduce weight and increase maneuverability. This composite material strength allows miloto cruise at extremely high altitudes. Drones are equipped with different state of the art technology such as infrared cameras, GPS and laser (consumer, commercial and military UAV). Drones are controlled by remote ground control systems (GSC) and also referred to as a ground cockpit. An unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts, the drone itself and the control system. The nose of the unmanned aerial vehicle is where all the sensors and navigational systems are present. The rest of the body is full of drone technology systems since there is no need for space to accommodate humans. The engineering materials used to build the drone are highly complex composites designed to absorb vibrations, which decrease the noise produced. These materials are very light weight. What Is A Drone \u2013 UAV Technology Below we examine the science and drone technology behind the DJI Phantom 3 UAV. We also have plenty of information on the latest drone technologies from the newest drones on the market. There are plenty of links where you can read deeper into various components of drone technology. For example, here is a terrific drone components overview article. This gives you a breakdown of the individual components seen in most drones. ",

            "answer_text": "Drone is an aerial vehicle operated to fly independently and is one of the representations of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). They are controlled by pilots on ground or simultaneously driven. Drones are actually very fascinating , their components and its widespread applications that determine its scope for the future. They are a mixture of streams of Electronics, Mechanical and especially Aviation. Drones are of different types and have different configurations. They have different uses and accordingly respective configurations are used. They have different structures and designs according to the work needed to be done by it. These widespread applications outshine the disadvantages which are rectifiable and hence this makes it a very productive technology in today\u201fs world. It is supposed to appear into full time existence in the coming years. They are a lot of questions i think you need to know answers on drone technology as a beginning to this drone world. For example: What are the types of Drone?What are the Components of a Drone?How Do the Drones work?What are the most popular Drone brands?As answers of these questions and more deep informations on drone technology i advise yo to go here.
