            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t yet have a well established theory of abiogenesis. There are many interesting ideas, but it\u2019s challenging to study since the billions of years of life since have almost certainly erased or overwritten direct evidence. Phylogenetic techniques can\u2019t really get past LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor). RNA World hypotheses are attractive since ribozymes - RNAs with catalytic activity - can catalyze a wide range of reactions. The peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome is a ribozymes, suggesting that this is a fossil of a pre-LUCA and maybe even pre-cellular world. Thers also the fact that so many enzyme cofactors resemble ribonucleotides and may also be molecular fossils from early life. RNAs are rarely truly single stranded; they naturally fold upon themselves. tRNAs are very compact examples of this, but complex secondary structures are the norm across RNAs. RNA structures feature helixes, loops, pseudo knots and many other complexities not seen in a comparatively dull DNA double helix Just as protein enzymes rely on folded structure for activity, so do ribozymes rely on secondary structure. Also just like protein enzymes, they can have cofactors such as specific metal ions Gerald Joyce is a leader in the field.

            "answer_text": "While RNA can form double helixes, it usually doesn\u2019t, and for origin of life models, it likely wouldn\u2019t be, at least not at first, because the main point of the RNA world hypothesis is that RNA serves both information storage and catalytic functions, and catalytic functions require shapes other than double helixes. Later on, after the origin, there may possibly have been a transition phase between RNA and DNA that involved dsRNA.That is the hypothesisRibozymes are catalysts made of RNA whereas enzymes are catalysts made of protein.",
