            "answer_text": "Imposter Syndrome is the feeling of wearing a mask and playing a role that one does not feel at home in. It is when you feel like you or your work is a fluke, and that you\u2019re a dwarf amongst giants. Many of us have this, especially when we\u2019re in some sort of creative industry. Why? Because we are our own worst enemies and we do not give ourselves enough credit. We let the voices in our heads spin tales of inadequacies, and we believe them. We look in the mirror and wonder if anyone else realizes that we\u2019re just faking it.  That voice that is throwing hateration in our confidence dancerie has been allowed to take over, and we sit there thinking we\u2019re playing a part we aren\u2019t qualified for. We think we\u2019re not good enough, and more often than not, we are sorely mistaken. Imposter Syndrome tells us that we need to be perfect, otherwise we are failing. It tells us that everyone else is better than us, because they seem to be further ahead or that they have their shit together more than we do. It tells us that we deserve less than we\u2019re worth, because we are replaceable. It lies to us. Imposter Syndrome is liar, and too many of us have accepted it as truth. How do we fight it? How do we kick it out of our heads, or at least turn the volume down? I remind myself that: I am not the best. I don\u2019t have to be. I am enough. The idea of \u201cbest\u201d is temporary. The person who wins a race won it once. The next race, they might no longer be the best. Are they at least in the top 3? Did they beat their own time from the last race? We can reach for being the best but thinking we\u2019ve lost just because we didn\u2019t win is the quickest way to psyche yourself out.I\u2019ve worked my ass off. At the minimum, that hard work has earned me a ticket in. Even if I am not the best, the fact that I KNOW that I work hard, then maybe that alone is enough to have me in that room. My grind got my foot in the door. I can at least give myself that.Knowing that there are subpar and mediocre ass people out there who still think they belong in the room that your EXCEPTIONAL ass thinks you don\u2019t deserve to be in.Knowing that there are subpar and mediocre ass people out there who still think they belong in the room that your EXCEPTIONAL ass thinks you don\u2019t deserve to be in. Trust and believe that there are people with far less skills than you, who cannot be swayed from thinking that the room should have been named after them. People who cannot hold a torch to you are out here crowning themselves. Never underestimate the power of confidence. If you believe you\u2019re the dopest thing walking, you might convince people of the same, just because you\u2019re so headstrong about it as a fact.

It is no longer an accident. How do I make it intentional and purposeful? Well, I better learn from the best then. I better walk away from that room inspired, with a resolve to be a more superior version of myself. So next time I AM in the room, I feel at home in it.",

            "answer_text": "Your brain is only happy when it is punishing you with disbelief. Hm. This may be a way of ensuring you continue to work hard, or it may be a way of getting out of learning to give yourself credit, which is hard if you did not grow up knowing how to do this or with this as one of your daily habits. You need to get to the point where you believe - without any doubts - that you are good at what you do and that you deserve to be given credit for it. And you need to believe that it is OK for YOU to give you credit too. Ideally you need to integrate both sides of your brain so that these two voices are stilled - counselling and DBT could help you do this. For some reason you are giving your self-doubter more credibility than the part of you which knows you did the work and no-one else. A second suggestion is simply to learn to meditate and let go of this behaviour. This alone may resolve the doubting, but your low self-esteem may need addressing with other means and again, I would suggest doing a few exercises recommended by a counsellor to build this up over time. Meditation - 20mins Find a quiet space and do some deep-breathing. Close your eyes and continue breathing deeply. Then notice, dispassionately, each thought, whatever it is, as it comes into your head, and just welcome it as a part of where you are right now in your life. Just let it be there, without worry or judgement, and see it as a passing entity. Trust that it can come and go and that this really does not matter at all. As soon as you have welcomed it, write it into a balloon in your mind and let it drift away. Keep doing this until your mind is doing it automatically and so you get some periods of emptiness for a few seconds after you sent a balloon away and before each thought arrives. Just keep it going. It\u2019s quite good fun, actually, since you know you are in charge and it will bring you relief - guaranteed. If you do this several times per day, your mind will learn that these are just perspectives and not reality. It will learn that you can let them go and you will still be a fine, strong, capable person. ",
