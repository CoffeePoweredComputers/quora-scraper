            "answer_text": "a line of force is an imaginary curve in a region in which there exists electric field let us assume the source charge to be positive in the field of which we are studying the motion of a test positive charge then, this test charge will move away the path that it will take is our notion of a line of force one might somehow convince oneself that electric field ceases to act beyond a certain point (in real life it does not) such a thing indeed does happen in the case of nuclear force which is a finite range, very short range force but, when you envisage discontinuity in field line how can you imagine regeneration, reappearance of this line? we are taught that photon is the carrier of electromagnetic field can you imagine that, starting from the source charge, the photon moves upto a certain point (remember that photon always moves with the speed of light), at an instant it stops at some point, then it as if jumps to some other point (thus creating the discontinuity) and resumes its journey! how many such jumps? such things are not palatable in physics ",

            "answer_text": "Consider an electrostatic field line terminating at a point, say P. Enclose this point in a Gaussian surface. The field line is going into the surface and not coming out of it - there is net inward flux (considering the field directed towards P). According to Gauss theorem this means that the Gaussian surface must enclose a negative charge. This then means that the field line can terminate at P only when there is a negative charge at P. If there is no charge at P, the net flux through the Gaussian surface must be zero and the field line must emerge out of the surface. Thus an electrostatic field line can terminate only at a charge or it must continue to infinity. ",

            "answer_text": "An electrostatic field line represents the direction of electric force on a charge at any point in space. Since in theory, electrostatic force like gravitational force has infinite range, it means that at every point in space there will be certain value of force and its direction. If a line were to exist in such a way that it was discontinuous at certain points, it would mean that the electric field will not exert any force at that point in space. This is generally not possible, hence the lines are continuous in general. ",
