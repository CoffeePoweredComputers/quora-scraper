            "answer_text": "A steam engine is an external combustion type of engine, in which steam is generated outside the engine cylinder but the combustion of fuel and heating water. The steam engine may be Single acting single cylinderDouble acting single cylinderMulti cylinderIn a single acting engine the steam works on only one face of the piston in the cylinder while in a double acting engine the steam acts alternatively on both faces of the piston. Below is a diagrammatic illustration of a double acting single cylinder engine:  The high pressure steam enters the cylinder from the D-slide valve and the steam then works on the piston leading to its displacement which ultimately rotates the crankshaft. Thus work is produced at the crankshaft output. When the piston is about to reach the other end of the cylinder the steam enters from other side leading to displacement of piston in reverse direction. The exhaust steam exits the cylinder due to piston displacement in opposite direction. This is the working principle of a steam engine. Thanks for reading the answer. Good luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "Now that\u2019s a good question. ! what is steam engine ? Its a heat engine that is mainly driven by coal as a power source . You can think of kettle siting on top of coal fire.Now, The water will ultimately convert into vapour and now this steam is captured to used as a power source. how steam engine works ? You can think of cylinder and piston arrangement as that of IC engine the main difference its piston is driven by steam. A chamber where the coal burns.Boiler is used for steam generation.Now,this steam is piped to the cylinder causing enough force to reciprocate the piston.Now , as you can see in the figure ,the piston is attached to the machine which allows wheel to rotate. There\u2019s a lot bit complex phenomena for this . But i have tried to simplify as much as possible. Hope this helps!. :) ",
