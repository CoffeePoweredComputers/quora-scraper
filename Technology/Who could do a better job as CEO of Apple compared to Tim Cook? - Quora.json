            "answer_text": "This man     But before I list the ways in which Jeff Bezos could make Apple the ultimate superpower in tech, I'd just like to state that Tim Cook (Apple CEO) has done quite a stellar job at Apple after Steve Jobs. Here's the state of Apple, after Tim Cook has taken over.  Apple posts record revenues for Q1 2013 (Apple Reports Record Results). $54.5 Billlion in revenue vs. $46 Billion last year. Apple has been increasing revenues and profits year-on-year. Ofcourse, some would argue that this is only because of the dominance and popularity of Apple's products that were introduced by Steve Jobs (namely the iPhone and the iPad), and it could have been done by anybody. Apple came out with the iPad Mini in 2012. Once again, one could argue that this is just a new iteration of an existing product line (the iPad), and nothing worth a huge achievement. But one must understand that Apple is doing things today in a way that is different to how Jobs managed. Earlier, Apple would bring about a new category defining product every time (Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad), and dominate the entire market, until cheaper competitors come into the picture, and chip away at its market share. Under Cook, Apple is trying to (atleast it looks like) to broaden its market share in a particular category by diversifying its products.Apple has developed a conscience. After the Apple Maps debacle, I doubt that Steve Jobs would have a recommended using a competitor's product (A letter from Tim Cook on Maps). Also, soon after Cook becoming the CEO, he initiated a matching gift program for charitable donations. Steve Jobs, didn't seemed to have bothered a lot about it during his tenure.I could go on, but that is beside the question, and I just wanted to point out that Tim Cook is an equally capable CEO for Apple. Coming back to the question, I feel Jeff Bezos would make a fabulous CEO for Apple after Jobs. Some of the many possible strategies that Bezos would have done at Apple, had he been in charge, would be   Bring the iTunes Store into Android and Windows Phone. Apple has a huge dominance in digital music sales. But it is limited only to Apple devices. Broadening the iTunes store by opening it up to other mobile OS platforms will only strengthen Apple's dominance in digital music sales for years to come, and provide a huge additional revenue stream to Apple.Fix Apple's web problems. Apple isn't great when it comes to the web, be it the downtime of the online store after the launch of a new product or iCloud. And who better to fix it than the man who commercialised the web and had AWS built?Build an entire new service out of Passbook. Apple is one of the few companies that has a massive database of credit card numbers (other than Amazon of course), which I feel has not been utilised to as much as it could be. Building a mobile app that could serve as one's digital wallet, and spread it across all mobile OS platforms including Android and Windows Phone could be a game changer. Just my $0.02! ",
