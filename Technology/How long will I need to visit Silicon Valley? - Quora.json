            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t miss the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. Allow at least 4 hours to go through their Revolution exhibit. Visit the PDP-1 exhibit and you may meet some old guys who wrote Space War - the first graphic interactive computer game. You\u2019ll be able to play the game on the original equipment. Take the tour of the IBM 1401 computer room - they don\u2019t make those things any more. Allow a full day.Have a light meal at Buck\u2019s restaurant in Woodside west of interstate 280 at Woodside Road. It\u2019s a place where many a business plan was roughed out and settled on. The decor is fun for kids and there are some artifacts of the wheeling and dealing on display. At least you can take a selfie and say you were there. If the owner is there and not busy he can tell you some stories - all true.Drive past state route 237 and Mathilda Ave. in Sunnyvale - the large open space inside the fence used to be Onizuka Air Force Base - known locally as \u201cthe blue cube\u201d. It was the building from which all military satellites were controlled - and the target point for many thermonuclear weapons, we are told. It was a windowless cube several stories high painted blue and we are told that inside sections of the floors were at different levels so no one outside could tell where anything was inside.Drive up route 101 a mile or two north to Moffett Blvd. - notice the huge dirigible hangar (the toxic-coated skin has been removed so it\u2019s only a frame now) that was the home for the great Navy dirigibles \u201cAkron\u201d and \u201cMacon\u201d in the 1930\u2019s when the area was the Moffett Naval Air Station. The local community raised $148,000 to buy the land in 1931 and gave it to the government so the base would be located there - a good move since that formed the seed for Silicon Valley when the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory was set up there in 1942, attracting skilled technologists and an ecosystem of high-tech companies.Walk through Weird Stuff Warehouse on Caribbean Drive and see the largest collection of obsolete products and parts of products of Silicon Valley - all for sale at reasonable prices.Don\u2019t do this in the order listed - consult a map and work out an itinerary. There won\u2019t be a place where you can look in through a window and see where all the \u201creal stuff\u201d goes on - Silicon Valley is best described as \u201ca state of mind in a general physical location\u201d. It is always changing - almost nothing is left from any previous historical period or even decade. An old-timer like me giving you a tour would point to a lot of places and tell you what used to be there, but either there will be a new building unconnected with the old or nothing at all to see. Of course, there\u2019s always the Hewlett-Packard garage at 370 Addison St. in Palo Alto - kept just the way it was Hewlett and Packard started their company in it in 1939 making audio oscillators for use by Disney in making the movie \u201cFantasia\u201d. It\u2019s a nice enough garage, but it\u2019s still just a garage. And there is a granite state historical marker there. Take a selfie with it to prove you were there. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are on vacation and you are visiting the Silicon Valley, you wouldn\u2019t need more than a day to see the main sites: Downtown San Jose, The Tech Museum, Mission Santa Clara, Mission San Jose, Downtown Los Gatos, Santana Row, Saratoga Japanese Gardens and Downtown. Bottomline is that there is not much in San Jose or the Silicon Valley. People work there, companies are created there, famous products are born here, but as far as touristy things go, there isn\u2019t much in the Silicon Valley. There are many great vacation areas around the Silicon Valley. Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, Mount Hamilton, Big Basin Redwoods, Monterey Bay, The Peninsula, San Francisco, Mendocino, Napa, Sonoma, Russian River Valley. Farther afield, Sacramento, Tahoe, Mount Shasta, etc. ",
