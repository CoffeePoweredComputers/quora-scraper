            "answer_text": "Some people have already pointed out planting trees. Which, of course, yes! More trees! We\u2019ve got many forests to make up for though, so that\u2019s a long process. We do have these things though.  They\u2019re designed to remove carbon/CO2 from the air for production into bio fuels, solidification for storage in soil, etc.I\u2019m unsure as to how effective they are at the moment, but it\u2019s a cool idea. Let\u2019s combine the two concepts though\u2026 planting trees & product manufacture\u2026 Plant some of this:  Not cannabinoid-laden marijuana, just plain hemp.It\u2019s the variety of the plant that is useless as a drug, but incredibly useful in many other ways.We can make textiles from this. Bio-fuels. Bio-plastics. Oh, so much rope. It\u2019s really damn useful, and it grows fast.This would reduce our carbon footprint by not only introducing more vegetation to absorb it from the air, but also taking the place in manufacture of certain products and resources where the current methods are emission heavy. Get some hemp, man! ",

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis followed by carbonization. You plant something and it makes its own photosynthetic receptors (aka leaves), and pretty soon you\u2019ve got wood or woody stems or straw or something. You cut it down, dry it out, burn it in a very oxygen deprived setting so that the main effect is to just drive off the volatiles and break down compounds that would be digestile to microbes, and then plow it under. This can only be carried so far because you can\u2019t farm a pile of coal, but slightly increased carbon content doesn\u2019t hurt soil so we can run with the idea for decades and then look around for better ways to sequester the carbon. The same idea can be used with the thrash, or residue of regular agriculture. So there is no need to dedicate any cropland to this sole purpose. It can be carried out as a side process to agriculture. All that said, I have little faith in carbon removal. The whole idea strikes me as an afterthought. The best removal method is to not put the CO2 into the air in the first place. Wind, solar, and nuclear! ",
