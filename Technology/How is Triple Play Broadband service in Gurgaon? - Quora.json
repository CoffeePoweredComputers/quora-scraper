            "answer_text": "I can't believe I did the mistake of signing up for triple play broadband after reading countless reviews online all saying how bad their technical staff is. Nevertheless I did the mistake of registering for a new connection and it has been an absolute nightmare since. I dropped an enquiry online for new connection and immediately got a call back from the very extremely incompetent Prahlad Giri. After doing the payment, I was told my internet will get instaled in 3\u20134 days. I dint understand why there was 3-4 days period between payment and installation, specially when he was so adamant on me doing the payment quickly. Still that's understandable, a few days for processing is understandable. Problem started after 3\u20134 days when I got a call from a Triple Play representative saying he's coming to install the connection at my house at 3:30. He dint show up by 4 so I called him to ask, he said he was on his way and will come by 4:30 max. He dint show up by 4:30 or by 5 or by 6. So around 6 I called him again but there was no response. I called Prahlad Giri thinking he would know what the situation is, but he dint pick up. I called him a little later and his phone was switched off. I dint get any call back. Then next day, I called the guy who was supposed to come to my house to install several times in the morning but there was no answer. I called Prahlad in the afternoon and he said he'll check and let me know what the status is. He called back saying someone will come to install by 5. I waited till 5:30 to call Prahlad again, when I did call him he dint pick up. I called him again at 5:45 and his phone was switched off AGAIN. After 2 days of sitting at home and waiting for this guy to show up, I was fuming. I called Prahlad a couple of more times, now his phone was not switched off but he wasn't answering. Finally he answered at 7:30 and after a heated argument I asked for a refund. Let's see how many years the refund takes now. I had decided to give triple play a shot because of lack of choices for good internet. But they have easily, by huge distance been the worst in terms of customer care. This is truly the most frustrating company I have ever had to deal with, and I am amazed by how they are operating, yet surviving. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience of Triple Play was very bad. I wanted a broadband connection at sector- 45 Gurgaon. The person who come to fill form doesn\u2019t had any camera on his phone for documents. And never informed me before that he will be needing copies of the same. Line man named Rakesh told me lies for continues four days that he will come for wiring. Once he told me he is not able to find my house and he is nearby. He was lying because he nevershowed up and my house is very easy to find. And installing new connection is a three step process. And I was not ready to face two more idiots like Rakesh. Finally I decided to cancel my request for new connection. And asked for a refund. Which they says I will get in form of cheque at my doorstep by the same person who come to fill form. It will take a week according to them. I will update this When I will get refund. Overall experience is I found out that there customer care and there ground operatives both are useless. And there connection is pole to pole fiber based. So if something goes wrong then it will be a horrible experience to talk to those guys. I will try some other options. ",
