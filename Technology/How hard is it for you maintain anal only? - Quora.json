            "answer_text": "Not even a little bit! Anal only has become completely natural for me, and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. I know some girls love the idea of anal only but find it hard to maintain in practice. That\u2019s not how it is for me. Having vaginal sex or using my clit would be very hard to maintain at this point because they\u2019re nowhere near as enjoyable as anal for me, and I wouldn\u2019t enjoy them. I never enjoyed vaginal sex. I couldn\u2019t orgasm from it, and it would often start to get uncomfortable and raw feeling, sometimes even painful, in the absence of pleasure. I had to rub my clit to avoid that feeling, and it was very easy for me to get oversensitive in my clit and uncomfortable, which was amplified further after orgasm, where I\u2019d be repulsed by being touched anywhere around my pussy and clit. With anal, I had a lot more pleasure right away, initially still cumming from my clit, but once I learned I could orgasm just from anal without my clit, I started to do anal a lot more, and over time decided to stop vaginal entirely, and then stopped using my clit a while after too. I haven\u2019t ever used either since. It was that easy a decision, and I\u2019m super committed to it. In addition to not liking either, I find it a real turn on to know that I haven\u2019t been fucked in my pussy in ten years and never will again. It\u2019s part of my identity now, it\u2019s who I am, and that\u2019s just not changing after all this time. And besides, why would I want to have worse sex? ",
