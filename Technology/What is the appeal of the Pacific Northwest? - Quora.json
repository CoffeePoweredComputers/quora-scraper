            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s get some things straight here: The Pacific Northwest includes Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and sometimes Montana when they aren\u2019t pretending to be a better version of Texas (they are, but I hate it when they strut).The whole urban sprawl from Seattle to Portland really isn\u2019t the Pacific Northwest. Seattle = Portland = New York = Chicago = Detroit, etc., etc. Once you\u2019ve seen one city, you\u2019ve seen them all, and no amount of selectively placed trees can hide the fact that cities are ugly. In addition, as much as they REALLY believe it, King County is not the Pacific Northwest, and as much as they REALLY believe it, it absolutely isn\u2019t the best place either.It\u2019s best to think of Seattle and Portland as two old and obese women, who are very self-absorbed, wear lots of shiny jewelry and think the best days are ahead despite the fact they are suffering multiple aliments, can\u2019t move very well, and use ample amounts of perfume to cover their smell.Idaho is a very poor state with all the money hanging around Boise. Washington is a very rich state but with all of the money clearly being used in Seattle. Oregon is a very rich state with all of its money being used around Portland. Pretty much everyone outside of those cities hate them.Now, as to the REAL reasons why the Pacific Northwest has a lot of appeal: Relative freedom - There is still lots of areas where, when you finally realize that the big cities are just cesspools of intellectual cluelessness, legal theft, and \u201cfeel good\u201d rather than \u201cdo good\u201d politics, you can find a small piece of land that you can grow crops or livestock on. In addition, you can decide for yourself who you wanna talk to and how you want to live your life tends to be easiest here. You start to know the real you, and you get to understand that its a person\u2019s character that matters.Government Corruption is least here - For whatever reason, probably due to the large amount of guns, a higher willingness to use them, and a very independent will (well, outside Seattle and Portland anyways), there are a lot less stupid laws here than in the rest of the country (I am looking at you, East Coast and Midwest).Mild Weather - Seattle and Portland get lots of rain, but rarely any snow (though when they do get it, it is rather hilarious to watch). It never gets Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota, or Maine cold, and it never gets Arizona or New Mexico hot, and it never gets Florida or Georgia humid.Wide, WIDE variety of scenery. The Cascade and Rocky Mountains. Let me re-iterate that. Real, beautiful, dangerous, majestic Mountains. The farm lands of central Washington (especially in April and May..just wow), the vineyards, the Snake and Columbia Rivers, the Caves in Oregon, the forests of all three states, Coeur\u2019d Alene Lake, etc. etc. Hiking is best here.",

            "answer_text": "The first time I visited, it was March 2009. I had gone to Portland to interview at OHSU\u2019s med school. Everything seemed better. The weather was temperate, rather than cold as it was in Michigan. There were roses and cherry blossoms everywhere. It was very green! People were into environmentalism. And politically, I felt like I had found my home, as a liberal. That was the appeal for me. Educated liberals are my tribe. And this seemed like it was very much their home. I decided that maybe it would be my home as well, someday. It was with this in mind that I decided to take another tour up the Pacific Northwest, from Portland to Vancouver. I wanted to see what the older me would think. Was it still the place I wanted to move? What kind of details had I missed the first time around? I spent 2 days in Portland, 1 day in the Seattle area (I was actually in Issaquah rather than Seattle proper), 1 day in Bellingham, and 6 in Vancouver, my final destination, as it were. This time around, it wasn\u2019t all rosy. I noticed a huge homelessness problem. That was the starkest difference I noticed between now and then. If liberal governance is about giving priority to the most vulnerable, I would say that the area is failing, badly. My own diagnosis is that there simply isn\u2019t enough housing available to accommodate all the demand, and that this results in skyrocketing prices. At the lowest end of the socioeconomic ladder, this will mean that a certain percentage of the population will simply be priced out of a home. But even for people who earn 6 figures, it\u2019s hard to feel wealthy. People who live there are somewhat numb to those housing prices. For them, it\u2019s just a fact of life. But when you visit from elsewhere in the country, you get sticker shock. The way I see it now, by not living in one of those expensive places, I could retire a full decade earlier than otherwise. This doesn\u2019t mean that I rule out living there forever, or that I will pursue a low cost of living at the expense of everything else, but it does mean that I am more aware that every place has its problems.
