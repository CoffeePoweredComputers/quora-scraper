            "answer_text": "Plans are different for different states. I'm using Andhra Pradesh as example. 675 plan offers 8Mbps up to some FUP (again FUP is different for different districts eg:100GB), post FUP you will get 2Mbps unlimited internet. 599 plan offers unlimited internet with flat 2Mbps speed without any FUP. 675 plan is better. It offers greater speeds and it also bundles with unlimited calls from your landline 24*7 to any network. ( Not only 675 plan, any plan costs greater than 600 will get unlimited calls to any network 24*7 from their landline - applicable to all states) ",
