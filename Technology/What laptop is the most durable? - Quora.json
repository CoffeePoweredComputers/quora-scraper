            "answer_text": "A2A It depends on what your use case is. I\u2019ve been involved in purchasing several laptops for HEAVY travel & use. Like, people who spend significant time in airports, taxis, hotels\u2026 Meaning the laptop gets banged around, dropped, overheated, and in general\u2026 mistreated. IBM Thinkpads do pretty well. They last 2 or 3 years, maybe more with luck. Panasonic Toughbooks hold up amazingly. You won\u2019t see them break much\u2026 but they\u2019re VERY bulky and heavy. Not exactly things the typical business traveler gets excited about. For the serious road warrior, there\u2019s really only one consideration. Do you want a Macbook Pro - or an Air? Hands down, no comparison, Macbook wins the rugged/durable/unbreakable award. They are legendary, for damn good reasons. Although they are no longer titanium, the aluminium unibody construction and (until Apple stupidly discontinued it) Magsafe charger together eliminated most of the weak points and mishaps common to lesser machines. Yes, I\u2019m well aware not everyone wants to use MacOS. So you bootcamp Windows 10. Best of both worlds.  Little Gamers ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously the \u201ctoughbook\u201d models from different brands would be most sturdy.  Starting at 6 grand I take it that\u2019s not what you're after. You pretty much have to research specific models to find out which are designed with durability in mind. It is most likely going to be far from sleek and stylish if it\u2019s designed to be durable. In my experience the \u201clenovo thinkpad\" is a very physically sturdy laptop. My dad has one from work and the thing is invincible. It's got a water resistant keyboard that the company may warranty depending on your country. I have had a couple of dell laptops a 2008xps and an Inspiron 17 and taken good care of them. I have to admit they're not overly sturdy though. The first lasted me 6 years but it was because I took good care of it. ",
