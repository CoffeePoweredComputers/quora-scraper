            "answer_text": "When I start researching a topic, I often start with Wikipedia. Wikipedia is terrific because it gives me additional keywords I should try in Google that help narrow down search results. With more closely matched search results, you page through less garbage. Also, ask for a definition of your search criteria since it may have multiple meanings and a synonym might be a better choice. Another technique is to use your initial keyword, then type a common letter like t and the list of most commonly searched secondary keywords often pop up. A third technique (especially for searching news articles) is to use the keyword followed by a city paper name such as  \"war Chicago Tribune\" or \"stars Wall Street Journal\". If a year is provided like 2015, the search results will return the newest articles first, rather than the most popular hit. This can be important for common events like \"typhoon\". Rather than printing the results of your searches, try cutting and pasting the information into a word document along with the reference, then print the word document. Use \"paste special unformatted text\" to get rid of ads and odd formats when you do this. Once you have a good source of initial information, try the links to related articles at the end of the article used for reference material. Also, click on helpful in text links.  Those next articles will often lead to other articles with reference links. Going from good link to reference link is often quicker. Bing often gives less ad information in the results than Google. Turn off download of pictures when working over a slow Internet link, it speeds up the process. Also, try Amazon, sometimes there are free articles or ebooks you can download and read via Kindle for PC or other device. ",

            "answer_text": "Blocking notifications is not the solution. You need a heavy dosage of self discipline.  You have to be - mentally, physically, emotionally and even spiritually - prepared to do whatever it takes for you to get the job done. What you can do is to quickly draw up a learning agenda or study plan for your academic pursuit, with compelling, inspiring and over-arching long range goals and objectives, broken down into short-term, medium-term, and long-term perspectives. Then, you need to translate these goals and objectives into specific, prioritised and executable tasks that you would need to accomplish daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and even annually. This is the basis of your larger game plan. In other words, with the end in mind, you can see vividly your startpoint, endpoint, and the developmental path of transition points in between. On your daily plan, you need to determine: - specific tasks to be accomplished for the day at each transition till the endpoint; - metrics to measure your progress (*); - accountability, as some tasks may need to be shared, if any; - resources needed, so that you refrain yourself from searching and/or surfing aimlessly; - timetable for completion of each predefined task;  (*) most important; metrics may come in the form of a completed essay, or a final resport!
