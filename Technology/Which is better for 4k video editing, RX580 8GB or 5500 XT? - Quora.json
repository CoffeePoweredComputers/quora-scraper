            "answer_text": "4k video editing or video editing in general is a CPU intensive task and won't make use of the GPU in most cases. So getting the best CPU with multi core performance out there would be the best upgrade. Apart from this, the GPU can also provide some performance boost in the form of GPU accelerated tasks. Among the two mentioned, both cards perform similarly in games and hence are more likely to perform similarly for GPU acceleration too. Hope this helps! ",
