            "answer_text": "Oh yes!! I am an IT student in Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad.  Scoring semester marks in IT is easy. So academic wise it's good. And coming to the difference between CS and IT, I didn't find a great difference in CS and IT in my college. Subjects you study is same except, some subjects we study are studied by CS students next semester and vice versa.  Some of my friends were like, \"You chose IT? You're a courageous girl to select IT\". Many say chances for IT people to get corporate jobs is difficult. That is all nonsense. You get your job based on your technical skills and communication abilities. And IT people have technical skills. :P  Now coming to the subjects you may learn, I want to list some subjects which are provided in my college:C, C++ and Data Structures, Java, Shell Programming and scripting languages, Database management systems, Design and analysis of algorithms, Computer organization, Computer networks,  Operating systems,  Data communication, Data warehousing and Data mining, Compilers,  Microprocessor Interfacing, Computer Graphics, Multimedia Image Processing and many more.  If you feel you have interest in any of these subjects, please go for Information Technology. And of course you can enjoy your engineering life being an IT student. :)  You have many options for your higher studies. Many fields to go for in GRE and GATE. And if you are going for CAT,  not a problem at all. :P  Hope this answer helps..!!  :) ",

            "answer_text": "Why not...it is a good choice of branch keeping the fact in mind you have inclination to be in IT for earning bread and butter. Also if you do have plan to go for MS in MIS or management degree still no issue. That is different thing if someone has no interest at all in IT then it may be boring but still won't be tough as EC or Mech. So enjoy the four years in IT !!! All the best!! ",
