            "answer_text": "There are supposedly 5 Love Languages. Regardless of your gender, men and women can and do utilize any of the 5. It\u2019s possible that some of the love languages are more commonly used by men than by women and vice versa, but there\u2019s no rule at all. People express their love differently regardless of gender. I, for example, express my love with gift giving and acts of devotion. There are quizzes you can take to find out what your love language is, and it can actually be quite useful to ask the people in your life to take it too! Often times we feel frustration or hurt at what we perceive as the other person not reciprocating our love when in reality, they simply use a different love language! ",
