            "answer_text": "Terminology is important for this question. Mobile data and WiFi are two separate and distinct entities, although both are means with which to get internet access on a mobile device. When you use WiFi, you don't use any of your mobile data. Likewise, when you use mobile data for internet access, WiFi isn't used. When mobile providers offer \u201cunlimited data\u201d plans, this means that you can use mobile data for internet access all you want, anytime you want. For this, WiFi isn't a factor at all. However, let's say for instance that your data plan isn't unlimited, and that your plan includes 5GB high speed data per month. To keep from using up this 5GB of data during the month, you can use WiFi for internet access whenever feasibly possible because, while you are using WiFi, your mobile data isn't being used. Your mobile data is best utilized when you are in locations or in situations when WiFi isn't available. But on a truly unlimited mobile data plan, you never have to use WiFi unless you just want to. You won't run out of mobile data either way. ",

            "answer_text": "Unlimited data on a phone refers to the Internet connection over the cellular network and does not use or require WiFi. The question does not make sense when talking about WiFi as you can connect to different WiFi networks (at different times). Any limit on WiFi applies to the ISP connection between the ISP and the local router. It is not a limit on the WiFi network itself. If one ISP connection reaches the limit you can transfer to a WiFi connection to different WiFi network connecting to a different ISP connection. ",
