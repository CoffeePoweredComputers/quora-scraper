            "answer_text": "The label \u201cgreen technology\u201d is very broad and used by many - those that are truly sustainable as well as those that are only claiming to be (called \u201cgreenwashing\u201d). In general sustainability and technology goes hand-in-hand. Things like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is helping us become more sustainable by making us take smarter decisions - as consumers, in business, in manufacturing, etc. In general, it is recommended that one investigates a little deeper into what is meant when someone mentions \u201cgreen technology\u201d and \u201csustainability\u201d. Unfortunately many companies are claiming to be greener and standards are put in place that are merely to lure customers and investors but there is little substance behind it. A good rule of thumb to assess \u201cgreen\u201d claims is to understand the technology\u2019s environmental impact when a) made, b) delivered/transported, and c) used. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a marketing term So the question is not really answerable. People apply \u2018green\u2019 to something to denote a sense of low environmental impact. Some is sustainable and some isn\u2019t. Here is an example of something to be considered when looking at some technology labelled as green that is not ultimately sustainable. Power paradox: Clean might not be green forever ",
