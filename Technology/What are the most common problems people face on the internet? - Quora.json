            "answer_text": "It has to be the proliferation of dangerous content. For good or for evil, many social networks and online communities are built around the concept of total anonymity\u2014the separation of our (socially, ethically, and legally) accountable offline identities from our (too often hedonistic, id-driven, and highly manufactured) online identities. People have always behaved badly. That\u2019s not pessimism or fatalism; it\u2019s just the truth. We are not perfect; often we are good, but just as often we indulge our darkest desires, even if they hurt other people. And so with the advent of a virtual space where accountability is all too often non-existent, the darkest parts of the real world\u2014harassment, rape threats, child abuse\u2014all moved onto the internet. In the \u201creal world\u201d (an increasingly amorphous concept, but that\u2019s a topic for another day), we are generally held accountable for our behavior, whereas online we are responsible only to ourselves. And sometimes, we cannot be trusted. Facebook Live is a recent example. When used to share, engage, connect, and tell stories, it\u2019s a beautiful tool. It\u2019s benign online disinhibition at its best. But when it\u2019s used to live stream murder and sexual assault\u2014that\u2019s toxic online disinhibition at its worst. And in the case of that sexual assault, at least 40 people watched it happen in real time, and not one of them reported it. How did this happen? It started with cyberbullying. We associate bullying with the playground, and since those of us who make the rules\u2014adults\u2014are far removed from the playground, we forget just how much schoolyard bullying can hurt. So from the beginning social networks have allowed bullying to flourish. Bullying became harassment, which became threats, which became hate speech, and so on, and so forth. We\u2019ve tolerated and normalized bad behavior so long that it\u2019s built into the framework of the internet. It\u2019s no surprise that 40 people watched a live video of a 15-year-old girl being assaulted, and did nothing. It\u2019s not difficult to trace a direct line from consequence-free rape threats to actual, live rape. When social networks operate without a safety net, everyone gets hurt. The good thing is, more and more sites are realizing that they have a social, ethical, and (potentially) legal obligation to moderate content. It won\u2019t be easy\u2014as Facebook has discovered, live streaming videos are a huge challenge for moderators\u2014but it\u2019s necessary. There are products out there\u2014like Community Sift\u2014that are designed specifically to detect and remove high-risk content in real-time. In 2017, we have an opportunity to reshape the internet. The conversation has already begun. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get it right this time. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with other answers, pointing to security, echo-chambers and the anonymity that leads to bad behaviour. However, I think we may still have the worst effects of the internet to come. Listening to a debate in the radio the other day, one guy cited a study in which young telemarketers had trouble with determining the mood of the people they engaged with over the phone. One reason for this, it was suggested, was simply the lack of emojis :0 So the young adults of today, who have never known a world without internet and phones with texting capability, appear to have decreased empathy. In 20 years time, we may see the diplomatic discourse taking place over twitter and always furbished with ample little graphics to clarify the meaning. Could it be that Trump actually got this one thing right? ",
