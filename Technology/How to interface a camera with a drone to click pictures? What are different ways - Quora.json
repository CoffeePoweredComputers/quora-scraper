            "answer_text": "Hi its my personal opinion. Am not expert in drones. What I heard from a professional cameraman that he uses drone for video shooting say I feel a fixed position for camera n lcd display of drones decide the view. I guess you can set up a interval clicking like after 5 ot 10 sec camera will take photos. If possible and camera is within reach then you can access interface using wifi or bluetooth on android and click photo yourself with explicit view. Thanks. ",
