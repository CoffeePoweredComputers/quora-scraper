            "answer_text": "\u201cIf Biden wins, do you think he will run for reelection in 2024?\u201d Nobody can possibly know the answer to that. Biden is certainly sharper, and much more healthy and vigorous than Trump\u2014and much more likely to still be all there physically and mentally after four years. However, at the end of his first term, he may feel he\u2019s done enough to restore the nation and it\u2019s time for someone else. ",

Harris will take over and follow through on her threats to raise taxes, abolish fracking that has helped the US be the only country reducing emissions, confiscate certain semi automatic weapons and pack the court.
