            "answer_text": "You just finished to dine at your favorite restaurant. You always loved the pasta there, and that night you ordered a nice carbonara. Although, the pasta was good, there was something that did not feel right. The pasta carbonara on your tongue and palate felt different. Your taste buds sent information back and forth, from your brain to your mouth, hundreds of times per second. What happened? In short, your expectation has not been met. Therefore, your Midbrain started to release less dopamine, which in turn made the memory of that experience less pleasurable. The next time you will have to decide to go somewhere, the experience you had with that carbonara dish will influence your decision-making process. In other words, your brain assesses repeatedly what happens, through your body, based on the expectations that you had about a certain situation. When the expectation is different than actual experience, this creates either a positive or negative gap, which needs to be filled. To fill that gap your brain will release more or less dopamine, according to the situation. For instance, in the previous example, since the expectation was higher than the actual experience this will created a negative gap, which was by the brain, with the release of less dopamine, that eventually allowed the expectation to align to the actual experience again. In short, the decision making system is a sort of feedback loop, which continuously adjusts according to the gap between expectation (how you imagined the future experience to be) and the actual experience.

            "answer_text": "People make decision in 2 ways: consider their pros and cons, consult with their past experience and expertise, think of possible future benefits and consequences, and then make a decision based on all of the above.go with the feeling/emotion/desire of the moment and go for it full forceWe get to see the second kind on everyday basis. that\u2019s why for example the tattoo removing business is booming. Or closer to those without body adornments, road rage is an everyday occurrence.The second instance is especially interesting, because those spur of the moment emotions transform an otherwise \u2018\u2019normal\u2019\u2019 human being at the speed of light: their vehicle become an extension of themselves, logic, empathy, reasoning is out the window, ego becomes larger than life overriding caution and common sense. The person suddenly views himself as Arnold Schwarzenegger in \u2018\u2019Terminator\u201d, and his only goal is wining no matter what. That\u2019s why engaging in any kind of negotiations at that time with an individual with such skewed mindset if not only futile, but dangerous for both parties. At this point things can go very wrong, very fast. ",
