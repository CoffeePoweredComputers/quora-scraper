            "answer_text": "I know you asked what the company is legally allowed to do. However, my questions are more about you and your apparent lack of understanding of the privacy afforded by Google and the Internet at large. (TL;dr: There isn\u2019t any.) My first question is why you would still want to be associated with a previous employer that you don\u2019t like. If you post a negative review of their company, and they take you off their website, who cares? Depending on the length of time you spent at that company, you could even decide to write off your experience entirely, axe them from your resume, and go your own merry way. My second question is why you would post something that reflects negatively on you on Google Business Reviews under your own name. If you want to help others to avoid the same pain that you did, by all means find a way to post such reviews anonymously on Glassdoor and Indeed. You could also create a gmail account that can\u2019t be traced back to you. My third question is whether you learned something from your experience at that company that helped you in some way, either professionally or personally. Even if all you learned was along the lines of, \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m not gonna\u2026 again\u2026,\u201d at least you could frame what you did learn in a positive way. Impulsive reviews and responses are a sign of youthful ignorance. With information on the Internet being semi-permanent, you can\u2019t afford to burn bridges at any stage of your life. Hope this helps someone. ",

            "answer_text": "The list is either a perk or a giant hole of doom. But for a moment put yourself in their place. If you had an employee / vendor that trashed you knline for the public to see, would you want to A) list that person as a trusted resource? and B) they have represented you on their site as a premiere vendor / service provider and by giving you high marks they made you a trusted industry source. As a trusted industry source you bashed a company, which can cause them to lose business. Separating the business as far away from you gets rid of some of the repercussions. I\u2019d keep an eye out for the response to the review you left. I would imagine it will be negative and you will be described as \u201cdisgruntled\u201d which can get you further in a hole. I would move on and build a business exclusive of relations with your former company and keep your comments to yourself because you leave yourself open to rebuttal and their ability to afford a stronger rebuttal is most likely higher than yours. don\u2019t let it rent free space on your brain, and don\u2019t keep damaging yourself.
