            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You should NEVER, EVER completely discharge a smartphone battery. That will shorten its life. Smartphones use Lithium Ion (or Lithium Polymer) batteries. They do not like to be completely discharged or completely charged. There are dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of questions with answers regarding smartphone battery use on Quora. I have I get better results doing a Google search than search on Quora. Here\u2019s a search link for you: site:quora.com smartphone battery charging Also, here are a couple of my answers to related questions: Chuck Rogers's answer to Is it true that you need to unplug your iPhone when it reached 100% and if not, will it really 'stress' the battery?

            "answer_text": "Never. If your phone can last all day, that\u2019s good. If it can\u2019t, then carry a powerbank if you\u2019re not in a position to give it a boost as it goes down below 50%, certainly by 30%. To limit stress, don\u2019t be so keen to keep charging past 80%-90% because I think the last 10\u201320% charge does put just a tiny stress on the battery, but not enough to worry about. Check out the cost of replacing a battery after 4 years. I think this small cost/budget outweighs nearly everything you can do to extend the life except for avoiding obvious abuse (like fast charging in hot environments, or posting the phone against a hot windscreen in the sun when using GPS).
