            "answer_text": "In a way it feels like it, but many of the features of the iPhone and iPad product lines have made solid improvements to the Mac lineup. MacBooks have moved towards solid state storage, which results in more responsiveness and quicker boot times. Battery life and especially standby time have improved dramatically. More Macs have been coming with sharper Retina displays, which has made the experience of using a Mac much nicer.  However, there has been a noticeably slow pace in other improvements, some Apple's fault, some not. Apple has not made the same level of improvements to the desktop product lines. The iMac (the sales leader) has seen sharper displays and flash storage added, but performance has not increased in many years. The Mac Pro and Mac mini have not seen updates in years. The Mac Mini isn't really a professional machine, so I will leave it out of this discussion. You could argue this is due to Intel reaching physical limits in improving processor performance. However, the Mac Pro offers fewer configurations than it used to, and is out of consideration for many professional users as a result. Beyond the fewer configurations, sales aren't what they use to be because these computers are good for much longer than they used to be, so pro users don't buy as many.  Overall Mac sales are going up, but mostly in entry level laptops. The MacBook Pro line has also been trimmed. I believe that losing the 17\" MacBook Pro isn't really a big deal, as the 15\" is sufficient for most users, and anyone needing a larger screen can always plug in a monitor.  Where I feel Apple is really neglecting pro users is in software. Apple has stopped producing Aperture, and has made minimal recent investments in all their other pro software. Part of this is due to that software being pretty mature, but part of this is definitely Apple focusing on use cases for more mass market consumers.  I was upset when they stopped developing Aperture. I'm reasonably OK with using Photos for Mac, because I like the iCloud syncing with my iOS devices, and it has most of what I was using in Aperture. Professional photographers will not be satisfied, since most of the editing functionality is buried and not as easy to get to. You can see similar patterns in Final Cut Pro X.  Given the health of the Mac ecosystem, especially among professional users, I would not be concerned about finding appropriate software to do your job. As long as professional users are sticking to Macs (Windows has been even worse, especially the disaster with Windows 8, Apple at least had the decency not to make drastic changes to the Mac), there is a plethora of third party software available. If you need confidence that your tools will stick around, you may need to use third party tools.  ",
