            "answer_text": "Neither of them, ancient Mesopotamia was home to several people and ancient civilizations such as the Assyrians, Syriacs / aramaics, Chaldeans, Sumerians, Hurrians, Akkadians, Elamites, Persians, Medes , Kurds, ancient Mesopotamia wasn\u2019t a country but a region which consisted several states, kingdoms,, etc. It was located in modern day Syria , southeastern Turkey, modern day Iraq and Kuwait and Northweatern Iran. In fact the only people which were Mediterranean looking would be levantines as they were closer to the Mediterranean, however Mesopotamians ranged in appareance, some where tanned, olive skinned, many brown skinned, many of them even had light (white) skin such as the ancient Sumerians, who depicted themselves with even blue eyes (in fact blue eyes) even originated in northern Iraq . So many of them had light skin but also some of them were darker. Many Iraqis are of mixed descend and many Christians in Iraq are lighter skinned , or Kurds as they have less Arabian admixture. But ancient Mesopotamians themselves were NOT one race or people as they spoke several languages such Elamitic and Sumerian (which according to linguistic) isn\u2019t related to Semitic languages. Akkadian, Aramaic, Assyrian, Chaldean is semitic, The Medes and Kurds spoke Indo-European languages such as the Hittites in modern day Turkey who wrote in cuneiform . Arabs moved in later from hejaz mainly after the 7th century (Islamic expansion), levantines such as Jews (Ashkenazim, sephardics, Mizraim) , Phoenican, Samaritans, Ugaritic people and Syriacs were light skinned but still due to their semitic roots closer to ancient Mesopotamian and levantine populations but also to the Mediterranean and it\u2019s population.

            "answer_text": "The short answer would be \u2018neither\u2019. The long answer would involve pointing out that \u2018Ancient Mesopotamia\u2019 spans thousands of years, during which not only states but races and ethnicities rose, merged and vanished. The Sumerians were an ethnicity (not a state; states such as Ur were of Sumerian ethnicity) which was the earliest and perhaps most notable ancient mesopotamian ethnic group. They eventually merged with the completely unrelated Akkadians, who were also a major ancient Mesopotamian ethnic group. Akkadians spoke a Semitic language \u2014 the oldest Semitic language \u2014 which would suggest (insofar as language is a pretty good approximator of ethnicity) that they were more similar to Arabs or Jews than to Europeans. The Akkadians left some pretty advanced images of themselves which look vaguely Semitic if anything:  But that\u2019s just the Akkadians. The Sumerian language itself was not related to any modern language group at all, and their images of themselves are quite consistent but don\u2019t really remind me of any modern population:  Of course, if you look at more recent ancient Mesopotamia, you start to find more familiar groups, such as the Babylonians. It\u2019s a bit misleading to say that the Babylonians were \u2018like Arabs\u2019, though \u2014 it\u2019s more accurate to say that our modern impression of what the \u2018Arab\u2019 ethnicity is like has been influenced by the absorbtion of the Babylonians and many others into that identity. So, it\u2019s a tricky one, but it\u2019s certainly fair to say that Semitic languages dominated the area from the end of the dominance of the Sumerian language onwards, so by that measure, you\u2019d have to say ancient Mesopotamia was mostly more Afro-Asiatic than Indo-European.

There are so many different ethnicities, I would not group them all in one, with the term \u201cArab.\u201d For example, Lebanese people are not the same ethnic group as Saudi Arabians, but they both speak Arabic. Also, I do not believe that ancient Mesopotamians look more like modern day Mediterranean peoples. You also did not include a time period, which is pivotal, due to Imperialism and conquests in both regions. You need a time period in order to identify them better. Ancient is a broad term. ",

            "answer_text": "I would not answer this, as it is a question for me as well, however, when you refer to \u201cmediterranean\u201d people, you should consider that they are very very diverse, these days and in fact for ever. If you look at the Mediterranean Sea and then around it\u2019s shores, you see countries like Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Libia, Algeria, Tunisia, Morrocco, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia, Albania, Grece. Which one of those are you refering to, as they are quite different looking people, with different genetic heritage? The so called \u201cmediterranean\u201d genes seem to be the Y-Dna E1B1B found in southern Europe, West side of Middle East and Northern Africa. Usually the facial features follow the genetic heritage, so you may want to have a look at the maps showing Y-Dna and MtDna distribution in Europe, as an example: Maps of Y-DNA haplogroups in and around Europe Maps of mtDNA haplogroups in and around Europe ",

            "answer_text": "Arabs are not representatives of how any ancient people looked like. I would say that the Mesopotamians looked more like any other \u2018race\u2019 on the earth than the Arabs. Even though the Chinese think they are the oldest people, a lot older species has been found in Africa. But. they did not look like any modern Africans. We have all got traces in our DNA from early homo \u2018something\u2019. But, that was way before Mesopotamia. I guess if you have got a scull, modern technologi could recreate how the different ancient people looked like. ",
