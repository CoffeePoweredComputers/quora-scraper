            "answer_text": "Apple is not reliable at all, no matter from myself expectation, experience or their product review from KOLs or Consumer report, they have quality issue since 2016. They used to be PCMag\u2019s 10year consecutive 1st place brand but now at most, they were ranked as the 5th. Best quality, well, Panasonic, according to IDC Japan statistics, they only have 0.5% machine failed among all of their products, and expected lifespan is 6.04years, averagely, 4.57yrs, consumers would consider to replace a new one. Plus, Panasonic give 4years warranty as a default option,(You cannot have 4years from Apple even if you order Apple Care+), Panasonic would give one more year after 4years long warranty period even.

            "answer_text": "Durability of any equipment depends on the care given and it\u2019s usage. Follow all manufacturer instructions and more. I have stuff from the 70s that look and work just like brand new because I protected them well and used safely. Not all manufacturers will give you a handbook on how to care for their product. But you can always get advice from your friendly engineer. Performance wise, the better its fully loaded with high performance hardware the faster it\u2019ll run. When selecting a brand, the older the name the durable their products. That\u2019s a clich\u00e9. But at least applies to their top of the line products which are expensive. ",
