            "answer_text": "Shareit uses the Wi-fi direct feature, whereas other apps (mostly) uses bluetooth or conventional wifi network (or sometimes Internet).  Whats Wi-fi direct Feature? Wi-Fi Direct is a Wi-Fi standard that enables devices to easily connect with each other without requiring a wireless access point. It is usable for everything from internet browsing to file transfer and to communicate with more than one device simultaneously at typical Wi-Fi speeds.One advantage of Wi-Fi Direct is the ability to connect devices even if they are from different manufacturers. Only one of the Wi-Fi devices needs to be compliant with Wi-Fi Direct to establish a peer-to-peer connection that transfers data directly between them faster than any other available medium. It is Faster.. but how? You may already have a device using Wi-Fi Direct. For example, the Roku 3 which comes with a remote control that it communicates with using Wi-Fi Direct rather than using an older InfraRed blaster or Bluetooth connection. The remote control doesn\u2019t actually connect to your wireless router. Instead, the Roku creates a new Wi-Fi network that the remote control connects to, and the two communicate over their own little network. I am much eager to use it in my upcoming apps :)reference: For Geeks, By Geeks and wikipedia ",

If you have knowledge of networking you can do it without shareit . Just try creating servers from other devices and try to open those servers from web browser. Try xpolre to create servers .  ",
