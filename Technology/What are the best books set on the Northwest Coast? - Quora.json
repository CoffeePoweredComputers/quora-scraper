Set in Seattle\u2019s Pioneer Square and in the woods near Everett. Trout Fishing in America by Richard Brautigan is set in the NW. Sort of. \u201c Stacked over against the wall were the waterfalls. There were about a dozen of them, ranging from a drop of a few feet to a drop of ten or fifteen feet. There was one waterfall that was over sixty feet long. There were tags on the pieces of the big falls describing the correct order for putting the falls back together again. The waterfalls all had price tags on them. They were more expensive than the stream. The waterfalls were selling for $19.00 a foot. I went into another room where there were piles of sweet-smelling lumber, glowing a soft yellow from a different color skylight above the lumber. In the shadows of the edge of the room under the sloping roof of the building were many sinks and urinals covered with dust, and there was also another waterfall about seventeen feet long, lying there in two lengths and already beginning to gather dust. I had seen all I wanted of the waterfalls, and now I was very curious about the trout stream, so I followed the salesman\u2019s directions and ended up outside the building. O I had never in my life seen anything like that trout stream. It was stacked in piles of various lengths: ten, fifteen, twenty feet, etc. There was one pile of hundred-foot lengths. There was also a box of scraps. The scraps were in odd sizes, ranging from six inches to a couple of feet. There was a loudspeaker on the side of the building and soft music was coming out. It was a cloudy day and seagulls were circling high overhead. Behind the stream were big bundles of trees and bushes. They were covered with sheets of patched canvas. You could see the tops and roots sticking out the ends of the bundles. I went up close and looked at the lengths of stream. I could see some trout in them. I saw one good fish. I saw some crawdads crawling around the rocks at the bottom. It looked like a fine stream. I put my hand in the water; it was cold and felt good.\u201d ",
