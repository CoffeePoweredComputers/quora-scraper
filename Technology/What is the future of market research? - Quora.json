            "answer_text": "Market research is very important for business and can benefit various businesses in many different ways. For market research to be meaningful you need to gather lots of data and that would be difficult if it would be done manually. This is why many market researchers use web scraping to achieve their goals. Here are some other reasons why a business needs web scraping: An online presence can be tracked. That\u2019s also an important aspect of web scraping where business profiles and reviews on websites can be scrapped. This can be used to see the performance of the product, the user behavior, and reaction.Custom Analysis and curation. This one is basically for the new websites/ channels wherein the scraped data can be helpful for the channels in knowing the viewer's behavior. This is done with the goal of providing targeted news to the audience. Thus what you watch online gives the behavioral pattern to the website so the business knows their audience and can offer what the audience actually likes.Online Reputation. When a business plans its ORM strategy the scraped data helps to understand which audiences business most hope to impact and what areas of liability can most open the brand up to reputation damage. By understanding these areas of vulnerability, the business can use them to its greatest advantage.To provide better-targeted ads to customers. The scrapping not only gives numbers but also the sentiments and behavioral analytic thus the business can know the audience types and the choice of ads they would want to see.To gather public opinion. Monitor specific company pages from social networks to gather updates for what people are saying about certain companies and their products. Data collection is always useful for the product\u2019s growth.Search engine results for SEO tracking. By scraping organic search results you can quickly find out your SEO competitors for a particular search term. You can determine the title tags and the keywords they are targeting. Thus you get an idea of which keywords are driving traffic to a website, which content categories are attracting links and user engagement, what kind of resources will it take to rank your site.Scrape leads: This is another important use for the sales-driven organization wherein lead generation is done. Sales teams are always hungry for data and with the help of the web scraping technique, you can scrape leads from many directories and then contact them to make a sales introduction. The data can be taken out in the desired format and can be used for lead generation, brand building or other purposes.To build vertical-specific search engines. Even if this is a new thing that is popular in the market but it also requires a lot of data hence web scraping is done for as much public data as possible because this volume of data is practically impossible to gather.These are just several examples that can be achieved with web scraping while doing market research. Market research can highly improve business, help with researching markets, launching new products, improving communication with target audience, etc. I have to say that with the time market research will grow to be more and more important, probably we will find out new ways on how to execute market research tasks and how to use the information we gathered. This process will be important for everyone who\u2019s in the business world. ",

            "answer_text": "Over the last couple of years, it's become trendy to talk about \"disruptive\" technologies that are supposed to change market research forever.  There's a great deal of hyperbole out there right now, including much talk that certain types of market research are going to disappear.  Others will say that one sort of tech-based market research is the \"future\". A couple of things to keep in mind: 1. Nobody knows the future.  When people talk about what the future will be, they're actually talking about their perceptions of the present, its relationship to the past, and their hopes or fears about the future. 2. Technologies are usually additive.  They don't typically replace older technologies, and despite the enthusiasm for new technologies, they aren't truly universally applied. Remember the paperless office?  It never happened.  We still use paper, though we also use electronic screens for some things we once could only do with paper. Are eBooks replacing physical books?  No, though there are some sorts of books that aren't being published in physical format anymore.  eBooks are great for some things, but they're lousy for others.   When interstate highways were invented, were old-fashioned roads abandoned?  No, though some poorly planned cities suffered from decreased traffic when the new highways were put in. My point is this: We can't be certain about the future of market research, but keeping past cycles of technological development in mind, what's likely is that older, non-digital, non-social, non-mobile methodologies will keep going strong, where they are appropriate for use.  The future won't belong to any method or technology.  We're more likely to have a mosaic future, and the ones that are currently hot will settle down to become just another choice among many. ",

            "answer_text": "It's mobile + video. Mobile is empowering consumers and making it more convenient for them to interact with brands - whether they are purchasing a product, researching a brand, asking friends for advice and reviews on social media sites. People don't have the time to drive to a focus group, nor are they interested in brands interrupting their lives in any way. Think of what's happening in marketing right now: the new trend is a purely permission-based model.  Why video? The ability that video gives you to read non-verbal communication, to see things through the consumers\u2019 eyes, and to capture \u201cin-the-moment\u201d insights is unmatched. Mobile (and all market research, for that matter) methodologies that ignore video are harvesting only a small fraction of what companies need to make informed decisions. Mobile research allows us to move away from having consumers describe hypothetical situations and closer to respondents sharing the facts and actual happenings around them \u2013 but these insights can be skewed if you can\u2019t compare what they narrate against the visual reality around them. That\u2019s one reason video responses are superior to written responses. On-the-go text qualitative research demands great effort on the participants\u2019 part, which could affect the quality of the insights. Video takes less effort to produce on the go because participants don\u2019t have to reproduce what they are experiencing but capture it as they live it. If you'd like to see this methodology in action and learn how Hewlett-Packard was able to follow the natural shopping journey of high school graduates looking to purchase a PC and a printer for college by leveraging mobile video, check out this webinar: http://www.qualvu.com/events/webinar-mobile-research-gets-real-hewlett-packard-lets-the-consumer-decide/.
