            "answer_text": "It is possible that they had more advanced technology than we thought, but not that they had better technology than today. The Antikythera mechanism  demonstrates that there were mechanical devices much more advanced than we were aware of. The device showed a level of technology a thousand years ahead of what we considered possible for the time. BUT the technology was nowhere near what we have today. The gear teeth in it were not as efficient as those used today, but were perfectly adequate for the job at hand.  Sometimes the method for doing something may be lost to history, although the results can be duplicated today. The source for the the materials used to make Damascus steel is not known, but modern steels can be far better than that from a thousand years ago. The exact procedure used to make the blocks for the Egyptian pyramids may not be known and the way they were assembled is not known, but we can easily duplicate the blocks and assemble them in short order. The technology we have today is very far in advance of anything in the past because we have electrical and electronic devices. The electrical devices such as motors and lights were approximated in the past with rope and pulleys and candles, so our technology is IMO better than what went before. We have electronic devices which can perform calculations in milliseconds which could be done in years in times gone by. So could they have technology in advance of what we thought, yes. Did they have technology in advance of what we have today? Not a chance. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm inclined to think that some of their technology developed down a different evolutionary path, and some of these were superior to our current solutions to the same problem. There is also some knowledge that has clearly been lost, and we can not to this day replicate them. The precision of construction of the pyramids is a good example. Although academics are quick to explain away how they were built to the precision they were built, they remain simply theories that have not been proven to work. A practical example of superior solutions to everyday problems is food production. The place which is now Mexico city used to be the site of a large swamp, and this swamp had been converted to the most efficient and sustainable food production system the world has ever seen. Modern farming practices don't come close to the productivity of these chinampa systems.Chinampas 2.0 - an Elegant Technology From the Past to Save the Future - The Permaculture Research Institute ",
