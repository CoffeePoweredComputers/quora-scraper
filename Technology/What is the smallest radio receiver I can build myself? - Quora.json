            "answer_text": "Presuming you have a decent high-impedance earphone to produce audible output from a very weak source, the smallest radio receiver would be a crystal radio. Such a receiver uses one simple diode to detect (AM only) radio signals. There are plenty of kits or plans avaiable for DIY-ers online. It\u2019s fun because it\u2019s an actual crystal that detects the radio. The crystal radio was the only device available at a low cost in radio\u2019s early days, and its crudeness was regarded by some as proof of its failure by some, yet as proof of skill in tuning in stations by others. Tuning is done with a thin wire called a \u201ccat\u2019s whisker.\u201d It\u2019s incredibly simple. If you want to see the world\u2019s tiniest radios using (a) solid-state device(s), I\u2019m sure that\u2019s easy to Google. They\u2019re (modern examples of tiny radios are) also used in espionage. To study radio, I also recommend seeking FCC licenses (by learning the materials required to pass the exams, then passing them; the cost is nominal). Also, the publications by ARRL (Amateur Radio Relay League) are above average. ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest AM receiver can be implemented with a tuning circuit, a diode and high-impedance earphones. The diode performs the demodulation. The diode should be a germanium diode, because it has a smaller knee voltage than silicon diodes (0.3 V instead of 0.7 V). Since there is no amplifier, only very strong signals can be received. Also, the tuning capabilities are not very good.   (Source: Peebles Originals) ",
