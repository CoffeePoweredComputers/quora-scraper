            "answer_text": "Basically you can start with an prototyping board like an arduino and implementing some sensors and actuators with an appropriate interface you will get there. This steps would be basics but will give you a good understanding of mechatronics systems. You can find a Lot of projects which based on arduino. Just quick Google arduino mechatronic projects and this will bring some ideas to start your own mechatronic system project ",
