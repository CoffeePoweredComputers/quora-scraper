            "answer_text": "a stud finder is a magnet looking for magnetic material like nails that\u2019s it in a nutshell. there isn\u2019t anything to go through any material and just look for wood, unless you spend lots and lots of money for an x ray machine or mri, which probably costs more than the house. Use a hammer and your judgement the more experience you have the better you will be. or you can use a ruler find one stud and go for the 16\u2033 or 24\u2033 centers . If it is balloon framed , around 80 years or older could be another story. A lot of these questions are from people that have no experience and have no idea. a lot of these are impossible to answer without writing a book. ",
