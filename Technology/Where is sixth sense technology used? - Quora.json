            "answer_text": "I have never known if such a technology ever existed! What is termed as a \u2018sixth sense\u2019 is nothing but a \u2018guesstimate\u2019 based on one\u2019s past experiences and one\u2019s ability to extrapolate possible outcomes in a given situation. It might so happen, coincidentally, that sometimes such a wild guess matches with actual happening in due course of time. But, that is just a coincidence. Life and nature is full of such coincidences. ",
