            "answer_text": "When fully activated which is around 2020, Galileo will be the most accurate satellite navigation system according to the authorities. The satellite array of Galileo is integrated with the most advanced atomic clocks that are accurate to less than one nanosecond per 24 hours. The increased accuracy of atomic clocks allow for users to locate objects with a margin error of 1 metre. Having 30 satellites in orbit makes Galileo roughly 10 times more accurate and also the users will be able to tell how accurate the signals are. This helps greatly in emergency situations and when safety is important. Also Galileo satellites are orbiting the Earth at a higher altitude than GPS which means they have a wider cone of vision. All these properties and more will make Galileo superior to the other satellite navigation systems if everything goes according to plan. ",

            "answer_text": "The wiki listed refer mostly to the theoretical capabilities of the systems. Observation, new GPS chips (L5) coming this year are due to have an accuracy down to 30 centimeters (0.3 m) - but probably only available for the military. GLONASS can also do somewhere down to 2m for the civilian applications (military systems are thought to be more precise but there\u2019s no data available). There\u2019s also Beidou (the Chinese system) that can offer 10m precision for public systems and 10 cm (0.1m) for encrypted systems - which are also available for public use but licensing restricts precision to 1m.
