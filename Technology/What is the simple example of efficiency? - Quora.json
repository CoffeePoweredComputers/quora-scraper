            "answer_text": "In a square, a line that crosses diagonally from corner to corner takes less travel distance than following the edge of the square. In computation, zeros and ones were used to capture data, as this maximizes the variation in data relative to simplicity. In my philosophy method called categorical deduction, there are only two combinations of four categories, because opposites must be diagonally opposed, so only diagonals can alternate, so there are only two orderings. The classic example is a worm on a tree. There is a bird on a branch. If the worm crawls down the tree a bird will eat it. But if it uses a silk thread it can go straight down. ",
