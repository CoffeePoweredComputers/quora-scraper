            "answer_text": "It all depends upon the area and the area manager. At strecth of about 5 kms normally they appoint 3\u20134 big size dealers, it also depends upon the market. If the demand is high and the other dealer is unable to stock or supply or fufill the demands then usually the company officials are always ready to open new dealers. First thing to look is how far is the existing dealer located, if the other is dealer is fairly far then you have high chances. You may directly approach the company officials like sales person and so on. Dont forget your experience also matters.if asian/berger paints doesnt gives you dealership dont hesitate to opt for their opponents, they have equally good products. As this depends upon the area where already are dealers of one company, the company doesnot tend to open a new dealer or to disrupt profits of the existing ones. In todays indian market there are big four players: Asian paintsBerger paintsKansai NerolacAkzo noble dulux. So u have a loads of choices.",
