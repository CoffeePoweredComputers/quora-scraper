            "answer_text": "If your purpose is to reduce police interactions to avoid police shootings then you should eliminate the enforcement of violent crimes committed with a firearm. 97% of fatal police shooting involve an armed and dangerous suspect. Avoid those armed and dangerous suspects and there will be a lot fewer police shootings. Of course violence on the street might go up so expect more overall fatalities. Other possibilities. More cameras for traffic violations and street crime. Use the cameras to identify suspects. Monitor all urban streets twenty four seven with cameras and drones. Include listening devices to eavesdrop on criminals. Robotic vehicles with two way speakers for domestic violence calls. Use psychologists to talk the crazed man or woman with a knife trying to skewer their spouse or kids down from their drug addicted high in the safety of an office. Sexual assault charges could be handled without wasted time on investigation, gathering evidence and a trial. Just believe the accuser and throw them in prison. Eliminate police presence in all high crime areas and call them self policing zones. Gangs would be authorized to settle their differences in whatever manner they choose thereby freeing up police to patrol low crime areas. Needless to say spitting on the sidewalk, urinating in public, defecating in public, using drugs in public, sexual relations in public, public nudity, and jaywalking would all be beyond the purview of the police. In many cities that is true already. Police could also quit following up on shoplifting or petty thefts. I mean, its really just sharing the wealth. Right? For minorities its just preemptive reparations. Arson has to come off the list as well. The fire is already going. Police don\u2019t have fire hoses. If there is gunfire at the scene of the fire then don\u2019t send the fire department either. Let it burn. Its only property. Billions of dollars worth of property. Laws relating to firearms have to be eliminated from the list. Most crimes are committed with illegally obtained firearms so whats the point in enforcing the laws against those who don\u2019t commit a violent crime. Waste of time and energy. Maybe Colin Kaepernick is right. Maybe we should just eliminate the police and empty the prisons and let anarchy reign. That way we will have no more police shootings at all and since most violent crimes are committed by criminals who are of the same race as the victims we would have very little reason to call out racism.

            "answer_text": "I'm going to give what is going to be an unpopular answer. Starting as a patrolman, I had Watch Commanders who would add self initiated actions for our shift, if not otherwise busy. Usually, they would have us seek equipment violations (headlights or tail lights), or specific motor vehicle violations (i.e. specifically stop sign, lane usage, etc.). This specific targeting of certain motor vehicle violations was intended for handling only in between more important calls for service. We had a Traffic Division and many of the Patrol Division cars had no in car mounted radar units, for instance, nor were all patrol officers certified to use radar units. In my state, equipment violations carried no fine, so long as proof of correction was provided within 15 or 30 days (I forget now). So, the equipment violation was viewed as an effort to correct (in most cases) small issues, such as burned out light bulbs, which the vehicle operator was usually unaware of (or at least stated they were). These minor and brief interactions were about 99% positive; just long enough to write out the violation notice, ensuring the vehicle operator knew of the violation and, perhaps more importantly, how to correct the violation without paying any fine whatsoever. In my view, still today, a very positive public interaction. Even for traffic control violations, very few officers even bothered to write a ticket. We just warned people to drive more safely, and quickly sent the person on their way (\u201cfull stops are required by law - don't just roll through\u201d). These effort also led to occasional serious motor vehicle infractions (no license, suspended license, and warrants). This additional effort led to (mostly) education and verbal warnings but also the intended ancillary effort of catching very violent and dangerous felons, as many are in a borrowed car, or a stolen car. Owners of cars tend to take care of their vehicle, even if it is older. Criminals tend to hastily borrow or steal a car, without regard to the vehicle's condition. ",
