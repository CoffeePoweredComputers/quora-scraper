            "answer_text": "The answer is, not surprisingly, both yes and no. Any work of art must be understood within the limits of how it was created\u2014where, by whom, and with what intent. Even attempts at pure abstraction like Ellsworth Kelly\u2019s paintings have an intent behind them that helps define what they are. Some works simply transcend their origins, like the Great Pyramid:  which speaks by sheer scale and the naked beauty of its geometry. Much the same might be said of the Mona Lisa:  Even out of its cultural context, there is someone universal about a beautiful woman with an enigmatic and teasing smile, echoed in a luminous and slightly unreal landscape Large-scale architecture has a kind of visceral impact that, I think, conveys some meaning even outside of its cultural context, like the impact of walking into Amiens Cathedral:  Or the US Capital. Depictions of family scenes work outside of their contexts. So do some portraits, although our knowledge is greatly enriched by an understanding of the subject: as in Bellini\u2019s wonderful painting of Leonardo Loredan.  Then there are works of art that require some context to appreciate. To someone without religious feeling, paintings like this:  the Mi\u2019Raj from the Houghton Shah-Nameh, or this:  Carlo Crivelli\u2019s Annunciation, may be pleasing arrangements of color and form, but they will not tap into the intended meaning of the images and the emotional states that the paintings can evoke. Medieval and Renaissance art often needs to be read, using ideas that the artist and his audience were familiar with, but which are no longer current. A perfect example is Botticelli\u2019s La Primavera:  La Primavera presents a complex allegory. Here is a link to a short explication: Allegory of Spring or Primavera by Botticelli at Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Edgar Wind\u2019s Pagan Mysteries In The Renaissance has an extended treatment of the subject. Finally, there are works of art that require specialized knowledge to view with even a small degree of understanding, since they come from cultures that share nothing with Western culture. In the West, we have a degree of understanding of Japanese, Chinese, and other Asian cultures that gives us a degree of comfort with art produced there. However, what might you make of this, from the Aztec Codex Borgia (restored)?  Equally strange to anyone schooled in Western art is Egyptian art. We have seen so much of it that we are comfortable with it\u2014but it violates all the assumptions about representation we know. It is, I think, true to say this of any culture\u2014the further you move away from the canons, the expected rules of art in your culture, the stranger and more incomprehensible some art will became. We run into an issue that E. D. Hirsch articulated in Validity In Representation\u2014the distinction between meaning and significance. Meaning is defined by the maker and is objective; significance is defined by the viewer and is subjective. Your visceral reaction to any of the works above is significance\u2014to you\u2014but not meaning. Your perspective can let you say \u201cThis is not art\u201d because it makes no sense to you, given your understanding or lack thereof, of the culture that produced it. Significance does not have a boundary; meaning does, without understanding how and why and which what intent the work of art was created. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question. Art has no boundary even though the experiencer\u2019s sensibilities may be caustically damaged. We cannot allow art or human endeavor to become subject to fear. . . I am sickened by some Koons product, but he must be allowed to produce it. Raccoon feces in a sugar bowl or ten-foot-long straight pins on a floor are not art \u2014- are they? ",
