            "answer_text": "From what I am able to understand you want to start with writing blogs in technology. And for all the latest topics, you need to be ready with all the latest news. There are websites like mobile phone reviews, news, specifications and more... , Phone Arena - Phone News, Reviews and Specs , where you can go for latest news. And if you like to read all of the tech blogs at one single place then go for storyloop.in, an app where you can find all of the blogs, videos related to technology, share them on your social accounts, and if you have any blogs you can link that too.
