            "answer_text": "Three Important Advances Featured in Modern Elevators Believe it or not, very little about elevators has changed. We\u2019re just retrofitting an amazing invention that has stood the test of time. Technology changes the world. Chances are, you\u2019re reading this on a mobile device that didn\u2019t even exist a decade ago. In contrast, the first elevator was put into service in New York back in 1853. And what we ride in today hasn\u2019t changed drastically\u2014for the most part. What hasn\u2019t changed at all is the need for elevators. They get people\u2014and things\u2014up to parts of buildings that would otherwise be impractical by way of stairs. What has changed? Read on. But first \u2026 Modern myths and little-known facts \u2022 People call it \u201celevator phobia,\u201d but there\u2019s officially no such thing. Most people dislike riding in elevators because they have claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces), or agoraphobia (fear of being trapped in a situation where escape is unlikely). \u2022 Often, people say they get nervous in an elevator because they\u2019re afraid something will cause it to break loose and crash to the ground. There\u2019s only been a single known occurrence of this happening\u2014and it was in 1945 when a B25 Bomber crashed into the Empire State Building. An elevator car plummeted from the 75 th floor when its cables were severed by the aircraft. A woman in the elevator survived the incident because the elevator car landed on 1,000 feet of the cable that had fallen and coiled itself, acting as a landing spring. \u2022 Statistics prove that elevators are actually safer than cars, and even escalators. Safety has been the objective of advances in elevator technology. From the very beginning, it\u2019s what has determined the usage of these transportation devices. The first innovation was the elevator safety brake. Far from \u201cmodern,\u201d this patented device was put into use in 1861. Here\u2019s what\u2019s been added because of technology advances since then. 1. Automatic Doors Okay, the automatic door has been around since the 1940s, when Joseph Giovanni patented the sensitive door bumper. It automatically stops further closure of the elevator doors if it encounters an obstruction. The concept has seen further innovation since then, though. Today\u2019s elevators use infrared or ultrasound sensors in the doors. Elevator doors equipped with this technology won\u2019t politely bump into you. They\u2019ll stop beforehand. 2. Microprocessor Control Elevators used to be run manually by dedicated operators. They didn\u2019t just push buttons to open and close doors, and move from floor to floor. Early on, these human operators also used a lever that controlled the speed of descent. A soft landing was due to their skill. By the late 1970s, microprocessors were added to elevator operation. It automated this process. These mini-computers took over the decision-making of when and where an elevator stopped. It greatly increased elevator efficiency because it automatically controlled the speed. It also meant that it was time to retire if you were an elevator operator. 3. Sky Lobbies You might not even know what this is\u2014and that\u2019s mainly because the innovation isn\u2019t really part of the operation of an elevator itself. Sky lobbies are essential in modern skyscrapers. Think of them as staging areas. You\u2019ll enter an elevator on the ground floor. It\u2019ll ascend at a high speed to a certain level of the building without stopping. When the doors open, you\u2019ll have arrived at the sky lobby. From there, you\u2019ll switch elevators to ascend the rest of the way to your designated floor\u2014and these elevators have the ability to stop at any floor along the way. This innovation was introduced as a way to move a large number of people around with a limited number of elevators. The position of the sky lobby is determined by passenger flow models, and the analysis behind it has created a highly efficient way for elevators to service large, tall buildings. The bottom line is that technology has made modern elevators more comfortable and able to accommodate more people\u2014but they were always very safe from the beginning. Short ascents may now be driven by hydraulic shaft lifts instead of cables, but even that technology was already in use by the earliest of elevators before electricity became reliable enough to introduce the electric-driven motors that now drive elevator cable-winding cylinders. Elevators are responsible for shaping our modern cities. There would be no skyscrapers without them. For the most part, however, they still operate using the principles that made the first elevators possible more than 160 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Good Question Actually. Cant explain within quora. I have added a detailed article here. You can check it out if you have some time :) When Frank Lloyd Wright sketched out his Mile High Skyscraper in 1956, it was four times taller than the Empire State Building, the tallest building at the time. Such was Wright\u2019s faith in the technologies of modernity \u2013 foremost among them, steel frame construction and elevators \u2013 that he naturally presumed the challenges of this extreme height could be overcome. Almost 60 years of failure later, Wright\u2019s dream looks finally to be realised \u2013 almost. Plans for the Kingdom Tower, a mile-high skyscraper in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recently scaled back to a mere 1km due to \u201cunsuitable geology\u201d. Nevertheless, today\u2019s construction technology and engineering are edging ever higher, enabling a new generation of so-called \u201csuper-tall\u201d skyscrapers. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest, stands at an impressive 829m.  But what of the lifts? Halfway up the Shard, London\u2019s tallest skyscraper, you are asked to step out of the elevator in order to switch to another. This is called the transfer floor or \u201csky lobby\u201d, a necessary inconvenience in order to reach the upper half of the building, and a symptom of the limits of elevators today. It can also be seen as evidence of the centuries-old arms race between architecture and technology. The Shard is only 306m tall, and one still has to change elevators to reach the top. To ascend a mile-high (1.6km) tower using the same technology could necessitate changing elevators as many as 10 times. Waiting around on that many transfer floors may take the shine off your penthouse suite. But transfer floors are not merely inconvenient, they also take up valuable floor space that can\u2019t be let. Too much unlettable space and your super-tall skyscraper won\u2019t stack up financially. Enter the UltraRope, a new kind of lift cable developed by Finnish elevator company Kone. Eschewing woven steel cable in favour of carbon fibre, the UltraRope is described as \u201clift-hoisting technology\u201d \u2013 a bit of a mouthful, and a sign that we don\u2019t yet have the right words for this cable-that\u2019s-not-really-a-cable. Strong and lightweight, the UltraRope will supposedly allow lifts to travel up to 1km in a single run, double what\u2019s currently possible with a steel cable. It\u2019s the weight that\u2019s the real innovation here: as lift cables get longer, the weight of cable itself can account for far more than the car and its passengers, requiring impractically huge machines to operate it. The UltraRope is 90% lighter than the equivalent steel cable, thereby reducing the load and enabling far taller continuous runs. I have a piece of it on my desk. It\u2019s a peculiar object, very stiff \u2013 you almost think they should have called it UltraStick \u2013 and black. Looking closely, you can see it\u2019s comprised of four carbon-fibre cores, each roughly 5x3mm, encased in a high-friction coating of clear resin. When installed for real, multiple strands of UltraRope are used to hoist each elevator car, operating in parallel to share the load. The UltraRope is a peculiar and unusual contemporary object, the product of technological refinement and materials science. ",
