            "answer_text": "i would say the answer lies within you. Perception it is. The way you take your life, it depends on your thinking. Back in old times, when we lacked technology, people were still happy. people back then still never complained anything they lacked. By technology, i mean sophisticated advancements like the android phones we are holding in our hands right now, like the cure to the diseases we have found so far, like bullet trains we have developed, those advancements in the space area and so forth. we don\u2019t need to manually wash our clothes because of the washing machine we have invented, we happen to travel across the continents at a very rapid rate as compared to the past when it used to be wonders about crossing oceans. technology at one hand is making our life easier but at the same time, it is spoiling our mind. so rational use of technology is the most in the present scenario. we can use technology as our guide, as a tool for our personal development up to a certain limit only, not to the point where we cant live without technology, else our life would be hard .

            "answer_text": "Technology has made our lives much better than they would be had we been left in the Stone Age. But the paradox is that we barely notice the differnce. Why not? Two reasons: We take technology for granted ... particularly \"primitive\" technology such as plumbing.With increased technology comes increased expectations. How often do we stop to think that we have fresh water brought right to us at home? How often do we think of how lucky we are not to have to defecate in a bucket?I could go on: we take electric lighting for granted. Americans take air conditining for granted. We barely stop to think that tools (shovel, axe, hammer) are all technology ... yet they are. All of these things (and many more) represent hundreds of steps forward; but we tend to take these for granted. And for expectations: in my youth, cell phones did not exist. \"Radio phones\" such as Dick Tracy had, were seen as science-fictional.In those days, if you were stranded highway 185 in between towns, you could do nothing but start walking to the nearest exist to find a cell phone.Now that problem is solved - but now everyone expects you to be available for them. Formerly, your boss could not call you unless you were at home or at work. Now, wherever you are, you are available by phone. With increased access to telephony, there are increased expectations. My short answer? MU.Yes, it does, but no, we strangely tend not to notice. Thanks for the A2A, Kimberly Baskett. ",
