            "answer_text": "Assistive technology (AT) is assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities or the elderly population. People who have disabilities often have difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, or even with assistance. ADLs are self-care activities that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal device care. Assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks. For example, wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk, while assistive eating devices can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so. Due to assistive technology, people with disabilities have an opportunity of a more positive and easygoing lifestyle, with an increase in \"social participation,\" \"security and control,\" and a greater chance to \"reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses.\" I just copied this from Assistive technology - Wikipedia Google can get you answers to this type of question faster than waiting for someone to copy and paste info from pages for you. And, searching on your own also allows you to follow links /references and learn more. ",

            "answer_text": "12 Current-use BGL-reducing Natural Researched Supplements, most entirely from local Health Food Shops for DIABETES-2: 1. Bitter Melon 2 capsules daily. Note on jar reads: \u201cHelps maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Do not consume if hypoglycemic\u201d! Now deleted. 2. Fenugreek 2 daily. Now deleted. 3. Berberine 0.5g, 2 daily, expensive; better than Metformin. Was taking Glucynergy Advanced obtained from 1 of typical American Research Doctor Groups; seems to be as powerful as Berberine. Others available, also as backup. 4. Ceylon or True Cinnamon (usual variety is not medical) 2 daily. 5. Aloe Vera supplement, 2 daily. 7. Occasional Coconut oil protects against Insulin Resistance etc; lately big jars of organic locally available. 8. Occasional SAMBUNG = GYNURA PROCUMBENS evidently good also for many exterior & interior afflictions like Kidneys etc. Grows well locally, comfortable to eat 2 to 4 leaf or more daily now that plants are big. 9. Occasional Inulin against liver fat glucose. 10. Bergamot also optimizes Cholesterol - 1 capsule 30 min before a main meal but another recommended for a big meal. 11. 60mg Gliclazide 2 daily, 1 of only 2 Prescribed. 12. 50mg Januvia 1 evening, 1 of only 2 Prescribed, but not tried deleting them yet. -------------------------------------------------------------------- A supplement HEMP OZ KOMBUCHA often found in supermarkets has been claimed to utterly cure a Diabetes-2 case as was shown on MEDICAL or MYTH show on Australian SBS-TV, July 1, 2019, 8:30 pm, by Dr.C.Teo, Dr.Ginnie Mansburg & Prof.Ashraful. If above doses are not effective enough, then best suggestion is evidently to take another Berberine twice daily. Variety is an advantage if any supplement is suddenly cut-off, or found not advantaged. FOR KIDNEYS now twice home-cured or stabilised: 1. Fresh Water 1.5 L daily + LEMON, NOT including drinks, hot or cold. 2. Barley Water homemade from cold or hot; 1 cup daily. (Supermarket jars have wrong additives.) Also good for Kidneys + 7 benefits. Use used barley like rice, or on cereal. 3. Apple Cider Vinegar or capsule without awful taste. 4. Ginger. 5. Sambung as above. -------------------------------------------------------------------- 300,000 IU = 7.5 mg vitamin D3 claimed to cure Kidney Disease in 8 weeks (1 IU = 0.025 ugram Vitamin D). FOR CHOLESTEROL: BERGAMOT fruit capsule. Instead of sugars in cake etc, PURE STEVIA is used microscopically (not the big supermarket jar that has useless additives). Plus largely growing own Organic Fruit & Vegies, results in BGL way down to around 3.9 to 8, providing conform to above. FOR PAIN: Heal-n-Soothe by LIVINGWELL. -------------------------------------------------------------------- PILL MIXING: Now, if I had pills & went to sleep immediately, then wake up in 4 hours, result would be just as if I had not taken any pills. But if I stayed awake for those 4 hours, the pills would be effective! This is often confused with needing exercise during the 4 hours. Actually not necessarily so, because being so busy saving the world, I never take any exercise, meaning that wakefulness equates to the body moving & thus allowing pill chemicals to mix effectively. ==================================== The following from part of 1 file: You know it\u2019s bad when Big Pharma throws in the towel\u2026In 2018, global drug giant Pfizer abandoned its research to find new drugs to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. Because when it comes to helping this 6th leading cause of death in the U.S., & masses of others, drugs have been miserable failures. And as noted in the journal Current Neuropharmacology, even drugs to treat the early stages of brain deterioration \u2014 a condition called mild cognitive impairment \u2014 has failed to demonstrate significant improvement. To avoid becoming one of the 44 million people in the world living with Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s time to take matters into your own hands. Jonathan Otto an investigative journalist and filmmaker, covers drug-free steps you can take to help save your brain in his brand-new eBook (that you can pick up at \u201cno cost\u201d). ",
