            "answer_text": "I personally feel this laptop is a great choice given its fantastic configuration. With a 2GB Graphics (NVIDIA in specific) and 8GB Ram , it can deliver very high performance . I dont think there\u2019s any visible cons that you should worry about. Plus you always have a service centre with 1 year guarantee which allows you to get anything replaced easily :) Go for this .. HP Pavilion 15-AU111TX (7th Gen CORE i5 7200U|8GB|1TB|2GB Graphics NVIDIA|Windows 10) Silver However if you\u2019re willing to upgrade even further (if you\u2019re a gamer) , you can go for this that comes with additional 4GB NVIDIA graphics card.. Just 2K extra from Au111 model HP Pavilion 15-AU006TX 15.6-inch Laptop (Core i5 6200U/8 GB/1TB/Windows 10 Home/4GB Graphics), Natural Silver ",

            "answer_text": "Everything is good except for 1366x768 resolution display. Really get a 1080p display for that price. Better get HP au084TX. Even though it has 6th gen i5 you wont be able to observe difference between them but you can observe the difference between 768p & 1080p displays. If you are a heavy user, add a 8GB RAM stick to it (so total 12GB, it has 4GB RAM when you purchase, cots 3.5k at max) ",
