            "answer_text": "They\u2019re still pretty popular, and will remain so for a while yet. But if you\u2019ve checked out the competing brands, e.g., the latest Samsung phones, you might have noticed that they\u2019re just as attractive to look at and hold, and do everything most people want just as well (and some of them possibly better) than iPhones can. And for some strange reason they cost less. In other words, the competition has caught up and Apple isn\u2019t doing enough to stay ahead. It seems to be running out of ideas. Even diehard Apple consumers like me are starting to look around. Now it\u2019s just a question of who gets the next Big Idea first. At some point somebody will, but it might not be at Apple. ",

I know till iPhone X priced under 1 lakh, iPhone was good but as they have launched many models like xr, xs, X max etc. At above 1 lakh prices, while android phones give comparably better value under 80\u201390k like Samsung s9 plus and Oneplus 6, xiomi poco f1 (please don't flood the comment section with Apple chip has performed better in untutu and blah blah blah I know you don't need that amount of power in a phone as you're not going to cook food on it xD) Do Upvote if you like my sh*t.
