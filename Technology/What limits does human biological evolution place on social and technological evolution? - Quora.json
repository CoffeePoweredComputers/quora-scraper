Ah, I hear you say. But we are still human, with human wants. Aha, I say: AGI will allow us to effectively meddle with our genome to remove the old constraints. Want to become a bush? No problem! Read Iain M. Banks' \u201cCulture\u201d series for an intelligent exploration of what we might become. ",

            "answer_text": "Given the current state of things humans cannot fly, and any technology that requires human flight will fail. Any technology that assumes that a human operator is 14 feet tall won\u2019t do to well either. I think you get the idea. Any technology or cultural change that exceeds human abilities is not likely to accomplish much. ",
