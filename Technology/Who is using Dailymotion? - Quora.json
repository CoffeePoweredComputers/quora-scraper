            "answer_text": "I don't use Dailymotion anymore but I can remember a time when I used it a lot. Back in my school days, when I first discovered how to masturbate I found myself using Dailymotion to fill my growing pornography needs. I didn't really know what porn was at the time, but I knew that watching naked women made my masturbation all the more pleasurable. And the only place I knew that had these naked women was Dailymotion. As my masturbation days went on I found myself continuously coming back to Dailymotion looking for the naked women which I craved so much. Then one day Dailymotion decided that it wasn't going to host these porn videos any more. I was forced to look for my porn elsewhere. This is what lead me to discover \u2018proper\u2019 porn sites such as Pornhub, xhamster and YouPorn. ",
