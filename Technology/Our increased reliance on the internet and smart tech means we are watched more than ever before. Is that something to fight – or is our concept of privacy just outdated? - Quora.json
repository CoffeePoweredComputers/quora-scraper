            "answer_text": "It seems that we can\u2019t go anywhere online at the moment without being reassured that \u2018we respect your privacy\u2019 and being directed to a 2,000-word privacy policy. We probably just click \u2018got it, thanks\u2019 because who has the luxury to stop and think about what their \u2018privacy\u2019 actually means? But privacy is something that starts becoming far less abstract when you can see how it is being threatened and undermined, every day and everywhere we go \u2013 even though there isn\u2019t a privacy policy in sight. For Example 1.No such thing as free wifi We are lured into a coffee joint with the promise of free wifi, we should be aware that what you are doing online could potentially be exposed especially, as is often the case, if the wifi network does not require a passcode to get online. Unsecure networks like this make it easier for cybercriminals to eavesdrop on what we do online. We should also be aware of \u2018rogue\u2019 wifi hotspots, which might deliberately use a name that\u2019s similar to the coffee shop we are currently sitting in but has nothing to do with them. So lets be careful before we connect to \u2018Stirbucks_wifi\u2019 etc. 2. Who is following us on social media? If we are not already concerned about the police\u2019s reach into our life, how do we feel about them reading your social media posts? And using the aforementioned facial recognition technology on our photos? Even if our social media accounts are all set to \u2018public\u2019, does that really mean your Facebook should be an open book to the police? Let\u2019s use an analogy. If we were walking through a busy city centre, minding our own business and not doing anything suspicious, how would you feel if a police officer followed you wherever you went? Would this make us feel safer? And would we think that because we are in public, we have forfeited our right to privacy? Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll give a short and simple explanation for this : To be frank though I'll totally agree with the second point that the \u201cConcept of privacy is just outdated\u201d . Every simple service you use nowadays whether it's sending an email to someone or the texts and images you exchange with your peers and relatives . Every single bit of data that you posses passes through a number of privately owned and maintained servers who simultaneously transfer and make copies of the information which passes through them , services like Google search and Facebook take your locations to serve , various games and streams take your name ,email ID , pictures and friend lists to register , Apps like Netflix and Amazon take and permanently store all the various Credit and debit card numbers that you entered in them along with the other technical details of your device . Every service ,Every app ,Every device wants your information in order to \u201cServe and Cater to your needs and demands\u201d but in reality all these apps generally sell these informations to third party apps to let them show advertisements through which they earn . It's both alarming and disturbing at the same time. ",
