            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t care about speed or bandwidth or reliability, anything from carrier pigeon to a pair of tin cans with a string stretched between them. If you want speed, then you can use some other part of the Electromagnetic spectrum, either in free space or in a waveguide. Or you can use sound (much slower, but still faster than pigeons). A telephone or intercom is essentially radio waves using a waveguide (a wire; the information is not carried by electrons moving slowly down the wire, but by a wave moving through the electrons). Much of the internet uses light (usually near infra-red) in a waveguide (optical fibre). Lasers in free space do not work so well on earth - they need line-of-sight, the air is dirty and they are subject to interference from rain, birds, people etc. Underwater, you can use sound to communicate. Whales use low frequencies over hundreds of miles, while we use modulated ultrasonics for divers to communicate underwater over short distances. Hypothetically, you could use high-speed particles to communicate. A beam of neutrinos would allow you to communicate through solid rock. The T2K experiment has actually done this (sent a beam of neutrinos 295km through solid rock) but as a communication method it\u2019s ridiculously expensive and impractical. Some advanced civilization might possibly use that to communicate over dozens of light years through interstellar dust clouds. ",
