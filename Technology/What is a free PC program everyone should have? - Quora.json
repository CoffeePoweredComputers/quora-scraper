            "answer_text": "Everything is one such application every Windows user should have. I have been using Windows search for a long time, it takes a long time to index and give results. Moreover windows search index consumes a lot of space. So I disabled Windows Indexing and started using Everything. Everything is fast at indexing, giving results and is easy to use. AutoHotkey is another application everyone should have. I use it to have my own hotkeys. But AutoHotkey is capable of much more than that. MusicBee is a very good music player-cum-music manager. It is easy to use and customizable. The things I like the best about MusicBee are time-synchronized lyrics and its search (search is excellent). Sumatra PDF is a free PDF, eBook (ePub, Mobi), XPS, DjVu, CHM, Comic Book (CBZ and CBR) reader for Windows. It is powerful, small, portable, easy to use, slightly customizable and starts up very fast. ClipGrab is a free downloader and converter for YouTube, Vimeo, Metacafe, Dailymotion and many other online video sites. SpaceSniffer is a portable disk scanning utility. I find it aesthetically better than WinDirStat  The following programs too are very good but may not interest everyone With Rufus, one can create bootable USBs (Windows or Linux) very easily. And Rufus is idiot-proof. If you are a fan of Spaced repetition (even if you're not), then you should try Anki.  Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. calibre is a free alternative to Adobe Acrobat.   calibre can convert from a huge number of e-book formats to a huge number of e-book formats. It supports all the major e-book formats. Therefore I believe calibre is better than Adobe Acrobat. If you ever wanted to offline copy of a website (small one I guess) in case the website is down or your Internet connection is down, then HTTrackis the application you need.  It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the \"mirrored\" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online.  With TeamViewer, you can access your friends' pcs remotely, share files with them or troubleshoot them.   There are lot more applications, I cannot recall some applications now and some of the applications like VLC, Notepad++, uTorrent, 7zip, CCleaner, Defraggler, Recuva etc. are already mentioned by the others. I will add other programs once I recall them. p.s If you want a program of particular category, leave a comment below. If I know any related program I will add that. ",
