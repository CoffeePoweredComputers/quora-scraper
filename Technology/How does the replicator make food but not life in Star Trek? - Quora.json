            "answer_text": "The transporter and replicator share some aspects of their technology, but they aren't the same kind of device. The transporter converts an actual object into a form which can be \u201cbeamed\" through space and reassembled, exactly as it was before beaming. This exact duplication is essential for things as complex as living beings, and many other kinds of complex matter. It has its quirks, some of which may work in individual stories, but are harder to fit into a single technical explanation. It can be used to \u201cedit\" the object sent. Rare malfunctions can create a duplicate, a reflected signal which is enhanced twice to allow both to create objects. Duplicates require the system to fill in the missing matter with stored reserves, and tends to result in one or both copies failing to be perfect. But even if they are both functional copies, it still requires an original object to allow a living creature to be duplicated. The replicator doesn't use an original object as its source. It instead uses a program to create objects from.stored materials, similar in concept to a current 3D printer. As such, it builds its objects out of pre-designed structures and molecules, and like most programmed devices, tends to duplicate structures repeatedly in order to make larger objects. The inherent resolution, especially for quantum states, is far less than the essentially perfect transporter. Replicators often operate at very low resolution and detail, when making objects which don't require fine structural components in order to work. For food, the replicator can run anything from simple protein and carbohydrate bars, to simulated cellular (dead) structures for better quality foods. The Federation disallows using it to create living beings. The basic design seems incapable of actually doing that anyway, because it lacks the ability to create the complex fine structures of living matter. But a medical replicator could use living cells as building materials, in order to construct artificial organs and other body parts for medical repairs. Doing so gets around the resolution limits, by making the raw materials by other means. Creating a larger, complex life form by this method would seem difficult. Like Frankenstein creating \u201clife\u201d from dead body parts, putting all the pieces together and making them work as intended would require very fine detail, control, timing, and energy in order to have the creation function as a living creature. Very simple life forms might be possible to create by this method. But what about the future, after Next Generation era? It is hard to say, since we've seen other species with more advanced technology do things which look miraculous even to Federation science. ",

            "answer_text": "It could be argued that the replicator actually DOES create life. The replicators are basically small transporters. The ship\u2019s main transporters scan an object or person to determine the exact composition and position of every particle in their body. Then, they disintegrate that person, and use raw matter from the surroundings at the destination to re-build that person or object again. Make no mistake - the person doesn\u2019t move. They die on the transporter pad, and an identical copy is made at the other side that is a living, breathing doppelganger who shares all the original\u2019s memories and emotions. It can (and does) also create clones this way. Cmdr. Riker had this happen to him on TNG, when a transporter accident created his clone Thomas Riker. Thomas was a separate individual with his own memories and life as soon as he stepped off that pad. He was identical to Will in every single way, but he was unquestionably alive and a new person. The replicator is just a transporter with a different function. It takes a \u2018gel\u2019 made of all the molecules you need to create something and transports it onto the replicator in the right combination to make a steak, or a cup of tea, or a screwdriver. It does this using in-built templates with all the information it needs on them. Given that it\u2019s just a mini-transporter, if you had the \u2018template\u2019 of a live mouse you could assemble and replicate infinite mice. You\u2019re only restricted by the size of the replicator. I assume that this is against Federation law, but it\u2019s definitely possible. ",
