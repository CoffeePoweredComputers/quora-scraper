            "answer_text": "People with this problem often had parents who had high standards, gave little praise, but a lot of criticism. They my not have even believed in praise, saying \u201cYou should just know when you have done a good job.\u201d The sufferer may also have had a parent or sibling who was superstar\u2014at the top of their field, the golden child, who excelled in everything. The child may have spent their life hearing\u2014\u201dWhy can\u2019t you be like your sister or brother? They may have been ignored, no matter their success. Individuals with this syndrome may feel inferior, denigrate their successes, deny victories, refuse to accept praise. Cognitive Restructuring/RET may help. The sufferer needs to ask WHO did the work? Did anyone else do it? Who\u2019s idea was the product or action? Did they steal the work (facetious\u2014but some people may feel they did)? Are all the people praising them fools, suckers, naive? A lucky outcome???\u2014what is luck? Ninety percent perspiration and hard work, 10% being in the right place, with the right idea, and the right skills\u2014-if this is true what does it say about them? Why don\u2019t they DESERVE the success? Are they evil? If evil, why have they not been arrested, exposed, called out? Stupid? If stupid, how were they able to do this? The individual needs to realize that if they came out of a dysfunctional family that produced these feelings\u2014-even now\u2014they are likely to not be recognized, praised, or valued. It is very possible they will hear\u2014Yes but, your brother did_________. Your father was able to__________________. \u201cBig deal, So what, Is that all, Don\u2019t get a swollen head,You are kidding, Who did you pay off, \u201c and similar phrases may also be heard with a dysfunctional family. You may need to learn to celebrate your successes by yourself and with those who accurately see and know you\u2014valuing what you do. ",

            "answer_text": "Stop comparing yourself to other authors, especially the well known ones. Set your expectations accordingly. Fifty Shades of Grey was a fluke, right subject, right time. Harry Potter was a phenomenon, again, right place, right time. And if you want the real story on some famous authors, google how many times their manuscripts were rejected. Your odds of a first novel being a best seller are about the same as winning the lottery. The thing is to have inventory so you don\u2019t fade into obscurity. Publish, even if self published, then have another in the wings to publish a few months later. TLDR: If you\u2019ve completed a novel, you\u2019re an author. If you polish that novel and get it published, you\u2019re then a published author. If you sell one book, count it as a win. If you get one 5 star review from a stranger, count that as a win. Take the little accomplishments as they come, starting with finishing your book. You\u2019d be surprised how many would be writers never even get that much done. ",
