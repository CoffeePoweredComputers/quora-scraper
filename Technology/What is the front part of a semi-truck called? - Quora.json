            "answer_text": "The front part of a semi-truck (technically, \u201csemi-trailer\u201d) is called the tractor. The combination is often referred to as a tractor-trailer. Tractors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from conventional, with a hood covering the engine, to cab-over, which lacks a front hood and positions the windshield almost directly above the front wheels. Tractors range in both length, horsepower, and gross weight, depending on the service they\u2019re intended for. The tractor is connected to the trailer by means of a kingpin on the underside of the front of the trailer. This kingpin engages a clamp in a coupling plate mounted near the rear of the tractor, and serves as the pivot point for the semi-trailer combination. The tractor contains the cab, which is where the driver sits, and often includes a sleeper compartment behind the cab. City trucks don\u2019t usually have a large cab, since the drivers go home every day, but over-the-road trucks have larger cabs with sleepers and room for the driver to store extra clothes, food, and personal items. Drivers are sometimes on the road for weeks or even months at a time (I did this myself for almost two years), and need to have a reasonable amount of comfort so they can sleep when they\u2019re not on duty.

            "answer_text": "Are you talking about the tractor, which is what the trailer is connected to? Or do you mean the grill, which sits over the steer axle? Perhaps you\u2019re referring to the zombie driving the truck at 0330 (3:30 in the morning for you civilians)? It\u2019s all the same thing. Tractor - vehicle used to pull a trailer. Driver sits inside, sleeps inside it, wishes they had paid attention in school in it. Trailer - receptacle of items driver is tasked with hauling. So many different kinds of trailers exist. I\u2019ve been a driver 10 years, still see trailers I don\u2019t recognize daily. ",
