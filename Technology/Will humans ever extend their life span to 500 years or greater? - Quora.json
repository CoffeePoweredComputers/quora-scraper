            "answer_text": "It is not a matter of extending life per se, but extending the functional life as a human. Because extending the life of someone that\u2019s not functional is not particularly useful. And extending the life of something that can\u2019t really be considered a human is not \u201cextending the life of humans\u201d. A human is much like a car - made of many parts which wear out at different rates and all have a service life. So, to extend the life of a car you can either replace parts as they wear out or design a better car. Per available design virtually all parts of a human have a fixed service life much under 500 years. Maybe apart from skin and bones. So, the strategies of significant life extension would invariably involve gene editing and/or organ replacement. I don\u2019t think that vitamins, dietary changes or some magic pill would give us a 5x life extension here. As for organ replacement, I do believe that as cloning tech advances we would be able to grow in a jar and replace most internal organs. Such procedures would be extraordinarily expensive and complicated, hence very rare. Sill, the obvious bottleneck would be that you can\u2019t really replace the brain and it seems to have an expiration date of under 500 years. Maybe in some fantasy future we\u2019d come up with some nanotechnology which would be able to physically encode brains doing a Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V on the hardware level. The software part of a human personality doesn\u2019t seem to be the main component per se. I don\u2019t see this tech emerging anytime soon. Plus, growing a functional brain in a jar might be far from trivial. As for gene editing, it might theoretically be possible to create something resembling a human which would have an arbitrary lifespan. You\u2019d need to totally change the metabolism, re-engineer pretty much each and every system in the body and likely add a number of new ones. Which won\u2019t be trivial. But, in principle that should be much easier to accomplish than growing/encoding a spare brain. Also, I am not sure that what we get as the final result would be a \u201chuman\u201d in the classical sense. And such a construct would likely lack reverse compatibility with vanilla humans when it comes to reproduction making it a distinct species by any definition. Which has some obvious implications. ",

            "answer_text": "Such questions relating to those types of examples are pointless. The physiology of an earthworm versus a human fucking being is like comparing the complexity of a hand grenade to that of an ICBM. Extended lifespans is about more than just age, it involves the physical deterioration of the human body, which can self regenerate\u2026 to a degree. With the exception of the brain's nerve cells, which are irreparable once damaged or dead. To live for such an obscene amount of time would require those nerve cells to be replaced, and doing so organically rather than synthetically (your body replacing them rather than a brain transplant) is leagues beyond what we currently understand. Not to mention that the body itself can only regenerate cells for so long. Eventually, you break down like a machine. And unlike replacing a buggered oil filter or what have you, trying to replace the human liver, heart or skin is outside of what we can do right now, at least without the aid of immunosuppressive drugs. Which brings us to another concept. Disease. Alzheimers, Turings, Cancer and various other diseases can end the human life well beyond the natural lifespan. And on thr topicof premature death, you've not considered workplace hazards and just health hazards in general. Immortal or not, a bus travelling at 80km/h can kill you at any age. ",

            "answer_text": "The graph of life expectancy in the U.S. has been pretty much linear, going from 71 years to 78 years 1970-2010:  Do we see just a hint of some plateau over the last few years? Maybe ...  But look at Japan's curve, since it has the longest life expectancy of any major country in the world (thanks to Prof. David Roper):   Their curve definitely seems to be flattening as it approaches 85 years (it's almost there now, actually). You can see almost the same thing in Germany:   A lot depends less on medical science than on prosperity. It has taken a while for the eastern part of Germany to approach the life expectancy curve of the western part of Germany, but since unification in 1990, they are almost at equity now:  So barring unexpected breakthroughs, I think we in the U.S. can also expect to reach a \"natural\" limit of 85 in 2040 or so (unless we really want to keep people in poverty, as some are advocating). This apparent physical limit may not be so different from athletic performances, which are plateauing as well. For example, the world record for running a mile:  But then ... sometimes super humans come along and change everything:  ... and look like this:   ",

            "answer_text": "It's not likely.  Most of the answers still suffer from the basic confusion of life expectancy versus life span. The short answer.  Increases in life expectancy are only improving the probability of surviving to the human life span.  They are NOT increases in lifespan. All the graphs, etc. are simply nonsense, because they are working on population averages which tells us nothing about actual life span.  In the 19th century there were people that lived into their 90's just as there are people today living into their 90's.  Life expectancy increases because the effect of infant mortality is decreasing.  That doesn't mean that anyone is actually living longer. In addition, the expectation that somehow modern technology is responsible for longevity is simply PR.  There is little evidence to suggest that modern technology has done anything for life span, although it clearly can affect individuals that had a higher probability of dying younger.   The current human lifespan is 120+ years.  Until life expectancy begins to approach this number, any talk about increasing life span is scientific nonsense. ",

In the event that there is a hard biological limit that prevents a single human body from lasting that long, it is often imagined that we may find a way around that in the form of mind uploading. However, nowhere near enough is known about the workings of the brain to make this anything more than a dream. Also, of course, a prerequisite to all of this is that we as a society treat people well enough that they could live that long, including healthcare. Even if we don\u2019t actually make it to an average life expectancy of over 125 - even if that is impossible - we will be better off as a society for having tried. ",

People in the last 100 years enjoyed the improvements in the environment while still having good genetics shaped by thousands of years of the evolution which gave us steady increase in the lifespan. Although we can expect the progress in the medical care to continue, the gene pool will eventually degrade. People who wouldn\u2019t survive their childhood 100 years ago (me probably included) nowadays can live without problems long enough to have their own children. To be fair, this is a very slow process and although sometimes effects can be seen in the next generation, for the whole gene pool it will take dozens of generations to have a significant effect.On the other hand bacterias are still evolving and there are already superbugs immune to antibiotics which sends the medical care one step back. There are two solutions to this issue that should be combined: genetic engineering (not only to fix the faulty genes, but also to make new better ones too) and extensive use of body implants (especially electronic ones for brain to external world communication, eventually leading to immortal humans living in a virtual world). This is still probably not very popular nowadays and may lead us to the Borg-society, but without these steps the lifespan will reach a plateau at 85 years (as demonstrated by Laszlo B. Tamas) and then probably start to decrease. ",
