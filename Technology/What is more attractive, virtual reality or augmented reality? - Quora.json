            "answer_text": "It boils down to personal opinion and when you're asking this question. In the long run neither of them will prevail.  Alright, let me explain myself.  It's important to know what are distinct differences between the two, before you make an investment into the hardware of your choice.  There's also an inevitable follow-up question: \"What about mixed reality?\"  Virtual Reality VR is the computer-generated simulation of a 3D image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors. If you choose to try VR, you are leaving the real world and immerse yourself into new one. Your visual and hearing sensors are focused into the artificial world. Your actions, flailing around with your hands, jumping up and down has an effect on the VR world (and the real one as well).  Closing yourself completely from real world might be uncomfortable for most people and I don't see it in much use in public, except for few exceptions. But it's definitely cool to do so and experience the artificial world.  Chris Milk calls VR the Ultimate Empathy Machine which makes it a perfect medium for storytellers. Our brain gets tricked by VR, because it appears so real. Even as you're aware about the trickery, you will still feel connected to the story. Chris Milk - How VR is creating an ultimate empathy machine Nonny De La Pena - The Future of News? Virtual RealityIn regards of content, VR is blowing up right now. Games are being made and announced on regular basis. Filmmaking and Storytelling is evolving, and when the prices of VR cameras drop, there will be even more content out there.  And let's not forget the most obvious application of VR there is. For the next few years VR has a solid future. Being funded by Facebook (Oculus) and Valve (HTC) helps a lot as well. So if you are gamer or story-lover the VR is definitely the most attractive option of the two.  Augmented Reality AR superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view - it blends digital components into the real world. AR doesn't isolate you from reality completely, but adds a layer of data.  It's great for unobtrusive use of certain applications such as automatic translations, additional data, tracking biometrics etc.   Mixed Reality  If you combine interactivity of VR and open nature of AR, you get MR. If the layers of digital graphic can be manipulated with our actions  MR and AR on other case still keeps you in the real world with added Augmented layers with which you can interact with.  I've mentioned in the start that neither VR or AR will  the long run I feel like AR and MR have better chances (even though I work in a VR startup).  I bet 9 out of 10 people will feel uncomfortable putting on a VR device in public. The tenth person is a nihilist and just doesn't care.  Would you be brave enough to suspend the senses in real world and move to the virtual one while waiting for subway train to come. Of course not, you might run into somebody or someone might take the opportunity to relieve you of your wallet or a handbag. It's easy to lose self-awareness and track of time in VR.  The biggest advantage of MR (and AR) is that it's going to take less time for people to get used to.  I mean check the \"lense\" Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap holding in his hand. Compare that piece of technology to bulky headwear of Oculus/HTC.   ",

            "answer_text": "For pure aesthetics, VR is the more attractive. It is an entirely created digital world, and so the author can make the scene appear any way they desire. They can determine your entry point into the scene, including things like the camera height so that it feels \u2018real\u2019 and everything about that scene. By contrast, AR is an attempt to overlay digital elements on the real world. The most commonly understood example of this is Pokemon Go. But in the game the characters don\u2019t interact with the real world, they\u2019re just sort of painted on top. So regardless of trees or water or other features of the landscape, the characters sit there. It has a fake quality to it that interrupts the aesthetics you\u2019re talking about in your question. MR has been mentioned by some other responders as an option, and it is a version of AR where the real and the digital respond better to each other. So imagine looking at how a real chair looks in a digital room, or being able to move that chair in a responsive design. Useful, for sure. Interesting, even. But more attractive? I doubt it. VR is a window on a fully digital, authored world and therefore like a movie scene composed by a director or a painting, drawing or rendering, it can be made more aesthetically pleasing than the \u2018real\u2019 if the author desires.
