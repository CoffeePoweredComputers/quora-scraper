            "answer_text": "It won't slow down your computer because virtualization does not consume major resources. When a computer is going slow, its because the hard drive, processor, or ram is being overly utilized. When you start up a virtual machine (which uses virtualization) then you begin to consume resources. A VM could be small (like a Windows 2000 backup server) or larger such as an enterprise web host. Depending on the VMs performance will directly affect the servers performance. You can think of the relationship between the server and the VM like a pie whereby the VM takes a proportionate amount of resources from the server. ",
