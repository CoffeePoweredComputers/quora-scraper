            "answer_text": "Air travel is energy expensive and has a LOT of regulation hurdles, mostly because regulatory bodies need to have the highest safety levels to make sure nothing is falling out of the sky and crashing into people or property. So a mini-car, which is autonomous and carries nothing but cargo is always going to be \u201cbetter\u201d, at least by the criteria of cost and ease of getting the device past regulations barriers. Something the size of a scooter, with three wheels, and a mast going up to seven feet high (both for sensors and to be highly visible to human drivers) would be nearly as fast as aerial drone delivery by quadcoters, but also able to carry a much larger package, both in volume and weight.

Honestly, the way things are currently done (humans in cars) is the best way. There is no other real alternative available that will compare , both in terms of efficiency and cost. ",
