            "answer_text": "there are MANY such places these days \u2026 try ViewBug for example \u2026 or Shutterstock \u2026 or Flikr \u2026 or Fine Art America \u2026 or \u2026 (even Facebook, Twitter, Instagram et al can be used for the purpose if you know how to do it \u2026 but Facebook degrades the image quality so much it\u2019s not the best option really!) search online using the keywords: sell photos online internet photo gallery \u2026 and things like that to find them \u2026. remember though: some of these \u2018services\u2019 do offer free yet limited accounts of some kind, while others start with a fully-paid offer and are not easy to enter their \u2018club\u2019 since they require the photographer to send some samples of his/her works first, maybe even pass some specific technical tests, so that s/he\u2019s found qualified enough to be a member there \u2026 IMPORTANT: you may join any, most or all of these services, post billions of your masterpieces in all of them for decades but not sell even a single photo for known or unknown reasons! so, just be prepared so as not to be disappointed! just keep doing your thing and NEVER give up if you\u2019re truly motivated! also try printing business cards, flyers, create your own website etc, as well as print some of your best shots, make a nice little or big album, a few lightweight yet fancy frames and so on, then carry them around to actual street galleries as well, where you may try your luck \u2018face to face\u2019 \u2026 (be ware some if not most of them may not be happy dealing with \u2018callers\u2019 without an appointment though \u2026 be VERY polite and friendly and appreciate their valuable time!) hint: make sure the site / service does allow you to use your own watermark signature(s) and/or logo etc (possibly along with or without theirs) so you can make yourself and your work known publicly \u2026 your photo without your own signature can be stolen and maybe sold under someone else\u2019s name! (if a service doesn\u2019t allow photographers and artists to use their own logos and publish their own website addresses and enforces other \u2018bans\u2019 too, i\u2019d avoid that service TOTALLY! if they ask for money to let you advertise yourself more aggressively, that\u2019s a different story and it may be worth it if you can afford the costs \u2026) more hints: do not overdo the image in editing (unless when truly necessary!) and don\u2019t make your logo/signature look so \u2018obvious\u2019 and big etc that it may \u2018cover\u2019 the image\u2019s main subject and original looks! but do make sure your logo/signature does exist there and IS visible enough \u2026 CAUTION: just having your logo/signature on your own artwork is no guarantees it wouldn\u2019t be stolen! but well, you do have the original, preferably in lossless formats such as RAW or TIFF etc .. therefore, you ought to upload your photos (or artworks) in a smaller size, lower quality yet good looking enough in JPG or PNG and the like lossy formats, and no \u2018deeper\u2019 than 72ppi \u2026 (and no lesser than 36ppi of course \u2026) that\u2019s all for now folks but i just made the basic points here \u2026 there\u2019s more to all that of course \u2026 :-) ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to sell your photos online: direct sales via website like Etsy or Shopify (or your own website)Stock photo sales on many stock media sites (like Shutterstock, pond5, Fotolia, etc)Social media is a great place to sell your work - I've spoken with photographers who make money on IG, Tumblr, and FacebookSubscription sales from sites like Patreon.Photo sales to magazines and publications - look at the photographers market guide 2017 for lists of photo sales avenues.The big thing is a hefty marketing campaign. You need find an audience for your work and market to them directly. It will take time. The trick here is to be patient, persistent, and positive. Most artists give up before they really get going. Your best bet is to set up a website or a social media starting place like a Facebook page or something similar that lets you post large versions of your work and continue to expand to new areas. You'll need to post regularly - be you and it will be fine. Don't quit your day job yet. I left mine for other reasons and decided to do photography professionally. some things to consider: what do you shoot? What do you like to shoot? How is your work unique from the thousands of other photographers out there? Do you shoot people? Nature? Landscapes? Architecture? Something completely different? When you market, people want to see you. Yes, the you that is messy, insecure, depressed, angry, etc. Not the idealized version everyone wants to see, but the real you. Believe me, it helps sell art. So, when you write, write your way using your words and your ideas. ",
