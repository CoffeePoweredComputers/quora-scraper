            "answer_text": "Haptic is a Greek word which means \u2018able to come into contact\u2019 or \u2018anything related to sense of touch\u2019. The technology where the sense of touch is recreated through vibration or other means is known as haptic technology. Haptic technology saw one of the earliest applications in large aircrafts, where controls surfaces were operated through servomechanism systems, a system which provided negative feedback when it sensed error. The servo systems was not equipped enough to let the pilot know of any external threats. The servo systems were modified with weights and springs to allow sending vibrations to the controller in the pilot\u2019s hand, whenever threats were detected by the servo system. Modern haptic technology utilizes sensors to measure the amount of force exerted, by the user, on the user interface and then sends a feedback. The market for haptic technology is growing at a very fast pace, primarily owing to the growing demand for various consumer electronic devices globally. Haptic technology is now a common feature in most mobile handsets such as smart phones and tablets. It is also being used in various laptops. It has also being seeing growing applications in gaming consoles. The increasing penetration of internet of things (IoT) coupled with rural penetration of internet in emerging economies has been boosting the growth of smart phones, tablets and laptops market. This in turn has been positively impacting the growth of haptic technology market. Additionally, haptic technology is also being utilized in vehicular electronics and medical electronics among others. Furthermore, various research institutes and research and development (R&D) divisions of corporations have been focusing on improving haptic systems and also to develop newer applications for haptic technology. Considering all the positive impacts of the above mentioned factors, the market for haptic technology is expected to grow at a fast pace. PDF For Detailed Anaysis of Haptic Technology ",

            "answer_text": "Haptic technology is mainly focussed to provide to a user interacting with a general piece of equipent a tactile feedback delivering a piece of information. A simple example is the vibratoin of the joypad of the playstation or Xbox. There are proven advantages to provide haptic feedback while interacting with devices, it has been show that natural haptic feedback in trackpads reduces the error rate, and pointing timing consistently of ~ 10 %. Which may be considered trivial for standard applications, whereas in critical applications, such as robotic surgery, is a fundamental feature to reduce the possible mistakes. ",
