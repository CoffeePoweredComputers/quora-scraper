            "answer_text": "As established by the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual, the holodeck is a combination of holography, replicators, and force fields designed to simulate an experience. We have a difficult time producing holograms in full color that don\u2019t have rainbow effects due to diffraction. And animation of a holographic image is still in its infancy. [sidebar: That pyramid thing that you place under or over your phone to see \u20183D\u2019 images is not actually 3D\u2014it is a set of four 2D views mapped onto a virtual four-sided prism by the reflection of the pyramid surface. A real three-dimensional image would have a slightly different view from any angle.] However, the image component is nonetheless the closest to being reality of all aspects of the holodeck. Force fields such as tractor and repulsor fields are mostly theoretical at this point; the few demonstrations that even begin to approach such things involve very small areas of effect, and use technologies that would be impractical to use at the scales seen in the holodeck. And replication is completely beyond our grasp at the moment. In-universe, replication is a specialized form of transporter technology, that takes raw matter and conforms it to a specific matrix\u2014that of a known substance or item. It is of a limited \u2018resolution\u2019 compared to transporters; transporters may be considered to be a matter transfer technology under continuous control, whereas replication can be considered to be controlled by a more discrete and quantized matrix. An apt comparison might be the difference between extremely high-fidelity analog audio versus a relatively low-fidelity digital audio format such as 8000Hz 8-bit. Out-of-universe, we have no idea how to convert matter on the macro scale. We are barely able to accomplish the teleportation of a single quantum, and it is unclear if that accomplishment is actual teleportation or a result of quantum entanglement effects. tl;dr: No. ",

            "answer_text": "Well lets see, The technical reference manual had 2 versions mentioned, I think they hinted that one was for smaller vessels that didn't have the resources of the enterprise. holography is fairly difficult, however if you can determine where someone is and project light directly into their eyes creating the illusion of the world (inverse ray tracing) then you can create the view of the 3d world that is not there. Many attempts have been done to add \"rain, smells, breezes\" to feature films, so you would have to introduce this sort of effects as well. There are Virtual reality systems where you walk on a ball and it allows you to move in the game without needing a controller, but then the technology of kinect is getting better and better.  Forcefields currently there is no known existance of these so this is how the fake people in the holodeck were controlled, sort of like puppets, the computer would replicate a fake human body and then control it with tractor beams and forcefields (this was the earlier season 1 explanation prior to the sherlock holmes episode in Season 2) post that forcefields made the impression of touching a wall or person or item, and if you wanted to say eat an apple the apple would be replicated for you to actually eat. but then the gun scene in first contact counteracts that again and reverts to the original explanation. (I prefer the second and it would then also allow bullets to not kill as they are only forcefields and not actually bullets)     ",
