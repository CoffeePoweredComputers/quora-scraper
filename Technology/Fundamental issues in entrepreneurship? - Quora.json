You will live, breath, talk, dream your business.Understand P&L and Balance sheets. You dont need to be an accountant, but at the very least have attended some seminars, training or corses in accounting to understand how a business runs, the importance of margins, profitability, strong balance sheets, financial projections.Being able to sell, and always hustling. Get outside your comfort zone, challenge yourself to talk to one stranger a day. Get better at speaking, communicating, writing.Become a great leader, to drive teams, to sell to customers. Dress well, look well, deliver commanding presentations, attract others.Develop good systems, set up a cookie cutter approach once your formula is successful, train others, write systems manuals, and upscaleValue your time, it is your most important asset. Know your $/hr rate. Don\u2019t waste your time on work that can be outsourced at a cheaper rate. Ensure your time is being spent productively, driving sales $, Cutting costs, training others so that others can do the key grunt work. You focus on the next deal or opportunityLEVERAGE - the most important of all. Leverage OPM/OPT (other peoples money, other peoples time. Understand good debt/bad debt, learn from industry leaders, great mentors - success leaves cluesCashflow is king, but so is equity that you create, and the equity allows leveraged borrowings for scaling.Control all elements of the process, so that there is no key middlemen, all parts of the business can be given to other staff and they can be quickly retrained if staff leave.Sit back and enjoy what you have built, enjoy the fruits of your labour.Never forget your roots, and what made you successful, stay humble, grateful and modest,",

            "answer_text": "Make an analysis of how we selected / fall in love with a girl or boy. When we tried to build that relationship and when we have not gone to any crash course or read any books before we venture into \"falling-in-love\" business. But you have selected that girl or boy ( I will say \"friend\")  after due mental process and after observing your friends, watching moves or TV Serials or books.  When you have established a contact, then your aim is that you will have to talk to her, convince her and then own her. Once she talked to you and gave you time to speak to her and once you talked to her - the connection is established and only that has to be cemented so that it will last long.  From then...  Every morning you get up thinking about her, and spend some time alone while thinking about her, then when you are dressing you wait and start thinking same thing, when you have your food, and surprisingly ( you don't know or realize) you have no interest on taste, no preference of dishes, not concerned about what you eat when to eat etc as your mind and soul is concentrated on that \"business\" of having that girl - at any cost. Everything else is simply not existed.  You will succeed - but did you ever tried to discuss or learn few hacks or tips or getting expert opinion about how to?   It was your plan, your strategy, and you don't want any one there, because it was your purely personal matter. And its your ( you would have replied to me) life and death problem.  Why not same enthusiasm, concentration, effort and secrecy is not being maintained when you want an enterprise of your own?  The idea of entrepreneur has come to you, then you start looking everywhere and frankly you have done the due-diligence  about yourself and then only you decided to get into your own enterprise.  1. Never invite a close friend or boy-hood friend to join you or help you or make him as your employee.  I can tell 5 real incidents - in one case after nearly 30 years courtship that friend asked 50 million to leave the company along with his relatives who occupied key positions in the organization. This company started in the same year the Microsoft was started. We are 6 brothers and no one has worked there. 2. Never ever mix sex with company affairs - I mean do not have any extra-marital affairs with any employee at any time - once you had - then her growth starts while your growth gets stagnated. 3. By the time you attain the age of 45 - see that you relinquish your authority on company management and hand-it-over to your son, however may be his qualification or bring your wife into board by giving her substantial rights. Reason - a male after 45 is vulnerable.  4. Never enter into business without understanding what is debit and what is credit and what is P&L and how the Balance Sheet looks like.  Get / purchase books and you should be able to question the Auditors and write their answers or ask them to write and come back verify in the net and get satisfied and then say yes or no. do not get convinced and do not agree with your finance manager - because it is your money. Except these fundamental issues - others things can be managed, outsourced, ask employees to do those jobs. ",
