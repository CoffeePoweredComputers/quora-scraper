            "answer_text": "The best 3D software for a beginner is the one your clients need you to use. I\u2019m not going to lie. I started using 3D software at the end of the 1980\u2019s. I was really good at Adobe Illustrator. But I didn\u2019t know how different 3D and 2D were until I bought Alias Sketch. There was virtually no internet, no YouTube, nothing except a cryptic manual using terminology I never understood to teach me how to use it. Eventually I decided to buy form-Z and ElectricImage Animation System. Both were the best option for someone on Mac OS at the time and together it cost me over $4000 in 1991. Fast forward 28 years and here\u2019s the biggest lesson I have learned. Any software you choose is going to be an albatross around your neck if something better comes along. Why? I have hundreds of projects in EIAS and thousands of assets created in form-Z. Both of these applications are horribly out of date, hard to use, and extremely limited in what they can do. But with all these assets and projects in my archives the idea of switching to something current like Maya, Houdini, or Cinema 4D was a tough sell. But one day a client got frank with me. They showed me something done by someone else using 3D Studio MAX and said, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d I had to admit it was literally impossible using my software. Of course they didn\u2019t care. They needed a product from me I couldn\u2019t deliver. It took me a couple of years but I learned C4D. It can do almost everything I need. And with plugins it can do about 95% of what I need. (If I had to evaluate other 3D apps not one would provide 100%.) There are a few projects in where Maya might be better, other projects where 3DS Max would be better. But my work Cinema 4D is the best option. It took me almost a year to get up to speed on C4D, and that included learning which plugins were necessary for my work, and how to use them. And how to develop a basic workflow for the kinds of projects I do. So to answer your question, the best 3D software to use is the one that is the best for the kind of work you want to do. If it\u2019s character animation, or industrial animation, or motion graphics, or architectural rendering. Whichever you choose the answer is going to be different. You need to consider modeling, animation and rendering for each. You need to be aware of things like scripting and plugins. You can literally get started with anyone of a number of good apps, but the longer you use it the more entrenched you\u2019ll become. Let\u2019s say you decide to learn Blender. It\u2019s free, and it\u2019s powerful. But it cannot do everything. And you will eventually need plugins to do GPU rendering or particle systems. Then you\u2019re going to have to spend some serious money. Over time you\u2019re going to amass hundreds or thousands of projects so you\u2019ll want to keep Blender around even if you move up to something like Maya just to be able to open those old files. At some point you are going to have to decide on the best application for you. Unless you work in a studio with floating licenses for multiple different apps, it\u2019s going to become too expensive to keep ongoing licenses up to date for more than one or two applications and all the plugins you need. So do your homework. Decide what kind of 3D work you want to do (and also what the market is for that kind of work). Find out what the best software is for that kind of work, what their strengths and drawbacks are, and how much it costs to own and maintain, and even if it\u2019s possible to sell your license if you decide you don\u2019t like it. Then, jump in! ",

            "answer_text": "I actually came here looking for an answer to the question myself, but it seems I might have an answer for your question instead. I would say the best beginner experience I\u2019ve had with 3d animation software has been with Poser 11, which is fairly expensive (not compared to most other software, but $120 is a lot to spend on anything digital). There\u2019s no need to set up rigs and skeletons separate from the original model just to avoid stretching a leg down into hell or the neck up into the aether, every model in there comes with an attached adjustable skeleton, and is great for just getting the hang of simple animations. The only real hang-ups I\u2019ve had on it have been getting actual human models made (hair on that thing is a nightmare to do with the internal program), and making animations longer than a second. But if you just want practice with positioning models and getting used to the feel of animating figures in 3d space, Poser works really well for a beginner. Much better than SFM or Blender. ",
