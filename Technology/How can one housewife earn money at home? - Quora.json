            "answer_text": "Before I ever had a child, I knew I would want to be that mom who stayed at home, focused on raising my child, instead of going for a high-powered career at the same time. I admire women who can do both but it wasn\u2019t for me. That said, living costs where I live are high and to be able to survive on one income, we needed not only to learn (and implement) financial planning but also earn extra income. Cue me spending massive amounts of time trying to find legitimate ways to make more money remotely. Thankfully, the internet has made it a lot simpler. Check out the top 10 ways you can earn money from home: Surf job boards for remote work. Did you know that there are now job boards dedicated to legitimate remote work opportunities? These are not scams but actual jobs that you can do from home.Remote work is perhaps the easiest transition to make if you would like the freedom to work anywhere but don\u2019t necessarily want to work for yourself.And you can even do service-oriented work online. Plumbers, doctors, nurses and therapists, for example, can now work remotely if they wanted to by joining certain companies, like JustAnswer or BetterHelp.YouTube videos. If you do it right, YT vids can be very lucrative. You earn not only from ads but also via sponsorships and affiliate marketing. Just look at Ryan\u2019s Toy Review as one example. FYI, this isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme. Yes, some people are overnight successes but they\u2019re not the norm. Treat this is a business that will need the same amount of commitment as a brick-and-mortar venture.Affiliate marketing. My weapon of choice in this digital smorgasbord. And the weapon of choice for many online marketers who dream of more freedom. Affiliate marketing, according to Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income, \u201cis the process of earning a commission by promoting other people\u2019s (or company\u2019s) products. You find a product you like, promote it to others and earn a piece of the profit for each sale that you make.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s just revenue sharing.If you don\u2019t have a product but want to earn money, then what you can do is apply to be an affiliate or partner of a company that does have a product (or a service) and promote it. You then get a commission for any purchase made via yourself (don\u2019t worry, you get a special link that allows the company to keep track of any sales that go through you).So, you have your special link that you then place onto your website or a social media account (think of your Instagram bio, your Facebook page or your YouTube video descriptions) and when people click on it, love the product and decide to buy it, the company you\u2019re an affiliate for tracks the sale, knows it\u2019s made because of your promotion and dedicates a percentage of the sale as your commission.Sounds awesome, right?Blogging. Why blog? Because your earning potential is practically limitless.Take a look at Elna of Twins Mommy, Carly of Mommy on Purpose and obviously Suzi of Start A Mom Blog. They\u2019re big in the blogging world as all of them are now making a full-time income by monetising their blogs.How do you do what they did?You can create your own course, embed affiliate links in your post, collaborate with your favourite brands, build a community that is totally invested in what you have to say and the products you recommend and the list goes on.In my personal opinion, affiliate marketing is the best way to monetise a blog. It\u2019s not as annoying as the ads that pop up when you\u2019re trying to read a post and which wouldn\u2019t leave the screen no matter how many times I hit X with my fat fingers. Obviously, this depends very much on how much traffic you have and the percentage on offer. Most major brands have an affiliate program and to find them, you just search on Google: topic + affiliate program.Anyway, there are many ways to get to the top of the mountain as they say. This is ours, if you want to see: How To Set Up A Blog To Make Money: The Resources You Need.Blog Flipping. Full disclosure: I don\u2019t have personal experience with blog flipping but I have heard a lot of good things from people who have done it before.Because domain names and websites are like real estate, you can do the online equivalent of real estate flipping.Done right, it can be very lucrative.First, you look for blogs that are failing, haven\u2019t been updated before or even those that are already out on sale.Some people just look at sites like Flippa or BlogsForSale which offers all sorts of online real estate that you can sell (like blogs, apps, domains etc).The downside to using sites like this is that anything you might be eyeing has already been priced so you\u2019ll probably pay more than if you were to approach a website owner who has let a site go and then offered to buy their site.I know someone who put a post out on a Facebook group to ask if anyone wanted to give up their blog and then offered to buy it.For more information, you can check out Sasha Lassey\u2019s interview with Chelsea Clarke.Freelancing. If you\u2019re looking to avoid employment but don\u2019t quite want to go the blogging, marketing or YouTube star route, then freelancing might be your answer. The digital age has given us so many options to choose from: writer, proofreader, social media marketer, web designer and developer, virtual assistant \u2013 these are a few things that you can be and you don\u2019t even have to leave your room to do them.The sky truly is the limit and you just need to harness your skills and then position yourself as an authority.Amazon FBA. Amazon FBA (Fulfilled-By-Amazon) is sort of like dropshipping, except you let Amazon do most of the work.You don\u2019t have to wrap your packages yourself and with the right training, can make you millions.If I weren\u2019t in love with blogging, I\u2019d be doing exactly this.So, what do you have to do?Step 1: Send your products to Amazon.Step 2: Amazon sorts your products and inventories them.Step 3: Customer goes to the Amazon website or app and orders your product.Step 4: Amazon packages your product and ships it to the customer on your behalf.Step 5: Once your customer receives the order, Amazon then follows up to check if everything is okay and if any changes need to be made\u2026and makes them.Sounds fab, right?All you really have to do is make sure that you source quality products that will make a profit, you have enough in your inventory and then promote it.Instagram Influencer. Instagram Influencers are really nothing more than content creators that leverage the Instagram platform to build communities across a particular niche or topic.That\u2019s it.And you don\u2019t even need thousands or even millions of followers.You just need the right ones \u2013 the engaged ones who really care about what you have to say.So, if you love taking photos and making them shine or if you absolutely adore reaching out to people and just engaging with them online, then this might be extremely lucrative for you.Sell your own product or course. One of the more difficult but infinitely more lucrative of the top 10 ways to make money from home is to sell your own product or course.They could be anything, as long as they provide value.Though remember that if it\u2019s flexibility and freedom you value, then you might want to consider how you\u2019re going to get said product or course to your customers.Digital products \u2013 like eBooks, printables, mp3 files etc \u2013 work best because all you have to do is upload once and then your customers will just download them after purchase.No need to worry about shipping. It\u2019s actually the same for a course.Sign up for an account (paid) with Teachable and then build your course.Network Marketing. Network Marketing has gotten such a bad rep in recent years, which is quite sad really when you think about it.The basic premise is actually pretty good and pretty similar to affiliate marketing, in my opinion. We already recommend things we love to people we know so why not paid when you do so?Many hugely successful people started with network marketing. Jim Rohn and Earl Shoaff come to mind.I\u2019ve personally dabbled in it but didn\u2019t really pursue it save for buying the products for myself and my family whenever we needed them so I won\u2019t be able to offer advice on how to make this work as a replacement for your full-time income. That said, there are many who\u2019ve managed to succeed in network marketing. And I\u2019ll let the world-renowned Robert Kiyosaki give you the information you require if you\u2019re really interested.Just remember that this has such a stigma attached to it, so you\u2019ll really have a battle on your hands but hey, with the right company, teammates and attitude, this might work for you.You\u2019ll also need to check out the company and make sure that it\u2019s actually a valid opportunity and not a pyramid scheme. They\u2019re completely different but it\u2019s easy enough for a pyramid scheme to masquerade as a network marketing opportunity.And there you have it. 10 ways you can start making money from home as a stay-at-home mom.

I think the best way to earn money at home is through the internet. You can either earn money through Take Surveys OnlineYou can try to make money by taking survey online. However, it is not possible to make a living by filling up surveys and you will not be able to make a sustainable income. However, it is the simplest and the most straightforward way to make money online as it does not require any special skills and qualification. Below you can find a list of legitimate paid survey sites you can sign up. Pinecone ResearchPaidViewPointOpinion OutpostSwagbucksiPollVivaticGlobal Test MarketMySurveyiPanelIpsosHowever, there are pros and cons making money through paid survey sites.

You need to constantly participate in taking surveys every day.Affiliate MarketingAlternatively, you can become an affiliate marketer. I graduated as an engineer and after years of working 9-to-5, I got fed up with the routine work and decided to do something else that could earn me an opportunity to spend quality time with my family and make extra cash. I started as a blogger and expected to make some extra cash like anyone else. To my surprise, it turned out well where I made more money than what I could as an engineer. My preferred way is to become an affiliate marketer because it allows me to make a lucrative and sustainable income through blogging. You can easily make $300 - $500 per day by becoming an affiliate marketer. To make money from blogging (affiliate marketing), First, you need to find your niche. A niche means a target or a subject that you are going to write about. A niche can be your interest, a hobby or a skill. Any subject can be your niche, for example, people blog about collecting match boxes, bug photography, work-out program, or even daily political scandals and etc. Remember one thing is when you are finding your niche, avoid being too broad with your selection. For example, do not blog about Work Out Tips and Motorbike at the same time. Both of them fall on different categories and they just can't simply be put together. You could do a post about your niche (e.g. camera, guitar, trekking) and include affiliate links to any paid ones (e.g. Amazon or ShareASale). Create great content is not enough to make a lucrative income online today. You will have to make use of social media platform to promote your content and drive traffic to purchase items via your product reviews. My site earned my $7,000 within six months. Of course, I worked extremely hard at the beginning and success did not happen overnight. I spent almost 5 hours per day after work to make it worked. As my site matures, I spend 1 to 2 hours every day writing, optimizing my site, connect to social media and reply readers' emails. The best thing is the earning potential doesn't stop there and the revenue growth is still climbing up every single day (provided I publish articles regularly). At the time of writing, my site is making 5-figure revenue every month. Anyway, my answer is if you're passionate about a subject and you have decent writing skills, blogging definitely could be an alternative career path for you to make a living. All you need is to become an affiliate marketer. You will also find the pros and cons working as an affiliate marketer. Pros:The earning potential is enormous due to the exponential growth of the internet usersIt allows you to make sustainable income onlineIt allows you to quit your nine-to-five job and allow you to spend quality time with your familiesIt is a legitimate online businessThere are many affiliate programs on the internet you can participate (e.g. Amazon, ShareASale, Apple, FreeflyVR)Cons:It requires a lot of effort and timeYou need to blog from time to time (constantly publish content)You need to learn how to do affiliate marketingYou can\u2019t do it alone. It requires mentor-ship. You can do it alone with trial and error method but it takes a while to figure out the methodologyEasy to get scammed as a newbie as there are many so called internet Guru out there to steals your money and only deliver empty promises.I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. For example, everyone is talking about virtual reality now. If you are interested in VR and you blog about, I believe there will be a huge potential in making good money from it. Note: Freefly VR offers affiliate program to earn commission. So, my answer to your question - become a blogger/ affiliate marketer. If you need help on building your first online business, let me know. I could work alongside with you. All you need to do is to get my 7-day Free email course. Hope the answer helps. Regards Alex Founder of ManagingYourFinance(dot)Com ",
