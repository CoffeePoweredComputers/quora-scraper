            "answer_text": "Over the past few decades, art and tech have become more intertwined than ever before, whether it\u2019s through providing new ways to mix different types of media, allowing more human interaction or simply making the process of creating it easier. Case in point is a show titled \u201cDigital Revolution\u201d that opened earlier this summer in London\u2019s Barbican Centre. The exhibit, which runs through mid-September, includes a \u201cDigital Archaeology\u201d section which pays homage to gadgets and games that not that long ago dazzled us with their innovation. (Yes, an original version of Pong is there, presented as lovable antiquity.) But the show also features a wide variety of digital artists who are using technology to push art in different directions, often to allow gallery visitors to engage with it in a multi-dimensional way.

            "answer_text": "Oil paint invented in the Renaissance changed painting for the better. No other paint could quite give off that soft shiny glow that oils produce.  When the camera started to become popular in the late 1800s it left artists free to explore modes of painting other than realism. Impressionism, Expressionism and eventually Modernism were born.  ",
