            "answer_text": "When Apple was in its really early years, the brains behind all the products like Apple I and II was Steve Wozniak. He had an inherent skill to design highly simple and efficient circuits. Steve saw the commercial potential of what he was working on and together they started making money out of it, starting out of Job's garage.At Apple, Steve was mentored by a lot of other visionaries. A notable one was Regis McKenna, a marketing legend in Silicon Valley. The way Steve marketed his products was largely guided by him. Apart from that, there was Ronald Wayne, Arthur Rock and Mike Markkula.As for the early Apple products such as the Macintosh, he had people like Bill Atkinson, Chris Espinosa and a host of other brilliant people who put together the world's first personal computer. In the later years at Apple, Jony Ive played a great role in designing the products such as the iPod.There are more unnamed ones but in all Apple, as it is now, is not just because of Steve jobs, but the focussed collaboration of a some of the brilliant minds of the planet.

            "answer_text": "Who's to say there was a genius behind Steve Jobs? In reality, Steve Jobs was the man behind a lot of geniuses.  Steve Jobs a very smart man but his skills were managing people and getting them to do what he wanted. He was a master manipulator. He drove people to succeed. He took ideas, transformed them into marketable products, and assembled the right people to create them. That was his skill and without that, most of the products that Apple created wouldn't have been possible. He was absolutely vital to the creation of the products that Apple put out, simply because no one else could have assembled and driven the people who created them to do so. Steve Jobs is the Nick Fury of Apple. ",
