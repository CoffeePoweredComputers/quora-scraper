            "answer_text": "An SSD is flash memory where as HDD works with a spinning read. This makes SSD multi fold faster than a conventional hard disk drive. The read and write operations performed by a solid state drive are quicker than those performed by a hard disk drive. You can compare the operating speed of HDD and SSD with a disk speed test that can be performed using a disk check utility like Crystal Disk Info and HDD Scan. You will get to know their speed in write and read operations for all kinds of disk accesses. ",

            "answer_text": "Like a memory stick, there are no moving parts to an SSD. Rather, information is stored in microchips. Conversely, a hard disk drive uses a mechanical arm with a read/write head to move around and read information from the right location on a storage platter. This difference is what makesSSD so much faster. ",
