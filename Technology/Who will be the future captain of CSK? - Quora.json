            "answer_text": "In my opinion it should be Faf du plessis to captain CSK after MSD. But by seeing his age I don't think he is gonna captain CSK. So another name which comes in mind is of Suresh Raina. Raina can captain CSK , but his age is also a factor. And I don't think that Bravo will gonna be captaining CSK as same problem of age. So above all du plessis is my choice. But CSK can buy some young and potentially good captain after MSD's retirement in next auctions. Let's see who it will be. Have a nice day. Thank you. ",
