            "answer_text": "Micromax ,every time i hear about there new phone, its very bad specification at very bad price. If they launch a phone at budget range, there they have huge competition and other company are offering better specification at same price. The problem lies with micromax is that dont have ability to see the competition and better phone with great apecification. Everytime i had to cover a device for micromax in my weekend tech news Weekend Tech News Review #24 - Whatsapp Update, ASUS Zenfone 6, Oneplus 7 & More i had to say better other phones are available in same price range. So to sum up all the things, micromax is doing wrong in understanding the requirement of the indian consumer. ",
