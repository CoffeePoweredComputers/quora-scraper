            "answer_text": "In February 2016, Google briefly overtook Apple to become the most valuable company in the world \u2013 worth more than $500bn (\u00a3350bn). In 2015 alone, Google had revenues of $75bn (\u00a353bn). That\u2019s about \u00a31,675 a second. Yet its core service \u2013 search \u2013 costs nothing to use. So how does it make all its money? In numbers: Google in 2015  Source: Google 2015 annual report (submitted to US Securities and Exchange Commission) A way with words  Google makes most of its money from selling advertising opportunities on the search pages so many of us use. Advertisers bid to have ads for their products or services displayed on relevant search query result pages. A combination of the amount bid and the quality of a potential ad influences if an advertisement will feature at the top of the page, where more users are likely to see it. In order to encourage efficient bidding practices, Google uses a Vickrey auction system. Bidders don't know their rivals' bids. When all bids are in, the highest bidder wins but actually pays the price of the second highest bidder. But that's not the end of it. Google also takes into consideration the relevance of the advertiser's landing page to the search query. For example, if an advertiser has a page which is all about car insurance, it would have to bid less to appear high up in the paid advertising results for a user googling \"car insurance\" than an advertiser who has a page on general insurance. Google calls this 'Quality Score'. Charging for every click The attraction of the service to advertisers is they can target advertising at Google users who have already expressed an interest in what the advertiser sells and ignore Google users who have not. This is known as contextual advertising. Furthermore, advertisers only have to pay Google after someone has actually clicked on one of the ads they bid to have displayed \u2013 and they can set budgets to limit their monthly spend. Released in 2000, Adwords remains the primary source of Google's revenue. But Google also makes money from advertising when you're not on one of its sites at all. Its Adsense network places adverts on partner sites \u2013 from blogs to major content publishers \u2013 with the search giant taking a share of the revenue. INTERACTIVE: Searching for profits Since its launch in 1998, Google has grown enormously in terms of both its revenue and its expanding portfolio of products. Hold and drag the icon to see how this growth has unfolded. ",

            "answer_text": "Google and Facebook make billions from targeted ads. There are two commons types of advertisements: Pay-Per-Impression (PPI) ads charge advertisers based on how many views the ads generate, usually in increments of 1,000 views or \"impressions.\"Pay-Per-Click (PPC) ads charge advertisers each time a user clicks on the ad. Advertisers specify a \"bid,\" which is how much they are willing to pay per click or view, and engage in an instant \"auction\" to try to have their own ads appear on a website or app. The bid amount and the ad's relevance are among a number of criteria used in selecting which ad to show to a consumer.Google and Facebook have made so much money from advertising mainly because of their \"ad targeting\" strategy. People spend a lot of time on their apps and services, so Google and Facebook use what they know about the interests of their users to target ads to them. When they do this, Google and Facebook don't actually sell user data to advertisers. Instead, advertisers submit ads to Google and Facebook, who then decide where to post the ads and who to promote them to (based on their knowledge of their users). There are only a few businesses in the world that have the ability to do this because they need to have enough user data to target ads effectively. Just Google and Facebook together account for roughly half of the entire mobile ad market. Google's average advertising revenue per user (ARPU) was $12.76 in 2016, compared to Facebook\u2019s $19.28 - so it seems like Facebook has now surpassed Google in making more money (on average) per user. Google\u2019s 2017 revenue was ~$110 Billion, so Google makes ~$300 Million per day. ",
