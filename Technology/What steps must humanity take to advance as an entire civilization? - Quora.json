            "answer_text": "Everyone who contemplates humanity always seems to try to seek out the hopeful advancement and continuation of human civilization and society into the future. How will we be able to colonize space when Earth begins dying off? Can we reach other worlds? Can we live on Mars? How can we feed billions more? \u201cWhat can we do to control global warming\u201d, etc. etc. etc. This question is in that exact vein. In my scientific and personal opinion, humanity is an absolute terror, blight and plague on the biosphere of Earth and always has been. Long ago, we became the agent of destruction for what might be the only planet in the universe with life, or at least in the Milky Way. We are rendering most advanced life on Earth extinct at an unstoppable rate. So, your question about human \u201cachievement\u201d is perhaps, misstated. Considering 8,000 years of human history, there has never been a single culture anyone can find that actually treated each other, and nature, with respect, decency and morality in a sustained fashion. Instead, ruthless, vicious rulers, dictators, kings, queens, emperors, chieftains, military generals and even insane billionaires, were soon given the authority to command local and global warfare, environmental destruction, animal exploitation and extinction, sports hunting, cruelty, slavery, bondage, forced servitude, mass murder, gladiator games of death, horrendous religious inquisitions, human sacrifices to made-up gods, genocide, violent raids and pogroms, deep bigotry, lynchings, burning at the stake, gassing of millions in gas chambers, denial of science, disgusting corruption, conspiracy theories, racial supremacy, mass shootings \u2026 all have not only existed in EVERY period of history since we came out of the trees, but have prevailed. To the best of my knowledge, EVERY major society became immoral and destructive over time \u2026 every one. Consider the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, German, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, British, Spanish, Italian, Inca, Aztec, French, Dutch, Vikings, Americans \u2026 even Apache and Sioux. Sure, there are short periods of a decade or so when some decent human being was given authority, but overall, evil in human society has clearly triumphed over good. It is apparently a genetic trait of human evolution, and human behavior to be ruthless, foolish and self-serving.  I know it is painful to acknowledge, but no matter what time frame you wish to consider, 100% of history proves that the frontier of human achievement will be bleak, and nothing we may wish to do to improve the future of civilization under human control, will ever change our abysmal treatment of our beautiful planet. The best we and the biosphere of Earth can hope for is an invasion from an Alien race or some God somewhere, that either forces humanity to behave, or wipes us out. ",

Democracy: As a system of government it allows talent to get to the top. Law: Applied equally towards all creates social fairness. Courts: Allows laws to be enforced so businesses can know risks to opporate. Liberty: A constitutional bill of rights because legislators are arbitrary. Enterprise: Level playing field. This is not unregulated capitalism. FDR regulated capitalism is now called social democracy as done in Europe also called democratic socialism. Education, healthcare, medicine, healthy food, pure water, equal protection under the law are all human rights and must be made available as needed. Government as community in place to serve the people and provide for as back stop. A job proving purpose when private sector fails. A living income for everyone regardless. You do not have to watch people. The social herd dynamic makes them want to outperform everyone else. Given a chance they will kill themselves to show everyone that they are better than everyone else. It is our basic instinct. There are those that are bad actors, but they are few and we do not need to become a police state in order to watch over them. In a police state the only ones willing to watch over everyone are the very ones needing to be watched, which is why police states fail. The reason civilizations work is because you can trust most.

            "answer_text": "True democracy. the United States was on that path under the Constitution, but it took a wrong turn during the Lincoln Administration when the government seized final authority over all of the States\u2026 rather than the voters of the state itself. This corrupted true democracy into totalitarian democracy, and that became the model for democracy all over the world. Since then, people only have the illusion of consent to government, while decisions are actually made by lobbyists who purchase elections by hand-picking puppet candidates according to anticipated kickbacks. For Humanity to advance, but people must be their own rulers if freedom is ever to exist. And that and that has never happened; prior to the Lincoln Administration, only a minority could vote; and afterward, it didn't matter. ",

And finally confirm something we have all known in our guts all along, that we are all eternal beings with eternal souls and always have been. The ultimate result of the scientific detection of souls (and reincarnation) will be the absolute, utter, permanent, irrevocable destruction of all evil on Earth. Think that would advance world civilization? I wrote a story about this once. All the reasoning is in there. Here. Watch the destruction of all evil on Earth begin. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do.

Civilization made its first big leaps when the rule of law became accepted in the larger nations, because people had less fear of random violence killing large numbers of them, or institutions like the Church killing people for their beliefs. Generally, I think advances happen when fears are reduced. ",
