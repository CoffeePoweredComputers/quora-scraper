            "answer_text": "The other answers are good but most renewable energy has severe limitations to its effective use. Solar and wind are intermittent and have a relatively low energy density (power per weight) meaning it takes a large production facility to meet high demand users or grid level ratings. You\u2019ll never see a passenger airline or a supertanker ship powered by solar. Hydro and geothermal are available in about 1% of the earth\u2019s land area. Hydro dams in the US have been max\u2019d out with over 80,000 dams. Bio is borderline efficient because of the protracted processing, supply chain and facility size. It should be remembered that technically, none of these are actually fuels. They are sources of energy that allow us to create electricity that is then used as fuel. That means that the end-user has to be able to store and use the electricity, not the solar, wind, hydro or geo-energy source. This means that all of these \u201crenewable energy resources\u201d have limited applications - for instance, in cars, aircraft, and ships, they do not provide \u201cfuel\u201d but rather temporary energy (electrical) storage capability. So the utility of the vehicle is not dependent on the solar, wind, hydro, etc. but on the battery storage capacity. For now, that does not have the energy density sufficient to power aircraft or ships and has not been well developed for cars. There are also significant problems in collecting and storing sufficient electrical energy to meet grid-level demands when there is no solar or wind. A calm night in New York City will still need millions of kilowatts of power and we now do not have or know how to collect and store all of that power at those levels using wind or solar. Development of a true grid-level storage capability and an all-new smart distribution network would solve most of these problems but those are decades and hundreds of billions of $$ away. Nuclear is generally considered renewable but people have an irrational fear of it which is unfortunate and does not agree with experience (it is historically actually safer than hydro-electric due to the numerous deaths from failed dams - according to the UN). There is one other \u201cfuel\u201d that is renewable, has a relatively high energy density (but less than hydrocarbons) and can be used to power clean grid-level power plants, cars, and ships and perhaps aircraft. It is hydrogen. Modern design (4th Gen) nuclear power plants - like the Pebble Bed Reactor or Molten Salt Thorium Reactor - can \u201ccrack\u201d water into O2 and H at a cost-benefit ratio that makes it worth it. This is possible only because the nuclear reactor is able to produce the high temps, very efficiently for a long time (up to 40 yrs) on a relatively small load of nuclear fuel (thorium). <<\u201dcracking water\u201d means heating it up until it splits up the H2O into H and O>> Once cracked, the same nuclear power plant can power the compression and liquidfication of the Hydrogen for condensed liquid transportation thru distribution pipes (like that used by the nationwide grid of natural gas pipelines) and into tanks for cars, power generation plants, homes and businesses. Hydrogen is also the essential fuel for powering the highly efficient \u201cfuel cells\u201d that can be sized to meet car and home demand levels. When hydrogen burns, its exhaust is water so it is the perfect renewable fuel and we will never run out of the water needed to make it. The production of H can be initially done by remotely locating nuclear power plants offshore or in the far north of Canada where they can access ocean water, be well away from homes and cities. This is to appease those that fear the nuclear power concept. After a few decades of use when the 4th and 5th Gen nuclear power plants prove that they really are \u201cwalk-away-safe\u201d, then more reactors can be built closer to users. The liquid H can be distributed through an existing nationwide network of underground natural pipelines and then trucked as a liquid to users and distribution points. Leaks present very little danger since it would simply disperse in the atmosphere and eventually recombine with O2 to make more water. It is not a greenhouse gas and it is not an environmental pollutant. Excluding future safe nuclear fusion reactors, Hydrogen is the only truly renewable fuel that we are currently aware of that will meet most of our fuel demands while eliminating most of the problems of hydrocarbon fuels and pre-1950 designed nuclear power plants (all of them now operating). Hydrogen can easily be retrofitted into existing gasoline cars and can be used for fuel cells and for heating and power production but It would take major reengineering to use hydrogen in aircraft, heavy trucks or ships as the primary fuel.

            "answer_text": "Solar, because all of the focus seems to be on payback periods instead of solar efficiency. It makes me wonder whether solar power is marketed by morons or if it\u2019s just a suppressed technology. If you had a solar panel that was 60% efficient you could power vehicles without need for plugging it in. However, the solar market is capped by the notion that a cell has to pay for itself. Why not offset the cost for R&D by producing/using/selling state of the art quality panels now, for smaller electronics? The market seems obvious, panels for phones and laptops, moving up to cars and houses after a while\u2026 even if it costs a little more, people would buy it now. Instead, what is being sold is just large panels for houses, which cost 10\u201330 years worth of electricity. Well, guess what? Your phone probably only uses about 25\u00a2 worth of electricity per year. Still, I\u2019d totally be willing to pay $25 (100 years worth of electricity) to never need to plug my phone in again. Maybe 40\u00a2 per year for a laptop... sounds do-able. The average driver probably spends $1500\u2013 $2000 per year in gasoline. 20% efficient solar cells simply won\u2019t work here\u2026 too bulky. You need at least 40% efficient\u2026 but 60% efficient cells have been made! How much would you be willing to pay for a vehicle that never required refueling? Well, yeah that sounds steep. What about a car where you could cut the refueling/recharging intervals in half? Interesting? What about just saving 33% of your fuel? How much would that panel cost? Toyota\u2019s version: Are Solar Vehicles Becoming Viable? But, why the push for houses and 100% solar cars first? That\u2019s what makes solar really interesting, to me. It has such a major, untapped potential\u2026 just languishing, clearly. ",
