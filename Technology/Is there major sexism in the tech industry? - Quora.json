            "answer_text": "Not in my experience. Of course, wherever you go in the tech industry there is usually a lot more males than females, and that does tend to characterize the social atmosphere. But the beauty of working in technical fields is that your competence will usually speak for itself. If you are technically skilled, you will be respected. A problem is that companies tend to hire as many females as they can to try to even out the gender distribution, so some women may get into positions they're under-qualified for, which makes it harder to get respected and acknowledged. In general, I'd say the industry isn't sexist at all. There may be cases of bad cultures in individual companies, but then you don't want to be working there anyway. ",
