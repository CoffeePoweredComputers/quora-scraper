            "answer_text": "The charge is conducted to the aft outboard edges of wingtips and flight controls, where small devices called static wicks drain the charge back into the air. Some static wicks look like short little strings hanging off the airplane, others are more rigid. Typically there are 2 or more wicks at each location.  ",

Both of which conduct the electricity or lightning back to earth, by only conducting on its surface. Much like faraday\u2019s suit or a hollow conductor. Read more on google.. ",
