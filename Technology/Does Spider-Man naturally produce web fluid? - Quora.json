            "answer_text": "In the past, Spider-Man has produced his own organic webbing. There have been a few times when Peter Parker has temporarily mutated into a giant spider and then he tends to hatch out as a human with spider-man powers again. One of these times, he retained an ability to produce organic webbing from I guess you\u2019d call then projectile muscles and glands in his wrists. This was probably a response to the organic webbing that the Tobey Maguire portrayed Spider-Man in the first Sony trilogy had. The producers of that movie believe it was too contrived for Peter Parker to produce mechanical web shooters and chemical webs. I believe one of Peter\u2019s clones, named Kaine who is one of the two present Scarlett Spiders still has organic webbing he generates from his wrists but at some point when I was not reading Amazing Spider-Man for a few years, Peter lost that ability. Kaine is not the science wizard that Peter or the other clone Ben Reilly is but Kaine has no apparent way for Peter to keep replenishing webbing. Kaine must be able to produce them himself. A few years ago, it was revealed that the radioactive spider that gave Peter his powers also bit and gave powers to a woman (teenage girl at the time) named Cindy Moon, aka Silk. Cindy retains this ability in a much more adaptive expression of being able to generate webbing from many fingertips and to be able to weave that webbing as if her fingers were spinnerets. In an early Cindy Moon guest appearance in Amazing Spider-Man, Peter gives dietary suggestions on consuming starches to replenish her bodies ability to produce webbing. This explains to me that he remembers that he was once able to produce them organically. If some reader knows what he stopped, please reply in a comment. ",
