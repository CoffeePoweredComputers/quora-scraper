            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been selling online for over 10 years and learned that the easiest products to sell are not the products that most people want (they are actually hard to sell since the competition is fierce) but rather the things you can make the most profit on. Here\u2019s what I would suggest selling: Price range between $100\u2013300 - the reason is your profit margin. On a $10 product, your margin will be $2 while on a $200 product you will earn around $20\u201340. This way you won\u2019t need to sell thousands of items just to make the minimum profit to get by. Don\u2019t sell low-cost items for $10 since their margin will be too low.lightweight - Shipping cost can become a huge factor for large and heavy products, especially if you offer fast shipping options. An express courier will charge $70\u2013100 for a 10kg package to be delivered from China to the United States. When a buyer sees a product for $150, paying an extra $70 on shipping is a conversion killer.Niche category - don\u2019t try to sell what everyone is selling because you\u2019ll end up with extremely low profit margins. You can find plenty of products to sell in niche categories which will be more profitable and less competitive.Simple to use - this is very important in terms of returns. When a customer receives a new product and is not able to understand how to use it then he is more likely to return it and you will have to pay for return shipping cost. These costs can pile up and lower your bottom line profit significantly.PS if you find my answer useful, please Upvote :) ",

            "answer_text": "The question is quite broad, so I will do my best to answer! As with all products, I would recommend Unique Selling Points (USPs) are identified in any business. What distinguishes your product from competitors? Once you have answered this question, it\u2019s time to venture online! When trading online, I would always look to sell products with low transport products. The ultimate examples of this are online products (e.g. software downloads), which require no mailing. Dropshipping is also a good idea, this is where you take the order, but never hold the stock and a third party distributes it for you. Easy products to sell are ones where the consumer feels they are good value for money. I once knew a Salesman who had an adage \u201cthe secret of selling is the buying\u201d. So, always remember the lower the price you pay, the lower the selling price can be! This is why importing from China and similar countries is often popular. As in all sales try to sell products where the market isn\u2019t crowded, and demand exceeds supply. This can often be emerging markets. Do your research and you may be able to find a new untapped market with easy products to sell! Community websites are another favourite of mine. Look for places where there are a community of like-minded buyers and sellers. These will suit certain niches, such as Mumsnet (parenting), Bazar (environmentally friendly products) and Model Mayhem (Models and Photographers). ",
