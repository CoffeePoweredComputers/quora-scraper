            "answer_text": "Life was a lot more work! Image from the internet  This is the sort of washing machine my mother had. It was the sort of washing machine that was common In my mother\u2019s case, She had to haul water, heat it on the wood stove in which she had built a fire, wash the clothes, ring them out (that\u2019s what the lady is doing in the photo), and then hang them out on the line to dry. And a lot of work was like that - labor intensive, involving a lot of movement. My mother still has her glass scrub board. And she used that a lot to clean our soiled clothing There were no microwaves. If you wanted to heat something up, you put it in a pot on the stove, or in the oven. Most tasks took a lot of time. Clean up was washing dishes and pots, not using dish washers. Most convenience foods that are common today either weren\u2019t common, or were frowned upon. Minute rice? who would use that! Potato flakes? you peel potatoes, boil and mash them if you want mashed potatoes. Cakes were often beaten by hand. Most things were much heavier. Clothing was incredibly heavy. Coats were made of felted wool. The only wrinkle free fabrics were wool blends. Irons weighed a ton, and were needed because otherwise your clothing looked like you slept in it. Vacuums were bulky and pulled around. Rain coats weren\u2019t gortex, they were waxed or treated fabrics. Quilts weren\u2019t fiber fill, they were wool or cotton batting. Blankets were heavy cotton, and not lightweight polar fleece. Footwear was leather, and generally heavily soled. Many women walked. Most families only had one car. That car was often used by the father to go to work. Those at home used other transport of walking, biking or public transport. There was a \u2018Victorian\u2019 attitude about cleaning, that things had to be scrubbed and disinfected. Now, cleaning seems to be more about spaces looking clean, not necessarily being clean. A good many women smoked. Doctors would subscribe bennies - amphetamines, the side affects unknown. They were thought to be safe ",

            "answer_text": "In the 1950's, doctors wouldn't hesitate at all to prescribe amphetamines to a woman who expressed a worry about weight gain. And there were Cigarettes, dahling, cigarettes! And plenty of booze instead of eating substantially. They consumed far less refined sugar then than we do now. But really, in the 50's, females were raised to believe that one of their chiefest duties was to be visually pleasing to menfolk. So I think girls received a much stricter \"head trip\" about remaining slim than young women of today do. Also, in the era before personal computers and cable TV, Americans of all kinds were less sedentary than they are today. ",
