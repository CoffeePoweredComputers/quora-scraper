            "answer_text": "Steel. Without steel nothing can be made. All manufacturing relies on steel. Other metals are important but being able to produce steel has made everything we know possible. No chemical plants, no transportation, no plastic production, no farms, no ships, no guns, no knives, and no nails or fasteners. Houses could not be built so grandiose, we would be living in little sod and rock houses with thatched roofs. Try to not touch anything that does not require steel for it\u2019s existence. Without steel the population of the earth would be a small fraction of what it is. Famine would kill off the masses on a regular basis like it did 3000\u20134000 years ago in Egypt. World wide famine was cyclical until steel was produced. Wars could not have been scaled up from sharp sticks and clubs to the high tech GPS guided un-maned mega bombs of today. If you had asked my great grandmaw, \u201cWhat was the most important invention?\u201d, she would have answered, \u201cThe washing machine\u201d (of course\u2026 made of steel).  ",

In my opinion it is the production, storage, and distribution of electricity. Of which our societies depend. And which without, would severely hamper our efforts to find and distribute a vaccine.Not to mention it would affect our communications, entertainment and business. We are so dependent on electricity that economies would crash. You think hoarding is a problem now with the coronavirus? Imagine what would happen if suddenly everything went dark. People would hoard worse than toilet paper and hand sanitizer. ",
