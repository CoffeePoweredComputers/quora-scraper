            "answer_text": "Because there was a war. The DVD specification includes audio DVDs and they are a thing. Unfortunately at the time the audio DVD was launched, Sony as they always do launched their own proprietary format (SA-CD) instead, and having a big market share for DVD players and controlling a lot of the content they chose not to support playing audio DVDs on their players to boost the proprietary SA-CD format. As is usually the case when a war breaks out - no one wins. There was no cost aspect to this - DVD players cost no more to manufacture than CD players, and DVD discs cost no more to manufacture than CDs. It is possible to have a DVD on one side of the disc and a CD on the other side, it is called a Duodisc and I have one of these. They did not catch on because Sony had destroyed the market for audio DVDs There might have been an outcry that we are stuck with the poor audio quality of CDs with their mere 16-bit audio, but in practice subjective testing demonstrates that no one can hear any better than the 16-bit resolution a CD provides. Time has moved on and physical media is not quite as popular as it once was, and compressed audio download offers a wide range of audio qualities and formats that do everything that you could do with DVD audio. This has left CDs as the defacto standard for the dwindling minority who still like to have their physical media because an audio CD can be played in any CD or DVD player - even a Sony one! If you are keen you can still master your own audio DVDs and play them on a suitable player from downloaded content\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Why are CDs still used for audio instead of DVDs? Why people do things is a mystery\u2026 In general, I would suggest that the number of existing CD players, especially in vehicles, but also in room-based facilities is driving people to keep purchasing them. In addition, there is very little supply of being able to get audio on DVDs. A DVDs has much more capacity than can easily be filled. On a single 700 MB CD, I can put 90\u2013120 mp3 songs. This is a nightmare if you want to charge $1\u20131.25 per song. No one is going to pay $100+ for a single disc of material. Now consider a 8.6GB (8,800 MB) DVD, that would be, roughly, 1,200 songs. Yeah. ",

            "answer_text": "Two different formats attempted to use a DVD disc as the physical medium for a replacement for the venerable Audio CD format - both substituting much higher resolution audio, supporting multiple channels, and adding sophisticated copy protection. They even technically still exist - DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD. Unfortunately (or fortunately, dependent on one's viewpoint) neither really caught on with the public, relegating both to niche status. In short, the quality gains weren't significant without massive hardware investments (if at all), they required new (and far more expensive) player hardware, and the CD ripping craze would have been made all but impossible if either format had taken over. And since then, the iPod, music downloads and streaming services have made such a format even more irrelevant to 95%+ of consumers. ",

They even tried it again with Blu-ray, and there are Blu-ray audio discs with amazing sound. For whatever reason, these just didn\u2019t sell well enough. I do find it odd that I can get my movies in lossless 7.1 studio master surround, but for music, I\u2019m usually stuck with 2-channel stereo and CD quality that\u2019s been around since the late 70\u2019s. Even if it is better than CD quality, it often isn\u2019t by much - people don\u2019t want music that\u2019s streamed or stored on their hard drive taking up a ton of space. A DVD can use up to 9GB, and a Blu-ray up to 50GB, for many channels and very high quality. I do wish I could get my music in the same quality I hear it during scenes in movies. ",
