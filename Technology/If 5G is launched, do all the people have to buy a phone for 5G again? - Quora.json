            "answer_text": "No not really. Everything will work just as it is right now. I can't see any type of application on a smart phone that need what 5G will offer. 5G is a way to improve machines to machine's communication by reducing the delay by magnitudes, and that is great. 5G could also provide better connectivity when internet over air is used instead of fiber on large populations but that is not proper internet access it is just a poor man's substitute compared to a fiber connection. So as far as I can see it. No reason to run to purchase a new 5G phone. Remember how power hungry phones was for the first three generations of 4G phones. I do expect that to be the case for 5G handheld devices also. But a change that I would like to see is the removal of 3G networks all together now when 4G networks actually exist. 2G for talking and 4G for data. 3G network is not good for either\u2026 2G have the range and 4G have the bandwidth. The rollout for 5G will take some time so jump the first two generations of smartphones is most likely a smart idea. But for bragging right's. Go get them as soon as possible\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "This is a service provider dependent condition, in addition to the age and version of the firmware chips, processor & supported OS on the user\u2019s device. The much bigger threshold is 5G vs 5G NR. And it isn\u2019t solely about handsets & wireless base stations. Other media and messaging types are idealized as a universal platform- like a utility or plug in the wall that connects universally regardless of access type. (e.g. fiber optic, {dedicated} line-of-sight radio/laser, satellite link(s), coax, Cat 6+\u2026) For hand sets, Qualcomm QTM052 chip supports 3 mmWave bands of 25GHz band. Other Service Providers will be alloying LTE concurrently to address voids in coverage during deployment. There is also the Qualcomm QTM525 mmWave band support for 26, 28, and 29 GHz. I still believe the use of the term 5G should be heavily caveat-ed. 5G is prescriptive, not descriptive, fine for use by marketing. Caveat Emptor. 3GPP has more influence over standards and outcome expectations than individual service providers, manufacture product marketing materials, or news media recitations of corporate announcements.
