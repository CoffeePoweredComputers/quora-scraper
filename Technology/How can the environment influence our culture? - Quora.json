            "answer_text": "The environment influences people in so many ways, it would be impossible to list all of them. However I will try to give some examples, I\u2019m talking from the top of my head here so feel free to expand or correct me. For starters\u2026 what would people be without the environment? Non existent. Everything we have in our lives is because of our surroundings. In the modern age being able to travel to different places and international trade definitely expand our scope, but still there are plenty of things you could only see or get at particular places. When we talk about culture and groups of people we have to talk about food. Regardless of where you are on the globe people have a certain relationship with food and hold it at great value. The environment in which the people are dictates the types of food they have access too. That\u2019s why island nations (or coastal regions) focus on fish in their cuisine - Japan is a prime example of food becoming a national staple; countries with warmer climates have fresh fruits and vegetables in their diet while people in colder climates historically rely on fatty meats, fish and root vegetables like potatoes. The environment determines what kind of clothes we need or don\u2019t need depending on the seasons and temperatures, and also back in the day in the day it determined the animals from which we could acquire fur for clothes (also primary meat people might eat as well as predators to be aware of). On the topic of clothes and art forms, the environment to some extent determines the predominant colors people use as they tend to mimic what they see around them. Here is a stereotypical example of the brightly colored Hawaiian shirts on the islands full of flowers compared to the muted grayish-blue/brown coats you would encounter in gloomy London (of course those things apply less nowadays that\u2019s why I\u2019m using stereotypes). The environment shapes architecture - from the materials people use to build (wood, stone, brick etc), to the locations they chose - settlements are usually built close to a water source (river, lake, sea) or close to some other type of valuable resource - forest, gold, marble etc. It also can dictate the style of the buildings - in a desert you want something made of a light stone to reflect sunlight, that is open an airy so you don\u2019t melt to death in it. Needless to say when you look at North Africa, the Middle East, desert US states those elements are visible in the buildings. Lack of space is also a factor - if you take Hong Kong for example, buildings there are very narrow but extremely tall, it\u2019s because there\u2019s not a lot of land to go around so they\u2019ve opted for stacking. Same to an extent in Japan with rice terraces being and example of agricultural stacking. Also high ground is a military advantage (maybe not so much today with satellites, camouflage is a better option) and at least in the past military compounds, castles and fortresses were built on hills, cliffs and mountains (as an example take Scottish castles - Edinburgh, Stirling, Dunnottar). Our surroundings and what we are used to influence our mindset - in a military point of view overestimating his troops in winter conditions cost Hitler the invasion of the Soviet Union. Germans suffered great losses in the cold, while the Soviets thrived in it, which is understandable as they have very severe winters. The same with the British freaking out over the tiny bit of snow while Canadians live literally buried in it and it\u2019s not big deal. In Nordic countries for example, the lack of sunlight in the winter months triggers depressions and lethargy, seasonal affective disorder they call it and the more north you live, the more prone you are to it. At the same time, being in a warm climate closer to the equator affects daily life in a different way - people spend more time outdoors because the weather is more often nice, they have outdoor restaurants, cinemas, markets, they would stay out later, they would walk outside more, kids would have more places for outdoor activities and so on. The last thing I am going to mention is the symbols and items of value that develop for a country, culture or otherwise group of people. People take inspiration from nature and more often than not the things that they value and take pride in are connected to the environment. Be it valuing water in a place where it\u2019s scarce, or forests, mountains is usually a big one, a natural feature that is awe-inspiring and you look up to. For Ancient Greece it was mount Olympus where they thought the gods lived, for Japan it\u2019s mount Fuji, for the US Niagara falls. Maybe it\u2019s an animal that has cultural/religious significance with it\u2019s strength, beauty or contribution to people\u2019s lives - it could be an eagle, a lion, kangaroo, a panda or an elephant. Maybe it\u2019s a flower - roses seem to be a popular option, lilies, lotus flowers, tulips. In any case the symbols of national/cultural identity and pride come from nature. It\u2019s where those people, regardless of anything else, started from and grew with. That is why there is often statements made that the food at home (country, area whatever) is the best, there is no other place more beautiful than home and all that. Our environment is what makes us.

            "answer_text": "Until food began to be traded in large amount across huge distances, the plants that grew in the local environment and the animals that were reared had a bearing on the culture i.e. what foods were commonly eaten, how the foods were prepared, festivals that celebrated these crops and of course the other non-food applications of those crops. Because of climate, certain regions of the world or country were rice growing, while other regions were wheat growing. The cuisine of southern India is largely rice based, while the north is wheat based.   In the south, coconuts are readily available/grown. Therefore not surprisingly, in the south cooking uses coconut oil and coconut is an ingredient of many dishes. Other parts of the coconut plant are used to make materials.  In Africa the Maasai communities rely on cattle for their livelihood. They consume the meat of the slaughtered cattle, and they also drain blood from live cattle and mix this with milk to consume.
