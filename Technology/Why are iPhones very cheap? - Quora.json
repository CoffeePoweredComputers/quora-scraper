            "answer_text": "Apple will never bring out cheap iPhones. They have budget phones, around $500. They don\u2019t manufacture, but they design and get them manufactured. Apple will never bring out cheaper ones, as Apple stands for High Quality, Status, Unique, and so on. Phone market is highly saturated in the global market and very little incentive for them to drop the price. They depend on existing iPhone holders to replace them once in 2\u20133 years. 5G is on the roll out. They will be bringing a new 5G phones with very advanced features not available/possible in current series like Augmented Reality AR etc. They also have so many other projects going on related to their iOS but unrelated to phones etc. So Apple thrives on being expensive and not otherwise.

            "answer_text": "Thank You for the A2A. Apple will make different models of phones with more and less features. And so I\u2019m with less memory storage, and some with more storage options available. You will see some phones with OLED screens while you will see other screens with 4K LED screens, which in my opinion have better blues and better blacks just wait-and-see. Taken all together the reduction of some features translate into a lower overall cost to manufacture which gets passed along to the customer in the form of a lower entry price to an iPhone. This does not mean that the iPhone is going to get cheaper. On the whole the iPhone has documentation that confirms that it is the longest lasting handheld device from a cellular phone manufacturer in metrics of long Jevity and over all durability. You may have to replace the battery at some point in your use of the phone over the years, take my iPhone 6 Plus as an example the app battery light, shows a where indication of 31% and a suggestion to replace the battery as soon as possible. With Apple\u2018s iOS 11.3 I have a feature that tells me my battery health and it\u2019s charge capacity but this is in beta so I take that with a grain of salt I also have The app Lirium, that has a battery indicator as well and it shows me the same percentage of deterioration of my original battery. There is no phone on the market that will last forever, that is a given. But if you take care of your phone and you install stable updates and you leave enough storage open for fresh updates to be able to be installed, your phone should last you a good long while with The suggestion of putting it in a case, Keeping it charged up between 80 and 20%, and not dropping it it should last you a minimum of three and on the outside 5 to 6 years. Good luck. ",
