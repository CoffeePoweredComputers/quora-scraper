            "answer_text": "If a software driver for hardware is unavailable, it can\u2019t be fixed because it\u2019s not broken \u2026 because it does not even exist. Contact the maker of the printer for an updated driver or work-around.Check web chats for other people\u2019s solutions.Get a different printer.Revert back to Windows 7.Put a cheap used $50 computer, or one of your own old computers, by the printer to act as a print server ... though Windows 10 may still balk, so then print to PDF, then send the PDF to the print server computer ( or sneaker-net a USB thumb drive to the print server computer ).Print to a PDF file, copy the PDF file to thumb drive, then insert the thumb drive into the printer, and then manually have it print from local storage, if that feature is available on the printer.Print to a PDF file, then convert each PDF page to a JPG, then rename them all properly for your camera, then copy the files to your camera storage card and insert it in your camera, then connect your camera via USB cable directly to the printer DPOF port, and then select the DPOF Digital Print Order Format option on the camera to print the files directly to the printer.If the printer has a web print service, then print to it over the web even though you can see the printer right there in front of you.If the printer has a scanner, then lay your computer monitor on the scanner and print a copy of the document displayed on the computer screen that way.Why do people think a computer has to do all the work? - - - - - - - - - - In dialog with others in this thread: Other: Install a driver manually for a printer that the unsupported printer emulates. You can also get \u2018Global' drivers from the bigger manufacture that both support a wide range of printers and are compatible with terminal services/remote desktop. Sometimes extracting the drivers for the printer for a previous OS, you can manually install the driver from the folder. This doesn't always work. You may have to share the printer from a system running an OS for which there is a suitable driver. Have you waited the 45 minutes it takes Windows to download additional printer drivers? Me: Windows 10 will want a driver on board to print to a network printer, same problem.. Other: As another answer explained, sometimes only installing the core printer driver of an network shared printer will work. Whereas the full driver fails. Especially things like smart spoolers. And again emulation is your friend. Me: \u201c\u2026 core \u2026\u201d? Do you mean, for, say, an multi-function printer, installing just the printer? What is \u201c\u2026 core \u2026\u201d?. Other: What gets installed to the spool sub-directories. And then just the subset for turning WMF format to something the printer can render. Me: Prior posts: \u201c\u2026 installing the core printer driver of an network shared printer \u2026 What gets installed to the spool sub-directories. And then just the subset for turning WMF format to something the printer can render \u2026\u201dIll try again.Install the \u201ccore\u201d drive by doing what?Thanks.. Other: Hence me referring to an other answer by HRH George J Rickle IV Me: Ah, you see \u201c\u2026 Install the driver from Windows 7 or Windows 8. Use the absolute minimum driver possible, ignoring all the addons. Install the minimum necessary to print. If there is a \u201cnetwork print\u201d driver, THAT is the one, even if you don't use it on the network.Short of that, it probably works generically with a PCL or PostScript driver from Windows \u2026\u201d [ from HRH George J Rickle IV's answer to How do I fix a printer driver that is unavailable on Windows 10? ] as meaning \u201ccore\u201d. I was wondering if people were seeing \u201ccore\u201d as a choice within any Microsoft driver installation dialog and choices, especially because I could not find such an on-screen reference choice. So \u2026 no, the phrase \u201ccore printer driver\u201d will not appear on screen anywhere for users to select. Right? Other: Using Updated Core Print Drivers - Windows drivers Along with the manufacturer\u2019s inf files for the specific device. Me:  THANK YOU for the reference to Microsoft using the \u201ccore print drivers\u201d phrase: \u201c\u2026 UniDrv, PostScript, and XPSDrv are examples of core driver components that many manufacturer-supplied drivers rely on to help with printer control and configuration \u2026\u201d \u2026 even though it never shows up in any Windows printer dialogs ( below ) or even Windows help ( above ). PCL, PS, and XPs, no UniDrv \u2026 hmm.   \u2026 but no \u201ccore print drivers\u201d anywhere. By the way, did you know of the official Microsoft web reference page to \u201ccore print drivers\u201d before or after you used the phrase in https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-fix-a-printer-driver-that-is-unavailable-on-Windows-10/answer/Joseph-oLoughlin-1/comment/126568367? Just asking. Other: Given the problems, some printer drivers cause for Terminal Services, and Citrix, and having to remedy that, yes, I came across the term years ago while working for Microsoft Product Support Services, (external badge). Also why I explained the use of Global drivers. Other: Adding comments disabled. Me: \u201c\u2026 Global \u2026\u201d \u2026 oh, \u201c\u2026 Adding comments disabled \u2026\u201d, I guess I\u2019ll guess at what you mean, and look elsewhere. Thanks for exploring as much as you did. - - - - - - - - - - ",

            "answer_text": "Even owning my own computer business doesn't make me a computer know it all. Still, I normally repair more computers in a week than the average person will see in their lifetime. With that in mind I also run into more problems and fixes than most. But I too have a printer that works perfectly with Win 7, but not with 8, or 10. I worked on trying to resolve this issue for a couple weeks. No luck. And I also have Driver Booster Pro, which I paid for, and is a GREAT program, it was unable to provide a solution. (Note: I normally wouldn't comment on something like this, but I'm surprised Quora would allow a post encouraging someone to steal a program in order to solve a problem. Be acutely aware that many of these \u201ccrack\u201d sites promote viruses and malware. Not worth the risk in my opinion.) To your problem, mine, and others, not all problems can be fixed. What I did was connect a Win 7 machine to my older printer, never connected it to the Internet, and of course it works fine. Not considered a fix, but rather a work around. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. ",
