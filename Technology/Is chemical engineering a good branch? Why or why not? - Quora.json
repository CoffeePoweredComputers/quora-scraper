            "answer_text": "Since your question is open-ended, I want to answer it from a different angle: what is it like constantly defending yourself on ethical grounds as a chemical engineer?   I pose this question because I think it's something most chemical engineers think about.  If you work for a major manufacturer and live in a somewhat liberal city, you will receive lots of critique on your work choices. As a student, you don't really imagine how annoying it is to be at happy hour trying to enjoy a beer and meet new people. Then some know-it-all finds out you work for some major company  (e.g. ExxonMobil).  They then proceed with the normal line of questioning:  \"how does it feel to ruin the world?  How does it feel to work for some company that did xyz in 1980?\" (its like your boss is Ted Bundy).   Now, you could retort by explaining that you work with some of the sharpest minds in the world, or that their understanding of the industry is off, but you choose not to because you know (from trial and error) there is nothing changing their mind...   But on your original question: how good is chemical engineering?  Chemical engineers give the world what it wants in the most resource efficient way possible.  Therefore, I am of the opinion that we are very \"good\" to the world.  Cutting off chemical engineering would lead to significant changes in quality and efficiency - more waste, more pollution, crappier products. In the end, believing in your own actions is what matters.  And sometimes only chemical engineers are intellectually equipped to address some of the world's greatest challenges. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Is Chemical Engineering a good choice? You are probably asking this, because you have some interest in Chem. Eng, but are not sure whether to invest 4 years of your life into studying the subject? In that case, I will try my best to give an unbiased opinion about Chem Eng. from my experience of studying the subject. Pros: Chem Eng. is a genuinely interesting course to study: If you enjoyed studying Chemistry in 12th grade, then studying Chem Eng. will be an easy and painless task. A lot of the modules are chemistry (organic, physical) and applied chemistry, and there is seriously a lot of interesting material that is covered, specially in the latter years of the course.Decent opportunities in the Indian government sector: A B.Tech in Chem. Eng will open several doors for job opportunities in PSUs. Moreover, cracking GATE is relatively less competitive as compared to other mainstream branches, as there are only ~30,000 students attempting GATE for Chem. Eng every year. Hence, if you are one of those who prefers working in a PSU, getting jobs in firms like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL, BARC, RCF etc, are a major possibilityResearch Opportunities: If you are passionate about research, the possibilities in Chem. Eng are literally endless. You could get into NCL, BARC or some other research organization and start working there. You could obviously, go abroad, to the West and I\u2019d imagine that the opportunities for R&D there are too pretty vast.Higher Studies: Since Chem. Eng is fairly multi-disciplinary, you could get into a plethora of MS programs (Core ChE and BioTech/Mechanical programs). Several students chose to do MBA and switch into domains such as marketing/consulting/operations/finance, that too is a perfectly acceptable career path.Well compensated abroad: I am yet to verify this from alumni, but as per the internet, Chemical Engineers are very well paid overseas in countries such as the United States and Canada. The field of Petroleum Engineering too is considered to be lucrative.Cons: Difficult to branch out into Computing/IT services/CS: It is a well known fact that most of the high paying jobs after engineering are those that involve some degree of coding ability, and in this sense Chemical Eng. lags behind, because you learn almost nothing relevant to computers/coding which maybe useful for jobs in IT firms/Data Science firms etc.Outdated Syllabus: I found a lot of the syllabus to be outdated and not very relevant to tackling modern day Chemical Engineering problems, most of the coursework was rote learning and application of various formulas into various scenarios.Limited Applicability: You will learn a few things about Heat Transfer/Momentum Transfer/Reaction Engineering etc. but these subjects will not have a LOT to do with what actually goes on in the industry or what your job role in the industry will be like (or atleast that was my observation during internships).Plant Locations: Most of the chemical plants are located in obscure locations, if you are someone who enjoys the urban life and wishes to work in the chemical industry, then this maybe a disadvantage.Difficult to be an entrepreneur: Start-ups by Chem Eng graduates, are almost unheard of, because of the simple fact that it takes a HUGE amount of capital, effort and government intervention into opening a chemical facility/ plant/factory. (I have an industrialist relative who mentioned that he needed close to 55 licenses from the government, to open a small scale soap factory)Thanks for the A2A, and feel free to get in touch with me, in case of any queries/clarifications.
