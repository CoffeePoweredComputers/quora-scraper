            "answer_text": "Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computing system. This allows IT organizations to run more than one virtual system, and multiple operating systems and applications, on a single server. Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create useful IT services using resources traditionally tied to hardware. It allows you to use the full capacity of a physical machine by distributing its capacity among many users or environments. Virtualization diminishes the number of physical workers, decreasing the vitality needed to power and cool them. Gain time. With fewer servers, you can spend less time on manual tasks required for server maintenance. It is also much faster to deploy a virtual machine than it is to deploy a new physical server. The way toward isolating the product layer of a PC or worker from the equipment layer of a PC or worker. A new layer is placed between the two to act as an intermediary. ",

            "answer_text": "What is Virtualization? Virtualization is a combination of software and hardware engineering that creates Virtual Machines (VMs) - an abstraction of the computer hardware that allows a single machine to act as if it where many machines. Without VMs: A single OS owns all hardware resourcesWith VMs: Multiple OSes, each running its own virtual machine, share hardware resourcesVirtualization enables multiple operating systems to run on the same physical platform ",
