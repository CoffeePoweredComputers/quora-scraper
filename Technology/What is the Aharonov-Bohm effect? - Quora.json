            "answer_text": "It describes the experiments of splitting a beam of electrons and taking it round the sides and outside a long solenoid(normal to its length). The beams of electrons are made to meet and interfere after that within a crystal and a set of fringes are observed as normal. The fringes however experience a change to whether the solenoid was energized or not. This is considered a mystery as the magnetic field outside and around a solenoid is known to be zero- as all the field is confined to the inside even for an air-cored tightly wound solenoid. So what the electron is seeing on its travel outside the solenoid? Many attempts to explain the effect ended on taking the point that this is a quantum effect with no classical counterpart and can be explained by the vector potential from which the magnetic field is derived; B=curl(A). This is not straight forward explanation as the electrons have to be moved by a force and A is not a force, whereas B produces a force via; F=e v^B and if B is zero, then F is zero. Because QM uses A and not B in its calculations, this was taken to vindicate the methods of QM at the end. Is the above argument true. Apparently not since one can bring counter and well known and practical examples where the magnetic field is zero, yet we can still sense what is going on inside the solenoid. This is the toroid transformer. In this case you have a ring of strong magnetic steel that doesn\u2019t allow any B outside. Yet we put windings on the outside of it, then put-in and take-out electric power as in this illustration; What's this \"crossover\" toroid winding called and what is its purpose?  Another example is provided here; (Professor Eric Laithwaite: Magnetic River 1975) , where an aluminum ring is floating in the air(left picture) due to a magnetic field confined to the inside of the steel core of an electromagnet despite the zero field there.  So what is the story. Because B=curl(A) you need to circle A and the bar in order to get the effect. If the aluminum ring in the last picture is put outside the bar and near to it, it will not be affected at all. If you are to shrink the ring to a point, we see that B measures zero everywhere outside the bar. Despite of this a ring around the bar enclosing the A (or the magnetic flux inside) will be affected. If you are not familiar with this set up, the ring floats because of the induced eddy currents in it turning it into a current coil that interacts with the magnet. In the Aharanov-Bohm effect, the electron is moving so it is creating a current that interacts with the current magnetic flux like how the metal ring is doing, and a combination of this is what is being felt and causes a change in the fringes when the magnet is turned on or off. Laithwaite in the video shows this effect as he showed a rotating cylinder placed outside the metal ring, rotating right or left depending on its position with respect to the bar- as in the second and third pictures above, which akin to what the flying electron does. See this ref and quote; https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0305084.pdf \u2018\u2019 Thus, even if the magnetic field B is totally contained within the solenoid and the beams pass through a B = 0 region, a resulting phase shift appears, since a non null magnetic flux is associated to every closed path which encloses the solenoid. \u2018\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Aharanov and Bohm had showed that vector potentials can affect the quantum mechanical behavior of a charged particle, even when it moves through a region in which the field itself is zero. Aharanov and Bohm proposed an experiment in which a beam of electrons was split in two, and was passed either side of a long solenoid, before being recombined. The beams were kept well away from the solenoid so the magnetic field due to the solenoid was zero for the beams, however vector potential wasn\u2019t zero. The two beams arrived with different phases. Michael Berry pointed out in his first paper that this effect was actually an example of geometric phase. It\u2019s interesting to see that although the solution to the Hamiltonian acquires a form similar to a geometric phase( hence Berry\u2019s paper), it doesn\u2019t require the use of an adiabatic approximation.
