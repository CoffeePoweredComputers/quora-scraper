            "answer_text": "Data center space is sold through account executives, or salespeople. To procure space you should contact a number of companies and see which solution fits your particular needs.  Like Baybars mentioned, usually you will lease the space and then ship your own servers to that space. Different data center providers will help you to different extents. Some might set up everything for you and manage the deployment throughout its lifespan, others will just give you space, a shipping address, and access to the building. The key thing when looking at different data center solutions is research. You have to know what you want and where to get it. Luckily there is a lot of information available.  For example, I work for Equinix - the largest colocation data center provider, and we offer an entire Forum of relevant discussion: Explore IT Strategies, Services & Solutions  You can see Equinix-authored strategies as well as those authored by our customers.

            "answer_text": "Mostly, you only buy(rent) rackspace, power and internet connectivity. And you bring your own servers. Some data centers also do buy the servers for you, it depends on the size of the agreement, with enough money, you can make them do a lot of work for you. ",
