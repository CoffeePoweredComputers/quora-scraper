            "answer_text": "Hi , I'm a believer in online learning and has been following it for the last 4 years regularly , so I think I can give you some Tips to learn more effectively online and get the most out of it. I would like to convey my answer in an algorithmic way :-     If the aforementioned part seems strange, so here is the summary of what I wanted to convey you: 1. Always use a notepad to write down the points as it helps you to revise and use them for later references. Always try to make flowcharts or diagrammatic representation of the concept learned (it help you to remember it more easily). 2. While watching a lecture do consult other online/offline resources to clear your doubts on that very point or use the discussion forum ( if available ).  3. Be an active participant in the discussion forum as it help you to learn from your and other's mistakes. If you contribute on discussion forum, you will get a better understanding of the concept from the fellow learner's feedback on your contribution/ Answer . 4. Participate in the coding assignments and homeworks. 5. Whatever concept / algorithm you learn try to code it or make a module related to it. This will help you to explore that concept in more depth and also help you to improve your coding skills.   6. While watching a video tutorial , pause it in between whenever a sub-topic is completed by the teacher and then do step 1 and 2. So what I mean here is that don't watch and write simultaneously, rather first see and try to understand and then move to writing notes.  7. Do revise the concept after every  8 or 9  days till you don't build the confidence in that topic. Keep Learning and Exploring ! ",
