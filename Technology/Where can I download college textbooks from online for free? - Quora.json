            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure about downloading them, but I can tell you how we did it in medical school. Some of the texts were $700 and this was 25 years ago! There was no way I could afford them. I wasn\u2019t the only one. We had a group of 5 of us. We waited till Kinkos had a photocopying sale. It would get as low as half penny/page in Chicago sometimes. We\u2019d take 5 books to photocopy. Each of us took 5 binders for ourselves. Then we\u2019d each copy a book, in 5 copies. Darn copiers didn\u2019t collate back then LOL We\u2019d then sit there and make the piles and put a copy of each page on the 5 piles. It took a few hours of hard work, going as fast as we could turn pages. When we were done, we\u2019d have a book for maybe less than $20. Now I know there will be people screaming. I don\u2019t care. Those that had the money bought the books. If I HAD the money, I would have too. But I was crawling out of poverty and being thrifty was the only way. Not having the book meant certain failure. Of the 100 students on my class, we may have been the only five to do this. My anatomy partner was starving to death, literally, trying to make it through school. I was afraid he\u2019d die before we graduated and I wasn\u2019t doing much better. Used books weren\u2019t an option. Everyone kept them for boards and studying for residency interviews. ",

            "answer_text": "Publishers invest tens of thousands of dollars in getting a manuscript ready for publication. Their employees invest their time. The authors do, too. The only way for any of them to get their investment (time and/or money) back is to have control over the right to make copies. When you pirate a copy, you steal that control \u2014 and therefore their ability to make a living from the work that you obviously value. You can get free copies from most university libraries. You can buy a print copy with a friend and trade it back and forth. You can get a scholarship that covers books. You can rent a copy. There are many options for reducing your costs without destroying the foundation of the book business, and of the creative economy, in general. ",
