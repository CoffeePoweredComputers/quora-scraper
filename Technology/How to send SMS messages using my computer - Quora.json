            "answer_text": "Twilio has an easy way to send text messages from the command line of your computer.  The twilio-sms bash script will send an SMS to one or more phone numbers provided on the command line, using content read from STDIN. It can practically be used as a drop-in replacement for mail in some instances. The script can read configuration parameters, such as your Twilio AccountSid, AuthToken and CallerID from the command line, or more preferably from a config file. You can provide the path to a config file in the arguments, or the default ~/.twiliorc will be tried.  Additionally, you can provide one or more phone numbers in a single invocation of the script, and all the numbers will be texted.http://labs.twilio.com/bash/sms One note, if you are looking to make it look like these messages are coming from your cell phone number you will find that carriers cannot substitute one phone number for another (often referred to as \"spoofing caller ID\") because it violates MMA guidelines for SMS requiring that a recipient be able to unsubscribe to the original sending number. You can also send outbound SMS messages using the Twilio REST API:http://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/sms/sending-via-rest ",
