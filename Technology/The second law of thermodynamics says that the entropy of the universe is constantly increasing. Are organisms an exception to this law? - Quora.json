            "answer_text": "No, but you are misunderstanding how the law works. It's not that the entropy must increase in every tiny spot, but that the overall entropy must increase. For example, my freezer removes heat from cold food and dumps the heat into the warm surroundings. This is actually decreasing entropy, but it's fine because the power station is burning fuels that are high energy density and spreading out that energy, increasing entropy - by more than the freezer is decreasing it. While there is a local decrease in entropy, overall there is an increase, satisfying the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Organisms are no different. They may be an example of a local decrease in entropy, but the Sun is increasing entropy by more than enough to counter this local decrease. ",

            "answer_text": "The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of the universe is constantly increasing. Are organisms an exception to this law? No. The rest of that law describes the difference between a closed system and an open system, and, what happens when you add or subtract energy from a system, etc. So, the entropy of the universe as a whole, is observed to be increasing. The sun is adding energy to the earth, so, energy is being added, making earth an open, not a closed system, so, on earth (And other planets, etc) entropy is DECREASING\u2026as the law explains. If something dies and decays, after energy was added to it, this too, is part of the law. This is all part of the law, so, there is no conflict whatsoever, and, it is, in fact, further confirmation of it. :D ",
