            "answer_text": "An 800 mm fixed focal length or \u201cprime\u201d lens does not zoom at all. Zoom lenses can change focal length, and the zoom factor for a zoom lens is the ratio of its two extreme focal lengths. For example, the default \u201ckit\u201d lens on low-cost Canon DSLRs is an 18\u201355 mm zoom. The ratio 55/18 is basically 3, so this would be called at 3 X zoom lens. If you photograph an object with the lens set at 18 mm, and again with the lens at 55 mm, the image of the object will be 3 times larger in the second photo than in the first. A 100\u2013300 mm zoom also has a 3 X zoom range, but it covers a different range of magnification than the 18\u201355 mm lens. But any fixed focal length lens, whether it is 8 mm or 800 mm focal length, is not a zoom lens and has no zoom factor. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have stated an 800mm doesn\u2019t zoom, but I think you mean what magnification a 800mm has, similar to binoculars. With cameras we really don\u2019t use magnification, but angle of view which is 3 degrees 10min. Or you can use 50mm as normal and divide 50mm by 800mm and get about 16 power. Now this is just an approximation. Hope this helps. ",
