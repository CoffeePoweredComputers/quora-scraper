            "answer_text": "Text messaging on its own has not replaced letter writing, however the onset if digital communications systems has made it much easier to communicate the written word without the need for letter writing on paper. Email, SMS, IM and Social Media all play individual roles that would once have been performed by sending a letter. However there are still many reasons to send a traditional letter; legal documents and other purposes where a hard copy is necessary all make use of the postal service. I'm sure you can think of other examples. So whilst text messaging has played it's part in reducing the need for letter writing, it has by no means eliminated it. ",
