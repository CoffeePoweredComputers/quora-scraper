Open the Google docs document, place your cursor where you want the table, hit ctrl+v. You will be presented with the option to either link to the spreadsheet or paste unlinked. Choose to link. You will now have the table in the Google doc that will have an \u201cupdate\u201d button whenever the spreadsheet is changed. Note: changes to column width and row height do not appear to update correctly on the Google doc currently. If you change a column width or row height of your table, you will need to delete the table in the Google doc and follow the above steps again. Charts: Open the Google docs document, place your cursor where you want the chart, click \u201cinsert,\u201d then \u201cchart,\u201d then \u201cFrom Sheets.\u201d Select your spreadsheet, then select the chart in the spreadsheet.
