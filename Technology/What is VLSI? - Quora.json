            "answer_text": "Vlsi is an abbreviation for Very Large Scale Integration.Long answer :Meaning the integration of very small circuits on boards and dies the size of a coin(1 rupee). There can be millions and millions of transistors, capacitors and other electronic components, along with their related connections, routings and wiring. And there is undergoing research to further reduce the transistor sizes, currently being of the dimensions in the range of 10s of nanometers. And it's a highly competitive and exciting field, both for research as well as job opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "VLSI is very large scale integration. It is the technology by which integrated chips are fabricated.All the chips are fabricated from silica.Silica is abundant in the form of sand. For various data processing, processors with different functionalities are required. All the required functionalities are designed by engineered and are incorporated into chips. The whole process of manufacturing chips from sand with required functionalities can be termed as VLSI process technology.Millions of transistors are integrated into the sand wafer hence comes the name IC or Integrated chips.
