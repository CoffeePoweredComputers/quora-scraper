            "answer_text": "Because there\u2019s a hard limit on how much the tech can be improved without changing the design. The original USB 1 and USB 2 specs used a certain number of wires. That limited the amount of information to what could be sent over those wires. In order to increase the speed in USB 3, they had to add more wires to the cable - requiring different plugs. USB 3.0 - Wikipedia (connectors)   (You didn\u2019t see this one nearly as much.) USB 3.2 added two additional extra-fast speeds that required still more wires on the connector, meaning still another connector - USB-C - was needed. USB-C also added more abilities that required more wires and more intelligence in the cable. Video, power wattage enough to drive a laptop, bidirectional control, and more. ",

            "answer_text": "When we went from USB1 to usb2 we kept the same types and it lead to a lot of confusion as to which cable was a 1.0 cable and which is a 2.0 cable. You'd connect a 2.0 device with a 1.0 cable and then leave bad reviews on a product even though the poor performance wasn't the product, but your cable. At least, that's my guess as to one of the probably numerous reasons. ",
