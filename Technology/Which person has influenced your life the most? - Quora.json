            "answer_text": "My parents influenced my life the most when I was growing up. I have learned a lot from them. My mom taught me how to be grateful and appreciate simple things in life. She taught me how to be patient and resilient in times of hardships and difficulties. My dad, on the other hand, taught me the true meaning of generosity and hard work. When I was little, I remembered growing up in a little house with my parents and 4 siblings. Our living room was also our bedroom. My mom used to sell clothes, refreshments and all sorts of desserts from house to house in order to help my dad, who worked in a government construction company at that time. Life was so hard during those times and we were amongst the less fortunate ones who don\u2019t have that much in life. I remembered during my primary years in school, I used to wear the same school shoes and bag for 4 years. My mom used to go to the shoe repair shop in order for my worn out school shoes and bag to be mended so that I would be able to use them again. Although we were lucky enough to eat three times a day, I remembered eating rice and just having salt and pork oil as viand for dinner. My childhood has been tough and our family experienced a lot of struggles but I\u2019m happy and grateful enough to have parents who worked so hard in order to provide us with our daily needs in life. Because of them, I learned how to save and to value money early in life. When I was in primary school, I used to keep some left over coins from my school dinner money and deposited it in a bank for it to grow so that I could use them for my future needs. It earned a lot of interest which have helped my family during the time when we are in great need of money. So, now that I have my own family, I was able to carry the legacy that my parents had taught me when I was young. And these are to value hardwork, to be grateful and appreciate simple things in life, and to be patient and resilient during difficult times. My parents are my greatest influence in life and I owe to them what I had successfully become in this life.  ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a bit of conflict between my mom being the biggest influence and my mentor being the person who made the biggest impact on me. I think, that, my mom is the biggest influence in my rocky life because she\u2019s always there to encourage me when I feel low about myself, when I feel no hope whatsoever, etc. and tell me that things aren\u2019t like the way that I see it sometimes. She\u2019s the one that holds me close when I\u2019m in tears and instantly heals my hurt (it is so magical). She\u2019s the one that comes to my graduation, school event, etc. with a big smile on her face no matter what the event is. She\u2019s the one that supported me when I really needed it. She\u2019s the one that helps to add fuel to my fire at the lowest moments of my life. She\u2019s the one that tells me to give my father another chance when my patience is gone and anger in my tone. She\u2019s the one that encourages me to find what I love instead of following the stereotypes. She\u2019s the one that nurtured me to go in the depths of understanding and truly grasp the feeling within people\u2019s shoes. She\u2019s the one that told me to turn my negative thoughts into positive thoughts when anger surged through my veins. My middle school years were rocky due to the lack of support from my father, my father\u2019s side of the family, insecurity about my future, academics, etc. I learned to be resilent through my mom, through what she does and shows to us when others [my father\u2019s side of the family] tell her she can\u2019t because she\u2019s a woman, tell her to put us [my brother and I] into cheap schools, etc. She\u2019s a strong woman with a strong mentality. She\u2019s a logical woman with a mind so clever that even my father cannot win a single argument with her because she knows just what to say with every comeback hurled at her. As her eldest child I look upon her with favor even though she may really touch my buttons sometimes. In addition, my mom is the one brave enough to point out my mistakes, what I can improve to make myself a better individual, etc. whether it is in public or not. I really appreciate it and I show her all my love. Because I can see her love, because I can see her understanding, because I can see that she truly cares about me, is the reason why I so willingly improved myself when I didn\u2019t want to in the first place. I am here where I am now because of my mom. She\u2019s been my patient guide through all those tough years of my life and my childhood. Even when my father decides to side with my grandma (his mom) she stands stronger than steel. ",
