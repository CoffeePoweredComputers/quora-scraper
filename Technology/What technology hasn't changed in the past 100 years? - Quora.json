            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends on how specific you want to make the comparisons. For example, cars haven't changed in a hundred years or more. They are still four wheels, an engine, a means for steering and braking, and a place for occupants. A similar statement could be made about planes, trains, and ships. However, if you get down to systems, then yes, they have changed remarkably. We can see similar conditions in most technology that has been around for a century or more. Refrigeration and air conditioning is basically the same; so are electric lights\u2014 although the bulbs are vastly different. But what technology is essentially the same\u2014 inside and out\u2014 as it was a hundred years ago? Firearms. Today, most firearms are operated the same way as they were in the Great War: A bolt mechanism, or a recoil or blowback operation. So far as I know, plumbing still works the same way\u2014 gravity, pressure, valves, faucets\u2014 a person suddenly transported from 1918 would know how to get a glass of water, and, apart from the aesthetics of the faucet, find nothing strange at the sink. Mousetraps. Venetian blinds. So, a few simple things work the same way as a hundred years ago, and many things work essentially the same, although the workings have been vastly advanced. ",
