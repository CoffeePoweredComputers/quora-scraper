            "answer_text": "Ask the experts! There is much information online about communication between earth and space. Basically the sources or targets are pinpoints usually moving very fast, and very distant. So we need antennas able to aim directly at the radio source in space for both transmission and reception. Space vehicles have limited power and limited size antennas, so the major burden is on ground control. Huge antennas are required for distant probes like New Horizon or Voyager. The other requirement is powerful computers with up-to-date information on the exact location and trajectory of the space craft. Finally, a global network is necessary for instantaneous connection with points all around the world, since the satellites or space vehicles are circling the earth continuously.

            "answer_text": "Q) What technology is used to communicate in space? A) Microwave frequency bands of are used for space communication. There are two types of space communication. For Telemetry tracking and command (TTCC) usually lower frequency bands (S,X ) are used. For communication of voice, video or data, microwave frequency bands from S to Ka (in the increasing order of frequency) are used. Do check out the following videos to know more:     ",

            "answer_text": "So far, radio waves have been used, because we have technology to generate them easily from a weak supply of electricity. We also have the technology to detect weak radio signals.  But lasers would have significant advantages (such as being able to use a smaller receiver), so Why don't we communicate to our spacecraft using light? has already been asked. ",

While there may be some special purpose 'laser' devices, all communication from current space vehicles or individuals outside a space station/platform use radio devices. At one time in the 'olden' days, some satellites did have film cameras and the resulting 'film' had to be dropped back into the earth's atmosphere, and later picked up. ",
