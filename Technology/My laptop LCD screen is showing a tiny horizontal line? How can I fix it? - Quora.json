            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. \u201cTiny horizontal lines\u201d are typically an indication of hardware failure. No one on Quora can tell you what piece of hardware, however. It could be the video board, the video cable, or the screen itself. But first, make sure it isn\u2019t software related. Try this: Completely shutdown your laptop and wait 10\u201315 minutes (or longer if possible) for everything to cool down.Restart.Is the line there immediately? Is it on the screen in exactly the same place no matter what software you are using? Or is it gone when the machine is cool and then reappear once the machine heats up? If the line only appears in certain software, then it is a software issue. But if it is there all the time it is a hardware problem, and it is unlikely you have the skillset to fix it. You will need to take your laptop to an Authorized Repair Center for that brand to get it fixed. ",
