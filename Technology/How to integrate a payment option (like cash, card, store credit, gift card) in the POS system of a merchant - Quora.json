            "answer_text": "Integration is a big word when applied to POS. The definition seems to vary greatly with the individual asking the question. Chances are, my definition of POS integration will be a lot different than yours. Most POS functions have nothing to do with the actual payment processing function. A fully-integrated solution (payments-wise) usually just means that the server signs in, selects the table number, and gets the billing information on the mobile terminal automatically. He/she can then split the bill any way they need and pass the terminal to the patron for payment. The POS recognizes the transaction and closes the sale/table while adding any tips to the server\u2019s account. It may or may not send a note to the bus team to clear the table. Some POS systems are more simple. The server enters an amount in the POS and it populates the payment terminal\u2026 big whup. That type of \u201cintegration\u201d is just a little better than useless. It\u2019s just as easily done, if not easier, on the terminal itself. The big difference is in who enters the amount to be paid, who marks the sale as paid, and who monitors the balance still owed (not all POSs do). A fully integrated system does that on its own. In a non-integrated, or partially-integrated system the server does it. To answer your question: The first type of integration is not something you can do. Let the POS company handle it. Hopefully it will be for someone they support. It can take ages to code and approve an integration. Some processors (cough, cough, . . . like us) offer a middle ware solution for near instant integration. POS companies can off-load the processing stuff to our middle ware. Many do not offer this type of thing and the POS company is forced to jump through multiple hoops, costs, and headaches. Then, without that middle-ware, any changes on the processing side require emergency coding. ",

            "answer_text": "Most POS systems treat gift cards as a credit card so nothing to do. Cash? Cash is handed to the cashier, it's posted and change if any is given back to you unless you have an expensive machine like a self checkout this function is built into the machine so it recognizes the bill or coins ",
