            "answer_text": "If you are talking about on board diagnostics,it will tell you why a check engine light has been switched on & why there may be any driveability issues with the vehicle. A compatible scan tool will tell you which part of the engine management system is at fault by retrieving any codes stored on the cars PCM,it can also display live data regarding long term & short term fuel trim reading, oxygen sensor monitoring in real time (while the engine is running), vehicle speed,engine RPMs,airflow volume (in grams per second),throttle position %age, ignition timing, coolant & inlet air temperature. Other form of diagnostics include :- Engine cylinder & leakdown testing to check the engines overall cylinder condition,cooling system pressure testing & a chemical test which can indicate that there is carbon monoxide in the coolant due to a blown cylinder head gasket, spark plug tester to check whether the ignition system is working or not, an oil pressure test gauge to check that the engines bearings & oil pump are in good shape & a fuel pressure test using a pressure gauge to find out if the fuel pump is performing or whether the EFI fuel system has any internal leakage !

            "answer_text": " An automobile diagnostics test can analyze the overall performance of your vehicle and pinpoint any potential issues as well as determine whether any adjustments may be wanted. With the use of a specialized computer that scans the operating systems in your vehicle, your mechanic doesn\u2019t have to guess anymore as to what kind of repairs are wanted. So what does a diagnostic test on a car tell you? It can indicate issues associated with the components relating to the following: Transmission,Oil tank,Gas tank,Exhaust systemIgnition timing problems,Level of combustion buildup in the engine,Fuel injector performance,Engine rpm levels,Condition of the ignition coils,Air and coolant temperature,Crankshaft and camshaft position and throttle opening.",
