            "answer_text": "Cloud Certifications were all rage when they were Introduced first, like from vendors like Microsoft and AWS, CompTIA & EXIN etc. They did hold a lot of values initially, and were a gold standard to hunt/hire proficient people on Cloud. However, most of these very certifications have lost their value/Importance over time (anywhere/everywhere, and not only in India), because of many reasons, like people getting easily certified in large numbers using brain dumps (classic Issue with MS certifications, and now even extending to AWS quickly) without beyond basic knowledge of the platform, seldom updated certification test questions with a limited/static question bank, objective nature of the certification tests without checking for hands-on knowledge etc. These certifications are now good to showcase on profiles, but beyond that what really matters is your real-world field knowledge on Cloud and the specific platform(s) you are pitching for, which certifications cannot guarantee in current times. If someone hires you without checking for your depth of knowledge and proficiency in Cloud, you are certainly getting into a dubious role, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to make it unless you prepared for and passed the respective certifications legitimately. I have been Interviewing tons of Cloud certified candidates from last few years or so, both on MS Azure and AWS, and have found consistently in last 1 year that more than 90% of the certified candidates know nothing beyond very basic level knowledge on either platforms, and many even have never even opened the cloud portals of these platforms and just crammed information from tutorials and question banks/dumps. One of such certifications, CCSK, I consider still not having lost its value/Importance, but most others I feel have been discredited to a large extent because of various reasons, and some of those reasons are mentioned above.

            "answer_text": "Depends on CV and post applied for. For sysadmin related posts most employers will expect in-depth (at least theoretical) knowledge around working on SSH, scripting in 1\u20132 language, basic idea of networking, DNS etc. If job is cloud related hardly few questions on experience with Python and OpenStack will be asked. All companies essentially seek a capable employee and ready to pay well. Certification always can add slight to huge point or attract the recruiters to think about a candidate about his/her interest. Of course it is good to attract the employers in that way to mostly self taught skill sets. Test only certifications with no hands on lab work without any matching works on GitHub, SourceForge can invoke suspicion of brain dump memorization. As investment is a matter to think in India, for a country like India I can not say \u201cmust have\u201d. Cloud computing certifications are not powerful unlike ethical hacking related certifications. That is exactly I want to say. Now if you have company A\u2019s cloud computing certification and applying for company A\u2019s cloud computing post related to marketing, it can add more value as candidate. ",
