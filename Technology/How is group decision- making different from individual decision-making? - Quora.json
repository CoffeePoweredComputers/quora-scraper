            "answer_text": "Let us take a simple example to understand the process. Say, there is a task of lifting a square shaped stone weighing 100 kg. If an individual is asked to do this task, he/she may not be able to perform it considering the individual\u2019s capacity to perform such a laborious task. ( Please leave out the bodybuilders. Individuals are there who can perform such tasks such as Braun Strowman.) Now, if the same task is asked to perform to a group of 3\u20134 people, everyone will contribute towards how to complete it. And then, yes, it can be completed successfully. While coming to a conclusion over an issue/matter/problem/decision, every individual will sure have some capacities & limitation to look at the problem & come to a solution. But if the same situation is offered to a group of people to find a solution, there is no doubt that every individual will have a little different approach, perception & a solution too. After everyone have put individual\u2019s opinion on the table, everyone can take out the best all they can find from everyone\u2019s contribution & reach to the best possible solution to the problem. However, group decision making does not guarantee satisfaction to everyone involved in the process. As the outcome of such process is a mixture of mutually agreed upon positive factors contributed individually to find a most suitable solution, few or all may feel that their ideas were better than what others have given or what has been chosen at the end. The process basically leads to a win-win situation where everyone is either assured of minimal satisfaction or zero satisfaction. It may not be necessary that such process will have left a space for expressing displeasure over the outcome. Because, the phrase \u2018Group Decision Making\u2019 itself conveys that its a process which can have either positive or negative outcome. This is why either minimal satisfaction or entirely none but the process is carried out in the interest of larger good. If you ask me, its far better than letting an individual have the control over a particular situation or problem. ",

            "answer_text": "If we take decision in group then it is much better because other people will also give their suggestions hence it make decision more accurate and acceptable by more people and also other people will feel good and circle of trustworthy and intelligent people will grow\u2026 And if a decision is taken individually on behalf of group where group is also involved may not be that much perfect until and unless other people of group are all fool.. Individual decision for individual is very good if it is taken for achieving certain goal because it gives motivation when you feel low and also makes you responsible for you failur\ud83d\ude02that is also good why not? \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0924\u094b \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0916\u0941\u0926 \u0915\u094b \u0917\u0932\u0924 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e At times we considered ourselves wrong ",
