            "answer_text": "To be able to explain why it does something, a system will need first of all a causal model of why things happen, and then a symbolic facility to render that to language of some sort. A causal model involves primarily some form of abstraction, so that low level details are elided and higher level principal causes are brought to the forefront. Sort of like prinicipal components analysis, we can only understand explanations where there are a couple of primary \u2018reasons\u2019 why something occurred, and we need representations that can pull those out from the complex multilayered goals and subgoals, sensory stimuli and uncorrelated things happening in a real environment.
