            "answer_text": " Innovation is usually thought of as something that\u2019s technology driven. It can be - but it doesn\u2019t have to be. It also doesn\u2019t have to something that takes tons of R&D money to produce. You don\u2019t have to mine asteroids or create the next great app to be an innovator. To me, an innovator can be any entrepreneur that looks at the marketplace and asks themselves, \u201cWhat does the marketplace want, but no one is giving them?\u201d You can be innovative and there are three ways to do it. First there\u2019s adding services. This is where you add obvious services to make a complete package. For example, if you\u2019re a restaurant you could add flower delivery or limo service to make the ultimate package. The second way is it to name exclusive services and systems. What do you do but don\u2019t tell anybody about? Even if others in your industry do it \u2013 the first one to explain it and name it, wins. For example, maybe you\u2019re a manufacturer and your process is really thorough. Would your customers be blown away by all the things you do to get your final product? Name your system and make it exclusive to you. Educate your prospects and clients on why and how you do it and the benefits it provides them. The third way to innovate is \u201cReal innovation.\u201d This is usually the most difficult to figure out because people are stuck in their own heads and say, \u201cthat can\u2019t be done or it\u2019s too expensive or too hard to pull off.\u201d Simply ask yourself \u201cWhat does the marketplace really want but no one is giving them?\u201d And then give it to them.

            "answer_text": "\u201cInnovators like Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos think differently, observe the world carefully and ask questions that lead others around them to behave differently. This leads to more experimentation. Innovators were brought up in family environments where questioning was encouraged. Companies can create similar environments where questioning is encouraged. Companies can encourage managers to pay attention to ideas and re-inforce and reward ideas arising from teams they manage. Companies that foster this approach are valued more highly by the stock market.\u201d More on this topic by Hal Gregersen in a 16 min video here. More on Hal Gregersen here. ",
