            "answer_text": "Repair Workshops. People with broken things bring them to workshops, where they have them fixed by knowledgeable handymen/handywomen, and in the process, learn how to maintain the things they own themselves instead of throwing them out and replacing them. These types of workshops are springing up all across the industrialized world, in no small part as a way to punish companies for making products designed to fail and be replaced, by keeping them going much longer than they were supposed to.Community tool pools. This is kind of an extension of the previous point. Knowledge of how to fix something is great, but when fixing a $20 toy requires a $200 soldering gun, the breakeven point on your investment can be pretty far out. But you might know someone that has a soldering gun and will lend it to you, assuming he gets it back in the same condition he lent it out. You yourself might own a portable table saw and would be willing to make the same arrangement. With enough people getting together and keeping a centralized list of who owns what and who it\u2019s loaned to, you can spread the cost of this vast pool of resources over the entire community, instead of one gearhead having everything that everyone needs.Build it yourself. I don\u2019t mean go out and put together a washing machine from sheet steel, but way too many things are overengineered for aesthetics or for the last little bit of mechanical or physical advantage. You want a shelf in your living room? Shop the lumber section, not the pre-fab aisles. With a little knowledge and skill (unfortunately that skill requires some time and patience to gain), and a nest egg in power tools (or the aforementioned tool pool), you can make a better shelf costing less money than the cheap pressboard prefab units. That\u2019s not to say shelving systems are bad, but take a close look at what you\u2019re buying. The easier it is to install, the less likely it was built to last.You can\u2019t afford to buy cheap. In the Discworld novel series, Terry Pratchett posits through a main character a theory of economic disparity, the \u201cboots\u201d theory. Let\u2019s say a quality pair of leather boots costs $50. You can get a cheaper pair for $10. The poor worker will buy the $10 boots to save money for other necessities. These boots might last a few months, then the cheaper material the sole is made from will break down, develop holes and leaks, and the worker has to buy another pair. A wealthier person who can afford the $50 boots will buy them, and the quality leather and durable sole will last for years. In that time frame, the poor worker might have had to buy ten pairs of the cheap boots, spending twice as much because he can never scrape together the $50 in one go. Even when things eventually wear out, there\u2019s a right way to design and build them, and someone willing to do it that way. In the long run, it will cost you less to spend more.Baby your tech. Apple doesn\u2019t put Gorilla Glass on their iPhones, not for cost reasons, but for revenue reasons. Apple wants you to break the screen, so you pay someone $100-$150 to put pone of their replacement screens on the phone. Do this maybe twice, and you\u2019ve just made Apple another $200 in screens, that they wouldn\u2019t have made if you\u2019d paid for that $50 Otter Box (not saying an Otter Box case is the best option for everyone, nor that you can\u2019t still break the screen in one, but it does help).Look for maintenance-friendly features. Cell phones are designed with batteries that last you the two years of the average mobile contract even if used properly. If that battery is permanently installed in the phone (to make it less expensive and also thinner/smaller), when the battery no longer holds a charge the phone is garbage. There are still phones out there built with replaceable batteries, which allow you to drop in a new battery for a quarter the cost of a new phone, keeping your older phone new.Clean your tech. Microsoft Windows\u2019 biggest weakness, IMHO, is the Windows Registry. This database of application and system settings is seemingly designed to hold onto everything forever, and as the size of the Registry grows, computer performance, especially at bootup, degrades. Similarly, storage space on hard drives is reused over time, causing file fragmentation, and while defrag tools help, many of them will scatter the files that one application needs across several areas of the disc either due to overall usage statistics or just because it\u2019s the most convenient place to put those files. Adjacent files, however, are easier to access, so program access time is typically improved by orders of magnitude simply by being in the same space on the disk. Eventually, the best solution is simply to backup what you want to save, reformat your entire hard drive and reinstall your operating system from scratch. Not too many people still do this; they blame slowdowns on the age of the device, or they\u2019re stymied by anti-piracy methods that prevent registering the same copy of Windows too many times, and they simply upgrade after taking a backup of critical files.Don\u2019t be a first adopter. The first revision of anything is going to have problems. It\u2019ll be slower than anything that comes out later. It\u2019ll be heavier. It won\u2019t be just the right size. This is problematic, because if nobody bought the first one of anything, nobody would bother making anything new. However, something being the latest and greatest has come to dominate consumer demand; we want it because it\u2019s new, not necessarily because it\u2019s appreciably better. The push to get more people thinking that way is why planned obsolescence is so common in consumer devices now.Some things, you just can\u2019t fight. Your 90s-era cell phone was built for a network that is in the process of being deactivated and dismantled, so the radio bandwidth can be used more efficiently by 4G and 5G technologies. 3G networks are also being cannibalized and 3G devices will eventually be obsolete as well. Your old analog TV had the same thing happen to it back in 2007; analog broadcasts went off the air, and you needed a digital antenna and receiver (with two remotes or a compatible universal remote) to continue to use the screen. There is usually a net benefit in these situations; in this case it\u2019s more efficient use of the EM spectrum bandwidth to support an ever-growing appetite for mobile communication. If everyone kept their computers and portable electronic devices around for ten years, that would be the pace of technological growth, based on the money flowing into the tech companies. We as consumers don\u2019t want that; we want better products sooner.",

            "answer_text": "Planned obsolescence was one of the main points of contention in Cold War propaganda. Critics of capitalism claimed that monopoly producers deliberately made shoddy cars or bad light bulbs, with a limited shelf life, so that you would have to buy more. Out of this genuine debate, grew an entire field of conspiracy theory, that some inventor somewhere built a better mousetrap, and some big company stole or bought the rights to prevent the competition. For every would be Steve Jobs there were millions or Rube Goldbergs, so this was a huge topic of debate for more than 50 years. Lets be clear, for most people in the world the issue was that there was a limited number of monopoly capitalist companies, mostly in the US, who deliberately produced shoddy products, often dumped on the 3rd world, because there was more profit than in producing quality products that lasted longer. In 1971 the Socialist Allende government created a humor magazine, LA Firme, dedicating to exposing the evils of US capitalism. One copy was on the light bulb. It claimed the incandescent light bulb was a bad idea and that GE had bought up the rights to improvements, only to hide them. I used to buy 4 GE light bulbs at Safeway for $3.99. Living near the beach they lasted about 2 months. Now I get LED bulbs that last 3 years, or an eternity by GE standards. British sports cars and Detroit cars were examples of planned obsolescence in the sense understood at the time, shoddy products needing constant parts or replacement. Japanese cars made it immediately obvious. The solutions are: trust Consumer Reports ( the only ad free, honest evaluator of how long products last), word-of-mouth and living a minimalist life style.
