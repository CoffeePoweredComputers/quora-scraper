            "answer_text": "Latest technology which is under development is smart grid. It features almost all branches of engineering for it\u2019s operation. Smart grid does not have an exact definition. As smartness can be in various levels. This grid reduces the dependency on centralized power plants by including distributed generation. Smart grid requires various branches of engineering for its installation and maintenance. Communication engineers are required for installation, maintenance and operation of data network that transfers data from the meters and sends real time information to the Independent system operators. This technology aims at reducing the dependency on transmission lines while utilizing the distributed lines to the maximum. That is the DGs are used to produce power locally and share the power among a group of consumers. The ISO uses communication devices to transfer information for heavy automation of power systems. The heavy automation also helps in preventing instability in power systems and avoid blackouts. ",

            "answer_text": "One really cool technology that is just emerging is in the area of protection and control of transmission lines. The technology is used to sense faults (short circuits) on a transmission line and then open the line circuit breaker in a fraction of the time that conventional (earlier) technology takes for the same fault. This latest technology is called time-domain line protection and it senses the traveling wave caused by the fault. Checkout the SEL-T400L to learn more. ",
