            "answer_text": "Appreciate your question and the best part is the sensors are available to detect clothing or fabric\u2019s material.Now robots can identify with following sensors based on: Vision based:High resolutions camera for image scan and modifications to assess the pattern,structure and fibre microscopic analysis can determine the fibres.Please note that every kind of fibre have unique appearance under microscopic view thus material can be identified.Tactile based :The BioTac, with advanced human-like tactile sensing, is the leading product in machine touch.The design consists of a rigid core surrounded by an elastic liquid filled-skin to give a compliance remarkably similar to the human fingertip.The BioTac\u00ae is capable of sensing: force, vibration, and temperature which is identical to human touch capabilities. These sensory capabilities have been incorporated into the device without placing a single sensor in the skin. Instead, all of the electronics are protected inside the rigid core.[1]  Thanks Footnotes[1] Sensor Technology | SynTouch",
