            "answer_text": "Every single answer is wrong! All the answers refer to Clyde's message, you know, this one:  If we read the message, we can tell that being blocked isn't the only reason Clyde returns this message. These reasons are: You've been blockedYou don't share a server with the recipient (or you're not their friend)Or, on your shared server(s), you have Receive Messages from Server Members disabledThe recipient is only receiving DMs from friendsSo how are they wrong? My Discord settings are set to receive no DMs unless you're my friend. So when someone DMs me, they see Clyde's message. According to other answers, this means I've blocked them! But I haven't, they just can't message me. All hope is not lost though, there is ONE way to find if someone has blocked you and it's this: just react to one of their messages.If the reaction appears: you are not blocked.If the reaction disappears: you are blocked. It's simple! Clyde tells you nothing about your blocked status. You can't even PoE it because there's no way to tell their DM status. Use the reaction method, it's the only reliable way to see if you're blocked. ",

If they attempt to send you a direct message, a message from Clyde will pop up  In case you can't read it it says: \u201cYour message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, **or you were blocked by the recipient**.\u201d That could also pop up when the person has there direct messages off or aren't in a shared server with you (server your both in). You can always try pinging them in that shared server and see if they reply. If they don't It's likely because they did block you and if you block someone you can't see the messages they send. Hope this helped **-important ",
