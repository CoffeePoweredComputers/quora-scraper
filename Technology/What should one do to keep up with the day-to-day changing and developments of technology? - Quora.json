            "answer_text": "The problem of generation gap is universal and everybody across the globe faces the unchangeable problem. But this problem is experienced intensely in countries like India or Gulf countries where the families live united. Although the families continue to live united they may be in odd terms with each other.Due to the difference in bringing up, their mental framework differ from each other. Physciological and behavorial patterns are formed on the basis of circumstances one undergoes. When the people of the different generations meet each other they often are induced to difference in opinion, communication gap, conflicts etc. Due to the difference in mental framework the likes and dislikes also differ from each other. In this way both the parties cannot live in peace with each other and they are unable to respect the likes and opinion of each other. The frequency of thoughts flow from opposite directions in a parallel manner. When the thought process from the two parties is so different, then love cannot be expressed even if it exists between the two parties. Both of them are unable to find a proper channel to express their feelings also. in this way gap creates between the two relationships. If you want to cope up with the generation of the future, you\u2019re going to have to speak their language. Stay current with the trends that define your kids\u2019 generation, from slang, music, movies, and clothes to social networking and current events. It\u2019s especially important that you become adept with the current technology. ",

You, yourself will be able to find ways to remain updated with the latest things going on in the tech world. However if you want to do this just so that you can boast about it then I think that's going to be a problem. ",
