            "answer_text": "Here are some few tips you can go about \"understanding technology\" 1. Learn about the Internet, networking and software The term technology is mostly associated with the three things above. If you can learn to understand what those three things above work, interconnect and relate to each other then it shouldn't be hard to move forward. The questions you should be be able to answer on all three afterward should be; -What are they -How do they work? -How are they made of? 2. Try to learn how technology helps and makes life easier For instance, how would it have been without cellphone or the Internet? How would it have been This will not only help you try to think further and deep on what happens when you make a phone call or send an email, but also help you understand the third part which is the devices involved. 3.Devices This shouldn't be hard to understand for it compliment the other mentioned above. Learn and try to understand the physical devices behind unseen software. How they work, pass information and communicate to each other from end point to another 4. Use Wikipedia Wikipedia has been a great source for a general knowledge about almost anything around. Whenever you hear something new, i argue you try to Google it and see if it has a Wikipedia page and try to read it. You won't left totally blank as most of the stuffs are written with a simple language which probably anyone would understand 5. Learn about people I know this might seem strange but i most of the time it worked greatly for me. After i read about a certain new technology i have no idea with i try to find the person behind that project. This helped me to be more interested with the topic as i start to examine and think what was going on that persons mind for him/her to develop that particular technology but it also helped me to see the flaws on previous technologies that were being tried to be solved with that new piece of technology. 6. Learn the basics of HTML and CSS and try to put them in action This will help you understand more on what really happens behind the screens. Sometime reading alone can't be enough, practices will make it better.And the good thing is you can learn all these in less than two weeks. Trust me it will help you to keep moving 7. Use \"How?\" Whenever you see anything interesting just ask yourself, how does it work? ",

            "answer_text": "Technology goes always  together with the human civilization and it is difficult to give you a good answer. What I mean is that it depends on what technology branch, what kind of applications, in what level etc. you are interesting in. The main tools of understanding are mathematics and physics. These two are the seeds of the technological achievements. By them have emergent modern brunches of sciences like informatics and engineering. ",
