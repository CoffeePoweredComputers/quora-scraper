            "answer_text": "Depends on various factors. If it is in the vicinity and considering the device has either Bluetooth, GPS or WiFi On, we can easily detect just by searching for the device with your own device. (Simplest Case) However, if the device is On with no other above features On, then probably you can use an RF or Radiation Detector device which can be obtained from any related company. It detects the radio signals emitted by the cell whenever it connects to a signal tower when doing a call or message. But mostly, in the case of deliberately hidden cell, the cell may be powered Off. Here there is no way of detection, other than physical methods.(As far as I know) Hope this helps. ",
