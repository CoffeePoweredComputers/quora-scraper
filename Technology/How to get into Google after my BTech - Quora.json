Besides your academic record, they look at extra curricular record which has helped shaped your personality. Google also encourages individuals who have displayed leadership qualities right from their school and university days. So, if I have to summarise it. Good academic record (sometimes even overlooked if other aspects are brighter)Excellent extra curricular activitiesLeadership qualitiesThis is how they select people for most roles. But I am not very sure how they select Engineers. A technically sound background is definitely needed. I'm sure they look for innovation and vision in your work. Foresight and the ability to create need for things that we may not even have thought of is a plus. Good communication skills are a must. You have to be able to share your ideas clearly. So, make sure you're confident and able to hold conversations without any problems. Hope this helps! ",
