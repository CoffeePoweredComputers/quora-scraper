            "answer_text": "The iPhone first became a thing when Steve Jobs set a team to work on a tablet. They realized the technology wasn't there yet to create the tablet they wanted to, so they came up with the idea to make a touch screen iPod instead. The project grew and changed and later other features were added, turning it into the iPhone that was announced in January of 2007 and released 6 months later.  The iPhone changed everything about the phone market in 3 major ways that can't be understated:  It put a computer in people's pockets. All the other functionality, like the phone, messaging, pictures, and the web browser, were just apps running on a very small computer. It changed the form factor, making buttons dynamic instead of static and opening up possibilities. It was also one of the largest screened phones on the market. Many people at the time said the 3.5\" screen was too large. It took the power away from the carriers and gave it to the manufacturers. This one is probably the biggest and the most understated one of all. It completely changed the entire industry and made all of the innovations in the mobile market possible. ",

            "answer_text": "This is largely my personal view. I have lived in Spain since around the time the iPhone was announced and so this answer also reflects the situation in Spain. The iPhone was always popular. A lot of people knew that this what we wanted before it had even been announced\u2026 \u201cWhy can\u2019t Apple just put a phone inside the iPod? That\u2019d be great.\u201d And then, finally, on Jan 9th 2007 Steve Jobs announced that what the world wanted was on its way\u2026 We still had to wait a few months to actually be able to buy an iPhone but the people wanted them! At first it was difficult, you had to have a contract with a specific network, you may have had to pay a data surcharge, etc\u2026 but people still wanted them. Jailbreaking became a popular hobby as people would import them from the US to use on European networks. I even jailbroke a couple for friends. As we moved forward we got the iPhone 3G and 3GS (The first one I owned was a 3G in 2010, almost 2 years after its release). But from what I saw, here in Spain, it was the iPhone 4 that really got people buying iPhones. You could now buy them on any network and they had had 3 years to show the world that this was the future. The fantastic new design of the 4 was another factor (no-one cared about the antenna problems.) It was this model that I suddenly saw in the hands of all my friends. This was when everybody started making the move to smartphones. ",
