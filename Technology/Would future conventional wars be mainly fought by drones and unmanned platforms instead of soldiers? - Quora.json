            "answer_text": "Interesting question. The obvious lure of using machines to fight is counter balanced by the inherent weaknesses of machines and the industrial logistics of building them. A further problem is a machine can easily be turned off or turned against it\u2019s home nation. If you were to hack the air force of an enemy nation in the time of war, you could use their entire air force against them. If there were no human reserves that nation would be highly vulnerable. Machine piloted aircraft allow fighters to perform maneuvers that would knock out or kill human pilots. We have by far exceeded current human capability in an unprotected cockpit , that does not mean we cannot design aircraft that will protect pilots from such maneuvers. The added weight and expense of protecting the pilot, the pilot themselves, the and controls make human piloted planes more expensive and less maneuverable. AI guided aircraft are vulnerable to predictability, EMP, hacking, errors in their programming, a lack of creativity as well as the inability to deal with highly complex and vague mission orders/situations. As such a mixed mode of human and drone combat aircraft is the only logical way to fight. This requires drastic changes in air war strategy. Drones as a replacement for infantry is a Sci-Fi concept that excites military leaders around the world but comes with a host of unforeseen problems. Interactions with humans for example. Drones are incapable of empathy and compassion. They will enforce the literal constructs of their mission parameters without exception. This can lose a war if one totally alienates the populace of a nation they are invading. Like aircraft, infantry drones are prone to hacking, errors in programming and can often be too literal for the fluid demands of the battlefield. Arming advanced AI that could deal with the fluid situations of battlefields would be suicide. If the AI has all the military power, why would it obey our orders? AI has to be self programming to adapt to the changing environment of combat and if it\u2019s self programming, sooner or later it will both become self aware and then question it\u2019s status as slave. As such, again a mixed mode of drones and humans is the only logical way to conduct such a war. There has to be a fall back in case the drones are hacked or rendered inoperable. A single traitor on one side could otherwise completely win/lose a war. A well place spy could render the entire military of another nation into junk or worse turn it against the civilian population. Asimov\u2019s 3 laws are a pipe dream. We could never build hardware capable of dealing with the complexity of the battlefield and still enforce those laws in the hardware. Another thing to consider is if there is no cost in terms of lives for the aggressor nation, then there is little incentive to avoid a war if one side is confident of victory. After all the only risks are world opinion which is fickle and easily manipulated and some hardware. Why not go to war if that is all that is risked. The losing side will pay a very heavy price however. As such I do not think that we will ever see AI taking over our military unless it is literally the last thing we do as a species. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably. As you state above, it is cheaper and a lot less of an economic drain to have robots killed instead of humans. It would make sense to send robots out instead of humans. They would not just be on the battlefield without human intervention. There would be a number of safeguard that would prevent a total robot on robot conflict It is not going to be like Terminator in which we have a massive computer program which looks after everything. Humans will be there to regulate what is going on and have their say in the operations of the conflict. There will be massive safeguards that would prevent this. It is not going to happen for as long time. Conventional war will still have a huge amount of human death in it (As there will never be a time when robots can do everything) but they will have a much bigger place on the battlefield. They would be able to take out opposition well before it was detected by human forces and thus reduce military casualties. The problem that would happen is that robots would not be able to make ethical decision on the battlefield OR know when to stop attacking. For example, say a civilian force sees a group of civilians in a hut, \u201cRegular soldiers\u201d would call in air support and get them out of there. Robots would ignore them for not being a threat and then leave them to the enemy forces. Alternatively, say that there were terrorists hiding in the group, a robot may kill all the people to get the one and not arrest them as it should be. Without human intervention, Robot on Robot conflict would be designated to specialist areas where they could fight in a safe area away from the ethical and moral issues of humanity. ",
