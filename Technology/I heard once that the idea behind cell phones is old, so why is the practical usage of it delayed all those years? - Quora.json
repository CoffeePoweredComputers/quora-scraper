            "answer_text": "The lack there of technology, size, and cost restrictions. Making wireless calls started in the 70s. My dad had a car phone in the 80s. Radio-telephone relay. It was hard wired into a huge box that filled a good 30% of the trunk. It also had this huge whip antenna that was bolted to the side of the car. You would lift the receiver, push a button, and via radio link a dispatch center would call a number for you. You had to push the button every time time you talked. If pushed while the other person was talking, it would cut them off. It was terrible at best. In the 90s he had a Motorola bag phone. 4 watts of analog power. Again it wasn't that great, lots of static, and interference. Didn't even try if near a power line. Technology got better as time went on. Keep in mind, the Motorola engineers that designed the first all in on hand held cell phones died of brain cancer. ALL of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Cell phons are a complex technological problem. Nowadays is the time people (the bright technical people and companies of Earth) got to the level that these work reliably, are popular enough (to have low costs and good quality). Technological progress is not automatic, it is a result of peoples (companies) actions, thoughts, inventions. It also needs a solid market that trusts these products to spend money on them,\u2026 to be able to get back the invested resources and continue the work. That all is a slow process (might take years). This is probably similar to an apple tree. You see the apples while still green but you only eat them when those are ripe. The only difference is that that ripening process is almost automatic (just needs the sun, water, minerals, time, protection from bugs, :-). ",
