            "answer_text": "I would recommend that you install Google Chrome and go to it's web store.  Search for flowchart.  You will see a lot of web based software. Lucidchart also works offline, which means it can run faster. As you know, the best known program in the area is Microsoft Visio. It is not free. However it's viewer application is free. You can save your files in the Visio format if possible then use Visio Viewer to check it's formatting etc. ",
