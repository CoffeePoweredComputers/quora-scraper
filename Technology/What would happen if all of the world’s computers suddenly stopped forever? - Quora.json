            "answer_text": "What would happen if all of the world\u2019s computers suddenly stopped forever? The USA, China, Russia etc would be totally stuffed in every conceivable way. Commercial planes, trains, ships, automobiles etc would cease to operate, and maybe crash. Initially there would be a bit of disruption as society retooled and returned to the technologies of the 1970s. We can easily live without computers. In commerce\u2026 When I started full time permanent work at an Insurance company in the early 1970s, my job was to manually enter figures into a multi column underwriting ledger about 5 feet wide, about 60 lines deep and about six inches thick (think of a huge excel spread sheet). At the end of each month, I\u2019d mentally add ever line and column, across & down and pray the end total equaled in both directions. A couple of years later I was given a huge Buroughs mechanical adding machine (electric driven), with about 12 keys across & 10 down. I found it quicker to add mentally than use the machine. Somewhere in the mid 1970s I was given an NCR adding machine with a keypad. This was great. Years later I pulled one apart and it had a small abacus thingy to do the computations. This machine could do do both addition and subtraction, so you could reverse errors through reinput. The machine cost more than I earnt in a fortnight. Around the same time Monroe released a mechanical machine that could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It cost about three months average wages and was redundant a year later when Singer brought out a \u201cpocket\u201d calculator that could do scientific type calculations. That cost about a weeks wages. Assuming you don\u2019t consider pocket calculators a computer, then we can readily live without computers, but pocket calculators with a keypad certainly and tape display made life easier. Things just take longer when you can\u2019t automate data interchanges and have to duplicate inputs. So what about the internet? In the old days we had encyclopedias & people would go to the library to get info, people would write letter to communicate, or better yet use analogue telephones if a quick response was needed. We even had the equivalent of dating sites via special magazines & newspapers. The only thing the internet provides that we didn\u2019t have a direct equivalent was kids having ready access to porn. So if all the computers in the world suddenly disappeared, we have a fall back position, and evn fall backs if the the fall backs fail. It would just take a short time for industry to retool. In the meantime, backwater places still using the old technologies would climb to the top of the pile of commercial centres. Now, if TV suddenly disappeared the world would be doomed and Armageddon will have arrived! ",

            "answer_text": "Try running this little scenario in your head: You\u2019re at work, normal day of the week, when the power goes out. Your computer goes dark, and you notice everyone\u2019s computer in your office has also crapped out. Your boss says \u201cOK, it\u2019s a power outage, let\u2019s wait a bit\u201d. After more than a bit, you and your fellow workers are sent home early \u201cbecause it\u2019s no use keeping you guys here\u201d. You get in your car and drive home. You get home and there\u2019s no power either. But it\u2019s OK, it\u2019s just a power outage, they\u2019ll fix it soon. The next morning you wake up and there\u2019s still no power. So, no TV, no radio, no phones (everyone\u2019s using VOIP now\u2026) no internet, etc. Problem is: no hot water for your shower, or for doing the dishes. If you use electric appliances, no way to make coffee, tea, breakfast. And your freezer is melting kind of fast. By this time, some people are starting to freak out. Whoever got caught inside an elevator during the initial outage and hasn\u2019t been rescued yet is already in trouble. People in hospitals especially those in need of life support or specialised treatments are also in deep trouble (hospitals should have their own generators, but how long will the fuel for them last?) You try to go to a store near you and buy some candles, matches and a gas cooker to try and make things a little better, but you can\u2019t. Their cash register is also electrical, and so it won\u2019t work. But you have some cahs on you, and talk the owner into it. He/she sells you most of the stuff you want for your cash. But now you need some more cash. For groceries and stuff. OK, just go to an ATM, right? Ooops. ATMs are also electrical, and depend on a bunch of computers and other equipment to work. Without power, they are useless. But your bank is nearby and open at this time. You can withdraw some money straight from the bank. Nope. Without power they can\u2019t use their own computers, and they can\u2019t check your balance. So no money. If power comes back on the following morning, it was just a scare and a pretty big inconvenience. If it doesn\u2019t, the problems start getting serious. People start getting scared, angry and hungry. This can get very bad, very fast. This is a basic scenario for a bad blackout, but if there is some kind of event that makes every computer go out, one of the first things to be disrupted will be power delivery. Unfortunately for all of us, we\u2019re becoming addicted to technology. Yes, it makes lie a lot simpler, and allows us to do things that were impossible 50 years ago, but if we ever lose this for any kind of reason, we\u2019d better know how to make do without. ",

That will be the immediate result. In the longer term, food production will not be as efficient as it is in our real world nor will food distribution work that well anymore.Big cities will not be supplied with food.Large scale starvation. Within a year the worlds population will be halved.Epidemics will break out, medicine production will be near non existent and the supplies in storage have the same problem as food, the logistics have broken down with the disappearance of computers.
