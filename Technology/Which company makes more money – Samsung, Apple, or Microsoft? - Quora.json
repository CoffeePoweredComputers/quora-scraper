            "answer_text": "SAMSUNG FUN FACT: Samsung makes a TON of money FROM Apple because they sell Apple parts for their iPhones: sometimes SSD memory, RAM, and the Super AMOLED screen as featured on their iPhone X. So every sale of iPhones, Samsung gets a profit off it. Samsung also makes the AMOLED screen for the Apple Watch too (sometimes LG provides parts too when needed since they manufacturer LCD and OLED screens). You have to deduct the cost of each iPhone sale and then you'll get a better answer because Apple has to buy all those parts.. Apple, just like any \u201cAmerican brand electronics\u201d, do not make their own devices. While APPLE is number one in the USA (IN TERMS OF SMARTPHONES), Samsung is actually number one in the world.. Samsung doesn't only make computers and smartphones, they make a whole host of things which includes TV, PC monitors, washers dryers, refrigerators, smart home products, and now they acquired Harmon Kardon (also known as AKG and JBL) and make high quality speakers now.. so I'd say Samsung is the biggest of them all given the fact they sell more than just computers and how much more they sell around the world.. Apple only sells a handful of iPhone models, high end MacBooks and Mac PCs which not everyone can afford to purchase and they do not make \u201ccheap \u201c budget laptops.. they make very terrible quality Beats Audio headphones (no longer made by Monster) which looks stylish on the outside but sounds terrible from the inside, their Apple Home speaker was a fail and did horribly.. the Apple TV wasn't that successful either, they are trying to do their own streaming service but Amazon, Netflix, and soon Disney will always be at the top.. Microsoft on the other hand only has their Windows OS, Microsoft Office software, Xbox, and Surface Tablet PC.. their Windows Mobile phone was a expensive disaster as they've tried multiple times to get it to become popular but ultimately they failed. So these are the reasons which I conclude it's Samsung that is number one.. Again, Apple does not MANUFACTURER things.. so you have to take into account that they pay other manufacturers like Foxconn, Samsung, sometimes LG, etc. not only to build the phones but also purchase parts from them and they have to pay a fee for it all.. so you will have to deduct the cost for purchasing these high tech parts which are not cheap. And again, Samsung actually is number one on the world regarding smartphones as their phones sell the most in the world.. they sell more than just a handful of phone models, they make different models for each market.. they are a household name and considered a high end TV and appliance maker.. Apple does not make TVs, washer and dryers, refrigerators, etc. (but Apple still beats Samsung in the USA in terms of smartphone sales however)... All of this makes Samsung number one. ",

            "answer_text": "  Undoubtedly it\u2019s Apple !!!!! is worth more than Microsoft & Samsung Electronics combined. It\u2019s US$1.1 trillion dollars value is much more than Microsoft, which is worth US$863 billion dollars & Samsung, which has a market cap of US$372 billion dollars.Though Bill Gates (co-founder of Microsoft) is much more known globally than both Steve Jobs (co-founder of Apple) & Lee Byung Chul (founder of Samsung) but it is Apple & it\u2019s products most notably being iPhone which are much more popular with consumers rather than Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phone.Apple is worth much more than GDP of some countries like : Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, Canada, Switzerland, etc\u2026\u2026.",
