            "answer_text": "The Internet can never truly be free! There are resources being used to keep the internet up and running (bandwidth charges, data servers, maintenance etc.) and that's exactly why the internet can never be in a fiscal sense. All these schemes like free data for a month an all are just an illusion. Remember, if you are not paying for some product, You Are The Product! But for the sake of the question\u2026 Let's assume some generous aliens drop by and set us up with free internet services, here's what will happen: Cellular companies go bankrupt. And to mitigate losses, they'll have to compromise on their policies. They may sell their data to the third party. I don't like the feeling of it.Having such a great income source fallen, the economy suffers increasing prices of other products.People WILL go exhausted soon of the internet but at that point, they'll be addicted to the dopamine loop. They'll be miserable but won't be able to help themselves.And sooner or later\u2026 There'll be some religions born, supporting or opposing the internet itself. And history already has told us what happens when religion gets involved.You may think why I'm negative, I'm not! I'm practically speaking, even though we'll thrive either way.. the picture which I have in mind is scary. Peace. ",
