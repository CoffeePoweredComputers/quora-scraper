            "answer_text": "With how volatile the cryptocurrency market is, the answer is anyone\u2019s guess. Yet, many people in the cryptosphere love to speculate on just how high the prices of their favorite coins may rise. Before i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world. The website is IBUYCRYPTO (www.ibuycrypto.store). It is safe and secure. The interesting part of it is that, you don\u2019t have to drop your vital informations before you sell to them. You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform. We scoured the web to find out what the big names in the industry have predicted the Bitcoin price will be in the near future. Moreover, we reached out to experts in the space to see what their opinions were on the matter. The answers we gleaned vary wildly\u2014by 2020, some say 1 BTC will be worth $30,000, and some say it will be $1 million (read on to find out what this person will do if he is wrong\u2026!) It\u2019s important to note that while many of these experts have used quantitative research and modeling to come to their respective price predictions, the cryptocurrency market is still incredibly volatile. Since it is all wild speculation, remember to take these predictions with a grain, or perhaps a barrel, of salt. Only time will tell us who was way off mark, and who predicted correctly, if anyone! Sam Doctor, Quantamental Strategist at Fundstrat Global AdvisorsWe expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple. Source Thomas Lee, Co-Founder and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global AdvisorsWe still feel pretty confident that bitcoin is a great risk-reward and we think it could reach $25,000 by the end of the year. Source John McAfee, Founder of McAfee AssociatesWhen I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "The math behind it Is this really possible? Bitcoin needs to grow at a rate of 0.484095526 % per day from 2017-07-17 to 2020-12-31 to get from $ 2,244.27 to $ 1,000,000.00. That is the red line on the above chart. As long as the blue line is above the red line, we are on target. Hover over the chart to get daily prices. Compared to the enormous price changes, half a percent does not sound like much to you? This is the magic of exponential growth. That parabolic curve - seriously? When you zoom out, the curve gets steeper and steeper. Relax! Growth curves look like that. Take the Dow Jones, a savings account with interest or bacteria growing in a petri dish. With a fixed percentage per time, rising from 1 to 10 takes as long as from 100,000 to 1,000,000. Both is the growth by a factor of 10. That is why many analysts like to look at charts with a logarithmic scale where the y-axis scales in orders of magnitude. Why would it grow? Bitcoin is scarce. There will only be 21 Million BTC. If every Millionaire in the world wants one, there are not enough for every one to have a whole BTC. More people adopting and buying bitcoin will raise the price. This technology is still at a relatively early stage. Think the internet in the mid-nineties when the majority thought it was only for nerds and had no real use. The market capitalization of bitcoin is still tiny, compared to gold, credit cards or the stock market. Such an expensive currency! You can buy and spend fractions of a bitcoin. Sooner or later, it will make sense to use a unit like microbitcoin aka bits (One Millionth of a Bitcoin) and Satoshis (One hundredth of a bit). Then a bit will be a Dollar and a Satoshi will be a Cent. How does something like '1 \u03bcBTC is $ 1.07'or '1 Satoshi is $ 0.01' sound to you? A lot less expensive, right? Maybe people will start calling a microbitcoin just bitcoin. No big deal. When we say calorie, we actually mean a kilocalorie. What can go wrong? Though bitcoin has proven to be secure and many people put their trust in it, there is still a lot that can go wrong. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose! Bitcoin could go to zero and many people think so. Is bitcoin wasting electricity? Mining bitcoin is hard on purpose. The so called proof of work is what controls the money supply and what makes the ledger tamper resistant. Bitcoin is both a currency and a ledger for storing all transactions. Gold would not have much value if it were easy to find or if it were cheap to create. A ledger that was easy to tamper with would not be trustworthy. The bitcoin ledger is called blockchain and the entries are bundled into so called blocks. Supercomputers all over the world are competing to find the next block. All these miners do not trust each other and reject invalid blocks. Someone trying to tamper with the blockchain would need an incredible amount of computing power and electricity to overpower all the others. What about CO2 -emissions? Many miners are located in places with a surplus of electricity (geothermal power in Iceland, hydroelectric or solar power in the middle of nowhere). It is cheaper to send a bitcoin-block over the internet than building more power lines. Still not convinced? Think for a minute how complicated the current fiat banking system is and you will agree that bitcoin is a lot more efficient. ",

            "answer_text": "While I completely understand the allure of being able to foretell the future, either accurately, approximately or in any manner at all, I am not sure why people would believe that it can actually be done! Somewhere along the way, many aspiring traders have come to believe that \u201cwhen you know what you are doing\u201d, you can predict the future of how a stock, a currency, or a commodity will perform. Think about it for a minute\u2026 \u2026while I have a pretty fair idea of what I will be doing tomorrow, next week, next month, etc., the proverbial \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d can mess up my best made plans. I could get sick, the car could break down and, since I live in Minnesota, I can\u2019t begin to count the number of times when a blizzard screwed up my day\u2026and the list goes on. And this is in my own life \u2026 where I really have a lot of control. How about in the financial markets? Where I have absolutely NO control! Prediction? Not a chance\u2026 The above being said, here is my response, which I have posted before, to questions such as these\u2026 Plug in your market instrument of choice\u2026Bitcoin, Oil, Gold, S&P 500, pork bellies\u2026 So, you want to know if an event in the future - the gain/crash of Bitcoin in this case - is going to happen? And, you want to know not only if it is going to gain/crash, but also the year in which it will gain/crash\u20262020 in this case. That\u2019s a pretty tall order!! Here\u2019s a favorite quote of mine on this topic\u2026 \u201cPredicting is very difficult\u2026especially when it involves the future.\u201d Traders and mankind in general have been trying to foretell the future - accurately - since time immemorial. I am sure there was some cave man out there trying to predict the migration patterns of the woolly mammoth so his family would know where their next meal was coming from!! Traders, economists, market gurus, etc., can make all kinds of fancy prognostications about if this happens, then that will happen and various currency pairs, commodities, or cryptocurrencies will do this, that and the other thing. Bottom Line: No one knows anything that will happen in the future with any certainty. There is no crystal ball. Sure, some educated guesses can be made but that\u2019s precisely what they are - GUESSES!! The educated guesses may tilt the odds of success in one direction or another, but again, nothing is an absolute \u201clock\u201d. Unquestionably there are many opinions on how to trade news events/announcements, price action and each trader can decide which is best for them. The school of thought to which I subscribe centers around this quote: \u201cNothing happens until it happens.\u201dSo my trading plan is not to try and predict what may happen; but rather, react to what is happening. In a nutshell, wait until an event takes place - if Bitcoin crashes, let it crash\u2026if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. Then, let the volatility occur and let the market react and kind of shake itself out a bit as it absorbs and interprets the news. Then, when a continuation move (trend) presents itself on your chart time frame of choice, a higher probability trade can be made. In my opinion this affords the trader a much greater chance of success as opposed to trying to predict a move ahead of time. Sure you may miss out on the initial (riskier) part of the move, but the potential for success is increased beyond that of a mere coin flip\u2026 Please let me know if you have any questions on the above or other aspects of trading the FX market\u2026 All the best and good trading, Richard Krivo RKrivoFX@gmail.com Please visit my YouTube channel at\u2026 Richard Krivo ",

However, I am a bit hesistant as of last few days. Why? For a price incease to happen, Fiat need to come in. The coronavirus did make the prices go up, or so is the conventional wisdom and belief. But now with the coronavirus becoming more likely to cause a pandemic (Italy, Iran, South Korea now affected as well), then it can have a drastic effect on the world economy, that could have an impact of Fiat investments in Bitcoin. It could happen that investments increase, but I belieev that the safe haven effects of Bitcoin goes only so far: a bit of turmoil: good for BTC, but a pandemic that would effect the world economy? That could be just to much of turmoil and BTC could sink. Say people in SK for instance will be under curfews, and less work, income and liquidate BTC to stay afloat. Increase of BTC on the market, and less to buy i.e. negative for price development. Same with larger investors. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is a predicted or projected high for Bitcoin in 2020?\u201d Personally, I find questions that ask \u201cwhat is the high\u201d or \u201cwhat will the highest value\u201d of bitcoin be, to be disturbing, because those questions come with some huge and improper assumptions \u2014 such as:the assumption that bitcoin should be measured in terms of its value or worth to another currency. (It should not be, though it may be when it is traded on open markets \u2014 but this price is always whatever the markets will allow, as the different prices across exchanges demonstrate, especially with variability in supply and liquidity.)the assumption that bitcoin should be measured in terms of its value in relation to USD by default, or the EUR. This is often an implicit assumption with such questions about \u201cprices\u201d or \u201chighs\u201d and it is unfortunate to see such a strong focus on fiat currency valuations of cryptosystems used as currency. With some work, we can largely discard this focus and choose better ways of worth (a difficult, but not impossible challenge).The question asks, \u201cWhat is a predicted or projected high for Bitcoin in 2020?\u201d The term Bitcoin (with a B) refers to usage of the protocol -- the protocol, payment network, and ecosystem as a whole, whereas bitcoin (with a b) refers to units of currency. Given that the question asks what the projected high for Bitcoin will be in 2020, the proper answer is not related to price of currency (and thus should not be expressed as \u201cprice in USD\u201d or other currency), but rather is derived from the innovations we will see in 2020 from the Bitcoin world. These include, in part:Taproot, Schnorr, and related privacy initiatives which will increase efficiency while making most transactions look alike.Solutions based entirely on Bitcoin that are designed expressly to solve ownership and income problems in society (see Reference item (2)).Smart contract advancements based in part upon code which has long been present in Bitcoin but which only recently has been made light of by a larger development community.An interested institutional and legislative community which in some states (following Wyoming's example) will develop (USA) state laws (and potentially work to improve some of the more troublesome federal ones) so as to make the legal landscape more welcoming for innovators and developers.A substantially higher degree of mobile adoption across Latin America and Africa.Projects such as Lightning (lnd), distinct from Bitcoin but helpful to it, will help drive adoption. In 2020, such value adds will continue with sidechain developments that allow atomic cross-chain trading, thus eventually reducing the need individuals will have for customary trading methods online.Bitcoin now finds itself (via the Blockstream satellite system, and the SpaceChain system) broadcast through space. These are a few of the censorship-resistance methods which are now already existing in 2020. The future will see this envelope pushed even further as the nascent Bitcoin protocol escapes terrene boundaries entirely while also eventually being managed by purposeful A.I.s (artificial intelligence units) whose role it will be to propagate and defend the transmittal of the data.As a standard for measurement of Bitcoin worth: for 2020, I have suggested that the value of Bitcoin is equivalent to new usage (both new users and innovation leading to new uses of Bitcoin) and that increases in adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency shall also provide an indicator of value, independent of comparisons to fiat.

            "answer_text": "Here is a part of my article in 2019: \u201cAs the end of 2019 came, the third halving of bitcoins in 2020, which is expected to be happened on May 15th,2020, is closer and closer. Since 2012, the halving of bitcoins happens every 4 years, of which consequence is that the 10mins output of bitcoins reduces by half every 4 years, After the third halving, the block reward of bitcoins every 10mins will reduce from 12.5 bitcoins to 6.25 bitcoins. The total volume of bitcoins is 21,000,000, and there are currently about 18,000,000 bitcoins in existence. The halving of the block rewards will lead to the situation that the time length of bitcoins enter into circulation will be longer. The limit of bitcoins supply caused by the halving will also make the scarcity of the bitcoin more prominent. To the bitcoin price, it is obvious a BULL signal. Will the halving push the bitcoin price to rise? The most important concerns from normal investors. In fact, the extremely bull market came out after the 2 halvings happened before. The halving of bitcoins is really capable of boosting the bitcoin price rising sharply. Without exaggerating, the halving of bitcoin is one of the important catalysts to the BULL market again. Besides the normal investors, miners are also watching closely to the bitcoin price. Now, the budget for bitcoin mining is getting more and more expensive. What is more, the competition of the hash rate and the fluctuation of the bitcoin price cause the income of bitcoin mining unstable. With the factors of the halving of bitcoins and the upgrading of the bitcoin miner, the budget of bitcoin mining is much more expensive than before. If the bitcoin price is lower than it, the whopping budget would cause miners to shut down the machines and lose all their investment in bitcoin mining.

I bet on Bitcoin from start, and glad I did, but no one predicted a run up to near $20,000. in 2017, as well, no one predicted a massive correction back to recent $3,000. range.
