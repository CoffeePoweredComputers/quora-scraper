            "answer_text": "No. Not only would the technology and the records needed to have been lost but all physical evidence along with it, because all the mysterious stuff left behind is well within our capability to recreate either faster or to a higher standard or both. We might not be quite sure how Mayans dressed stone as neatly as they did but we could certainly do it even better now. We might not be sure how the megaliths of Stonehenge were moved around but we can shift far heavier loads around. We might not understand exactly how the Nazca Lines were created but we could easily do larger and more complex versions now if we wanted. We might not know for certain how the pyramids were built but you can be absolutely sure that if we can build a habitable tower over half a mile high we could certainly recreate the largest pyramid the ancient Egyptians ever managed, and probably make one a lot bigger if we chose. Any obstacles are usually economic rather than technological: why would anyone want to built a bloody great pyramid now? But tell any of those ancient people that we could fly around the world in a day at the height of the highest mountains or that there\u2019d be a metal building in space that was travelling faster than a bullet from a rifle\u2026 and then you showed them a rifle and how fast a bullet goes\u2026 yeah, if you did that they\u2019d be absolutely incredulous and marvel at how people ever learned to do that. Unless they thought it was all witchcraft and murdered you to death. ",

            "answer_text": "There are folkloric tales of ancient gods, heroes, and nations that performed mighty deeds. While they carry much cultural significance, in the end they are ancient versions of the comic book heroes of today. Many people like to speculate that those ancient tales are literally true. They aren't. When people point at megalithic (large stone) structures as examples of inexplicable technology, they are reasoning that if we do not understand how they were built, some kind of magically advanced technology must have been involved. Actually, we don't know how they were built because our ancestors figured out a long, long time ago that there were easier ways to build than moving really big stones around. It is also the case though, that while ancient people may have been ignorant by our standards, they were not stupid. In the field of experimental archeology a number of trials have been performed to show that people using clever but simple techniques can move large stones far more easily than we have thought. Yes, we did lose that technology, but It was not supreme to ours. ",

            "answer_text": "I really-really doubt it. The technology of olde would still have had to conform to the laws of physics and the rules of engineering that we have today. And our understanding of these laws and rules today is infinitely better than what we had 100 or 1000 years ago. So, I have significant doubt that the technology of olde in any ways could have in principle been better than what we have now. Now, some things done in the past could be of superior quality even to what is commonly available today. That\u2019s because the maker of it were not subject to the same constraints of time and money that a manufacturer of today would be. Plus, we also have to separate the myth of some ancient tech from the reality of it. I.e. many things like the efficacy of \u201cmagical\u201d swords of the past have been greatly exaggerated. The issue here being that it were totally possible to have a proper steel sword back in the bronze age. Even if you were producing small quantities of iron as an exotic thing, not enough for everyone - steel in very small quantity would be a byproduct. And out of that steel one could make something. And you can imagine how superior that one of a kind artefact would be to a bronze sword that a commoner might have. Not to mention that people would just lie like in the case of the \u201cGreek fire\u201d to impress their enemies. ",

I assume that by the word technology you mean scientific knowledge behind things and it's application and not related to technical, digital, Or machinery knowledge. Yes I believe that much of the past knowledge has been lost, may be because it wasn't recorded or the resources might have lost their existence. But definitely not all the resources are lost. We can find many archeological, monumental, literature and Stories and other such things that hint that the technology and the knowledge floating in that era. It is very advanced and also complex. And knowledge that our generation has, is what actually borrowed from the previous generation and is mainly the advancement and complexion of the past knowledge. The Structure, organisation, order, mechanism, everything meant for a purpose but the scientific reason behind it was not clear. The research then was not well planned and organised and also may not be completed too. But they are either but recorded or may be lost due to natural occuring or anything. Also, I feel that in the past people were not likely to share the knowledge except among their own community and sharing some information was also against their tradition and punishable in some. It is also that they might have felt that there would be no point in sharing the knowledge as their previous generation haven't done so. Thus, they might have felt recording the knowledge was unnecessary and also difficult. I think that we also crossed the point of advancement that was there before and the knowledge now is more complex than it ever was and it is based on deep research. ",

He forces the crew onto the planet and goes onto reveal to them that he is none-other but Apollo, the Greek god of truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, and more. He goes onto explain that what humans have considered as Gods and Legends for thousands of years, were actually people from his planet who happened to visit earth millennia ago. It was because of their tall heights, powerful weapons, and because their spaceship\u2019s descended from the sky that humans started to consider them as people from heaven, when in fact they were living beings from another part of the galaxy.   To answer your question now. To me, it's a thought which romances with possibility But if at all sophisticated technology existed in the past there is a very good possibility that it was alien in nature and we humans may have co-inhabited individuals from other planets for centuries at stretch. And when they left earth, they took the technology with them and most of the evidence of it.[1] Footnotes[1] Who Mourns for Adonais? - Wikipedia",

Have you ever seriously ever heard of it.. This requires a special mantra to open . So there is some thing beyond us but for us to unlock ,for that you need the language of all ( Sanskritam- now Sanskrit).
