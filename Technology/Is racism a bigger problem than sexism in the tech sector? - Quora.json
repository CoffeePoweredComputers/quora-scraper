            "answer_text": "It depends at what level. I\u2019m a \u201cbrown\u201d face in \u201cwhite\u201d tech and in my anecdotal experience, as well as the objective stats, sexism is a much bigger problem on the ground than racism is. I\u2019ve encountered white-on-minority racism on the ground once in 20 years. I\u2019ve even seen more minority-against-white racism in that time. Yet, on gender, I\u2019ve seen everything from sexism to an \u201cunfriendly culture\u201d on the ground in pretty much every job I\u2019ve been in. As always, the numbers tell the whole story: Women aged 18 make up less than 25% of tech subject entrants at university. This figure compares to 41% in general science and engineering subjects, like math, physics, structure, mechanical and aeronautical engineering etc.Even by the time of graduation happens, that number is between 13% and 17%. However, the numeric drop is almost exactly the same as males in the subject. Showing universities aren\u2019t the issue.That same number is often reflected in the tech diversity stats published by large tech companies every year. The only exception is twitter, who seem to have a 90% male41% of women leave the tech sector versus 17% of men. This is because of the culture of the companies they\u2019ve worked in.Female pay is 5% to 17% less than the equivalent males (around $6,500 per year to $22,000 in the USA) - the gap is worst in mid-sized firms. Female confidence in asking for a raise is often cited as a reason for this. The question men should be asking is why?Women are less likely to get employed than their white male counterparts, but are more likely to get promoted to senior positions than men of colour or of course, women of colour.\u2026Despite this, 75% of tech firms do not have a gender diverse senior management team (part of that is arguably pipelining lower in the hierarchy)So, how does this compare to race? Race affects the job prospects of all minorities in tech. Yet, this isn\u2019t because of companies, who employ pretty equally. It\u2019s more often because of recruiters, recruitment agencies or recruitment businesses, who, whilst not allowed to discriminate on race, do so regularly.Asian\u2019s make $8,000 a year less than their equivalent white counterparts on average. Hispanics $16,400. Black people $3,650 less than their white counterparts[1]. Note, this includes minority women in the set of course, who get a double whammy.However, race gets to be a worse problem when you look up the scale. Ethnic minorities are 60% less likely to get the investment they need than white counterparts of both sexes.35% of minority founders in SV get no investment at all, despite an equivalent product set launching later by a non-minority and garnering investment.Comparing Floors and Ceilings The key to the latter is the comparison of floor level employees to those in senior positions. GigaOM aggregated big tech stats[2] and found the following: Ranks and file ethnic diversity  Senior management ethnic diversity - makeup of US companies  Similarly with Gender, the distribution is not the same for women as men (purple is women, blue is men)  Summary Now, the issue for women is even worse. Since tech companies based outside the USA and Western Europe (e.g. Alibaba) don\u2019t necessarily have a racial problem or the problem is reverse racism. Those aren\u2019t reflected in american tech figures, because the ethnic minorities in those companies have a heritage from other countries. So I await big tech outside western countries, since there are around 6 billion others in the world. However, the problem with females in tech is universal! This applies across boundaries in all countries. Hence, the problem with gender diversity is much bigger than ethnic diversity simply because the scale of the problem is bigger. Many areas have lower than 10% ethnic diversity. Hence, a workforce that has 10% of it\u2019s staff hailing from an ethnic heritage is fine. Yet, 50% of the world\u2019s population is women and the drop off rate, both in each stage of a lead up to a job, and the exit from the role, are big steps each time. Hence the effect on women is significant and the scale is large. This is compounded by the fact that the user base of almost every tech product out there is 50:50. So companies do not reflect the gender diversity of their user base. Hence, in short, the lack of gender diversity in tech is a much much bigger problem than racism overall, though there are nuanced parts, such as startup investment, where race does peak over.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there is a definite answer, just my personal experience and opinion. Probably changes depending on location in particular. Sexism for me is clearly much bigger. I have had peers from different races on different companies, covering positions from entry-level to CEO. While in the USA I saw a lower rate of black race (not African Americans, as many came from other countries) than the population, the people on that situation were brilliant guys doing well. There was this guy that was a great employee, and a white guy was promoted instead of him; he left the company and did much better, while some of us suffered the bad white manager, but my belief is that the white guy was more of a politician (good for promotion, bad for his reports), not that race was a factor. And on most places I have worked, I have seen a range of skin tones that are as ample as population\u2019s (not similar proportion, so I agree there is some racism problem on some companies) On the other side, I have found too many organizations that have zero or 1 woman in technical positions; while I have also been in a company with 50\u201350 rate, it is quite an exception. When I finished school, we were a 2\u20131 proportion, but in some jobs, I see proportions 30\u20131 to 10\u20131. Considering population is 50\u201350 and student proportions is close, there is no excuse for the level of sexism of such organizations. ",
