            "answer_text": "Unplug things instead of just turning them off. Insulate your toaster. Charge all your electronics in the car or at work instead of at home. Turn off your water heater. Watch TV at your neighbor's house. Use a headlamp instead of room lights. Take the light out of your fridge. Use a microwave instead of the regular oven. Use a windup alarm clock. Use manual tools instead of powered ones. Wear sweaters and turn the heat way down. Insulate your house and heat with cats. Park your diesel powered car in the garage and leave it running 24 hours per day in the winter. Open the window and turn off the ventilation fan when you shower. Install skylights. Wash your clothes in cold water. Switch to all LED lights. Use paper plates and cups so you don't need to use the dishwasher. Make coffee at work not at home. Sell your fish tank. Turn off your security system and don't forget to unplug it. Eat out all the time. Get a roommate and have them pay the bill. Put solar panels under the local streetlights and use them to run appliances at night. Turn off your computer. Get a pedal powered generator and run your tv with it. Clothesline. Candles. Insulation. Weather stripping. Motion sensor lights. Keep your fridge and freezer really full. Turn off the shower while you soap up. Shower in groups. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a huge fan of zero energy housing. The best ways to lower electricity costs are the conventional ways. If you have electric heat then I would start with the heating bill. The cheapest fixes are notably the most effective, namely insulation and shutting off unused sources like the lights. Obscure ways are less effective but worth noting. My favorite is geothermal or microhydro power. Coupled with a dursuperheater hotwater system and the usual suspects, you can get close to zero. Having a bank of good south facing windows and almost no northfacing will not only provide light but solar gain (heat). You will need an absorber (thermal mass) like a concrete floor or water containers. Then heavily insulated curtains when the sun goes down. Wind provides a poor return on investment in most cases. Solar is great, especially if you have a bank of batteries. Net-metering is inefficient as the electric company pays you only a fraction of what you buy it for and some power is lost in transmission. Supplementing your battery bank with a generator, perhaps biodiesel powered, is wise for long periods with little sun. Heavy drain devices should be reduced. These include refrigerators, freezers (especially of they are not full), microwave oven, blender, vacuum and space heaters. An on-demand water heater instead of a tank is often a good switch as well. Edit: for the truly obscure, I would have to say storing heat by having a sub-basement full of thermal mass like rocks, with ductwork running through it. Tidal electricity is a thing if you're near a source. Rainwater collection with a gravity pico-hydro system might work in Seattle. Of course there's always pedal power generators and doing your laundry via barrels of soapy water and a bumpy road. ",
