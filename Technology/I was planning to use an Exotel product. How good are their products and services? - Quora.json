            "answer_text": "Exotel has to be the best telephony solution available right now in India. i tried finding solutions that were customisable to meet our needs at sendit- Online Shipping Marketplace. I found Exotel as the only provider to meet our very different needs. You say them \" I want this and they will say Why don't you try this? It is better\" The sales and support at Exotel are an icing on the cake to there already great product. A special mention to Ananth who was my go to person for anything. Chilling out and goa still helping me out even from there. This has to be commendable service from Exotel. We have been using this for the past 6 months and i can definitely say nothing like Exotel in India right now. There are a few solutions from other  Providers but they are too expensive for startups . Twillio is great Internationally, but not available in india because of the strict rules and regulations of TRAI. Believe me nothing like EXOTEL ",

Have used other cloud telephony products but Exotel has an edge over all the competitors in the market. Will recommend it to everyone as their UI is also very simple to use and very user-friendly.  My recommendation will be to Go for it and turn your business profitable. ",
