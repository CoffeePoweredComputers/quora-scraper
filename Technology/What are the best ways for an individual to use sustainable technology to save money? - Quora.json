            "answer_text": "The possible answers here are legion. First rule: Negawatts before Megawatts.  Find ways to not use energy. Second Rule: Use what you get for free.  If it rains, use water.  If it is drying, use the dryness.  Use the heat capacity of the soil under you, and so on.  Whatever you have, use.  Here, in central Canada, we get winter.  It\u2019s far easier to store winter into the summer than the other way around. Observation:  Technology is intended to save effort, not money.  Seldom is technology going to be the \u2018cheapest\u2019 means of accomplishing something, although it may be the most convenient. ",
