            "answer_text": "My first computer was a Kenbak-1:  which I bought in 1971 for $750. It was a third generation computer (CPU made up of 7400-family logic chips, did not use a microprocessor). Considered by the Computer History Museum and the American Computer Museum to be the world's first \"personal computer\". Only 50 were built; about 14 still exist. I sold mine to a collector about 15 years ago for considerably more than I paid for it. The Kenbak-1 was truly an 8-bit machine, not only did it have an 8-bit data path, but an 8-bit address as well, so it could only address 256 bytes of memory, which was implemented using two 1024-bit shift registers. What it did have going for it (and what appealed to me when I bought it) was a full set of addressing modes, including immediate, direct, indexed, indirect, and indirect-indexed. It had two accumulators (A and B), and an index register X, similar to the 6800 which would be my next CPU. See the eight pushbuttons on the left, four black and four white? That was the sole input mechanism. One would input a starting address, then input the contents for that location, then it would increment to the next address, and you would input data for that location also. The buttons (along with the little lights above them) were arranged in a pattern 2\u20133\u20133 because the documentation used octal notation, popular at the time. There was no assembler. Programs were written out and converted to machine code by hand. They provided a coding sheet to make this a little easier:  I got tired of entering programs by hand all the time, so I added an ASR-33 (Teletype) interface to it, so I could just enter a very short bootloader program and then read programs in off of a paper tape. Since the company included the schematics, and the CPU was made up of discrete ICs, I modified the computer to add an external interrupt facility. I made all the hardware changes using a separate perfboard, so it was easy to remove them before selling it. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201coldest\u201d -or- \u201cmost unique\u201d computer I\u2019ve ever used? Let\u2019s take \u201cprogrammable digital computer\u201d to simplify away from various kinds of analog computers and the abacus, and \u201cwritten a program for\u201d instead of \u201cused\u201d. The \u201coldest\u201d has two candidates (a) the RAND \u201cJohniac\u201d which started working in 1953 (b) the Lincoln Labs TX-2 computer, which dates back to 1956. However I didn\u2019t write programs for these until 1967. The first real programmable computer I wrote programs for was the IBM 1401 in Air Force Air Training Command ca 1961, followed shortly by also programming for ATC\u2019s Burroughs 220 machine. And then a host of others. \u201cMost unique\u201d is harder because so many of the early machine architectures would be considered \u201cunique\u201d by today\u2019s pretty vanilla conventions. For example, looking from today back then, all of the computers I\u2019ve mentioned would be considered \u201cunique\u201d, and they were all very different from each other. For me the most challenging computer on which to write \u201cgood\u201d machine code was most definitely the Control Data 6600 ca 1965 \u2014 it was a parallel machine with multiple operational units and a tiny cache and resequencer that the programmer had to have accurate visualizations of to make worthwhile programs. And then there is microcoding. The most challenging there was the FLEX Machine that Ed Cheadle and I did ca 1967\u20139. This was because the microcode memories available then that could be used for a personal computer were so slow. The remedy was to have a very wide code word (120 bits wide on this machine!) and try to do as much as possible within these 120 bits before having to fetch another code word (yikes!). By contrast, the Xerox Parc Alto had a fast microcode memory with quite nice 32 bit microcode words so just a few little tricks were required. ",
