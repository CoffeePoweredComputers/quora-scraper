            "answer_text": " AI means that machines can perform tasks in ways that are \"intelligent.\" ... Machine learning is technically a branch of AI, but it's more specific than the overall concept. Machine learning is based on the idea that we can build machines to process data and learn on their own, without our constant supervision. ML and AI are completely different. AI is more generic, while ML is more specific which deals with classification, clustering, prediction and other operations. AI deals with images, multimedia data, neural networks, expert systems and other fields which work based on the type of data that you have and also based on what the end result should be. Machine learning has become so associated with statistics, data mining and predictive analytics that some people argue it should be classified as a separate field from artificial intelligence. After all, systems can exhibit AI features like natural language processing or automated reasoning without having any machine learning capabilities, and machine learning systems don't necessarily need to have any other features of artificial intelligence. Here i can recommend some online courses of machine learning and AI offered in India Top Machine Learning Online Courses: #1 Machine Learning A-Z\u2122: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science #2 Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R Top Artificial Intelligence Online Courses: #1 Artificial Intelligence Engineer #2 Artificial Intelligence A-Z\u2122: Learn How To Build An AI ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, the question is not too specific. So, I will provide a general answer. There are three ways you can learn Machine Learning: Pursue a PG course in ML A simple google search will give you the details still to mention a few you can checkout M.Tech. in Machine Learning and Soft Computing at IIST or M.Tech. in Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at M. S. Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences. There are lots of other courses so checkout their syllabus before selecting one. Work under a ML Professor as Research Assistant or JRF Working as a JRF will provide you with the experience of working on exciting projects having machine learning application. Initially it will be tough but you will learn a lot. Plus, if you work as a JRF you usually get an incentive of around Rs 20,000. Later on you can choose to pursue Masters where your research experience and recommendation letter from professor will give you a good chance to earn scholarship. Self Study Online The last and the best resort is to study online. There are lots of courses, videos and materials. Start with introductory material like Andrew Ng\u2019s course or PRML book. Take your time and understand the concepts. There are also good blogs and articles on medium. Also checkout Machine Learning India | Fostering data science and machine learning in India All the best!
