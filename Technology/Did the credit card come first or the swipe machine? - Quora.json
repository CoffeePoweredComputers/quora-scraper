            "answer_text": "The cards that were issued in the 1960s right up to the 1990s had to be processed through a machine similar to the type MArl Weinstock exhibits. These were bulk and high risk since if stolen in conjunction with other cards a fraudulent trader could commit fraud very quickly because the first the correct cardholder would find out was when they received their statement. The only control which was in place was that each card processer/merchant had a \u201cfloor limit\u201d (in the 1960s early 70s \u00a330; later that was raised to \u00a350). However that limit could be \u201creduced\u201d at short notice by the card clearing operations so in effect a person misusing the card or it had been stolen could be caught. This sudden drop in the floor limit as more frequent in banks where money could b drawn against the card (Cash Advance) and many a fraudster was picked up by this as they assumed all branches carried the \u00a350 floor limit. However they didn\u2019t know the branches who had received the reduction instructions from Head Office. Anything over that limit ha to be \u201cphoned though to a clearing centre\u201d and if misuse ha been discovered the Merchant/Bank told to seize the card and call the Police. However the latter didn\u2019t need to be done for account that had just gone over their limit, but there was suspicious use or indeed the card reported as lost /stolen These days , with the advent of \u201cChip \u2019n PIN\u201d in effect every transaction is checked and cleared with an authorisation number. Any cancelled card is picked up immediately an the transaction voided. So the card had to come before the swipe machine; actually they were created together if you are talking about the \u201cimprint machines\u201d. The swipe machine with Chip n PIN was only really viable until the telecoms operations were able to move in to faster transmission that just copper cable; and when the internet came along together with \u201coptic fibre\u201d the systems can pick up fraud faster than the floor limit and roller system.

            "answer_text": "I can't believe this is actually a question. Not because it's a dumb question, but because it makes me feel old\u2026 Credit cards came way before swipe machines. Back in the wild days of the 60s, 70s and 80s, when you bought something with a credit card, they would write up your order on one of these:  It usually had three layers of paper and had carbon paper in between. Later versions, like the above, used carbonless imprinting. Then, they would put your credit card into one of these:  and put the slip on top. You might wonder why many credit cards have the credit card number, expiration date, and your name embossed on them rather than printed. That's because these little doohickeys would imprint that information onto the slips of paper using the raised lettering on the card. One slip went to you (the buyer), one went to the store, and one was sent to the credit card company. In the early 80s, point of sale terminals and \u201cPDQ\u201d terminals started to come into use. Credit card companies began adding a magnetic stripe to their cards which included the same information that was on the card. But it could be read by a computer with just a swipe. Now we're all used to chipped cards and tap to pay, in addition to paying with our phones. But using a credit card used to be a very manual process. ",

Well, they used a different swipe machine like this  You put the card on the machine, put a multi part form over it and swiped the brown thing over the form so that the credit card info got impressed on the form.  Stores had a book listing all the no good card numbers. That meant, of course, that thieves had a few days, maybe a week or more, to use a stolen card instead of just hours. The swipe machine (and the real time processing) were a big advance. ",
