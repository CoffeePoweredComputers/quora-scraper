            "answer_text": "It\u2019s highly unlikely. Star Trek was based on some very old scientific theories which I remember physicists saying later on were impossible. I think it\u2019s technically moved from being a work of \u201cscience fiction\u201d to the similar genera of \u201cspace fantasy\u201d nowadays. It\u2019s a weird technical distinction that few people pay attention to which is why you never hear the term \u201cspace fantasy\u201d thrown around. Some of the societal constructs might work, but to be entirely honest I don\u2019t think many people would like to live in the Star Trek universe. To a lot of people it seems like an idealized socialist fantasy where science has solved all the problems inherent with that system, that\u2019s not really what happened. You mostly see Trek through the lens of an elite pseudo-military organization made up of the brightest and best. People tend to forget what they show of the other side of The Federation, in TNG we see Tasha Yar\u2019s home world which was a dystopian hellhole where she had to flee rape gangs and stuff. In a later episode they visit another Federation world where Picard goes under cover as mercenary and it seems like another urban dystopia. Other worlds we see are full of people like Picard\u2019s brother who exist largely as farmers (I believe he actually had a vineyard). In \u201cEnterprise\u201d we see a little of the hard working lives of those hauling cargo on commercial freighters. Overall it doesn\u2019t paint a great picture of what life in Trek is like for the average person even under The Federation. Star Fleet itself is apparently supposed to be highly elitist and only takes the brightest and best, and apparently there is a lot of competition. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous but Wesley Crusher who was supposed to be a scientific prodigy of ungodly level actually failed to get into Star Fleet the first time if I remember. I mean he was annoying, but he was supposed to be something really special. Basically looking at stuff like that it seems like it\u2019s not a matter of going to the recruitment office and getting a better life where you can explore the galaxy and benefit from all the technology and stuff, you pretty much have to be among the absolute best on your planet. This makes sense overall, but it\u2019s not great news for the every man. I\u2019d personally love to be a Star Fleet Officer, but I don\u2019t have any illusions about making the cut. Of course politics are also a thing even in that era and The Federation for all it\u2019s ideals falls prey to them. I remember them mentioning an initiative to recruit Bajorans into Star Fleet for the express purpose of making nice with the planet and getting it to join The Federation so we sort of had space-age affirmative action and political recruitment. We also had the whole Marquis thing where The Federation basically sold out a bunch of it\u2019s colonies and started a minor civil war, to this day I really have trouble thinking of the Marquis as being bad guys\u2026. basically I guess where I\u2019m going is that the whole political mess could exist in the future, I could easily see that, but that probably isn\u2019t what people want.
