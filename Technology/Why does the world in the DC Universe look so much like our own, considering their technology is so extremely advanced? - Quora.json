            "answer_text": "Is it? Well of course that the world looks pretty much like ours except with the addition of super-stuff is a convention of the genre along with the costumes, secret identities, ineffectiveness of guns and ability of everyone to make complete recovery from dozens of brain traumas. It appeals to the audience to have the stories set in a generally familiar world. And it\u2019s important that supervillains not be something that regular cops and soldiers can handle otherwise there\u2019s no reason for superheroes. So the \u201cadvanced technology\u201d is kept from general distribution by heroes and villains who want to preserve their edge, or is simply impossible to mass produce. Maybe it requires imaginary elements that are in too short a supply to make it economical, or alien components that can\u2019t be locally produced, or the help of actual superpowers to make. ",

            "answer_text": "Status quo and relatability. There a fiction trope called \u201cReed Richards Is Useless\u201d-referring to the point that despite having people on the planet that can travel across space and time, not to mention rebuild reality with the click of a button, the worlds in comics are still like ours. It\u2019s to make the comic characters and settings more relatable to the reader. The worlds are till mostly rooted in reality, while certain cities in DC are entirely fictional and can be messed around with a bit. If these people with these powers and technology actually applied their resources to better the world, these comic Earths could be utopias. All diseases cured, no world hunger-it would be a world of the future; a sci-fi utopia. By keeping the setting more real, the conflicts that fuel the stories can happen. Time and again \u201cwhat if\u201d stories have explored settings where the powered populace actually saved the world. These are usually limited series and one-shots, as they\u2019re just made to show what could happen. ",
