            "answer_text": "Every year brings new inventions. Some permanently change our lives almost overnight, some take time and some disappear as soon as they are patented. Over the last century there have been thousands of patented ideas around the world and whilst we may not notice some of them, many are exciting and completely life changing. 1)Electricity : Could you imagine a day without electricity ?? , Never. Probably one of the single most important things in our lives, if the power of electricity had never been harnessed we wouldn\u2019t have even a fraction of what we have in the world today. No TV\u2019s, no microwave ovens, no computers, no air conditioning and so.  2)Bulbs : If you are not sitting in the dark then you should be thankful to Thomas Edison for inventing the light bulb.  3)Computer and Internet : Computers have changed our lives in so many ways, from landing on the moon to simply browsing the web, none of it would have been possible without them. 25 percent of the world that is 1.7 billion people are using internet today. In the 1960s American defense used a service called ARPANET as a means of the internet and later joined hands with the National Science Foundation to evolve internet.Our life has been made extremely easy all thanks to the internet and the means of communication through social networking sites keeps us.

            "answer_text": "Cleanliness - The modern sewer/waste treatment system, water supply etc. Without the development of cleanliness, the world would still be plagued with epidemics of diseases like cholera and dysentery. We wouldn\u2019t have the ability to have the cities we have today. Just look at how life is in underdeveloped areas of the world where clean drinking water is scarce and waste disposal no-existent. They are rife with malnutrition, illness, infant mortality and shortened lifespans Harnessing electricity - Without the ability to utilize electricity we would never have developed the modern power grid system. No electric lights, which expanded both the work day and leisure time. No computers, no internet, no space exploration. So many inventions in all areas of life, from medicine, to engineering, urban development would never have come about if we hadn\u2019t learned ot harness electricity Cold - Starting with the original use of blocks of ice carved from lakes in winter, and leading to modern refrigeration techniques today, we\u2019ve been able to increase the ability to store food. To transport food from long distances. It\u2019s meant an increased ability to become a more mobile society. No longer tied to a local food source, humanity can spread out and import food from longer and longer distances. And with cryogenics, we\u2019ve opened up whole new areas of medical research, structural engineering. There are any number of world altering inventions that without which life as we know it wouldn\u2019t be the same. But most of them have their roots in some much more basic development or another. If you want to watch a real eye opening series on this topic, try to catch How We Got to Now. It explores these very same themes in a way much better than I can. I caught it on Netflix and learned a great deal about what we owe modern life to. ",
