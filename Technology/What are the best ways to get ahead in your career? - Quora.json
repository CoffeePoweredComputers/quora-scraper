            "answer_text": "People who learn to take responsibility for their actions are eventually picked by the company to lead. So remember everyone screws up. The important thing is to apologize when you are in the wrong. An effective and a sincere apology has three parts a) Acknowledge how your action affected the person b) say you\u2019re sorry c) describe what you\u2019re going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Don\u2019t give excuses.Don\u2019t half ass on any assignments given to you. Regardless of how important or non-important your boss makes it sound, don\u2019t half ass it. You build credibility with consistent output and not one or two big moments.Ask your boss exactly what you are supposed to deliver against for your next promotion. Most people just show up at office without any long term planning. They have no clue why they\u2019re spending 90 hours a week at office except to get their salary. if you want to progress have clear goals and communicate it with your boss. And get clarity on what his/her expectation is of you. This way you have a good reason to ask for your promotion in your next review.Invest in workshops and seminars in your industry instead of buying the next iPhoneDon\u2019t say yes to each and everyone \u2013 even when you are a junior. Take only the work you can realistically do and do it extremely well. That\u2019s the only way you will gain respect. Have a clear work philosophy. Have your do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and express them very clearly to the people you work with. Without a philosophy people will overstep your boundaries, take a dump on you and walk all over you whenever they please. Master the art of saying NO.Read non fictions on management, productivity, personal finance and leadership. Make a habit of it.Make sure your personal life is sorted too if you want to do well in your career. Your personal life and professional lives are not separate. If one of them\u2019s screwed, the other is not going to be extraordinary. Or at least you won\u2019t be able to sustain at an extraordinary level.Pay attention to dressing. Dress not for the job you have, but for the job you want.Invest time to network. If you don\u2019t your career trajectory will stagnate after a point. Network relentlessly within the organization and the industry you work in. Your network is going to determine how big of a jump you will make from your current job. So invest a lot of time networking.Learn to sell yourself. Know that in the corporate world you are a resource. A product. People buy into products that is sold to them in the most attractive way. Your boss is people, your next hiring manager is people, your team is people. So learn the basic principles of sales and marketing and learn to apply some of it to make yourself visible in the organization (and later as you grow \u2013 be visible in the industry) If you are wondering why you haven\u2019t got that promotion even after working 90 hours a week, it\u2019s because people above you don\u2019t see you as an attractive product.",

            "answer_text": "I can summarise it as \u201cYou can only connect the dots backwards.\u201d (Steve Jobs). Let me explain what I mean by this: 1. Change your idea of what \u201cmaking an impact\u201d means I see young people nowadays starting their careers with a lot of enthusiasm, just to become bored and disappointed after a few months, the most common feedback being \u201cI am not making an impact\u201d. But as my ex-colleague at Goldman Sachs Joseph Mauro famously said one day, you have to \u201cstay on the bus\u201d. We can make an impact every day with tiny things, but we tend to discard this as valuable because we reject simple stuff in favour of complex matters. This is also applicable to how we feel. Simple is boring and not sophisticated, and you and I are fun and sophisticated people, correct? Well, you don\u2019t need to feel \u201csophisticated\u201d about your impact. It is more rewarding to change the approach and build your contribution sequentially. Helping our team book meetings, bringing lunch to the desk, mentoring a friend at work\u2026 are all good ways of helping make a better world from a micro perspective. Small and simple things matter, for big things are made of small stuff. Focus on the impact you can make at every step of the way and stop worrying about the impact you think you should be making. 2. Set the right goals at each stage of your career The other day I was talking to one of my students at IE Business School. We were discussing career matters, and he was telling me that he was struggling to make an important decision: become a quant structurer in banking or take a different path in finance. He is in his early twenties. And so I asked: what are the things you can do to help yourself make the best decision? What is holding you back from acting upon that choice? If there was no downside, what would you choose here and now, on the spot? Treating a decision like that as an immediate goal is paralysing. To make that BIG decision you need to gather quality information first: info about the industry, the things you need to master to be successful, devoting enough time to interact with people doing that job, understanding the challenges, the growth path and the typical \u201cday in the life\u201d\u2026 you need to tick off the right \u201cprocess goals\u201d first before you can tackle the \u201cend goal\u201d. The former will take you to the latter. Choose goals that drive you to your ultimate ambitions but make sure you keep moving and acting, not just thinking and planning. Unpack problems and tackle things bit by bit, day after day. Avoid focusing only on the big, longer-term aspirations and keep moving. 3. The \u201creturn on time invested\u201d in growing professionally is not linear People tend to focus on their big goals, without realising that sometimes it takes several years to get the building blocks right. Moreover, the path as you go from breakthrough to breakthrough is never linear. You can never bet on a straight line, but you can surely bet on gradually acquiring the right skills for the future, and keeping a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude and the right work ethics. Those are things that depend on you, so focus on those and let \u201ctime\u201d do the rest. It is a lot more useful to our careers to focus on the process, on doing what needs to be done today, so that we can make progress. Deliberate practice compounds like interest. Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t have the patience to wait for the big pay-offs. 4. Don\u2019t fall for cheap marketing. Discovering your purpose is a lifelong journey As Peter Drucker once said, \u201cSuccessful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values.\u201d I have done many things in life. I think I am on my 7th \u201ccareer stint\u201d at 39 years of age. And I don\u2019t believe I am done yet. Life, for me, was never meant to be a straight line. What keeps me moving is my constant eagerness to learn, and to tackle opportunities that contribute to my skill set and my career capital as I grow. You just don\u2019t follow your passion, you work on it. Discovering your purpose is a lifelong journey, and meaning lies in the path, not the destination. ",
