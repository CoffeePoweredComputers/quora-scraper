This is not exactly about his personal life,but i think this will explain a lot! \" WHY RATAN TATA IS NOT IN THE LIST OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST \"Here is a Real Story of Ratan Tata.So many people around the world want to know that \"What is the NetWorth of Ratan Tata\"?TATA Group is running 96 businesses and out of which 28 Companies arepublicly listed on the various stock exchanges.Tata Group is world's top 50 Group according to Market capitalizationand Reputation.Have you ever thought why Ratan Tata's name is not in the list ofbillionaire's club? why Ratan Tata is not a billionaire on the Forbesmagazine list of billionaire people of the world?The reason is that, TATA Group's 96 companies are held by its mainCompany \"TATA Sons\" and the main owner of this TATA Sons is not RatanTata but various charitable organizations developed and run by TATAGroup.Out of which JRD TATA Trust & Sir Ratan Tata Trust are the main groups.65% ownership of TATA Sons which is the key holding company of theother 96 TATA Group Company is held by various charitableorganizations.So this 65% ownership of Tata Sons Limited is not reflectedon Ratan Tata's personal Financial Statement but on the variouscharitable organizations. and this is the reason why Ratan Tata is notin the list of Billionaire club.if we put this 65% ownership of Tata Sons in Ratan Tata\u2019s own personalfinancial statement then Ratan Tata's Net worth can become more than $70 billion. and that's much more than the Warren Buffet's Current NetWorth of $ 62 billion, the world's richest person according to Forbesmagazine 2008. However, it doesn't mean that Ratan Tata is poor. In one of the interviews hehad told the reporter that, \"I have my own Capital\". He is thechairman of Tata Group so obviously he earns lots of money every yearas a bonus, remuneration and salary. However, Ratan Tata's Net worthis not $ 1 Billion.He is not a billionaire on paper. but in reality he is the richestperson of the world. His net worth in reality is more than Bill Gatesand Warren Buffet.So the good thing about Tata Group is that, They do Charity out oftheir Money...And that is the reason TATA Group has generated so much of Goodwillover last 5 generations...
