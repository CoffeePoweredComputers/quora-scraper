            "answer_text": "The smallest CPU or \u201ccomputer\u201d (ARM-based microcontroller/sensor for medical applications) is as of 2018, is a 0.04 [math]mm^3[/math] 16nW wireless and batteryless sensor system with integrated Cortex-M0+ processor and optical communication for cellular temperature measurement (here compared to a grain of rice):  Picture taken from CNET\u2019s article on it: University of Michigan outdoes IBM with world's smallest 'computer' The computer, which can stand on the tip of a grain of rice, is one-tenth the size of IBM's version. [..] The university on Thursday said its engineers have produced a computer that's 0.3 mm x 0.3 mm -- it would be dwarfed by a grain of rice. While it drew comparisons to IBM's own 1mm x 1mm computer, Michigan's team said the creation is about more than just size. \"We are about 10x smaller so we can fit in smaller spaces,\" David Blaauw, a professor co-leading the project, said in an email statement. \"Also, the IBM computer can't sense its environment -- it can send a code identifying itself but it does not sense its physical environment.\" [..] In addition to the RAM and photovoltaics, the new computing devices have processors and wireless transmitters and receivers. Because they are too small to have conventional radio antennae, they receive and transmit data with visible light. A base station provides light for power and programming, and it receives the data. One of the big challenges in making a computer about 1/10th the size of IBM\u2019s was how to run at very low power when the system packaging had to be transparent. The light from the base station\u2014and from the device\u2019s own transmission LED\u2014can induce currents in its tiny circuits. I.e. there where two world-record-sized \u201ccomputers\u201d in 2018, and the ARM-based one is 1/10 the size of the former world record. World's smallest computer section at Microcontroller - Wikipedia The device is 1/10th the size of IBM's previously claimed world-record-sized computer from months back in March 2018,[7] which is \"smaller than a grain of salt\",[8] has a million transistors, costs less than $0.10 to manufacture Both (and IBM\u2019s) I guess the above ARM-based (while I don\u2019t know the clock rate) and below ARM-based, same \u201cCortex\u201d, that you can buy already since 2014, are more powerful than the ARM in the original desktop computer it came with, that had less then 30,000 transistors and was measured in centimeters: Freescale makes the world's smallest ARM controller chip even tinier just unveiled the KL03, the new world's smallest ARM microcontroller. At 1.6mm by 2mm, the Cortex-M0+ chip is 15 percent smaller than its ancestor. That's miniscule enough to comfortably fit inside the dimple of a golf ball, folks.

            "answer_text": "Perhaps more concerned about technology news, I think of the microcomputers that IBM showed before, with nearly a thousand transistors built in, which can be used as a data source for blockchain activities. Its manufacturing cost is less than $0.10, and IBM compared it to minerals at the time, which is a micro level.  However, according to Engadget, the University of Michigan has refreshed the record of the smallest computer. This temperature sensing device is only 0.04 square millimeters, and only 1/10 of IBM's size can be used to detect changes in body cells because scientists have a guess. Yes, tumor cells will be a little hotter than normal cells. The researchers put together a new \"computer\" and a grain of rice, and you can see huge differences through the pictures. It is said to be a computer because it is equipped with a processor based on the ARM Cortex M0+ design as the main unit for controlling and outputting sensing data. Because of the mini size, light can also affect the current, so scientists replaced the diode with a switched capacitor and tried to reduce the electrical noise.  ",
