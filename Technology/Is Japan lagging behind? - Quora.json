            "answer_text": "(It was suggested that my comment to another user's answer be posted as a separate answer, so here it is.) The perception and reality of Japan are often at odds. The country is indeed lagging in a number of areas. One could write a book. In fact, an excellent book about this very question was written several years ago: Dogs and Demons, by Alex Kerr. Although somewhat dated in the details, the overall picture he paints hasn't significantly changed. At 432 pages, I can't offer a synopsis here. Rather, I'll briefly give my opinion on an area in which Japan is perceived at home and abroad as a leader, but in reality lags. That area is robotics.  This was proven sadly true during the Fukushima disaster.  First off, I'll acknowledge the absolute vagueness of the question. Secondly, I'll point out that the question doesn't seem to imply that anyone has \"decided\" that Japan might be lagging behind (as a another commenter stated). \"Is Japan lagging behind?\" Vague but straightforward. Let's be objective, rather than try to defend or promote. Although the question is vague, it's certainly legitimate in view of the economic difficulties and stagnation that Japan has experienced in the past 25 years. Abroad, Japan is now perceived as an economic laggard, so it isn't surprising that those who don't live here might be interested in whether it's true in other areas as well . However, I won't get into the state of the economy. Volumes have been written. It is not improving, and shows no signs of doing so. \"'The Japanese like to put a face on things, to make them look like a humans or animals. It\u2019s more done for entertainment value than real practicality,' says Joseph Engelberger the \u201cfather of the robotics industry\u201d on Japan\u2019s robots. 'They should be able to do more.'\" Engelberger was referring to the lack of useful robotic technology during the Fukushima meltdown. The lack of purpose-built robotics was a serious impediment to assessing the severity of the problems at Fukushima.  Robots have failed Fukushima Daiichi and Japan The Fukushima disaster pretty clearly exposed the real deficiencies of so-called \"advanced\" robotics in this country. So yes, Japan lags in robotics in spite of the mistaken perception that they lead in that area. Yes, Japan is one of the world's leaders in robotics if you want a cute robotic puppy or a dancing waiter. They've clearly done a fine job of that. \"... in a nation renowned for its robotics research, many here are asking why the remote-controlled machines had to be imported. Critics say Japanese scientists have wasted too much of their expertise developing such gimmicky technology such as robots that can sing, dance and play musical instruments rather than more practical versions that could have been put to use in a national emergency.Even after a 1999 accident at a nuclear plant in which two workers died of radiation exposure, Japan's nuclear power industry has been slow to invest in the development of radiation-resistant robots, research scientists here say.\" Japan nuclear crisis, robots: Japan looks abroad for high-tech help at Fukushima plant Some may say that there has never been a need for that sort of \"useful\" robot in Japan, but that is also simply not true. There had been a clear need for robots useful during such emergencies for quite some time prior to Fukushima, but the need was ignored, for a variety of reasons, none of which is particularly valid in view of the huge impact Fukushima and previous nuclear \"incidents\" have had. The simple fact that robots had to be borrowed from abroad does indeed illustrate the lag in robotics. Useful robotics. ",

            "answer_text": "Lagging behind... in what, exactly?  Behind in cutting edge technology?  Not if the number of Nobel laureates is your chosen measurement.   Behind in popular culture?  Japan never intended to lead it- Japan's specialty is reacting, counter punching, reverse engineering and bringing its own flavor(s) to the world's table.   Behind in world economics?  Please show me a different 127 million people who are as comfortable and satisfied with their current economic status.  Behind in education?  Please consider as many different measurements as you can and tell me where, exactly? Behind in sports?  Considering recent success in soccer, baseball, volleyball, tennis, marathon running, swimming, judo and ping pong, how much is enough? Behind in future potential?  Please show me a country better positioned to thrive in the 21st and 22nd centuries. I'd like to know who has decided that Japan might be lagging behind, and on what basis. The population is falling, true enough, but that's not a brake on the quality of life.  As one of the world leaders in robotics, that's much less of a problem here as compared to the rest of the G7 or G20.  Clearly the First World needs to ask itself, \"How much is enough?  And how good is good enough?\"  If Japan is lagging in anything, it is arguably lagging behind in its aid to the developing world.  In a world where only 1 in 4 people  has a safe water supply, hygienic toilets, housing adequate to protect from normal weather and the chance to sleep secure from threat of wild animals or war, just how much really is enough?
