            "answer_text": "Oneplus 7 Pro is great phone at its price $669, it offers amazing display + stunning design + powerful performance. Some highligted features of Oneplus 7 Pro - Powerfull Qualcomm snapdragon 855 + 6/8/12 GB ram with World's fastest UFS 3.0 storage which means the oneplus 7 Pro have the fastest app read and write speed in the market. Stunning 6.67 QHD +, 90HZ display, which is almost bezel less, the 90HZ display means the whenever you touch the screen you will get the instant and smooth response. And seriously its amazing. The cameras - the oneplus 7 Pro comes with the triple rear cameras the main lens is 48MP with wide angle lens and 3\u00d7 zoom lens. The performance of the oneplus 7 Pro's cameras is just good not something which blow you away . It's camera is inconsistent sometimes it brings over exposure in photos . Over all I would say the camera is just good. Same for the front pop up 16 MP camera . Battery life - the oneplus 7pro comes with huge 4000mah battery which supports warp charge 30, according to the oneplus, oneplus 7 Pro should be charge to o to 50 percent within 20 minutes. But you need to understand that the 7 Pro has a 90HZ display, which consumes more battery than the 60 HZ display. So you can't expect great battery life from the 7pro. But the good news is that you can manually through the the settings change the resolution and refresh rate. So you can save some of battery life on your oneplus 7 Pro. Price - as I mentioned, the oneplus 7 Pro starts from $669 , and it is truely unbeatable at this price. Why you should choose it over XR & 10e - there is no doubt that the both Samsung galaxy s10e and iPhone XR , are the great smartphone at their respective price. But when you are looking for a smartphone which cost you less and give you more value for money then their is currently no other choice than the oneplus 7 Pro. ",
