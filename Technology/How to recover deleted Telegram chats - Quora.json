            "answer_text": "The Google Chrome extension to save Telegram chats, mentioned in another answer to this question, is a good way to follow. Yet, there\u2019s another cool way to do so. A fan of Telegram made use of Telegram Web, few keyboard keys, and Save as PDF feature of Google Chrome. Well, I will stop the writing now and redirect you to the webpage that explains it in a detailed, step by step way. Here it is: Exporting your chat conversations as .PDF  Note that this isn\u2019t an official way, but it doesn\u2019t involve a third party as well, so you can work with it to take the backup. But, a word of advice - you don\u2019t need to take backup of Telegram Chats because of they are saved in Cloud Storage. :) And second note: The link above tells you to tick the Selection only but this will disable the visibility of profile picture and images shared in the chat. So, if you want to backup images in the chat then un-tick it. ",

More so if you do it for the person with whom you are chatting in the next 48 hours. The only option you have is to check the chats of the person with whom you are chatting with.
