            "answer_text": "Diplomatic resolution requires bilateral will to resolve the issue. It is only the war that can be launched unilaterally. As regards the Armenian-Azerbaijani negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) conflict under the mediation of OESC Minsk Group, any room for the diplomatic resolution of conflict thereunder is exhausted now because of: The Azerbaijani ultimatum-like stands on every discussed issue and the Azerbaijani threat by war turned into the only Azerbaijani \u201cargument\u201d in the negotiations, being feeded by the Turkish military adventurism & abundant military supplies to Azerbaijan by Russia, Turkey & Israel;Failure of mediators, namely Russia, USA, and France, to ensure their own claims on non-acceptability of military resolution of conflict with any real efforts to enforce the peace to the Azerbaijani warmonger.On 27.09.2020, Azerbaijan & Turkey launched a full-sized military aggression against Artsakh & Armenia to \u201cresolve\u201d the conflict by extermination of indigenous people of Artsakh and military occupation of Artsakh territory. Thereby Azerbaijan violated the negotiation premises and practically ceased from the negotiations for diplomatic resolution of conflict. On 21.10.2020, after total failure of mediators to stop and punish the Azerbaijani aggressor who violated the mediators\u2019 claim on non-acceptability of military resolution, Armenia officially ceased from the negotiations, their premises and pre-agreements. It is expected that Armenia will recognize the Republic of Artsakh in the coming days. I.e., next negotiations, if any, will be launched with a clean slate and under the new reality: Artsakh independence & sovereignty is a fact and no more subject to negotiations, and Artsakh government shall be the major side of any negotiations related to Artsakh. From my perspective, one of the major reasons of failure of the diplomatic resolution was the excessive internationalization of the negotiations involving lots of diverse mediators & influencers with contradicting intentions, who rather promoted own interests than contributed to the negotiations. To be successful, any negotiation shall immediately involve the conflicting parties with the mediation of minimum number of mediators capable to enforce peaceful resolution and counteract the third-parties\u2019 interferences into the negotiations.

It has been 30 years since the invasion so I don\u2019t think it is possible via diplomatic route as Armenia has proven it by attacking civilian territories while the armistice(humanitarian) was negotiated and in effect. Armenia doesn\u2019t want peace they just want the lands. Azerbaijan must reclaim her lost lands on the field and force the opposing parties to reprimand the losses of war and hojali genocide. Azerbaijan is not an invader there, they are just trying to reclaim their invaded territories. ",

Armenia wanted Russia, Azerbaijan also wanted Turkey. Armenia wouldn\u2019t agree on that, despite the fact that Turkey has many citizens of Armenian origin, some are very successful, including celebrities and Parliament members, and migrating workers from Armenia that come to Turkey for work and send remittances back to Armenia. Now that the military solution is taking place, and the Azerbaijani side is making a significant progress, it would not be interested in negotiations, for as long as it is making progress and likely regaining all the occupied lands back. There\u2019s a possible scenario where Russia will \u201cforce\u201d everyone to the negotiations table, but if it comes to that, Azerbaijani side will have a leverage and get all of its original conditions, including Turkish peacemakers\u2019 presence.

This solution is rejected categorically by Armenia, because the population is (and was) overwhelmingly Armenian and it would be highly problematic with regard to human rights, because Azerbaijan is a chauvinist-nationalist dictatorship and there a no signs that will be protection for that big Armenian minority under Azerbaijan rule.Artsakh/Karabakh could be become an \u201c\u00e5landised territory\u201d in Azerbaijan (\u00c5land). That means that Artsakh/Karabakh would have absolut and unquestioned cultural autonomy, supervised by CoE and/or OSCE.So, the \u201csolutions\u201d 1. and 2. would not work, the international community should work towards the third solution - no matter whether Alijev and Erdogan like it or not.
