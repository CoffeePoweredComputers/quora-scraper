He, on the surface, doesn\u2019t kowtow to the status quo, moves to better America and Americans, doesn\u2019t cotton to the Swamp and fights Communism and the unrelenting Left every day. Tech owns everything. How in the hell have they benefited anymore than they already have except by being left alone to shut down everything that approves of Trump or the Right! High Tech Executives are wealthier than most third world country despots and , in point of fact wealthier than some small countries! Did they earn it? Did they deserve it? Yes and even more. It is just too bad that their ideology follows with the Progressive and Commie Left! We live in interesting times and may not much longer! ",

Because if he is not and either stays in the WH or the people message is unclear, we won't know what benefits tech has seen relative to the before Trump and after Trump. The measured need to include; cash flow, revenues, employment, new product launches (very hard to measure) and rate of stock price change as compared to other sectors globally. ",
