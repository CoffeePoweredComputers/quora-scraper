            "answer_text": "That depends: negatively or positively? Negatively Teenagers are often cyberbullied. Or, they are the ones cyberbullying. Hurting other people online has become so big, especially through the use of social media and catfishing. It makes it so much easier to hurt people when you aren\u2019t seeing people face to face.Teens are somewhat very gullible. Often reading whatever comes up, they will believe it. Unfortunately, many teens are ignorant when it comes to stuff happening around the world. When they see something on social media and read it, they may think it\u2019s true, when it\u2019s often fake news.Social media is setting high expectations. Celebrities are showing themselves off, and because they are \u2018celebrities\u2019, teens often want to look and act like them. Celebs are often seen as role models, making teenagers thinking they have to make a goal of being like a celebrity.Positively The internet is far, far ahead, and way more advanced than ever. Teens have everything at their hands, which means they can search up anything, and ask questions without asking a person and instead of getting the opinion of many different people.Teenagers are educating themselves online, believe it or not! Even if not many people understand their humor or their \u2018memes\u2019, most are educational and have a good point. I think I have learned far more useful things online from \u2018memes\u2019 than I have in school.Teens can make a difference! Teenagers can support their causes and give their opinions online. They can know more about, for example, climate change, and support the movement. The internet allows them to be connected and informed!I hope this helped. I\u2019d say anyone growing up with the internet would be very affected, seeing as how most people have it right at their hands. ",
