            "answer_text": "Voice Over Internet Protocol. VOIP is essentially digitized phone messaging, used with the internet, on cellphones, and also home phones marketed all the cable companies now. Traditional phone still uses a version Alexander Graham Bell and another guy from France discovered in the late 1800s. If you understand that voip is a series of digital packets exchanged between callers, that are voice originally converted to zeroes and ones, i.e. data, then transmitted to phones that, like computers, have programs that convert them back to the original voice., If you understand that, you understant that everything on a computer is expressed in zeroes and ones, which can be converted by programs, into speech, data, movies, tv, or email and text messages. That\u2019s all computers are is translators and exchangers of data expressed in zeroes and ones, via programs that handle that. On a computer, all the separate kinds of data, will automatically summon the correct programs to translate them. Cell phones and voip phones all simply trade data, often as conversation on cell phones and voip phones. Cell phones are not VOIP but operate similarly. Most major cable companies are now offering cellphone service as well as voip. You can .operate a voip phone- I have a free one, google voice, over a phone company internet, even using the three wire setup all traditional telephone companies still use. Those companies are very much like cable companies now, and would drop the three wires instantly if it weren\u2019t so expensive to do it, and also because three wire telephone receives a government subsidy for their service, without which tradish telephone would be unprofitable. Few people understand how similar cable and telephone ALWAYS WERE. The phone company owners knew and originally got into cable tv. Eventually the US government forced them to sell those holdings. That\u2019s how I got into cable. With partners I bought a cable company. Later the federal government allowed telephone to get back into the cable business. Except for AT&T, the practice isn\u2019t widespread. AT&T bought TCI Cable from John Malone in roughly 2000, but probably couldn\u2019t find a way to pay its dividend using cable economics. They quickly sold the former TCI to Comcast, which is now one of the biggest cable companies operating in the US. Malone\u2019s family meanwhile, controls Spectrum, which, for awhile was owned by Bill Gates\u2019 Microsoft partner Paul Allen, who owned most of Charter at first. ",
