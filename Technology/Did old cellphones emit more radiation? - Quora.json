            "answer_text": "For GSM phones the transmit power is specified by ETSI - European Telecommunications Standards Institute. GSM900 is the original GSM Std, it uses frequencies in the 900 MHz band and is designed for wide area cellular operation with maximum output powers of 1W to 8W allowed for mobile applications. That has not changed since the late 80\u2019s. That standard calls for the mobile and base to negotiate the lowest transmit power from the mobile that maintains a clear transmission. For hand held phones generally the maximum transmit power is 2 watts, 3,5 & 8 watt power levels were/are used on vehicle phones where battery limitations are not an issue. Back in the late 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when the cellular network was far less dense, hand held phones often needed to transmit at higher powers to maintain a clear connection with the base station but they were not higher powered transmitters. Modern smart phones are almost constantly transmitting in the background generally at much lower power levels but your total RF radiation dose (SAR) could be higher depending how your phone is set up. So, old GSM cellphones did not emit more radiation. The radiation emitted by a cellphone is not a health concern. ",

            "answer_text": "In all honesty, I don\u2019t know if older cell phones emitted more or less - not my area of expertise (sorry). But I DO know that there is absolutely no scientific evidence linking cell phones to cancer of any sort. The short version is that the radio-frequency radiation they emit is simply too wimpy to break chemical bonds to cause mutations in the DNA. There are some studies that purport to show cancer increases from cell phone use. However, there are far more studies that show no effect whatsoever. And even the studies that suggest an increase are equivocal at best. ",

            "answer_text": "No they did not. This isn't dangerous radiation. It isn't. This isn't like within safety measures of today. This has absolutely no effect on humans or anything. You see, this is 1000 times less radiation than a lightbulb emits. This is billions of times lower radiation than we get from the sun. Why is this so hard to understand? You can swim inside a nuclear reactor safely.  ",

The newer digital phones have a much lower output and work on a couple of methods. Chuck Coopers response is a good one. Here is a simplistic link to follow to get more information. What is the difference between analog and digital cell phones? ",
