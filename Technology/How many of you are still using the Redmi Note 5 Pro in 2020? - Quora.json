            "answer_text": "I am one of people who still own the Redmi Note 5 Pro. I won't even dare asking my parents for new phone cause I know what their answer's gonna be \u201cMONEY DOESN'T GROW ON A TREE\u201d. I know it's \u2018made in china' but still it works fine. I just flashed it and installed HAVOC OS which is far better than MI OS. It won't bug me again and again to sync my photos to cloud which I really hated about MI. But now there's another problem. My phone's screen is dying. It's not responding perfectly which makes me frustrated sometimes. I just never understood why people kept on buying new smartphone every year. Maybe they just want to stay up-to-date or it's just about class(rich people stuff). For me, I think I'm gonna use this phone until it's last breathe but I hope it won't last long. P.S. - My luck is so bad that this phone's gonna last really long, I think I'm gonna take this to heaven or hell or wherever the universe takes me. ",
