            "answer_text": "Not knowingly, but a friend of my brother's (both deceased) did. Me. Knowing the New York Clearing House, an association of the city's top commercial banks chose to feature me in a running series of posters, entitled: WANTED FOR BANK ROBBERY. $10,000 REWARD. The thing is, he himself at the time was a fugitive, wanted in neighboring Nassau County. I don't think I appreciated the magnitude of the decision he made as I had never before committed a crime and obviously had no prison experience. He was an exceptional person. [Aside: My brother had gone to prison (Federal Reformatory, Peterdbutg, VA.) and had given our friend an old but operable German Mauser machine gun from WWII to hold. For reasons never made clear to me, he attempted to sell it to what turned out to be an undercover Treasury agent and was sentenced to a year in federal prison (FCI, Lexington, KY.) I myself had left prison (Federal Youth Center, Ashland, KY.) as my brother was going in for selling cocaine to one of the first female agents of the newly-reorganized Drug Enforcement Agency then headed by the son of the judge who se tended him in Brooklyn, the Hon. John R. Barrels. Funny how looking back, the lives we all led seemed so unremarkable back then in the early to mid 1970s! Thanks for refreshing my recollection of a time I haven't had a chance to think about in a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I can\u2019t say I have or haven\u2019t. I\u2019ll say this though if I was running for from the law for whatever reason, be it I got a warrant for something stupid like I didn\u2019t go to community service or didn\u2019t show up to court, all the way up to I just robbed a bank or got in a shoot out with some fools up the street. Assuming the cops aren\u2019t hot on my ass and they don\u2019t see me run up to your door and and knock and duck inside, if you\u2019d hide me I\u2019d hide you, plain and simple. At the same time if your gonna be tryin to abuse that privilege like it\u2019s a entitlement, like it\u2019s your god given right to hide in my house multiple times a little to frequently. Then your not being a friend your being a asshole I wouldn\u2019t put anyone i know in the same felony committing bind over and over. That\u2019s not being a friend that\u2019s someone being a asshole. Chances are they don\u2019t give a shit about you or whatever you got going on. There\u2019s a thin line between taking care of your people and having them take advantage of your kindness. Your real people would never even think to take advantage of the situation. Keep it as close to 100 as possible. I say that because nobody\u2019s 100 all the time. Best you can hope to be is solid and if you solid hour ahead of the curb. There\u2019s a few common phrases that are over used which has taken away from their meaning, taken away from there power. One of these phrases is \u201cI\u2019m down\u201d. Like you know homies be like \u201care you down to do \u201cblah blah blah this and that yeah yeah yeah\u201d and your like \u201cshit I\u2019m down\u201d that\u2019s whats up, but stop and ask yourself what are you truly down for? Be down for your people, but don\u2019t be held down by someone\u2019s who\u2019s gonna question your authenticity soon as you ask him what the situation is. Don\u2019t be a fool, treat everyone good love your neighbors but don\u2019t hide some punk who just snatched a old lady\u2019s purse or a crook who will use your spot up till the cops kick in your door looking for him. Stay solid ",
