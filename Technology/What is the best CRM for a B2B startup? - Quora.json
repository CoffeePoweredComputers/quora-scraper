            "answer_text": "With consumers of every business getting more complex and demanding, being extremely proactive in terms if consumer management manually is hard and less efficient. CRM platforms automate this process along with allowing managers to make better decisions. B2B channels consumers (companies) value supplier relations quite high and evaluate the supplier on the continuous fulfillment process. Furthermore, the business is destined to grow, and consequently, the consumer base would also grow with it. Therefore, it is essential for a B2B startup to implement a CRM solution for efficient processes and effective order fulfillment. SugarCRM is a good option for this situation, mainly due to its tendency to be highly customizable in terms of industry-vertical specific processes, [i.e sales pipeline management, investment portfolio management, etc] and low cost. It is complemented by a plethora of plugins which add features to the CRM tailored according to the need of the company. For instance, Google suite integration which allows Google apps to sync with your CRM. Lastly, with its intuitive UI and dashboards, it shows managers key information to act upon. Therefore allowing managers to make better decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. A two person cleaning crew who services small office buildings is, technically, a B2B relationship. Oracle selling MySQL to multi-billion dollar international financial institutions is also a B2B relationship. One good way to steer yourself towards a CRM solution is to \u2018reverse engineer\u2019 your needs.  Here are few questions I encourage you to ask: Why do we desire CRM? In other words, what are our goals?What data/reports will we need to pull in the future?Will we integrate our CRM with our financial software?Are we in a business development, seller/doer model or a combination of both?Will we be importing existing data and from where?The differences in systems are, for the most part, minor. However, those minor differences can often be what helps a company embrace the system as a valuable tool or let it gather dust as an expensive lesson. If you have any other questions, let me know and best of success! Bobby ",
