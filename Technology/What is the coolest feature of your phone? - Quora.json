            "answer_text": "After years of using the same old phone, watching the 8gb of memory fill up to the point where I had to delete photos and clear the cache to update apps, watching the battery life get (only slightly) worse, and finally, watching Google cut it off from future updates, I recently got a new phone. I chose the Nexus 5x. The 6p may have better specs, but the 5x fits in my pocket. This phone has a lot of great features, and it is hard to pick just one. Here are a few of my favorites. Fingerprint scanner: On the back of the phone is a fingerprint scanner. Instead of pressing buttons, entering a code, or swiping a pattern, I can just pick up the phone. It quickly becomes a habit to pick it up with a finger on the scanner. As soon as I touch the scanner, the phone instantly unlocks. No buttons pressed, no passwords or pattern entered. This sounds like a minor thing, but you quickly realize how easy and convenient it is. Great camera: My old Nexus 4 had many good qualities, but the camera was not one of them. The 5X has a camera that will probably make me retire my stand alone point and shoot camera. Pictures come out great in all conditions and I can even record high frame rate slow motion video. I love photography, and with this phone, getting good quality images is much easier to do. Stock Android: I know a lot of people who say they hate Android. It is too confusing and they\u2019ll switch back to an iPhone as soon as they can, despite it costing more than $700. I used to have no idea what they were talking about, until my dad asked me for help with his Samsung. Many manufacturers put skins over top of Android that are just awful. Do I want to use the Google email app, the AT&T one, or the Samsung one? Don\u2019t you just love the color neon green and silly bloop and bleep noises whenever you touch the phone? Trying to find something in the settings? Good luck! Maybe some physical buttons (and therefore less screen real estate) are your thing!  It was not a good experience, and I see why he would want to use something simpler. I don\u2019t have those problems. Android, as Google designed it, is actually pretty damn good. It is easy to find the information you need, and while there are some useless apps that come installed and can\u2019t be removed, there are far fewer of them. The new Material Design standard makes things look very modern and nice, without even a hint of blue on neon green color clashing. Getting rid of all this junk also makes the phone run faster. There is one more benefit of not having a carrier or manufacturer skin over top of Android to be approved\u2026 Fast updates: My phone is running Android 6.0.1 with the January level of security patches. Next month, assuming there isn\u2019t a more substantial update before then, I will get another security update. Google can do this because once the updated version of the software is ready, they can send it out to the phones. Samsung doesn\u2019t have to take it and add all their junk to it. AT&T and Verizon don\u2019t need to drag their feet for months testing it and adding their own stuff. iPhone users have a similar experience, with the updates coming directly from Apple, but it is much more rare in the Android world.  I could go on with other reasons that I chose this phone, but the above reasons are the most important features that affected my decision. At least some of these things can be found on other phones,  but this one represented the best combination for me.  ",

You always have your phone but the TV remote is always lost. I can't count the number of times that my phone has saved the day. Additionally, it is very convenient because I am a bit lazy and sometimes I do not feel to get up and get the remote and my phone was there for me to use. My first experience with this was when I got the LG G2. I really loved it. It really pained me when I upgraded to the S7 edge and found out that it didn't have the IR blaster. I know not many people use the IR port on their phones but come on Sammy. Please bring it back. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, The coolest feature that I very recently found on my *Android* smartphone was that of location tracking.   So basically what it does is keep a track of where you have been, for how long and how often. And the best thing is that all this data is there for you to see and analyse at the end of the day. The only downside that I see is that it might take a hit on your battery life since you need to keep your GPS on at all times. This also means an active data pack for all your needs. How to Activate? Open the App Drawer and go to Settings.Scroll down and tap Location.Scroll down and tap Google Location Settings.Tap Location Reporting and Location History, and switch the slider to on for each one.You can view all the data on your laptop from this link : Sign in - Google Accounts  The Result : I have kept location tracking on for the last 1 year, and this is a sample pic that you might get :   This is over an year, but you can change the month and day to find out what you were doing on a specific day. Note : I am not sure how to get a similar feature on iOS. Never used one! Hope it helps!! ",

During one IPL match between CSK vs some other team, which was heading towards a nail-biting finish, I managed to switch off the TV(without anyones knowledge) of the cafeteria where some hundreds of people were watching. In our company, we used have big LED TVs(65\" Panasonic) instead of projectors in our conference rooms.  I used to switch off the TV in the middle of some serious presentation (of course, in such a manner that no one knows how it got switched off) ",

A bit large for most users, it is perfect for web sites and reading e-mail when I am not at my desk. The large size makes it only a bit more clunky as a voice phone \u2026 but using a Bluetooth headset alleviates any issues with holding it that close to my ear. The large screen provides ample space (at very high resolution) to use the \u201cdesktop\u201d, non-mobile pages for sites. With pinch zoom in and out, the desktop versions of web pages are perfectly usable on this phone! Also, I am not a movie buff, but received one free movie with the original purchase, as I recall. So, I watched \u201cGravity\u201d on a plane trip - that was an awesome experience. The screen was perfectly sized for this close usage. ",

Draw O on locked phone to launch camera, V for flashlight, double-tap screen to wake phone.Thanks to 6 Gigs of RAM, this phone coupled with nova launcher is a treat to use.
