            "answer_text": "Progress in science leads to creation of knowledge. This knowledge constitutes information about how a certain phenomenon occurs, what are it's contributing factors, what other inferences can be drawn from it, what possibilities it points to etc. It's essentially information and its interpretation. The result is we begin to understand phenomena we didn't understand or we achieve furtherance of our understanding of little understood phenomena or we get data that confirms or refutes some theory. Progress in science doesn't automatically lead to development of technology. The researchers working in various technological domains use scientific knowledge to create technology, processes and products. A body of knowledge was created by scientists in the field of lasers way back in 70s. I used to read about lasers in scientific magazines then. Technology to bring applications of lasers in public domain wasn't available then - only the possibilities about how lasers could be used for various purposes were mentioned in scientific and technical literature. Now we see applications of lasers everywhere: in medical sciences, manufacturing, space exploration, consumer electronics etc. So science creates knowledge upon which engineering/technology builds products and processes. There's something that goes between scientific knowledge and products. It's the technology. Technology, in essence, is application of science. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology uses science to work. In general, there are two sorts of technological innovations. There are sub-categories and some folks have it in the dozens, but the two major types are \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d and \u201csustaining innovation\u201d. Disruptive innovation is the game-changer \u2014 some new breakthrough or an application of a previously unused technology or idea. Like, say, the microcomputer. Sustaining innovation is the gradual improvement and evolution of a technology \u2014 like improvements and new applications of the microcomputer, for example. The first can change society and can cause a ripple effect that encourages other innovations. And that in turn encourages scientific exploration and risk-taking. And that results in more technology. Pretty much like nature \u2014 everything affects something else and causes a repeating cycle. ",
