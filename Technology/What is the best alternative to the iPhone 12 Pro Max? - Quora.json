            "answer_text": "In my thought there is no alternative android smartphones for iPhone 12 pro in terms of its performance because iPhone 12 pro max come up with latest and greatest A14 bionic processor with 5nm process technology and in android world there is no smartphone with 5nm process technology processor. I hope huawei mate 40 series is better alternative for iPhone 12 series in terms of performance because mate 40 series comes with hisilicon Kirin 9000 processor and it has 5nm process technology and antutu benchmark of hisilicon Kirin 9000 is better as compared to apple's A14 bionic processor.
