            "answer_text": "We will become the Borg  Humans are social beings and we often ask others for advice on life decisions. In my opinion the magnitude of the decisions where we ask for others opinions is constantly shrinking. Many young people start outsourcing decision making into their social network crowds. With live videos and shiny voting buttons or sliders they get immediate feedback of their followers and peers. Now imagine if we get a direct internet connection to our brain. It will probably take some more decades, but I think many of us will see it in their lifetimes. Now you can upload everything you see to the cloud. You can share immersive experiences, including smells and even emotions.You can experience the best moments of your life or the life of others over and over again. There will always be some bored people participating live in your life. This is not mandatory of course but many people will stay transparent all of the time so they get many viewers. There will be entertainment programs where you can live the life of a person on a dream vacation, doing extreme sports, being in a fight with their partner, or maybe even live broadcasts from the brains of prisoners when they get executed. It will get more and more normal to ask questions like which coffee to get at Starbucks in real time and listening at the decision the crowd will take for you. And in return you will participate more and more in the life`s of others and give your 2 cents to any topic they bring up. This is already happening in Instagram/Snap,\u2026 but not in real time and not in such an extent. After a while it will really hurt to go offline and people will be scared to be on their own. How can you know that you are going to make the best decision? Its a scary world when you are alone. It will feel so much better to be part of a collective consciousness that more and more people will join it. This will for sure end wars and increase compassion to all other humans since they all become one. Funnily enough this sounds like Mah\u0101y\u0101na branch of Buddhism, bringing all of humanity together to the single entity they are and which created our universe :) Resistance is futile! ",

            "answer_text": "Rather strangely, we are now in a position to make some reasonable predictions on this matter, although uncertainties remain. One thing is assured, though - we snoutless apes are fast becoming redundant to the evolutionary process that can be traced at least as far back as the formation of the chemical elements in the first stars. Most folk still seem unable to break free from the traditional science fiction based notions involving individual robots/computers. Either as potential threats, beneficial aids or serious basis for \"artificial intelligence\". In actuality, the real next cognitive entity quietly self assembles in the background, mostly unrecognized for what it is. And, contrary to our usual conceits, is not stoppable or directly within our control. We are very prone to anthropocentric distortions of objective reality. This is perhaps not surprising, for to instead adopt the evidence based viewpoint now afforded by \"big science\" and \"big history\" takes us way outside our perceptive comfort zone. The fact is that the evolution of the Internet (and, of course, major components such as Google) is actually an autonomous process. The difficulty in convincing people of this \"inconvenient truth\" seems to stem partly from our natural anthropocentric mind-sets and also the traditional illusion that in some way we are in control of, and distinct from, nature. Contemplation of the observed realities tend to be relegated to the emotional \"too hard\" bin. This evolution is not driven by any individual software company or team of researchers, but rather by the sum of many human requirements, whims and desires to which the current technologies react. Among the more significant motivators are such things as commerce, gaming, social interactions, education and sexual titillation. Virtually all interests are catered for and, in toto provide the impetus for the continued evolution of the Internet. Netty is still in her larval stage, but we \"workers\" scurry round mindlessly engaged in her nurture. By relinquishing our usual parochial approach to this issue in favor of the overall evolutionary \"big picture\" provided by many fields of science, the emergence of a new predominant cognitive entity (from the Internet, rather than individual machines) is seen to be not only feasible but inevitable Stephen Hawking, for instance, is reported to have remarked \"Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all,\" This statement reflects the narrow-minded approach that is so common-place among those who make public comment on this issue. In reality, as much as it may offend our human conceits, the march of technology and its latest spearhead, the Internet is, and always has been, an autonomous process over which we have very little real control. Seemingly unrelated disciplines such as geology, biology and \"big history\" actually have much to tell us about the machinery of nature (of which technology is necessarily a part) and the kind of outcome that is to be expected from the evolution of the Internet. This much broader \"systems analysis\" approach, freed from the anthropocentric notions usually promoted by the cult of the \"Singularity\", provides a more objective vision that is consistent with the pattern of autonomous evolution of technology that is so evident today. Very real evidence indicates the rather imminent implementation of the next, (non-biological) phase of the on-going evolutionary \u201clife\u201d process from what we at present call the Internet. It is effectively evolving by a process of self-assembly. The \"Internet of Things\" is proceeding apace and pervading all aspects of our lives. We are increasingly, in a sense, \u201censlaved\u201d by our PCs, mobile phones, their apps and many other trappings of the increasingly cloudy net. We are already largely dependent upon it for our commerce and industry and there is no turning back. What we perceive as a tool is well on its way to becoming an agent. There are at present an estimated 2 Billion Internet users. There are an estimated 10 to 80 Billion neurons in the human brain. On this basis for approximation the Internet is even now only one order of magnitude below the human brain and its growth is exponential. That is a simplification, of course. For example: Not all users have their own computer. So perhaps we could reduce that, say, tenfold. The number of switching units, transistors, if you wish, contained by all the computers connecting to the Internet and which are more analogous to individual neurons is many orders of magnitude greater than 2 Billion. Then again, this is compensated for to some extent by the fact that neurons do not appear to be binary switching devices but instead can adopt multiple states. Without even crunching the numbers, however, we see that we must take seriously the possibility that even the present Internet may well be comparable to a human brain in processing power. And, of course, the degree of interconnection and cross-linking of networks within networks is also growing rapidly. The emergence of a new and predominant cognitive entity that is a logical consequence of the evolutionary continuum that can be traced back at least as far as the formation of the chemical elements in stars. This is the main theme of my latest book \"The Intricacy Generator: Pushing Chemistry and Geometry Uphill\" which is now available as a 336 page illustrated paperback from Amazon, etc. There is absolutely no reason to assume \"life\" has any \"purpose\". On the other hand the evolving network of our universe very observably has directionality. And it may well be that the tiny cog in nature's machinery to which species comparable to ours correspond may typically self-destruct once the next, non-biological, phase of the evolutionary process is well established. Since its precursor, the Internet (and peripherals) is growing exponentially, that day might not be far off for us. On the other hand, we could possibly earn a reprieve by becoming amicable symbionts with the new cognitive entity. The benefits from such an arrangement could be great. But we first have to become aware of the process and take steps to curb our inherent belligerence. Straighten up and fly right! ",
