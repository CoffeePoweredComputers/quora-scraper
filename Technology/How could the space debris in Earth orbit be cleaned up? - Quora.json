            "answer_text": "Good question, and much more important than most of us realize. My brother was an officer in charge of the \"space command\" section at Cheyenne Mt. for quite a few years, and tracking objects in orbit was part of what they do. There are literally thousands of debris objects in various orbits and, whenever they collide with anything and become fragmented, it only adds to the mess.  However, \"cleaning it up\", though it sounds easy enough, is a monumental task. These are very small objects... anything from small specks of metal, plastic and paint, all the way up to hammers and other tools, and spent rocket boosters, etc. They orbit in a HUGE volume of space, and are travelling at the speed that corresponds to their orbital height... typically 17,000 to 20,000 mph. Just locating some of these objects, and keeping track of them, is an enormous task. Actually retrieving them would be titanically expensive. Like trying to find and net every plastic cup, candy wrapper, empty food container, or other piece of trash dropped from every ship that travels on the oceans of the world. The oceans are not as big as the orbital volume of Earth's space, and the objects are certainly not travelling as fast. But the trash in space is in relatively stable orbits that can (for the most part) be calculated with great precision. Trash dropped into the ocean can wind up anywhere, depending on currents, storms, winds, etc.  Not an easy task at all! A lot of time, effort and money required. The best thing we can start with would be to begin by not adding to the problem. We should make every effort to insure that whatever \"goes up\" does indeed \"come down\" (unless it was our purpose to leave it up there specifically). And we can certainly start by eliminating some of the bigger debris... dead satellites and larger objects drifting in heavily-used corridors of orbital space. That would probably be a good place to start. But to retrieve every screw, nut, bolt, widget... everything lost over the past fifty years? That is a daunting task, to put it mildly! ",

            "answer_text": "This is an active area of research and development. A number of methods have been proposed, but the present problem is actually more about money than method. In short, who is going to pay for it? Methods vary according to factors including the size of the debris and the orbits. Large pieces of junk will need to be handled individually, with the retrieval system matching orbits (more or less) and attaching a tool that can either de-orbit the piece or move it into a \u201cparking orbit\u201d where it can be left for many years until some later use for the materials arises. The \u201ctool\u201d could range from an active mechanism with ion thrusters and a navigation computer to a passive system that merely attaches a long tether that increases drag and/or uses electrical current (see (electrodynamic tether\u201d) to alter the orbit. Small items could conceivably be caught by a large \u201csweeping\u201d system. One proposed such system would be made of aerogel similar to that used to trap particles from a comet. I'm told that because of both treaty law and federal law, nobody is really responsible for their own mess. Therefore, nobody has a motivation to pay for the retrieval system. From my naive understanding, under the Outer Space Treaty every nation is liable for all costs resulting from any vehicle belonging to their agencies and private companies, including damage to other space vehicles and ground structires (or people) here on Earth. That precedent has been established, with several nations having paid, sometimes reluctantly and after years of negotiation, for damage caused on the ground. Based on that, it appears that the liability should drive a combined insurance + debris removal market. Apparently my understanding is insuffficient however. But, _if the liability were correctly established and accounted for_, then the cost of liability insurance would include the amortised cost of junk removal, such that the insurance companies would collectively fund the removal process.
