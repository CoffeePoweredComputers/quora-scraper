            "answer_text": "Are you asking if there are any news sources who ignore politics altogether, or just those who are fairly unbiased? If the latter, sure. But if you\u2019re pro-Trump you\u2019re going to have to look for biased news sources because even unbiased will report when he either says something wrong, stupid or a lie. Here are a couple sources. These are the most and least biased news outlets in the US, according to Americans AllSides Media Bias Chart How biased is your news source? You probably won\u2019t agree with this chart It\u2019s important to stay away from opinion people (like Hannity or whoever does opinion pieces at WSJ, CNN, etc). Most agree BBC, NPR and the AP are trustworthy and not noticeably biased. There are others as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Seriously? If you ever find one, please let me know! One fact I\u2019ve come to realise as a Truthseeker is that there are at least three dominant elements concerning the media, these are the following - Propaganda, Politics & Psychology! In fact they are inseparable.I use the alternative media plus foreign news platforms to obtain different perspectives that do not contain Western bias which is like a breath of fresh air! I utilise about 400 sources worldwide for referencing & factchecking as we are in a society of smoke & mirrors & as time passes, it\u2019s becoming more & more difficult to separate fact from fiction! It also takes time & there are no short cuts as such appearances like fake news, misdirection, misinformation, coercion etc have more than quadrupled my work. ",
