            "answer_text": "Unlike most answers, I completely disagree that a single person would have little impact. A single, well chosen and prepared person could cause humanity to advance to almost today\u2019s level within, at most, a few hundred years. Let\u2019s pick a particularly smart, young and strong person. You, for example! Start training and educating yourself for years, and select exactly where and when to be sent back. Make sure that you have all of your vaccines and, for the purpose of this, we\u2019ll assume that you\u2019re infection-free. You will know the language, history, and technological levels at the time. If you\u2019re careful, you can easily cause humanity to speed up the progress of advancement by thousands of years. Not all at once, but over the next few hundred years. You won\u2019t be around to see it all, but you will have caused it. Don\u2019t forget that arguably the largest advancements of humanity before the 1800\u2019s had nothing to do with the level of technology at the time, but more to do with processes and knowledge. All advancement requires a humongous amount of trial and error. You can avoid all of that, drastically speeding everything up. How can you do this? 5,000 years ago is pretty much the perfect time to jump back to. It was the end of the neolithic era (aka stone age), already somewhat into the copper age and the beginning of the Aegean Bronze age. This is perfect for us considering what we want to bring to the table, since they were already starting to tinker with a lot of this. Writing was just being invented, which fortunately was the start of recorded history, so we actually know quite a lot of what was happening around that time. Farming and agriculture was just getting off (out of?) the ground, domestication of animals was beginning, Troy was being founded, Stonehenge was being built, The Minoan civilization starts. The unification of upper and lower Egypt happened which brought about the strength of the Egyptian Empire. Pick any of those locations to start revolutionizing. Let\u2019s start with just language, reading and writing, and basic math skills. You will also know all the advancements in philosophy, psychology, etc, and can start to document and disseminate via written books. Start with simple language, phonetically written to match the language of the area, and use that to fully teach the language that you want to use for the rest of the documentation. Rely on science and pragmatism so that we can avoid arguing about interpretation and killing each other over this for the next 5,000 years. Avoid the dark ages entirely, that alone saves 1,000 years of advancement. Basic concepts of agriculture and nutrition, where and how to grow crops, what fertilizer to use (10x yield!) and how to harvest them in efficient manners will have massive impacts on being able to feed your cities. Regardless of where you end up, go find some potatoes and start growing those. Cultivation of that was largely responsible for the rise of western civilization and the end of famine in Europe. If corn, rice and wheat aren\u2019t in your area, go get those as well. Knowledge of basic forms of government, what works and what doesn\u2019t, will certainly help your burgeoning cities from collapsing. Health and life expectancy could be drastically improved overnight. General knowledge of how the body works, the fact that germs spread disease (and can be combated easily by hygiene and proper sewage handling), and knowledge of common causes of health problems could immediately provide benefits to everyone. Use salt to preserve food. Heat food up with specific times kills bacteria, and can let you store protected food after cooking for much longer. Evaporative cooling systems can be built with fabric in windy places for further preservation. Heat milk (or other liquids) up almost to the point of boiling and it kills 99.99% of bacteria and can be stored for much longer. Penicillin is very effective as an antibiotic, and can easily be cultivated without any technological requirements. Insulin can be extracted easily from animals to help those with diabetes. Now that we have a well fed and healthy population, start to build forges. Use coal and/or compressed wood with bellows to force large amounts of air in to create fires that are thousands of degrees. Use rocks to form basins, and you can start to refine metal ore (which you have an abundance of, since you knew where to look already). Make molds out of sand to have the metal drip into, and you can start casting crude tools, gears, and components to start building machinery. Start with iron, creating casts for use with copper, aluminum, tin and bronze. These can be forged at much lower temperatures, so the iron won\u2019t melt, allowing you to create parts with much greater precision. You can also work the other way around, forging parts with lower temperature metals and refining them by hand, creating clay/sand molds, then casting higher temperature metals. Welcome to the industrial revolution. A pendulum takes the same amount of time to swing back and forth regardless of from what height it started. This simple concept was pretty revolutionary for the time. Without much technology you can build basic clocks on this premise. Use the gears that you build using your foundries. If you want to use wood you can do this much earlier \u2014 the gears will be larger and cumbersome, but you can make it work. Timekeeping was a huge component in being able to manage large populations. Find Polaris in the sky and measure the apparent angle, or measure the highest point of the sun, and you have your latitude. Synchronize clocks in your capital city, let\u2019s call it London (Greenwich to be precise), and move them everywhere. Compare the difference in when local noon is (sun at highest point in the sky) to your London noon, and you can easily determine longitude. Now we can use the memorized geography to much greater extent. Magnetite can be found, and compasses built \u2014 no technology needed. Based on your geographical knowledge, you can expand your empire, knowing where resources are, and the best ways of getting there. Create as much gunpowder as possible \u2014 no tech needed here either. Forge cannons and guns using your foundries. Nobody will be able to resist your military now. Where to find oil reserves, how to do basic crude oil processing, and what to do with that oil would have massive repercussions. Building a sterling or steam engine won\u2019t be too hard now, and you won\u2019t be far away from an internal combustion engine either. Plastics can start to be produced. The concept of how an aerodynamic lift (an air foil or wing) allows you to build gliders almost immediately, even without engines. That would have massive impact on many things, but since you have engines already, strap them on with propellers. Congratulations you now have an air force. Electricity can be made by a lemon or potato, zinc and copper, and some wire \u2014 again, no technology needed. A crude light bulb could be fashioned really easily with minimal materials. Knowing where deposits of magnetic materials are, and how to collect and create magnetized iron, can be used to build crude generators. Put this into a mill on a river, and you have just built the world\u2019s first power generating station. Take the same zinc and copper plates, attach this to your electrical generator, and separate water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. Collect this \u2014 both will be extremely useful. You can use hydrogen in your engines, and the result is drinking water. That\u2019s pretty convenient. Wrap wire around metal fashioned into a circle, and attach it to a taught fabric cone that has its own magnet that sits inside the metal circle. Do this again, connect with some wire, and supply electricity. You\u2019ve just invented the telephone. Take those audio signals that you\u2019ve created, and run it back and forth along a long wire with enough power, and you\u2019ve just created radio. Even better. Now you can talk to the farthest reaches of your empire immediately. Basic knowledge of chemistry and the atom, plus the periodic table, would be a game changer. Once you have reserves of the basic elements (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen) you can create a massive amount of present-day products. None of those achievements so far require any significant level of existing technological achievement, so long as the person who went back understands where to find all of the materials, and how to use them based on what is available at the time. All of this, above, could likely happen within just a few hundred years. Congratulations, the year is 2700 BC and you\u2019re at roughly the level of technological advancement that we were at 100\u2013200 years ago, and we can keep going. Collect uranium, be careful with it, but you can refine using similar processes as we discussed above. Even without much technology, you can create crude reactors which can boil water. Slap some generators on this and create nuclear power stations. Collect the water vapor used and you have a desalination plant for drinking water. ",

            "answer_text": "No change whatsoever. To begin with, 5,000 years ago would take us to the onset of civilization, when early languages were being developed, but none as much as resembled any modern language. So our brave time traveler would be incapable of communicating with anyone. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume sign language would do. So he shows a modern invention to the locals. What could it be? A cell phone? There would be no signal, so at most he could show some videos he has downloaded. Would they mean anything to the villagers? Probably not. Plus, it would run out of battery within a day or so: let\u2019s assume some interested villager sends for the high priest, or chieftain, to look at the gadget. By the time they arrive, the phone may be a dead piece of plastic and metal\u2026 Any way I look at it, I fail to see how could the modern guy make any sort of positive impact. Of course, the other likely result is that the locals, being new at this thing called \u201creligion\u201d that explains why there is thunder and lightning, would assume he is some sort of demon and burn him at the stake. Without getting too drastic about life and death, there is a great short story by William Golding titled \u201cEnvoy Extraordinary\u201d, about a hypothetical Greek inventor who arrives to the Roman court with a number of far advanced inventions, such as a steam engine and explosives. Problem is, Romans are culturally unable to understand the significance of them: the Roman emperor can only see that the sealed steam boiler can be used to cook food without losing any flavor, so in the end, none of his inventions is incorporated\u2026 and this is about relatively close cultures.
