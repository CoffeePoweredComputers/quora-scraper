            "answer_text": "The DVD player can play CDs under normal conditions. DVD players currently include DVD Video Player for video and DVD Audio Player for audio. Nowadays, DVD Video Player is commonly used to play back high-definition DVDs. The first generation of DVD video players were basically products of Japan's Matsushita, Toshiba, Sony and South Korea's Samsung, LG and other companies. The initial products used the area code limitation technology because of copyright protection. However, in the subsequent upgrade products, Sony has taken the lead in launching a full-area code player, which further increases the penetration rate of products. As a typical DVD player, at least two core parts should be included: the decoder chip and the movement. The function of the decoding chip is to decode the signal read by the laser head, and its quality directly affects the level of image sharpness and whether the audio processing is 100% digitized. The DVD movement is responsible for the rotation of the DVD and the reading of the signal through the DVD laser head. The development of the DVD player from the first generation to the third generation or even the fourth generation today, the structure of the laser head of the key components has also changed greatly, and the single-head replacement of the double-head has become the trend of the times. In order to be more compatible with CD/VCD discs, the first-generation DVD player adopts dual-head reading technology. However, with the continuous updating of the prior art, the disadvantages of high cost, multiple coils and complicated mechanical structure are gradually exposed. Come out, the single optical head's optical path structure is simple, the number of components is small, the response is sensitive, the performance is stable, and so on, and the advantages of reading the film are better and the compatibility is stronger. It has become the mainstream trend of the current DVD player. ",

            "answer_text": "Virtually all DVD players will play a CD just by hitting the \"Play\" button (the little right facing triangle icon). Typically the fast forward and \"skip\" buttons will work as well. Audio will be output either from the RCA white and red connectors on the rear, or from a headphone jack (if it has one). On current mimimalist players, perhaps audio might be available only over HDMI, in which case you'd need to listen on your HDMI TV or use an optical or analog output from the TV to another amplifier to use with better speakers.
