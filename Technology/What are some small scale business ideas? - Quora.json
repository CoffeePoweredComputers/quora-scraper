            "answer_text": " In 1994, Jeffrey P. Bezos had the idea of a lifetime. Why bother going to the store to buy something, when you can just order it online and get it delivered to your doorstep? Now Bezos realized that if he wanted to become legendary, he needed to start with something small. So in July of 1994, Cadabra (later changed to Amazon) debuted as a single-cell online bookseller. Little did Bezos know that almost two decades later, his creation would be taking the cyber world by storm.[1] In 1997 - Reed Hastings and software executive Marc Randolph co-found Netflix to offer online movie rentals. Then they launch the first DVD rental and sales site, Watch TV Shows Online, Watch Movies Online. After two years, Netflix debuts a subscription service, offering unlimited DVD rentals for one low monthly price.[2] In 2004, The site called Thefacebook.com was launched by 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg as his college project. the site was an instant hit. After, six years later, the site has become one of the biggest web sites in the world, visited by 400 million people a month.[3] Now come to the point, you may hear of these stories for a quite long time. My bottom line is that whatever the business you are onto or want to startup, think why these businesses succeed even they are so small at starting. Because of these two characters. Passion: There passion for business never ends even though they fall. Never give-up attitude works. Scalability: You cannot be succeeded by counting a penny. Every business needs scalable otherwise you need satisfaction. Finally, to answer your question with honesty, Do any business you want but first find the purpose and indulge in it. Think of ahead, there is nothing like present in business. if your business can\u2019t be scalable then think thrice to begin.

            "answer_text": "14 Hobbies that you can turn into a Business There is a saying. If you love your job you do not work a day in your life. What a great saying and how true it is, from the fishing guide that takes people out marlin or bass fishing to the nature photographer.Lots of people have started with Hobbies that can turn into a business. Many people in what I would call normal jobs also love their jobs.So what a great idea to turn your hobby, what you enjoy doing ! into a business where you can earn money and supplement your income.The first hobby that comes to mind would be  CandlemakingThe basic start-up costs are not too expensive and the range of colours and odours you can make are limitless.I don\u2019t know anyone male or female that does not like the flicker of candlelight they are great presents and therefore can be great gifts to sell at local craft fairs or online in places like Shop for handmade, vintage, custom, and unique gifts for everyone,or EBay It can be done in the kitchen at home, as long as you are aware of the dangers of hot wax and any fire precautions.  SoapMakingAgain is inexpensive to set up and you produce a product that everybody uses and likes to receive as a gift, There are some beautiful soaps out there infused with herbs and customised in all sorts of ways.With any products like this, you have to present them in pretty ways wrapped in coloured tissue paper or brown paper with a tag with your logo and contact details so the customer can reorder from you again.The beauty of soap and candles is when you have them on a market people can smell the odour for themselves.This is exactly the type of business that started out as a hobby.  Lotions and Potionslots of people nowadays are very particular about what they put on their and their family\u2019s skin so if you can make creams and lotions from natural ingredients these could sell well it may be an old family recipe you can find or research an olden lotion that works well.Again presentation needs to be attractive and make sure you are allowed to produce items and are not violating state laws.  Woodworkingthis could be anything from making toys or picture framing.ideally producing things would work well rather than visiting someone to hang a door or fix something all of which could be complicated depending on your particular abilities. lots of people prefer traditional wooden toys but also making wooden items to complement today\u2019s tech, charging stations, watch box, even speakers for your smartphones.  Graphic-designThe internet and businesses are in demand for anyone who can perform graphic design items. from logos to packaging lots of work can be found if you register on work sites such as Upwork, the world's largest online workplace. Members of craft clubs and people who sell homemade items will all have a need for business cards and sales literature.  Gift making and craftingThere are lots of people out there who decorate signs or glasses and bottles that are in demand for table dressings for weddings and parties, these are one of a kind items and can be beautiful. The list is endless and a search on the internet through stores like not-0n-the-high street or Shop for handmade, vintage, custom, and unique gifts for everyone will highlight the many items that people are prepared to pay for. Try and make your items great quality and have your own designs.There is a whole skill in selling online but beautiful items with good photographs should always find buyers.  SewingAnother hobby that can bring income by selling items you make from clothing to toys etc.some of the worlds top designers Christian Dior, Yves St Lauren, all started with sewing and making designs for fashion for sisters and family members a Great example of Hobbies turning into businesses. Knittinglots of people sell clothes and items that they have knitted some made to order another search online will show you what people sell. Like sewing and any homemade items, there are various ways and places to sell keep trying other places until you find what is best for you.  TeachingWhether it be teaching a musical instrument of tutoring a special skill to someone can be very lucrative especially if you can teach more than one at a time. I met a lady who set up her diet club she had been involved all her life in various companies she then set up and charged everyone $5 per person and she had over 100 people in a one-hour long session that\u2019s $500 dollars per hour, she only worked 2 hours per week.  Card MakingIf you think about all the occasions that require a greetings card birthdays leaving work new job etcthen there are lots of opportunities to sell handmade cards and these can be made from your table top. People will pay for an original one-off card for that special person. With all these items remember if you would never ever buy a card or buy a candle that they are not for you, They are for your customers.  Cooking and BakingLots of people are so busy they do not have time to make meals and are willing to buy a homemade pie or meal. Lots of Cafes have local cooks and bakers to provide homemade food for their stores, again be aware of your state laws. Celebration cakes birthday cakes are all in demand and if you have the skills or can learn them, to make custom designed cakes these can be great sellers and another form of income. If you don\u2019t know what to charge ask another baker what they what they would charge to give you some idea. Keep Pictures of your work so you have something to show your cakes and give people ideas.This is a great example of a hobby that can be turned into a business.  Jewellery makingAnother great hobby that you can make items to sell for profit. You can start with cheaper materials so your jewellery is not too expensive. The presentation is important and having lots of different items to sell when you find yourself selling more of one item then you can concentrate on your best selling items.  Blogging (website) buildingIf you have an interest or hobby or if you have knowledge about a subject why not write about it?Share your knowledge and your passion there will probably be people out there that also share your interest and want to read about it. I have started a website about an illness I have had for over 35 years. I have experience and lots of tips that helped me get through it and I looked and read lots about it.I recommend a free website building program called fIMP Learn How to Make Money Online: Free Internet Marketing Training | FIMP I have paid for a few website building courses before I found this totally free course and it is far better than courses I paid for.  Research is the key In conclusionI hope I have got you thinking about things that you can do to make some extra money. I have picked mainly indoor hobbies which are more suitable for anyone with limited mobility, and you do not have to be disabled you could be looking after the children or caring for someone, This site discriminates know-one.
