            "answer_text": "It is sometimes a trap question, specially when you don\u2019t have clarity of type of project for which you are being hired. They are sometimes checking your thought process and priorities. This is also to check your flexibility about any kind of project / work. For example, you say any large complex development project or if you talk about specific tools & technologies then they will take you only if they have the same to offer in short to medium term future. If you are really particular about it then it\u2019s okay to state your priorities. Like any project on the analytics or machine learning. If they don\u2019t have that kind of project, they won\u2019t take you but that\u2019s what you also want. I generally say - any project which intellectually challenges me to put my best and if I see that I am adding value for the organization & end customer then that\u2019s ideal project for me. ",
