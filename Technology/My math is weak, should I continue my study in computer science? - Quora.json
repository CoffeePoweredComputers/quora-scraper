            "answer_text": "No, you should not, most of my friends who are naturally good at maths and logic breeze through computer science program, but they have weakness in communication, writting and other aspects. If you still like tech, go for information technology degree, you learn how to manipulate technology, CS is mostly solving hard problems which involve mathematical theory , this is not a direct practical approach that can be applied directly to the industry, as they are taught on how to be a \"scientist\".  Both can give you succesful route , you cannot judge one is superior than the another, it all depends on your personality or natural talent. Good luck discovering your journey. ",
