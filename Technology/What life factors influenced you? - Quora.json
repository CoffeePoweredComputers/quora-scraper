            "answer_text": "My dad Eulogy For Sander Faber June 19, 2007 Thank you Rabbi and thank all of you for being here today to help celebrate the life of Sander Faber. Sander was the freest man I have ever known. He was free to explore, create and love. Many are held back by chains of fear, fear of the different, the unknown and the fear that comes from not trusting in yourself. In this respect Sander, was fearless. Sander was free to explore Sander loved to build things even as a little boy. As a young teen he ran wires to other family houses so all could hear Sibelius\u2019 Finlandia from his parent\u2019s turntable. He once made a crystal radio set for his sister Corrine. (Don\u2019t feel bad grandkids, I haven\u2019t seen one of these either.) He was always in the new. How many children look to a parent as part of the avant-garde? I always wanted to know what he was into now. You could discuss and ask questions about anything- he usually added to your insight. We were always going to the unusual-studio wrestling, the Harlem Globe Trotters, air shows, even the ruins of the Detroit riots of 1967. The first video camera, first calculator, first Walkman and first car phone and first Apple computer I saw were through him. After my wife Melissa set me up for a Skydive, Dad saw my videotape and said, \u201cI got to do that\u201d. He said, \u201cit isn\u2019t often at my age to have to see a doctor and an insurance agent before you do something.\u201d Sander was free to create. Sander was a multimedia artist and musician- painting, sculptures of metal and clay, a jazz bass player and founder of the Sander Faber Trio. His intricate mobiles that floated through the air were a wonder for his children. Cousin Lisa says that is possible people with such a wide-open intellect and creative ability become selfish libertines. What was unique about Sander was how he combined his creativity with an iron determination. He was a great entrepreneur and businessman in the siding business, one of the toughest businesses there is. He was self-made, always reinventing the offering. He was a realist and saw through to the heart of things. Nothing got past him or cheated him. The worst criticism he could levy was to say something was NG- no good- the notation put on the back of bad business leads. By his example he always made you work harder, do better. In 1978 he challenged Brother Henry, then 10, and me to go to Graceland on the anniversary of Elvis death. \u201cThere must be 50,000 people down there, go sell them something, I\u2019ll watch on TV\u201d. Henry and I made a killing that day selling $1.50 straw hats for $5.00 in one of the most exciting afternoons of our lives. His other life lessons were just as powerful. \u201cHave good work habits.\u201d he would say. Learn to endure hardship, to earn your quota and the value of persistence; how hard habits are to set and how easily they can be broken. You can fail but never quit trying. \u201cGo down swinging\u201d, he would say. He had ability to see perfection but did not demand perfection from his family. Still, we also knew that he was not always a drink of milk. Brother Henry learned all his curse words from him. Yet he was compassionate. When a competitor cheated a bedridden couple out of their roofing money, Dad finished the job for free. Dad would open his swimming pool to a halfway house to let the residents there enjoy a day in the sunshine. He was free to love. Sander and my mother Florence divorced when I was 6. All my friends\u2019 parents were divorced, and they never saw their dads. Thinking he would go away too, I asked for his autograph so I would have something to remember him by. He wrote his name and phone number on back of my JFK picture so I could always call him. But more that, every Sunday the car came to the back door and my siblings, Mitchell and Debbie, and I would go way out into the country to Lakeland to fish or out to his house in Raleigh to see Lucinda- this wondrously beautiful, intelligent and gracious woman that I had the very good fortune to come into my life. Sander loved his children. He and Marcy built a stain glass window for the house and he would rub Marcy\u2019s temples to help her sleep. He loved to play cards with her. He first let her win but later confessed she was as good at cards as his mother Nanny Phyllis. He took great pride in her interpretive dance to \u201cNew York, New York\u201d and would show the video to any group of three or more people, right Marcy? With Henry, they launched into stamp collecting, coin collecting, ham radio and fishing. He was always very patient and methodical when teaching, moving from step to step. He loved to be with his eight grandchildren. He would want to swing by the Monkey Beans coffee shop to see Debbie and grandsons, Brandon and Laurence, go to see Madeline and Emily perform; or entertaining his youngest grandchildren Ashley, Sam, Sara and Sophia at home. And there is another grandchild on the way. How he would have loved that child! And a day did not go by that he did not tell Lucinda how wonderful she was and how much he appreciated her. Dad\u2019s love extended beyond his work and family to his many hobbies and interests. Here the family motto is, \u201cAnything worth doing is worth overdoing.\u201d Or as brother Stan called it, \u201cA long term commitment to excess.\u201d There was his music and stereo equipment. He loved good music- classical and jazz from Rollins to Stravinsky and we listened to it all. He was not enamored with rock and roll- \u201cIf you can\u2019t play good play loud\u201d he would say. Dad loved his stereo equipment and of course he made his own speakers. But Dad could never stand to fully part with his old generation equipment; Marcy, Henry and I bear witness to that- you should see my attic- a Smithsonian of stereo sound! There was his photography. Florence remembers his hours in the darkroom making the first home 3-D pictures. As a toddler, Marcy thought Dad\u2019s head was actually a camera. There was his gardening, no, make that landscaping, no, make that terra forming! Every Saturday morning several dozen plants showed up magically in the driveway- still can\u2019t figure out how they got there. He actually has indoor plants older than his children, even today. He called himself the world\u2019s first Klepto-botanist and kept a shovel in the trunk, always on the lookout for a wild specimen he could bring home. When you drive by the Shady Grove overpass on 240, look for the bamboo. He planted it to hide the MLGW terminal 35 years ago and it still going strong. He was a wonderful practical joker. In his younger days he would rig up ingenious ways to deliver an electric shock to the unwary. He built the famous Mongoose box that would launch a raccoon tail at victim\u2019s eyeballs. Or the time he asked me to put my hand in a bag and get a prize\u2026 of live lobsters! Florence got him back hanging a single banana on his much loved banana tree in Mobile. He ran down the back yard and pulled it free only to find it attached by a wire. And then there was food! Sander loved to eat- not just quality but quantity. He would say the last bite was the best if you got it you were special. We would take road trips to Tunica for a bellyful of his favorite trafe, crab claws. If it was really good we would joke and say, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it\u201d as a way to ward off the hungry. And he loved a good cigar. Sander was the freest man I have ever known. He showed us what it meant to live free, to go your own way. That it was ok to be different-not part of the herd. It takes guts and creativity, but it is worth it. It is worth it to keep your sense of wonder in a world of people who want to settle for quick answers to life\u2019s big questions and who try to find salvation in things and not in each other. Sander reminds us that each of us leads a life of special interest and value. And that each of us is unique with our own special gifts. And I say this especially for you, the grandchildren. I hope that you live as he did- living in the present with great hope for the future with a belief that a person with desire, good work habits and fearlessness could go anywhere and do anything in this world. Now this from our prayer book: \u201cIn many houses, All at once, We see our Dad, And he is young and laughing as he comes in, That he can\u2019t see our tears is of no matter, We were once his dream, now he is ours.\u201d ",
