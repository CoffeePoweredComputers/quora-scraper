            "answer_text": "Holographic Technology  So the breakthrough technology developed by SeeReal banks on highly logical yet keep-it-simple solutions.First of all, rather than boosting resolutions and intensifying display needs to unbearable levels, SeeReal has introduced Viewing Window technology. This actually limits display needs and corresponding diffraction angles.The benefit: a much larger display pitch, so for a 40 inch display the pixel size is in the range of at 25 - 50 microns. This is well within today's state-of-the-art.Second, SeeReal uses its proprietary Sub-hologram technique.  \u200b Classical Holography  \u200b Sub-Hologram and Viewing Window Technology The benefit: smaller encoded hologram areas per scene point, with the shape and size of the sub-hologram closely linked to the 3D scene being viewed (sub-holograms are freely super-positioned, to accurately represent any 3D scene point distribution).Overall, the combination of these two basic principles means that it only takes today's computing capabilities to create full parallax colour 3D HDTV images in real-time. For example, a 40'' holographic TV would consume only approx 3 TFLOPS. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a huge question that goes way beyond what I can offer you in a paragraph here. In a nutshell the definition of a hologram is that it is the recording of an interference pattern of light into a photosensitive medium. When reconstructed with the correct light source at the correct reference angle it will recreate a fully 3D (not stereo) image that you can see from many different positions (stereo is only 3D from one view). The term hologram is used wrongly to describe many things that are not holographic e.g. Tupak at Coachella or the images in the Haunted Mansion at Disney. ",
