            "answer_text": "The question is kind of confusing, you seem to think of science as a force that \u201cmakes things working\u201d or something like that. The science is just a process that we use to explain how things work - it has no purpose of it\u2019s own, it doesn\u2019t try to \u201cfix\u201d things or to explain why things are the way they are. Science accepts that the world is what it is and helps us to understand how different facts are connected to each other - that\u2019s it. There is no \u201chigher purpose\u201d or \u201cbalance\u201d for science. Also, the nature is not \u201cbalanced\u201d as you seem to imply - it just is. There are various processes and phenomena taking place and humans are seeing patterns here and there, but the truth is we just see what we want to see. Your question sounds like you believe that the nature is \u201chelping\u201d us to boil water by keeping the boiling temperature in sync with the oxygen concentration (which by the way is false - the concentration of oxygen is constant, the pressure of oxygen is getting lower). That\u2019s just another anthropocentric view of the universe that has no factual support. Just keep going higher and the nature will \u201chelp\u201d you to die by oxygen deprivation (or getting your blood boiling if you get in orbit, for that matter). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes all things are in balance. People try to apply science to nature, that's great to learn. I however think God just made things how that are and people justify things with science. Science is just numbers after all. How much lower a boiling temp it it? God don't care, his kids want boiling water well shit this is how it'll happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Linguistically, we talk about science as if it is a noun. As other answers have said, science isn\u2019t a thing with a purpose and direction. What science is, is a method for testing ideas and observations to see if they are valid or not. There is no ultimate goal of science. A properly designed study has an idea to be tested by experimentation. The only goal of the method is to prove or disprove the idea that is being tested. So really, the goal of science is whatever the person conducting the experiment says it is. ",

There is less oxygen at higher altitudes, and water comes to a boil at higher altitudes for the same exact reason: there is lower atmospheric pressure in high altitudes. ",
