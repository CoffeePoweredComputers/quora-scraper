            "answer_text": "In a school, there two are deadly sins, and their names are apathy and malice. It takes a lot for me to truly hate a teacher. I don't hate them for being strict, for they value discipline in class. Perhaps they believe that it creates a better learning environment for students, or that it makes it easier to teach. I don't hate them for being too relaxed in class, for they may believe that a class with high morale will be able to learn better. Or maybe that's just who they are. I don't even hate them for being poor teachers, because not everyone can communicate the same message with the same effect. Perhaps they're just not cut out for the job, as some people are in every profession. Or maybe I just don't get their style of teaching, because teaching really is subjective. One of the things I do hate, however, is the simple lack of shits to give. I don't mean teachers who speak their minds or teach the class however they see fit, for those teachers often do very well. I mean teachers who see their jobs as a means to an end. A paycheck to fund their outside interests. Perhaps that is possible in another profession, but not for teaching. In another profession, you could probably get away with that without adverse effects. But in a job where you face twenty or thirty young minds, several of whom actually want to learn? Not an option. If we can tell that you don't care, we won't. And that may be fine in class, where we could just sleep. But we don't just lay down our books when the last bell rings. It is in no way enjoyable to go through your work, only to realize that nothing was truly \u201ctaught\u201d to you in class. Got a question that you don't understand? Well you're shit out of luck, for you have nobody to ask. So a teacher's apathy in class makes students hate the subject, hate the teacher, and hate every moment of that class. The same applies to bullies. Teachers who enforce the rules not out of duty or the belief that it helps, but ones who do it out of the sheer, unbridled joy of keeping someone down. The ones who do it because they can. Because it pleases them to hand out harsh punishments for minute infractions. The ones who berate a student well past all reason, well past the time that their point was made. Why? Because they enjoy it. I hate these teachers. I hate them. I truly hate them. There is no excuse for their behavior. In a situation where they have control and responsibility over two dozen children, they choose not to nurture and teach, but to bully and berate. I wish the worst upon them. I wish for their removal from their chosen profession. Even for those I see as apathetic, I can make excuses. I can rationalize their behavior. Explain it away, telling myself that they really aren't that bad. Maybe they're just jaded, worn down by having to continually deal on a daily basis with a hundred people who would rather be somewhere else. But the bullies? The ones who act in malice towards students? There is nothing I can muster for them but hate. There is no place for them in schools. There is no place for them in society. There is no need, no place, no want for them, except as the basis for caricatured antagonists in musicals. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHate\u201d is a very strong word for my approach to life and other people. I have little respect for a teacher who does not know their subject and how to teach it well. Students deserve a teacher who walks in every day well prepared to help them understand the subject. That is simply impossible if the teacher does not know what they are doing. I have seen some thrown into situations where they were barely ahead of the students, but were willing to work very hard every night to stay ahead and be prepared to teach students the next material \u2014 not the ideal, but I can respect the dedication and effort. The teachers I want to leave the profession (There is my approximation to your word, hate.) are the ones who do not like students. If a teacher does not care about their students, all of their students not just the automatic honors kids who will make them look good, I do not want them in the classroom. That does not mean that I oppose all strict teachers with firm rules. Sometimes those come from a deep concern for students and preparing them well for the future. But, the teacher who is just there for the check, or in some way to feed their own ego, should leave and go sell shoes or something. ",
