            "answer_text": "Let's start like this: What is Industry 4.0? Tech Radar says: \"...new buzzword for the combination of industry and the current Internet of Things (IoT) technology is Industry 4.0.\" http://www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/future-tech/5-things-you-should-know-about-industry-4-0-1289534 What is IoT (Internet of Things)? The Internet of Things (IoT) has been defined in http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/gsi/iot/Pages/default.aspx as a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies. With these definitions in mind, let's answer your question \"How the Industry 4.0 help in our everyday lives?Well, by the very merge of the definition, its INDUSTRY 4.0. This helps the industry and not us everyday. However,indirectly, Industry 4.0 can help us in our everyday lives. Think of how an industry such as the energy industry utilize sensors on hydroelectric turbines to boost efficiency by say 3% (big deal for the actual company using this technology), which saves these dam owners and perhaps which will transfer to regular energy consumers as cost savings. Industry being Energy, IoT being computer connected to metrics sensor deviceLet's think of another example: the Healthcare industry. Tracking devices on medical equipment and personnel, could help speed up logistical efficiency in a hospital or field where these professionals work. This most certainly helps the lives of the sick everyday. Industry being Healthcare, IoT being computer to RFID tracking device.Potential future device, could be in the nutrition industry. Sensor placed in a 'smart fridge' can tell owner that he/she is not putting the best in their fridges and that at the current rate, owner is set to gain 10 lbs. This makes owner more cautious and buy proper food to satisfy nagging fridge, which helps owner be healthier. Industry being Nutrition industry, IoT being computer to sensors and computers in fridge. Direct impact on everyday life. At the end of the day, the ideal impact will be that things will be that far more automated and industries will find more ways to cater to consumer needs, which will raise consumer satisfaction, which makes us satisfied consumers everyday. Satisfaction=Profit? ",

            "answer_text": "Industry 4.0 brings the focus back onto manufacturing. It marries modern digital technologies with mass manufacturing technologies through the implementation of techniques like automation and data analytics, among others. It is the culmination of advancements in several different fields, each one complementing the capabilities of the next, a manufacturing symbiosis. The rise of new digital industrial technology, known as Industry 4.0, is a transformation that makes it possible to gather and analyze data across machines, enabling faster, more flexible, and more efficient processes to produce higher-quality goods at reduced costs. Even the name \u2018Industry 4.0\u2019 is an acknowledgment of the role played by software technology in spearheading this advancement. Here are some of the major components of the high-tech Industry 4.0 ecosystem. Nine Technologies Transforming Industrial Production and its impact on our daily life Advanced digital technology is already used in manufacturing, but with Industry 4.0, it will transform production. It will lead to greater efficiencies and change traditional production relationships among suppliers, producers, and customers\u2014as well as between human and machine. Nine technology trends form the building blocks of Industry 4.0. 1. BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS In an Industry 4.0 context, the collection and comprehensive evaluation of data from many different sources\u2014production equipment, enterprise systems, customer-management systems, etc. will become standard to support real-time decision making and all digital experiences. 2. AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS Robots will eventually interact with one another and work safely side by side with humans and learn from them. These robots will cost less and have a greater range of capabilities than those used in manufacturing today. 3. SIMULATION Simulations will be used more extensively in plant operations to leverage real-time data and mirror the physical world in a virtual model, which can include machines, products, and humans. This will allow operators to test and optimize the machine settings for the next product in line in the virtual world before the physical changeover, thereby driving down machine setup times and increasing quality. 4. HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION With Industry 4.0, companies, departments, functions, and capabilities will become much more cohesive, as cross-company, universal data-integration networks evolve and enable truly automated value chains. 5. THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS Industry 4.0 means that more devices\u2014sometimes including unfinished products\u2014will be enriched with embedded computing. This will allow field devices to communicate and interact both with one another and with more centralized controllers, as necessary. It will also decentralize analytics and decision making, enabling real-time responses. 6. CYBERSECURITY With the increased connectivity and use of standard communications protocols that come with Industry 4.0, the need to protect critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cybersecurity threats increases dramatically. As a result, secure, reliable communications, as well as sophisticated identity and access management of machines and users, are essential. 7. THE CLOUD More production-related undertakings will require increased data sharing across sites and company boundaries. At the same time, the performance of cloud technologies will improve, achieving reaction times of just several milliseconds. As a result, machine data and functionality will increasingly be deployed to the cloud, enabling more data-driven services for production systems. 8. ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING Companies have just begun to adopt additive manufacturing, such as 3-D printing, which they use mostly to prototype and produce individual components. With Industry 4.0, these additive-manufacturing methods will be widely used to produce small batches of customized products that offer construction advantages, such as complex, lightweight designs. 9. AUGMENTED REALITY Augmented-reality-based systems support a variety of services, such as selecting parts in a warehouse and sending repair instructions over mobile devices. These systems are currently in their infancy, but in the future, companies will make much broader use of augmented reality to provide workers with real-time information to improve decision making and work procedures.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.  I have the eponymous book, but I haven't read it yet. I'll try anyway.  Industry 1.0 was probably steam. Industry 2.0 Oil. Industry 3.0 Computers Industry 4.0 Automation.   If that isn't in the book, sorry... it's a crack. Automation is a game changer in the following way.  From 1-3 above, all of these expanded opportunity for people with skill.  Skill and learning became more valuable in a worker. Now something quite profound is happening.  Machines are no longer skill/labor enhancing, they are skill/labor destroying.  You really have to spend a few days internalizing this... because it is the most profound event in modern human history. If you think about wealth and wages for just a second, the outcome is painful and obvious.  Skilled people are declining in value... for the first time since industry started. I like to point out dentists.  Now they check for oral cancer, find some issues, fill some holes, etc.  There is no way, being completely honest, a human can do this better than a machine.  Zero chance.  The outcome is inevitable.  It might take a while.  Dentists may form labor unions of sorts, etc. that fight it, but it is inevitable.  Don't go to dental school, it's over!  Sorry, but until someone issues a sustained argument as to why that is not so in logical and easily validated terms, it is too painfully obvious to ignore. There is really no going back now.  Automation is... well, inevitable.  It is the optimal solution for society and for investors.  So, like Uber, it will occur... whether you are a black taxi driver in London or not.  We now have satnav, and no one needs \"the knowledge\" any more. All of life is accelerating toward these outcomes.  And many people will read this and do the obvious thing--join the last swings of movement toward automation and accelerate it even more!    Time for a New Deal. ",
