            "answer_text": "You should always find the root source. It can be very untrustworthy, especially when you ask Google a question and it comes up with an answer that someone has written on a forum website. The person writing that information could be quite literally anyone, but people take that as fact simply because it is the first thing that pops up. That\u2019s called an algorithm my friend. To give you one example of a question asked on the internet: \u2018Do sugary foods cause acne?\u2019\u2019 First answer: \u2018\u2019Sugar's oxidative properties can provoke acne and breakouts. Sugar and foods high on the glycemic index (meaning foods that, once ingested, convert quickly into glucose and cause your body's insulin levels to elevate), lead to a burst of inflammation that goes throughout your entire body.\u2019\u2019 - Source:  ForbesForbes is a global media company, focusing on business, investing, technology, entrepreneurship, leadership, and lifestyle.http://FORBES.com  (20th January 2017) Should this information be trusted? Absolutely not. There has been no academic or scientific research to suggest that sugary foods do in fact cause acne. However, here is a link to the NHS (National Health Service UK) official website: Acne This debunks certain myths concerning the causes of acne, including that of sugar consumption and the link to breakouts. Which one do you trust more? The NHS or Forbes? Both contain information on the same topic found on the internet, though both pieces of information conflict one another. One is based on scientific evidence, the other is based on opinion. So, Should I trust the information available on Internet? Don\u2019t take the first thing you see as truth. Use your common sense, and be sceptical. The internet is a great source of information, but there is also a lot of garbage on here. That\u2019s why doctors don\u2019t like people using the internet to self diagnose medical problems. You type in leg pain and come back thinking you have Thrombosis. You have a headache, you\u2019ve got a tumour. You don\u2019t like the way you look? You definitely have Body Dysmorphic Disorder. ",

            "answer_text": "Should You or Should you not depends on the information you are seeking. If you ask me, I\u2019d simply suggest you Take everything, every single bit of every information, with a pinch of salt. In plain and simple words, don't trust any single place, any single bit of information on its own without verifying it or, until or unless you have developed your own mindset for how reputed, or how authenticate that particular site is. For example, Wikipedia has no single author to write each and every article. You can every create your own page with your information on it. Does that mean whatever you read/write on internet is true?Newspapers change statements for their benefits. They don\u2019t care if you\u2019ll be misguided. They mean business and would do anything for that.There are some reasons to prove that you must not believe everything you read on internet. Some websites have sponsors who pay for specific content to promote products or ideas. The information could then be biased.There is no quality assurance when it comes to information found on the Internet. Anyone can post anything.Information found on the web has not been checked for accuracy before publishing it.Not all websites are same. Their purposes are different and so it the quality of information.Some websites are old and the information found there could be out-dated.To give you examples If you are learning something about technology, general knowledge, etc you can trust the information. It can be partial, but it\u2019ll be helpfulIf you are reading something about someone\u2019s recent (personal mostly) activities (politician, celebrity ), do not trust such information whole heartily as it could be misguiding. Such information is just for entertainment purpose.If you come across any offensive information (mostly religious, caste-ism type), avoid it and do not share. Such information is always fake.If you are reading about history of particular place/person/country, you can trust it but again, it may not be the complete truth.Hope this answers your question and clarifies some things for anyone who reads on internet. Cheers..!!! ",
