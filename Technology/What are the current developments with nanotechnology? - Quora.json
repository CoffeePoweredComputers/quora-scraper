            "answer_text": "Goodness gracious, where do we begin? Polymeric biocompatible nanoparticles are a hot topic! Nanotechnology is seeing a huge exploration for a class of nanoparticles to be used as miniature packages for admistering drugs. Many labs are searching for the \u201cNanotech Holy Grail\u201d of these classes of materials to increase the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs, or vaccines, or atherosclerosis drugs. Any day now, a breakthrough will change modern medicine forever, in that diseases will no longer be death sentences and harmful side effects will be a thing of the past. Some examples of prominent researchers in the polymeric nanoparticles include: Robert Langer, Samuel Stupp, Darrell Irvine, Melody Schwartz, and Matt Tirrell! Google them and see what they're about!
