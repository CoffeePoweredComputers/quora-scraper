            "answer_text": "Once it\u2019s been in for a while the only way I know is by exploratory surgery, they become almost impossible to find. I don\u2019t believe you can get one out any other way. I do know one of my family members cat died and he was told by his veterinarian it caused by the chip which caused his cat to have Cancer that killed him. I didn\u2019t know this could happen, it must have been from a foreign body from being in the cat. He adopted the cat a long time ago and they always inject the micro chips. I was really upset to hear the cats death from the chip and I will be looking further into it. I found a young Boston terrier one day on the side of a highway, he had a German Shepherd sized shock collar wrapped twice around his neck, he a little guy about 9 or 10 months old. This little guy's neck had been burned and all the hair was gone from this shock collar, it had to have been turned up very high to burn all his hair off, it also had sores. The dog was malnourished and was very scary but he was out hunting females, he had come up behind me and was hunching on my lower leg, but I looked at hi9m he would run off with fear in his eyes. I found the owner and she was mad at the dog and she told me to leave him were he was and said no you come get him, I\u2019m waiting for you. I wasn\u2019t sure what gone on. My senses were telling me to drive off with the dog, I waited about 5 minutes and drove off with the dog, I couldn\u2019t bare the thought of me giving this dog to someone who said leave the dog there. She didn\u2019t know what I looked like, so I was gone and I was in another state also. That was the best decision I ever made. The poor dog was in terrible shape and had severely abused, he was a fear biter, he had been kicked, his hips were in bad shape, he stubbled in hind end, he was not a sweet dog at all, he scared and would bite. He has been one of the hardest dog I ever tried to rehabilitate, it's taken me close to two year to get all the bite out of him. He had lost all trust and he was pitiful, not a happy go lucky dog at all, but now he is all worth it. He bit me numerous times and I couldn\u2019t show any emotion, I had to act like it didn\u2019t hurt at all and what ever I was doing with him, it was going to keep happening, I wasn\u2019t hurting him but he had learned to bite to get people away from him, once he learned I wasn\u2019t going away and I was kind to him, didn\u2019t raise your voice and what ever he did we just let it pass and turned to be my lap dog, he is a cat lover, he had a lot of respect for my cat, my cat doesn\u2019t like any dogs but his own and once he knew the rules he has been nothing but a cute lap dog, sweet as he could be. I was afraid he was going to chipped, he was a beautiful Boston and I told my Vet what happened and they will good we don\u2019t check for chips in every dog that comes in and that's the it was left. They know I rescue and adopt all my dogs. I was sick with worry until I was honest and told them what happened. I believe in stealing dogs, but in this situation, I sure did and I would do it again, if I have too. He couldn\u2019t go back the previous owner I know he was biting her and she was shocking him and it just about ruined his life, he would have been put to sleep. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a bit long, but I think it's worth it since it's based on my real life experiences. I don't believe that it would be possible once the chip has been injected in the dog and has been there for very long. What's \u201cvery long\u201d? I'd have to say about a month. You see, the microchop is inserted via a syringe under the dog's fur - usually between the shoulder blade area. It's about as big as a grain of rice. The internal tissue grows around the chip and simply encompasses it. The chip simply doesn't move\u2026or it moves very little. It's hypoallergenic so it doesn't cause a rash or a blister or a bad reaction in the dog. You don't know that there is a chip there unless you scan the dog with a microchip reader which can detect the chip and read the number. I used to insert microchips in puppers I raised and sold. One time I inserted one, checked for it and got a negative reading\u2026no chip. I did several more scans but it seemed like that was a dud chip even though I scanned the chip before injecting it. Shazzbutt! I then injected a second chip and scanned the dog again. Of course the first chip came up! And with a bit more scanning so did the second chip. At $12 or so per chip cost\u2026oh well\u2026a double chipper. That's to tell you that the chips just do not fail. The reader (scanner) might fail but not the chips\u2026they are inert objects. They have to be detected by a scanning device. You wouldn't know I have three screws in my hip unless you I either told you or you saw my x-rays. That's sort of how microchips work\u2026.you either know one is there or you scan for one. Bad example but it has to do. I don't know how they work\u2026I wish I did so I could explain this better, but there is something in the chip and the scanner that allows the chip to be detected despite being surrounded by doggie body tissue. So okay\u2026I had a doggie who died (weird disease/ailment) and I asked could they do a necropsy (that's what we would call an autopsy) and could they get the chip back. They got the chip back but they said it was such a pain in the ass to do that! They had to basically pick the back of his neck to pieces to find the chip. It was simply a part of the tissue then - well, not part of the tissue - but so over grown and surrounded by the tissue that if he hadn't been dead, they would not do that sort of surgery. We're talking a mini Dachshund under 12 pounds. And the size of a grain of rice. By the way, it still worked. I don't know of any way to remove a chip once it has been there for long - the tissue simply grows around it too quickly. It's not a surgery a veterinarian would do because it is simply TOO involved and WHY? As to \u201cdestroying\u201d one in a dog\u2026I don't know of a way without obviously destroying the dog. As I said, the effort to recover the chip from the dead dog worked. We got the chip and it still worked. I'm curious why one would want eliminate the presence of a microchip. I can accept that this is \u201cBig Brother\u201d or whatever\u2026I don't like that idea either, but it has benefits for pets. Bottom line in pets\u2026you can't destroy them or eliminate them without serious risk to the pet. Perhaps within a week of injection, but let a month go by\u2026no vet wants to do this type of surgery\u2026 Not in the best interests of the pet. ",
