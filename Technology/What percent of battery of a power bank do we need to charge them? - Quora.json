            "answer_text": "A power bank has certain capacity, e.g. 5000mAh. When 100% charged, its battery has 5000mAh to offer. The real world capacity will be down to 3500\u20134500mAh due to overrating and aging of cells. Mix in voltage regulation and charging losses, and so you may JUST be able to recharge a phone with a 3000mAh battery from 0 to 100% with your fully charged 5000mAh powerbank. If you charge this very power bank to 50%, it will only charge about 1500mAh of your phone battery before cutting out. At low temperatures, these numbers may drop another 20\u201330%. It makes a lot of sense to just top off your powerbank charge level near 100% before you to take it with you, just to have all the energy available whenever your gadgets may need it. Note that just about any lithium battery does degrade / age / lose capacity much faster at 100% charge than at lower charge levels. So to preserve the battery, it makes sense to keep it around 50\u201380% rather than fully charged. Today, however, powerbanks are cheap and disposable, so in general you want to have them fully charged, and rather than worrying about their cells, keep an eye on your phone or other gadget\u2019s state of charge, because those batteries are usually much more expensive and orders of magnitude harder to get hold of and have them replaced (especially in modern fully enclosed phones). Better toss away a $15 powerbank every other year than send in your iPhone for a $80 repair because you notoriously keep your charge near 100%. So my advice is keep your power banks at max. 80% for long term storage and top them off before use. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on average usage and if you fully deplete and recharge your power bank to 100% every day, it should serve you well for 1.5 years. And based on your need to keep your phone charged up as many times as possible, this is practically best achieved if your power bank is fully charged. So, take every opportunity to charge it up. If a solar power bank like HG, the embedded solar panel will automatically begin to recharge the power bank on exposure to light and will continue to do that for as long as there is light.
