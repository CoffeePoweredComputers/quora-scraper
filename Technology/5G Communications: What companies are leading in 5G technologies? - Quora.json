            "answer_text": " I recently did some market research in 5G and converted that into a guide which has described the research of some big telecom companies. The guide has more than 10 companies who intensely research on 5G technology. And the company which seemed leading on 5G to me is Ericsson. Why? You asked. Here is why. Ericsson claims to be the only vendor that is currently working in all continents to make 5G a global standard for the next generation of wireless technology. Their 5G radio prototypes are the first products designed to enable operators to conduct live field trials in their own networks which helps operators to get a greater understanding for the potential of 5G in their own networks and environments. Given their expertise in the 5G domain, many companies across the globe will collaborate with Ericsson. They have already performed several trials by collaborating with domestic vendors. In February, Ericsson and Korea Telecom with Intel conducted a 5G trial connecting a car to a live 5G network right in the center of Seoul. In the dense urban environment, 4K video was streamed to and from the car, giving an idea of how 5G will change the experience for car passengers.Last year, the company joined with Celcom Axiata Berhad for first ever 5G testing in Malaysia. It\u2019s also the first 5G trial conducted on the 28 GHz band in South East Asia. The trial showcased Celcom\u2019s commitment to providing the best services to Malaysia.Batelco and Ericsson have conducted Bahrain\u2019s first 5G trial which aims to drive innovation for IoT applications using the next-generation mobile network technology. The trial was conducted at Batelco\u2019s Headquarters during their 5G Forum event and demonstrated 5G capabilities in a real-world environment and over a live network, including tests on speed, latency, and beam steering, reaching a record speed of 25 Gbps.Multiple companies teamed up to make 5G available in some cities. Tallink, Telia, Ericsson, and Intel have created a 5G test and exploration area at the Port of Tallinn. The trail network is delivering internet to the commercial, passenger cruise ships while in the port. With million passengers annually on its Baltic sea routes, Tallink is one of the largest ocean transport companies of Europe.In India, Ericsson partnered with Indian telecom Bharti Airtel for 5G.Ericsson showcased the first-ever live 5G demonstration in India. The demonstration using Ericsson\u2019s 5G test bed and 5G New Radio (NR) delivered a throughput of 5.7 Gbps and ultra-low latency of 3 milliseconds. According to a latest Ericsson study, 5G technology will enable a $27.3 Billion revenue potential for the Indian telecom operators by 2026.Ericsson connection also reached the Pacific region where they made an alliance with Australian telecom NBN for kicking off 5G trials in Melbourne. \u201cAs with any new technology, there have been claims made about how 5G will impact the fixed broadband market,\u201d Owen said during the CommsDay Summit in Sydney.While Ericsson is making several alliances, it is also working on making 5G\u2019s speed better. In a partnership with SK Telecom and BMW Korea, Ericsson used advanced 5G technology to track a connected car traveling up to 170 km/hour to demonstrate data transmission speeds on a 5G network. Using advanced beamforming and beam tracking, the high-performance network connection supported point-to-point data transmission from a connected car traveling up to 170 kilometers per hour with downlink speeds of 3.6 Gbps.Ericsson is partnering with the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology to develop so-called blade integrated disks, or blisks, for Germany-based jet engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines.Ericsson recently signed a 3-year deal with Movistar Argentina to transform its Radio Access Network to expand network coverage and improve the mobile broadband experience to its customers.Ericsson also plans to invest in the Indian market as for them it is a crucial market for their business. They will start deploying the 5G networks in India in 2019 and major deployment will begin in 2020.Moreover, the company also secures all the research and inventions they are making. For example, for securing their inventions in 5G, Ericsson filed a landmark patent application for 5G with WIPO and USPTO. The patent application, which combines the work of 130 Ericsson inventors, is the largest in cellular communications in terms of the number of inventors, anywhere in the world. It shows the industry how Ericsson has approached 5G standardization with a comprehensive view that connects individual inventions in a complete 5G telecommunications network, rather than focusing on any smaller individual inventions. In a recent event at 5G MENA 2018, Ericsson presented its latest 5G strategy which would bring together telecom operators and IoT specialists across the region. All these research and working show that they are leading in 5G. Still, if you really want to know about other, you can read other 5G major companies\u2019 research. ",

            "answer_text": "Huawei is an important participant in the global 5G construction. Recently, Xinsheng Community disclosed that 1 367 5G base stations were built in 19 days by LG U+Korea. This is the fastest 5G base station construction in history. The equipment supplier for LG U+5G base station and planning and construction service is from China, named Huawei.  5G technology is in the commercial sprint stage, and this year will be the key year of 5G commerce. Once it is applied and popularized on a large scale, it is of great social significance. As the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Huawei attracts attention from all walks of life in 5G progress. At a 5G conference at the end of January this year, Huawei launched a 5G base station-oriented Tiangu chip, and demonstrated 5G base station, as well as brought 5G terminal chip Balong 5000, 5G mobile phone will also be released on this year's MWC (Mobile World Congress). For Huawei, standing in the new era of 5G, it explores 5G applications with all walks of life, creates new business models and jointly builds an interconnected intelligent world. It has set off a wave of 5G construction all over the world. More than 30 5G commercial contracts have been signed in various countries around the world, and more than 25,000 5G base stations have been sent to the world. On December 1, 2018, the three major Korean operators announced that 5G was officially commercialized. As of the day of the 5G commercial release in Korea, 5804 5G base stations had been deployed, of which 4133 were LG U +. China Huawei is the equipment supplier that provides 5G base station and planning and construction services for LG U+. As of December 19, 2018, LG U+has built 5,500 5G base stations. From December 1 to December 19, 4133 base stations were disclosed. In 19 days, LG U+built 1,367 5G base stations. This is the fastest construction speed of 5G base stations in history, while the number of LG U+competitors is less than 1,000. His speed is so fast that his opponents are caught by surprise. The integration of 5G technology, especially with AI technology, will promote the digital transformation of society. It can be said that Huawei plays an important role in the global communication market. Many countries have expressed that if Huawei's entry is restricted, it will affect the whole nation's communication network construction. It can be seen that the global 5G construction of Huawei is of great significance. ",
