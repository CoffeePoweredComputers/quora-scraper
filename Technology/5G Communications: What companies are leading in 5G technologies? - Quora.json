            "answer_text": " I recently did some market research in 5G and converted that into a guide which has described the research of some big telecom companies. The guide has more than 10 companies who intensely research on 5G technology. And the company which seemed leading on 5G to me is Ericsson. Why? You asked. Here is why. Ericsson claims to be the only vendor that is currently working in all continents to make 5G a global standard for the next generation of wireless technology. Their 5G radio prototypes are the first products designed to enable operators to conduct live field trials in their own networks which helps operators to get a greater understanding for the potential of 5G in their own networks and environments. Given their expertise in the 5G domain, many companies across the globe will collaborate with Ericsson. They have already performed several trials by collaborating with domestic vendors. In February, Ericsson and Korea Telecom with Intel conducted a 5G trial connecting a car to a live 5G network right in the center of Seoul. In the dense urban environment, 4K video was streamed to and from the car, giving an idea of how 5G will change the experience for car passengers.Last year, the company joined with Celcom Axiata Berhad for first ever 5G testing in Malaysia. It\u2019s also the first 5G trial conducted on the 28 GHz band in South East Asia. The trial showcased Celcom\u2019s commitment to providing the best services to Malaysia.Batelco and Ericsson have conducted Bahrain\u2019s first 5G trial which aims to drive innovation for IoT applications using the next-generation mobile network technology. The trial was conducted at Batelco\u2019s Headquarters during their 5G Forum event and demonstrated 5G capabilities in a real-world environment and over a live network, including tests on speed, latency, and beam steering, reaching a record speed of 25 Gbps.Multiple companies teamed up to make 5G available in some cities. Tallink, Telia, Ericsson, and Intel have created a 5G test and exploration area at the Port of Tallinn. The trail network is delivering internet to the commercial, passenger cruise ships while in the port. With million passengers annually on its Baltic sea routes, Tallink is one of the largest ocean transport companies of Europe.In India, Ericsson partnered with Indian telecom Bharti Airtel for 5G.Ericsson showcased the first-ever live 5G demonstration in India. The demonstration using Ericsson\u2019s 5G test bed and 5G New Radio (NR) delivered a throughput of 5.7 Gbps and ultra-low latency of 3 milliseconds. According to a latest Ericsson study, 5G technology will enable a $27.3 Billion revenue potential for the Indian telecom operators by 2026.Ericsson connection also reached the Pacific region where they made an alliance with Australian telecom NBN for kicking off 5G trials in Melbourne. \u201cAs with any new technology, there have been claims made about how 5G will impact the fixed broadband market,\u201d Owen said during the CommsDay Summit in Sydney.While Ericsson is making several alliances, it is also working on making 5G\u2019s speed better. In a partnership with SK Telecom and BMW Korea, Ericsson used advanced 5G technology to track a connected car traveling up to 170 km/hour to demonstrate data transmission speeds on a 5G network. Using advanced beamforming and beam tracking, the high-performance network connection supported point-to-point data transmission from a connected car traveling up to 170 kilometers per hour with downlink speeds of 3.6 Gbps.Ericsson is partnering with the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology to develop so-called blade integrated disks, or blisks, for Germany-based jet engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines.Ericsson recently signed a 3-year deal with Movistar Argentina to transform its Radio Access Network to expand network coverage and improve the mobile broadband experience to its customers.Ericsson also plans to invest in the Indian market as for them it is a crucial market for their business. They will start deploying the 5G networks in India in 2019 and major deployment will begin in 2020.Moreover, the company also secures all the research and inventions they are making. For example, for securing their inventions in 5G, Ericsson filed a landmark patent application for 5G with WIPO and USPTO. The patent application, which combines the work of 130 Ericsson inventors, is the largest in cellular communications in terms of the number of inventors, anywhere in the world. It shows the industry how Ericsson has approached 5G standardization with a comprehensive view that connects individual inventions in a complete 5G telecommunications network, rather than focusing on any smaller individual inventions. In a recent event at 5G MENA 2018, Ericsson presented its latest 5G strategy which would bring together telecom operators and IoT specialists across the region. All these research and working show that they are leading in 5G. Still, if you really want to know about other, you can read other 5G major companies\u2019 research. ",

            "answer_text": "Huawei is an important participant in the global 5G construction. Recently, Xinsheng Community disclosed that 1 367 5G base stations were built in 19 days by LG U+Korea. This is the fastest 5G base station construction in history. The equipment supplier for LG U+5G base station and planning and construction service is from China, named Huawei.  5G technology is in the commercial sprint stage, and this year will be the key year of 5G commerce. Once it is applied and popularized on a large scale, it is of great social significance. As the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Huawei attracts attention from all walks of life in 5G progress. At a 5G conference at the end of January this year, Huawei launched a 5G base station-oriented Tiangu chip, and demonstrated 5G base station, as well as brought 5G terminal chip Balong 5000, 5G mobile phone will also be released on this year's MWC (Mobile World Congress). For Huawei, standing in the new era of 5G, it explores 5G applications with all walks of life, creates new business models and jointly builds an interconnected intelligent world. It has set off a wave of 5G construction all over the world. More than 30 5G commercial contracts have been signed in various countries around the world, and more than 25,000 5G base stations have been sent to the world. On December 1, 2018, the three major Korean operators announced that 5G was officially commercialized. As of the day of the 5G commercial release in Korea, 5804 5G base stations had been deployed, of which 4133 were LG U +. China Huawei is the equipment supplier that provides 5G base station and planning and construction services for LG U+. As of December 19, 2018, LG U+has built 5,500 5G base stations. From December 1 to December 19, 4133 base stations were disclosed. In 19 days, LG U+built 1,367 5G base stations. This is the fastest construction speed of 5G base stations in history, while the number of LG U+competitors is less than 1,000. His speed is so fast that his opponents are caught by surprise. The integration of 5G technology, especially with AI technology, will promote the digital transformation of society. It can be said that Huawei plays an important role in the global communication market.

            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s IT industry is split between those who worry that it\u2019s already too late to catch the 5G gravy train and those who still think they still have plenty of time. This confusion is partly due to the mixed signals sent by the telco giants, but it is also due to lack of a clear timetable for the rollout of next generation mobile technology. In fact, \u201c5G\u201d is just a marketing term that covers a wide range of new mobile technologies. Back in early 2012, the standards committee of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - originally the International Telegraph Union - called for a network capacity of up to 20 gigabits. To put that in context: while LTE can theoretically achieve speeds of around 300Mbps, in reality, we are not likely to get more than around 42Mbps; standard 4G has real-world speeds of just around 14Mbps. 5G trials are taking place today, with Verizon in the US, for example, demonstrating that its technology can achieve 30-50 times faster download speeds than currently possible with 4G. That would enable you to download a full movie in around 15 seconds, versus around 6 minutes on 4G. Most telcos and other providers are talking about 2020 as the likely date for commercial availability of 5G, but some seem intent on stealing a march on the competition. While Chinese manufacturer ZTE was the first handset manufacturer to showcase a 5G smartphone at GSMA Mobile World Congress in 2017, Lenovo has eyes set on 5G smartphone leadership, based on chipsets provided by Qualcomm, an American company. Has the future already begun? And will 5G really herald a new era, much like the introduction of the internet itself more than a quarter of a century ago? One thing is clear: By using a much wider range of frequencies in a more flexible fashion, 5G has the potential to connect billions of mobile devices. Most of them will not be smartphones at all, but rather sensors and actuators included in a plethora of IoT devices, including automobiles, trains and planes. Engineers are already busy building robots and entire production lines with connection capabilities that rival today\u2019s fixed-line systems, only faster and more securely. 5G is the first mobile standard conceived expressly with machine-to-machine (M2M) applications in mind. Theoretically, at least, this could prove a gigantic shot in the arm for autonomous vehicles and other systems, including \u201csmart factories\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": " As the world remained fixated on the launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone 8 in Sep 2017, a quiet mobile revolution has just begun. Huawei had launched the world\u2019s first 5G network with Deutche Telecom in Germany on 1st Sep 2017.[1] Throughout the dawn of the 21st century, we went though the 2G(digitalization of voice and music), 3G (multimedia communications feature) and 4G(wireless broadband) mobile revolution with the core communications technology monopolized by a few European and United States' companies such as Qualcomm, Verizon and Ericsson. China became the first Asian country to break this communications technology and standards oligopoly held by a handful of US and Europe companies with the launch of 5G (high frequency broadcast) network which can transfer data at 100 times 4G\u2019s capacity at the same speed. Huawei recently unveiled its Kirin 970 chipset[2] which is equipped with the world's first 5G baseband, powering its mobile network throughput at twice the speed of Qualcomm's best Snapdragon chipset. The 970 chipset has 5.5billion Transistors which rivals Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, and does the job with higher efficiency and less heat generated.[3] 5G consumes less power than 4G for a similar amount of data transfer, can has data 10 times the data transfer capacity of 4G chipset. More wireless products could become mainstream and practical for consumer usage such as smart home appliances and mobile accessories. The Kirin 970 is also the world's first AI chipset, with a neural processing unit( NPU ) with processing power twice that of other equivalent CPU, while consuming 50 times less power, which means you can take 1000 pictures on your mobile phone and consumes only 19% of the mobile phone battery, with data transfer capacity and speed 10 times that of a 4G chipset.  Footnotes[1] Deutsche Telekom launches \"Europe's first\" 5G network with Huawei[2] IFA 2017: Huawei reveals low-power Kirin 970 mobile AI chipset[3] Huawei to unveil Kirin 970 SoC with AI Unit, 5.5 billion transistors and 1.2 Gbps LTE speed at IFA 2017",

            "answer_text": "While discussing the deployment of 5G networks, writers and bloggers often mention the initiatives taken by large telecom companies and network solution providers. But we should not forget that many small tech companies and startups also contribute immensely to simplify and speed up mass-scale 5G deployment. Simnovus \u2013 an Indian startup that has been helping device manufacturers to validate 5G devices and network operators to validate base stations by launching a slew of innovative solutions \u2013 UE Simulator and network emulators. Simnovator \u2013 the UE Simulator on COTS developed by Simnovus helps telecom companies to validate base stations without investing in expensive proprietary hardware. Many leading telecom companies already use Simnovator to perform feature and regression testing by running the tests on multiple test beds simultaneously. Likewise, Callbox \u2013 the network emulators on COTS developed by Simnovus \u2013 helps device manufacturers to validate 5G devices under varying network configurations. The device manufacturers can further use Callbox as a unified 5G device testing solution to validate multiple software versions, verify carrier aggregation, eliminate the need for drive testing, and identify device failures. The next-generation solutions like Simnovator and Callbox contribute immensely towards addressing the common challenges in 5G networks and device testing. The effectiveness of these 5G testing solutions can be assessed based on the fact that Simnovator is currently being used by a leading 5G stack provider like Radisys. Also, Callbox is currently being used by a leading manufacturer of ultra-rugged LTE handsets and mobile solutions like RSonim Tech. Hence, it is time to mention the small companies and startups while discussing the commercial deployment of 5G networks. ",

            "answer_text": "This question already have several useful responses and I will not attempt to outsmart them in a response but I would like to draw attention to the following thought process I often use when I analyze this type of topic:  1) The companies that are the most vocal is not always the once that are most advanced but rather the once that has most to win by portraying them self as market leaders.2) The companies not being very vocal can either be that because they have nothing to say and have no real position OR they have a very strong position that could only be hurt by being to vocal publicly.  With this said I would look for companies that might not be vocal or to active in (marketing) conferences but instead is active in 3GPP, NGMN, TM-Forum, (open or closed) 5G trials, 5G test beds etc. With this you can most probably identify a few extra companies in addition to the once mentioned below - two somewhat obvious large company examples is Qualcomm and Intel and a example of a smaller one is Nomor.  Make sure one does not confuse the marketing noise a company do with their relative competitive position in the development of a new technology such as 5G. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi.. This is kinda hard to get it right.. To me, the 3 main companies competing and delivering 5G to the masses are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon. I\u2019m pretty sure the delivery and the technology is the same between the company's. So, I kinda look at through a US Map of coverage. If I looked at the maps correctly, T-mobile seems to have the largest coverage, then AT&T then Verizon. If you are looking for a service provider, maybe do a \u201cGoogle\u201d search for service providers in your area\u2026Check for deals and packages. I\u2019m pretty sure who ever you choose, will give you the 5G service you may be looking for\u2026 What's kinda funny, or maybe odd AT&T invented this technology (Bell Labs) many years ago, yet they don\u2019t lead (to me) in this technology\u2026 go figure So choose wisely, I used to travel a lot for work, I had AT&T (of course), I can remember having dead spots in the Reno /Tahoe area, when I was traveling thru.

But my subjective opinion: HuaweiSamsungDoCoMoEricssonNokiaReal Wireless (*)Korea & China are being very active on national level. That includes the above companies, various other smaller ones and the research labs & universities. Japan is also keen - with the goal of being first to launch for the Olympics in summer 2020. But they have fewer OEMs, and it is still DocoMo who (rather uniquely for a carrier) is investing in R&D. Europe is active too: both with the OEMs and with national money (eg EU research and 5GPP initiative) While there are some specific exceptions (I like KUMU a lot, for example) in general USA is not doing anything like as much.

So if companies are talking (bragging) about trialing 5G in different areas of the world, or demonstrate some capabilities of 5G in lab environments, chances are high that they are not all talking about the same \"5G\", but their own idea of what 5G should be. That said, big players in proposing standards for 5G at the moment are surely Ericsson, Nokia, DoCoMo, Huawei and Samsung, with Huawei and Samsung pushing strongest, as they see a opportunity to \"change the game\" and become owner of the next generation networks.
