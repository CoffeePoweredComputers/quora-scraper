I mean the only thing that change is that the features that the Samsung releases will also be released in Apple phones. They make them equal but having their own status and build quality. While the fans and social media don\u2019t say anything after some days, some trolls were there. But Until they get the quality product from both the companies they are not gonna complaint or do something about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey No way Samsung will be never able to buy Apple, instead Apple will buy the company (Samsung) as it is much more profitable and advance in its views as compared to Samsung. If you see Apple always delivers something different from its counterparts and you have forgotten that Apple had changed the way we use our mobile phones and integrated few technologies to make one such product. Samsung has also done good in its own segment but always lack few important things which are not enough for its products to survive in the market. They always have some problem or other with their devices. As compared to Apple they haven't faced a single problem or defects in their system which makes them a play maker of the smartphone industry. You cannot imagine what will be the outcome of Samsung buying Apple . It would be worst for the industry as a whole. Hope you like my answer!! Thanks for the A2A :) ",
