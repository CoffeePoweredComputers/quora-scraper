            "answer_text": "replace air conditioning? How about \u201cnot air conditioning a space\u201d. Anything that conditions air is \u201cair conditioning\u201d. The alternative is to live in heat/cold. Obviously, the winter times can be done without air conditioning - fire or resistance heaters, but for cold, you\u2019re just going to have a difficult time finding a way to cool your space that isn\u2019t called \u201cair conditioning\u201d or more generally \u201cHVAC\u201d. But to answer the spirit of your question: I believe your analysis of the ozone and air conditioning is based on the world\u2019s use of R22 and other chlorine-dependent refrigerant media. In the US in 2020, just about every new air conditioning unit uses R-410a which has no chlorine. Big step forward, but can only be taken in steps, because it\u2019s a very different beast from R22, from design parameters to very proper ways to fill / refill the system with refrigerant. It will phase out R22 systems, and eventually there will be no R22 found anymore\u2026.and years from then we will be talking about some even newer refrigerant we came up with, or we\u2019ll have gone to localized campus-style chilled water systems, as the buildings in downtown Houston run off of and a completely different set of \u201cgreen\u201d challenges. The other more structural answer to your question is \u201cstop building crap dwellings.\u201d the higher the overall R-value of your building, and the less humidity infiltration you have within it, the less refrigerant and air movement you might need. Less tons of air conditioning, less refrigerant. Or just be like china. open your windows and turn off the AC unit that you installed, check it for leaks periodically. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends, on geography, size of area where u want to control temperature, budget etc. Commercially chillers, geothermal heat pumps, fluid based piping that are embedded in floor wall ceilings are some of the options. in fluid based piping setup in summers cooled liquid is run through pipes that are embedded into walls, floor, cieling or vents of building and that cools the environment in summers , and in winter heated fluid is circulated to radiate heat these options are efficient than regular ac units. more suggestions are welcome.
