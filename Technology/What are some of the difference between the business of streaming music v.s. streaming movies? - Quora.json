            "answer_text": "This is a massive question which needs to be looked at on a few different levels. But when it comes to only the business side (forget technology though I could write a novel on that as well, and happy to if anyone wants) let's look at the three biggest factors, library, licensing and operations.  Now that being said - you need to look at this in at least one more level down, because a video service isn't the defining factor as to how the business works....you have to separate the TV portion of a service from the Movie portion of the service.  1) Library - music -  there are 3 major labels (Universal, Warner, Sony) and then a series of indie labels. You MUST have all 3 major to launch a sucessful streaming service. This is true almost globally (though some parts of Asia have other significant labels or the majors aren't important) Add to that you need 16M+ tracks to sound even in the conversation (Spotify has 22M+). Now no one is going to listen to more than 1M tracks...but its a marketing number- movies - There are 6 + 1 major studios (sony, warner, universal, paramount, fox, disney + lionsgate). There are other important studios (ie MGM) but those 7 drive the most revenue. They all have some global clout but unlike music, there are places in europe where local content is a must (ie France where about 50% of revenue comes from French studios) Another difference from music is you don't need them all to launch. A good rule of thumb is actually 3+ majors and 2 or 3 indies and you are good to go. Why? When you go to rent movies in stores, people are used to certain movies being unavailable so in general they will just choose something else...not so in music. The libraries are also much smaller 2000+ is really good.- TV - TV is tough as its very very local. You can't launch in France with TV without Canal+ programming and you can't launch in the UK without BBC programming. So you actually can't approach this too globally, you have to think locally. Libraries are smaller in size than music as well 10,000+ different episodes is really good- Summary Licensing - Music licensing and movie licensing are more global but there are must haves in music to launch while TV and movie gives leeway. 2) Licensing - if anyone is still reading- movies and TV - pretty straight forward licensing. You go to the studio and network - sign licensing agreements, you are good to go in the countries those cover. You can get global licenses from the majors in a lot of cases (or at least wide licenses). TV you do generally do local licenses because a show produced in Germany won't usually make much sense to sell in Canada. Music is just really complicated for license. The labels you can look at globally (one company) but publishing(and mechanical rights) and performance rights are on a country by country basis. And in fact often take multiple agreements per country (and the US...don't ask:) So from a licensing approach its a much more complicated situation than movie or TV 3) Operational costs - well the big thing here is the size of a music file, TV file or video file. MP3s (and even the raw wave files) are astronomically smaller than their video compatriots - in fact HD movies get to 6 to 8 GBs. So one of the major operational differences is simply the cost in ingesting, storing and streaming of music v movies. Generally when you do a music service business plan, those costs are a rounding error. While in video services they are seen as a significant cost (its why companies like Netflix look to build their own content delivery networks). Add to that, with video you need to do a ton of encoding - which means different types of playback \"file-types\" but also frame rates and resolutions...why? because playing an 8GB 1080p 33fps movie on an iphone is a total waste of bandwidth...and if you happen to drop to 3G basically impossible. Music - its generally just a single encoded file that will work cross platform pretty well. That is a really brief (though it may not look like it) difference that doesn't delve to much into techology etc. but from a business stand point thats what you would probably care the most about. ",

            "answer_text": "The Internet is changing the consumption of entertainment. First to fall was music, due to the low bandwidth requirements. Now there is Apple Music, perhaps the largest (but it is a low cost, paid service) and many free radio stations and other companies, like Spotify, on the Internet. Radio Paradise is a spectacular music service run by ex disc jockies, so they get the \u201cradio part\u201d right. There are hundreds of Internet radio stations. Many modern stereo receivers have the ability to play Internet radio stations directly with an Internet feed. Streaming movies is newer, based on the proliferation of high speed Internet. There are many sites which, for free, allow to see blatant copyright violations up to 1080p movies based on foreign countries with lax copyright laws allowing people with handycams to videotape a movie in a theater. Sometimes, you can tell the taping was done in a crowded theater. There are also more organized, for pay streaming services, like Netflix which find original programming, like regular and cable TV, is the recipe for success. Netflix spends over $2 billion (U.S.) per year on original content. Apple TV and \u201cSmart\u201d TVs all have the idea of being able to work with and playback streaming content, such as accessing Netflix on the TV/Apple TV not needing a computer, in between. This is the story of \u201capps,\u201d which are the future of TV. ",
