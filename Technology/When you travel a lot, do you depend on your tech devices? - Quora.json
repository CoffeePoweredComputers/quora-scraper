            "answer_text": "Yeah I do. Though I carry maps and a detailed plan of the trip, I tend to use Nokia Maps to get to the destination. The best part about Nokia Maps is even if you're in a no connectivity region the maps work very well i.e Nokia Maps can be used online as well as offline. At times for finding routes where there were no people Nokia Maps was my savior. Apart from mobile phone (smart phone to be precise) I didn't ever find any tech device to be of that use during my travel. ",
