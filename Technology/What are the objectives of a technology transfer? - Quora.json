            "answer_text": "While the classic examples of technology transfer involve technology from universities or government laboratories being licensed to and commercialized by for-profit companies, many other types of transactions involving intellectual property (IP) may be considered technology transfer. Aside from IP licensing, these transactions may include the sale of IP, formation of partnerships or joint ventures, or the founding of a startup company. The primary objective of a technology transfer is fairly simply: Convey IP rights through a transaction that is beneficial to all parties involved. Outside of the transaction itself, a longer-term objective is to make new technologies and products that incorporate them available for use by consumers by transferring IP rights to an organization that has the means to make these technologies and products commercially available. Even more broadly, contributing to the economic development of the organizations, nations, and regions involved with the development, launch, sale, and support of new products may be considered an overarching objective of tech transfer.
