            "answer_text": "They vary, but the last ones made, the 2016 OLED 4k sets with passive 3D support, were the best. I have an LG E6P - the last model they made with 3D support, and it looks better and brighter than the theater. I can even watch 3D comfortably during the day with some light coming through the windows. It turned me into a 3D blu-ray collector. I had a previous 3D set and a fair number on Blu-ray, but this made me want to experience more as they look so good. There\u2019s two main ways to do 3D - active shutter, and passive 3D. Active shutter requires glasses that need charged and sync with the TV, they use LCD to turn one lens black, then the other. The TV swaps the images in sync with the glasses, and you get the 3D effect. My 1080p 3D set was active, as I wanted each eye to get a full 1080p (more on that below), but it also has more crosstalk (seeing double) since TVs can only change images so fast. Mine was 240hz, meaning it could swap images 240 times a second, showing the movie at the proper 24 frames per second on each eye. Passive 3D has less crosstalk, but each eye only gets half the pixels. So a 1080p passive set sends 540 lines to each eye. There is a filter on the screen, and it uses the same glasses that most theaters use, which filter polarized light. While this tends to look more solid with less crosstalk, I didn\u2019t like the idea of only getting 540 lines per eye. Then came 4k passive sets with 3D support. Since 4k is twice the lines of 1080p - half the lines for each eye still leaves 1080p per eye. So you get the best of both worlds. Both eyes get 1080p, and it is passive with almost no crosstalk. The way it compensates for brightness using the OLED screen is amazing too, looking basically as bright as a 2D image. My eyes don\u2019t water, and it appears very solid. There\u2019s no standard for 4k 3D at this point. The only 3D displays you can currently get are projectors. But 4k passive sets make for amazing 1080p 3D sets. They basically hyped 3D when the sets weren\u2019t great and filmmakers were figuring it out and being gimmicky. Once the TVs and movies got better, they didn\u2019t call attention to it, and it faded away. I think they could have done a \u2018see it again for the first time\u2019 type campaign. Most 3D movies I have to import from the UK or elsewhere now as well, as it is harder to find them in the US. Even abroad, there are some movies that just don\u2019t get 3D releases at all now for Blu-ray. I don\u2019t want everything to be 3D, but if the director made the movie for 3D, I want to see it that way. Home 3D before was ok, then it got perfect the last year it was available. My only hope is that the new Avatar movies spark interest in people wanting to experience them at home, and prompt them to release a new 3D standard for 4k as well as HDR color. ",
