            "answer_text": "I study Illustration at OCAD, although there are a number of options in Canada and the US that are very good, such as RISD (in Providence, RI), Parsons (NYC), SVA (NYC\u2014also has a renowned illustration MFA program), MICA (Baltimore, MD), California College of the Arts (San Francisco, CA), among others. The benefit of these schools is that the instructors are successful, working illustrators, often fairly well-known in the industry. I think that really helps because we often don't just talk about concepts and our execution of them in our classes\u2014we discuss the ups and downs of the industry, negotiating contracts, working with clients, etc. I would keep in mind that the illustration programs at a lot of these schools, including mine, focuses primarily on illustration as a print (or online, I suppose) medium (editorial, books, comics) as opposed to animation. You can take animation classes as electives if you're at a school that offers that major, but it probably won't be within your major. If you're interested primarily in animation I would recommend looking at schools like CalArts or Sheridan. OCAD is a good place to look at, too, because being in Canada, tuition costs are much lower than in the US. A lot of the US schools offer significant scholarships too if your portfolio is strong enough. I can't speak for the costs for international students at OCAD, but it's pretty affordable for domestic students, all things considered. I'm not sure if this has changed recently or not, but OCAD doesn't do much to facilitate students finding living accommodations while most US schools and larger Canadian universities do offer student housing. I would also suggest, if you live in Toronto, Vancouver, or the US, going to National Portfolio Day in the fall (bring your work, of course) and checking out which schools offer an illustration major. You'll get to meet with a representatives from different schools and show them your work as well as learn a bit about that school\u2019s programs. Best of luck. ",
