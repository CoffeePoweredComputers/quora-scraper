            "answer_text": "For centuries, and even for thousands of years, man learned to \u201cread\u201d the seasons and weather. They didn\u2019t have access to satellites, barometers, humidity gauges, or other instruments, but did have the power of observation. By using precise calendars and documenting weather occurrences each year, over a period of many years a pattern would emerge and they could discern the pattern and estimate what would happen in the future. The documented observations were recorded in almanacs. The Farmer\u2019s Almanac was a popular tool for farmers and ranchers for much of the 20th century. Some of these would not only predict monthly and yearly cycles, but also cycles by decade or century. Meteorologists today now know that these kinds of long-range predictions can be made based on solar activity and the elliptical orbit patterns of the Earth around the sun over a period of years. While the early type of weather forecasting wasn\u2019t as precise as it is today, it was accurate enough to successfully plant and harvest crops, and even take journeys. Sailors and others would often use simple phrases or mnemonic devices to remember upcoming weather events. A couple common ones are: Red sky at morning, sailor take warning.Wind from the south, rain\u2019s in her mouth.Some older prognosticators would even try to read the upcoming weather by how they would feel. If their joints became stiff and painful, they would assume a storm was coming. There may have been a scientific basis for this as well, since physical pain and stiffness can be exacerbated by barometric pressure and temperature changes. Lower pressure and dropping temperatures, which normally precede a storm could result in painful knees or shoulders. ",
