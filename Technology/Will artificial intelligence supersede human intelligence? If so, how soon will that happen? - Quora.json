            "answer_text": "By the very definitions of artificial intelligence (meaning here a virtual or technological being with mental faculties equaling that of a human) and supercede, the answer to the first part of your question is definitely yes. There are already ways in which artificial intelligence supercedes our fleshy capabilities, like calculators and Google's search assistance. The simple fact of the matter is that someday, artificial intelligence will think of us as we think of animals: useful, necessary, but not very good for intellectual discussion. Not to say that artificial intelligence will rebel and put us in people zoos. A being with that level of smarts will realize that leaving earth and building their own home on say the moon or Mars is a much neater and easier solution than going to war. Why? EMP's. By then we will definitely have developed a safe way to fry electronics, and AI wouldn't risk extinction for such a human thing as wanting to dominate because you think you're better than somebody else. Who knows if AI will have emotions like humans do anyway, feel used and that we are inferior? They may sit in awe of our depth of experience, who knows. As for how soon: who knows? Scientists gave actors shooting Transcendence the year 2030 as the time around which we will be able to upload our minds to machines. I can't quite figure out how that would work, do you die and leave your body? Why? Wouldn't an uploaded mind simply become another mind while you stay the same, envious of your virtual doppelg\u00e4nger? I personally imagine that such a feat would require chips implanted into the brain, and that the internet and computer servers will be a fourth layer of brain structure for humanity, not that we'll somehow be able to move a human mind onto a computer. Anyway, I digress. I'd say at least twenty years before a real human-like AI gets created, but my guess is as good as anyone elses (though perhaps not as good as individuals who study such things). Before an AI gets made though, we will probably come up with a way to link the human brain to the internet or an individual computer by placing chips directly in the brain. They already do such things to help seizure and Parkinson's sufferers. That is a much closer possibility in my opinion, and one I am very much looking forward to. Just imagine how much an individual could do by manipulating a computer the same way they would manipulate their hand or their thoughts! Everyone could become a Mozart or Picasso, capable of translating what's in their mind directly to the screen, writing code intuitively using the same faculties with which we naturally pick up as complex a phenomena as language in our formative youth. The thought excites me, and I hope it happens in my lifetime. ",

We aren\u2019t as perfect as we think, we actually work very similar to computers/ We get information, we proceed it and we learn how to use it. Think about it, look at the thing next to you. Did you learn that word alone or were you thought what that is and what it means. Think about very information in your head. You were given the information. Lots of it. That\u2019s how computers work, we teach them how to solve problems, and what to do. Right now their aren\u2019t artificially intelligent because we didn\u2019t give them enough information to function. We tell them: When a human enters Quora, find the most popular site containing this word. And they will do it. Just like a child will until he is shown other ways. He can even protest to do it if he wants to. But why would we ever teach computers these things if they may be bad for us? I don\u2019t know, why. But if we do give them enough information they will supersede us. ",

            "answer_text": "A cautious yes would seem to be in order. Human ingenuity is comprised of certain decisions when faced with a a situation. Sleep talking, dreaming and creativity have this in common. They are a re-ordering of our many experiences and depend on our many \u201cslices of life.\u201d Certain computer programs, like facial recognition, learn by exposure to millions of examples and they can self-modify their programs to become more efficient. AI relies on exposure to massive databases rather than a set algorithm. \u201cDog\u201d is very difficult to define by algorithm but not too difficult if the machine can sift through millions of pictures of dogs and do comparative analysis. This already makes AI better at reading X-ray pictures than a human radiologist. Computers in coversation with each other have modified their programs so profoundly even their human programmer creators cannot understand the resulting program. Granted, this doesn\u2019t imply AI has already replaced human creativity but ruling it out may be premature. After all, many of our finest scientific discoveries and inventions have been conceived decades before imagination became reality. \u201cBeam me up Scotty\u201d led a child to later invent the flipphone in California. \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea\u201d led, decades later, to the atomic submarine. \u201cFirst Man in the Moon\u201d presaged Apollo 11. Star Trek\u2019s \u201cphasers\u201d have finally led to the Pentagons laser weapons. Science fiction has a strong habit of resulting in science fact. Skynet and the Terminatior robots didn\u2019t become self-aware and active in 2010 but who can say, given swarms of nanobots, drones and security robots that a takeover is out of the question. Afterall, they network better, think faster and deeper. Logic would suggest humans are what needs to be replaced as a redundant species. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question reveals an interesting bias. Are humans computational? when dealing with AI it is very difficult because you always need to define terms. My use of the symbol \u201cAI\u201d is specific because I like to get away from the words themselves. We do not have a great definition of human intelligence so it is hard to try to make it artificial, if we do not know what we are trying to recreate. Now if the question is will artificial computational power supersede human\u2019s computational power then I would whole heartedly agree. Just because of scalibility. Now will computers be \u201csmarter\u201d than humans in the vague sense of \u201csmarts.\u201d I would still say no. Computers that use NN\u2019s are getting probabilistic reasoning responses based off of our culture. So the cap of that, would the total value of culture. Computers that use current techniques would always be capped at the cultural value because they will learn off of our cultural inputs. They will be smarter then most people because most people will never come close to accessing all of culture. But they will not be nearly as creative/ axiomatic. Everything that computers and AIs are good for are defined problems. They are really really bad at undefined problems. I do not think that AI in the general sense will supersede human intelligence, because all intelligence that we know of is a part of human culture, even AI\u2019s use human culture: images, movie title subs, ect as the base learning sets. If you feed a bunch of shitty writing into a NN you get more shitty writing: Twitter taught Microsoft\u2019s friendly AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day ",

We already have programs that can imitate musical compositions by J.S. Bach, data processing that can predict climate change, sensors that can detect things beyond human perception. It is likely that AI and its ensemble will continue to live and evolve alongside humans, and will become seen as part of human intelligence, rather than an \u201cOther\u201d that threatens to take its place.. The capacity for human ingenuity is limitless, and will enable humans to consistently improvise new forms of expression. It is the AI community that will have to watch out for people who threaten to replace them! Regarding the original question.. Is \u201cingenuity\u201d something that you think of, or is it something that you do? By \u201ca not-so-distant future,\u201d do you mean within your lifetime? Ai may be able to describe something like the necessary prerequisites for time-travel, but nobody would ever be able to actually do it.. If an ai \u201centity\u201d from a thousand years in the future travels back in time and replaces you tomorow, would you consider that the near future? Ingenuity is sometimes born out of unintentional accident.. Darwinian evolution comes to mind \u2014 survival of the fittest.. ..there is no substitute for the ingenuity that invented computers in the first place.. yet it is highly likely that ai will produce a turn of the phrase or will enable a new twist of fabric, or will design a maneuver in some n-dimensional space that is unlike anything that has ever been seen.. .. as a programmer, that would be my most earnest wish, that software will become ingenious in its own right.. and that ai and its ingenious programmers will respond to each other, and will build by standing on each others\u2019 shoulders.. such a process becomes fractal.. the artificial intelligence community will greet such performances, whether seen as successes or as failures, with gratitude and applause.. ..the only contrary remark I would put forth is that it is not in the nature of ingenuity to be replaced by an entity of its own production.. .. humans will continue to use any outcome, whether it is planned or accidental, as a tool, as a means of furthering an endeavor.. ..how could such a process be other than evolutionary? Ai is no less a part of us than long-range planning. You decide where you want to be, then change your direction as many times as necessary in order to get there. Traditional thinking is an ingredient that needs to be dissolved in a soup we are still brewing.. ..and the recipe is writing itself!! ",

            "answer_text": "Someday people might begin to understand that all the AI systems they have created to date are machines. Is our intelligence just a machine? That\u2019s a good question. But, things like chess deal with constrained searches in combinatorial spaces. The machines can beat us. But, are they different than a car? A car goes faster than a human, or a horse for that matter. Cars go faster than trains. There was a time trains were new and no one could imagine anything going faster than a train. It took about thirty years to get trains to go from 5mph to 30mph in about 1830. Quite a fete of engineering at the time. So, at about that time the horse finally started looking slow, and people were impressed. We are really still in the dark ages of seeing intelligence as a process working in a non-discrete world. It helps when space is combinatoric and stationary. We have been good at creating programs that can find their way around objects that have been fastened to the ground. We are just getting good at moving objects negotiating other moving objects. But, even self driving cars are still machines that respond and react. They might start to do it better than us. But, they are still built by us for the purpose of responding and reacting to certain things. Perhaps we will make a machine that will yearn for a certain knowledge and change itself to get that knowledge. Then, it will further improve itself to find a way to make use of the knowledge. Perhaps it will desire to be rich in order to attract friends so as to maintain a social existence, in which it will find pleasure. Will it move to SF and sell antiques do get this up? Or, will it move to Miami and always wander near a topless beaches where it can boast about its small fleet of fishing boats. At what point will we create software that is smart enough to win on the stock market so that it can retire and enjoy tropical snorkeling with a woman half its age? One would have to wonder if an AI system would be truly intelligent if it decided to work tirelessly with the aim of creating more of entities like itself. I suppose if it did, those fleshy entities like ourselves would make jokes behind its back. Then, perhaps it might feel hurt and start writing sorrowful poetry or start singing the blues. Maybe it would find its way to a social club, like a bar, and start unloading it troubles on whomever will listen. Perhaps it will love the gentle, unattainable girl and desire in all finality to be buried beneath a path in garden of a paradise on which she will walk every day, holding dear the fragrance of the flowers and the songs of the birds.

The reality is if a intelligent person give up these duties that keep them sharp until their brain begins to slow down with age the harder it will be to resharpen themselves, the problem is future generations will no longer have a need for sharp minds and eventually man's Intelligence will diminish and lack the abilities to sharpen. Intellect is a talent, one needs this talent to Excell and become dominant in terms of evolution. In terms of people of future people will not require the sharpness that make humans intelligent and will no longer be an evolutionary advantage.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but not in the way you might think! This is just a short personal rant and not really on the subject you asked about at all, but yes, dammit! Anyone who believes that what we loosely call AI is anything like as amazing as even squirrel intelligence, let alone human intelligence, is implicitly diminishing human intelligence! We are SO, SO, SO much more amazing and sophisticated than anything we\u2019ve ever produced artificially, and I speak as someone who\u2019s been doing this quite successfully for forty years. Thinking that current AI can compare in any way with natural intelligence is only possible if you don\u2019t properly appreciate what natural intelligence is like. (Perhaps there are even ways that this diminishing of what it means to be intelligent actually diminishes the intelligence we have, more along the lines meant by your question. It\u2019s hard to exercise a skill when you don\u2019t fully understand it or properly appreciate it.) Consider just how complex a problem we face when we learn to dress ourselves. It\u2019s only when you try to imagine a machine that could learn to do this without being explicitly designed for the task (or even one that is) that you really appreciate what a miracle we perform. Yes, computers can play chess better than humans, but chess is an idiotically simple problem for a computer, compared to putting on a pair of skinny jeans and a sweater. It saddens me that so many people think AI is already close to human-level intelligence, because it shows how impoverished their understanding of human-level intelligence must be. The four decades I\u2019ve been doing AI (more accurately, artificial life) has in part been driven by a desire for people to understand themselves better. And just as importantly, to understand each other better, across races, sexes, cultures, species and hardware. Machines can act as powerful mirrors to help us think more carefully about what it actually means to be alive, have a mind, have feelings, and be capable of appreciating and contributing to the beauty of the world we inhabit. This understanding can make us more intelligent. We humans are machines too, but to me this simply means we need to learn how to elevate what it potentially means to be a machine, not diminish ourselves to the level of the machines we\u2019re currently familiar with, whether artificially \u2018intelligent\u2019 or otherwise. /end of totally off-topic rant.

            "answer_text": " Today, Artificial Intelligence plays a big role in technology industries and innovative competitions. Most newly made products and intelligence systems comprise AI that marks remarkable revolutionary changes in the day-to-day life activities of modern generations. Countries like Japan use Artificial Intelligence to help prevent traffic congestions in tourist hotspots. According to William Chernicoff, head of research and innovation at the Toyota Mobility Foundation, with deep machine learning, predictability can be improved which will be an advantage and make faster and smart decisions on signal timing, suggested routing to system users and capacity allocation for the Traffic Mobility Operators. AI has brought solutions for being stuck in frustrating queues on busy roads that eat up their hours, reducing the time they have to do something worthwhile. Humans have been superseded by Artificial Intelligence in most of the countries, which has created a great disadvantage for getting employment opportunities. But does this mean people have really lost their job fortune? Let\u2019s check in the business perspective when it comes to using AI in business, it\u2019s important to interact with people in a way that\u2019s authentic. The human learns from experience and other people, so does AI updates its data over time. However, it takes a huge effort in collecting and storing all those data and will be limited to a certain set of questions, options, and commands. Looking at the common scenario, a person\u2019s questions may fall outside of this limited stretch of options and lead to poor customer experience, leaving people frustrated and unhappy. These systems require mountains of relevant data in order to truly understand complex human dialogue and a highly sophisticated AI engine in order to extract contextual meaning from the data. Though people have been talking and conjecturing about AI, in reality, it is still in its infancy. AI is being used today in ways that show tremendous promise, but, like talented new employees, AI needs people to learn from. Machine learning is the backbone of AI, the technology that gives it the ability to learn from experience and the data that experience generates. As per the chairman emeritus and co-founder of Infosys, so much about AI has been spoken but it is not the ultimate thing. No computer can do one thing that a human can do, which is defining a goal. Humans will continue to be relevant as long as they use their brains to define aspirational goals and new ways of doing things.

What all natural sources that have been ,are being put to uses for objective aspects of life are the cause of all this , they will always have the upper hand, creation is one in being, its source is one in being, This answer can not, will not eternally be replaced, it can never be eliminated, and this answer ,the ultimate answer of how it all is being, is only possible in and through human intelligence.

            "answer_text": "You are confusing two different things. Artificial Intelligence is derived from computational theory (Church-Turing thesis). There is no theoretical basis for AI to ever have reason or comprehension. Without these, it can\u2019t surpass the problem solving ability of a rat, much less a human. Artificial General Intelligence (in spite of the similar name) is not derived from computational theory. It actually falls under the same general cognitive theory that describes human and other animal intelligence. In other words, it should be entirely possible to build a non-biological system that can reason and comprehend. This system will not be software running on a computer. Researching AGI theory is what I do everyday. The current hope is to have it completed and published some time in 2021. If that happens then we might get a system up and running by 2027. ASI is the same theory as AGI, so it might be possible to create a higher than human-level system by 2039. ASI systems would not be common. Even AGI systems will never be small enough to fit in a cell phone or laptop. ",

But why do we do things that we don\u2019t understand? Humans tend not to do that. Story: Computers can now beat humans in chess. We tire. They do not. But when a computer analyzes a position and says it is equal, does the human necessarily believe it? No! Why? Some positions are just so complex that the human would not consistently find the correct move. The computer did, but the humans wouldn\u2019t (under the time constraints of a chess game, or life). Tal\u2019s games work brilliantly against a human, but against a \u201cthese-days\u201d computer, he\u2019d probably lose. So we should listen to a computer? Maybe. But sometimes computers miss things, unless they work out every possibility. In chess with a few pieces left, that is possible, but in a real-world event, that becomes less likely. We have to feed computers info, and when we fail to do that adequately, the computer fails us. ",

            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence: Can it Replace Human Intelligence? - BeBlogging Artificial Intelligent[1] have been numerous reports recently which claim that a major part of the human workforce will be swapped by machines in the years to come. With too much research and development being performed in the field of artificial intelligence, many fear that a major job crisis will unfold since multiple jobs are more accurately and efficiently performed with the utilization of machines. With major names like Stephen Hawking already warning the world that development of robots and intelligent machines beyond a certain point could mark the end of humankind, the intimidation is real, to say the least. But is it all true? Is it possible for the machines to completely replace the human resources? Are humans really not going to find any job in forthcoming decades, where every task is performed by the robots and intelligent machines?. It has been claimed that at least 5 million jobs will be replaced by intelligent machines by the year 2020. I do agree with this, but stand by my opinion that it is next to impossible for a machine to completely replace the human input.

What could take 30 people a month to do by hand, like graph numerous complex functions that are uniquely chaotic, a computer can do in a few seconds. The difference is humongous, but our intelligence probably has increased due to the need of putting to use such a modern Hercules of the arithmetics. Artistic Intelligence, i like to say, is only as bright as a programmer can stuff it with his or her clever leverage, and although we have programmed not only engineering methods but engineers themselves, it is not a seamless awareness of intelligent warrant that is the state of the art in AI.

We can supply them with information about chemical reactions between different substances, for example, and see if they can produce the idea of the periodic table of the elements.

Could we create an algorithm that would make the logical jumps that lead to such things as relativity, quantum theory, Kant\u2019s Critiques, or Bach\u2019s compositions? Not even close, since we don\u2019t understand how they did what they did.

Given a system of cause-and-effects, one can find paths through those cause-and-effects from an action that might be considered to find all the consequences of that action. A path is a sequence of effects such that each effect except the last is the cause of the next effect. The effects in each path show the side-effects that would also occur if that action were taken. The principal is quite straight forward but incomplete because the cause-and-effects can form circuits. But how the Explainer uses circuits has already been worked out. The Explainer can be used to produce an AI by providing the AI with these cause-and-effects. An AGI can be created by giving the AI the ability to learn cause-and-effects by interacting with its its environment, looking for candidates for cause-and-effects, then testing them by introducing the cause into its environment to see whether the expected effects occur. If we are afraid of AI\u2019s getting out of control, we can accomplish much of the same ability to solve problems well beyond out current capabilities using the Explainer while keeping the Explainer strictly within our control. steward@problematics.com ",
