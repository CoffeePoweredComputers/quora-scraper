            "answer_text": "I call this the \"broken, blocked, and banned,\" syndrome. These are some concerns:  1. Is it broken? Tech that is broken, outdated, or not supported doesn't help. A teacher station with Windows 1492, the Columbus Edition, has nothing more than a terminal. Same with student stations that are outdated.   2. Is it blocked? I've painstakingly prepared countless lessons which have been ruined when a seemingly normal site has been blocked. This wastes time, causes me to employ the less exciting Plan B, and can get expensive, too. And why should I constantly have to have a Plan B? Many teachers give up at this stage.  3. Is it banned? There's a lot of tech that could be very helpful in the classrooms if students were permitted to bring devices. Many schools don't have enough technology to give students access, but those students often have their own tech--easy solution, at least at the high school level.  Teachers have other concerns, too. They want to feel comfortable with technology. They want it to be able to intrigue students and propel their learning objectives. They want to be able to use the tech and take risks with it but not be penalized--many schools have high-stakes evaluations, teachers feel if they were to employ a tech risk or stretch and fall short during an eval--that's serious stuff these days.  The good news is the amount of people out there willing to help teachers overcome these concerns. It's very encouraging. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many many many concerns with technology in the classroom but I'll provide one example I've frequently heard from teachers: With our legacy education system, your typical teacher is evaluated based on his/her ability to hit certain milestones within the classroom. I.e. by week 5 will we be on chapter 5 of the math textbook or will students be 1/10 prepared for the nation wide standardized test at the end of the years. When you introduce technology into the classroom such as Khan Academy video courses, you'll begin to see different students learning at different paces (generally due to  varying levels of intelligence or natural curiosity). Since one of the goals of technology in the classroom is to personalize learning for each student, it suddenly becomes very difficult to evaluate the teacher based on \"milestones\" for the overall class and therefore it's also hard to determine a teacher's salary and bonus. Thus, you'll see a huge conflict of interest for a teacher to want to adopt any new forms of education technology in the classroom. ",
