            "answer_text": "Yes, that happens all the time. At Tyndall AFB there are several QF-16s I.e. remotely piloted aircraft. They\u2019re used for air-to-air training and weapon systems testing. They takeoff, do the mission, return and land, rinse and repeat. Sometimes the AF, Navy, Marines or an allied pilot shoots one down. F-4s, F-100s, even B-17s have been converted. The real question is why\u2026why convert an F-22? It makes no operational sense. On the other hand, purpose built remotely piloted and/or autonomous aircraft can fill a substantial number of the missions formerly flown by manned aircraft. Air-to-air will probably be one of those missions in the no so distant future. ",

            "answer_text": "This would increase the overall cost of the F-22 exponentially, taking its already sizeable fortune of $300 million dollars 2 nearer the $400 million per unit. The plane is not a drone, to big. Its control surfaces, computer and cockpit are configured for a pilots control not remote control. The plane, unlike say the UKs new Tempest, was not configured from the start to be a manned/un-manned hybrid aerial vehicle. Then it comes down to remote piloting. Would it be advisable to put a $400 million Interceptor/fighter/ground attack in the hands of someone watching the planes endeavors through a PC monitor. Oh and did I mention the short supply of the F-22, 85 left flying . Best scenario! Build a smaller version, of a look alike, F-22 and remote pilot that for a lot less bucks. ",
