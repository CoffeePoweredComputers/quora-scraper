            "answer_text": "Typical modern cell phones use less than .5 watts of RF power producing very low power densities. Microwave ovens might average 1000 Watts of RF power, 2000 times or 33DB greater power. Your microwave oven door may leak tiny amounts RF energy, but most is confined to oven cooking area. Power density within the oven is high enough heat and cook. Cell repairmen know better to stand in close proximity to a cell site antenna fed with a 40 watt transmitter, because these levels, may cause biological damage. Both are electromagnetic radiation and penetrate your body, but only strong fields pose danger. Keep in mind every time you hold your cellphone, you are part of the antenna as your body is coupled to the internal antenna. It is amazing how little the body changes signal radiation. ",

            "answer_text": "To the perfect answer hereinafter I\u2019d add that sometimes I\u2019ve even noticed the very mild heating effect generated in my flesh while keeping the cellphone close to the body, like when you bring it in a treasure\u2019s pocket; this isn\u2019t always noticeable because the device manages its own radiation transmission power in reference to the radio channel quality on a purpose of rational management of the battery stored energy and keeping the general radio noise within limits of usefulness.

            "answer_text": "Quite a few watts is the answer here. Your cellphone can radiate parts of a watt, (being battery powered) and your cooker needs a mains supply to provide the much larger power to cook things. Essentially the radiation is the same, (microwave) but the cooking effect on your brain from your phone is almost negligible. Mind you, you did say cellphone, and that includes the transmitter masts and relays. Not quite the same here, climbing up a live transmitter mast is not to be recommended. In fact, any transmitter mast (even longer wavelengths) is not a good idea. The intensity of the wave falls off as a square of the distance, (double the distance and quarter the power type of thing) but close up, no, not your most brilliant plan. You could have asked why people drown in lakes, but not in teaspoons, is the water in them both not the same? ",

            "answer_text": "Cell phones use a wider range of frequencies (from about .8 to about 3.4GHz) than microwaves but in the same region of the spectrum. If you had a bi and powerful enough cellphone and you sat inside a metal box with it you would get cooked. However microwave ovens use from about 300Watts to over 1 kiloWatt whereas cellphones use about 3Watts. So if you get into your small metal box with around 100 cellphones and attempt t make calls with them all at the same time (the calls won\u2019t connect you are inside a metal box) you can emulate your lunch. A cellphone heats you much less that the light bulbs in the room where you use it. ",
