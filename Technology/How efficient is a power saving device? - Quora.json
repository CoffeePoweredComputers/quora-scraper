            "answer_text": "If you are talking about one of the devices that you plug into an outlet and it \u201creduces your energy bill\u201d. I can categorically state that they are 100% efficient! That is 100% efficient in relieving you of your hard-earned cash and delivering, well, absolutely nothing! These things are snake-oil, cost almost nothing to make and sell for not insignificant sums, some could even be hazardous being so badly made they pose a fire risk. Avoid. Want to save energy? Turn off lights when not in use, turn down your heat by a couple of degrees (or turn up the A/C temperature if in a climate that requires aircon like we are). Unplug your phone charger when it's not charging the phone and whilst you're at it unplug everything that has a \u201cstandby\u201d mode. The amount of power used by these \u201cvampires\u201d is tiny individually but add up a dozen or so devices using a Watt or two (say 24W total) could save a couple of hundred units (kWh) per year, at Thai power prices that's about 30 US$ a year.

            "answer_text": "Question: - \u201cHow efficient is a power saving device?\u201d Power-saving devices come in a wide variety of efficiencies. All devices have an efficiency. Whether it saves power depends on its rating compared to other similar devices and may depend on its usage level and mode of operation. For example, an LED exit light may be twice efficient as a regular incandescent lamp, but it uses very little electricity. On the other hand, it receives long continuous use. ",
