            "answer_text": "Yes, telephone service and internet service as well. Phone companies often offer 10mbps internet service for less than cable companies. You can run a free phone over it or even select a streaming service like Netflix, Prime or Hulu over it, even get streaming cable service, a new alternative to traditional cable that is far cheaper, and from which you can select a cable channel package for far less than the cable folks charge, for far less money, typically $45 plus tax. There are hundreds of different cable streaming services you can get cheaper and run on a cheaper phone internet setup. I\u2019m paying $73 a month for 100 mbps I don\u2019t need, when I can get 10 mbps that works just as good, but for less money, $45 a month plus tax. I can also add one of hundreds of cable tv packages as streaming over that phone company internet. Something like $90 a month total for the phone company internet and one of the several hundred different cable streaming packages offered. Just plug the channels you want in a carefully calculated question, into your browser search hole: \u201cLooking for a cable streaming service package that include the following channels: (name the channels here) at the lowest cost?\u201d Hundreds of different packages, one or more of which will align closely with your personal cable channel tastes will appear, that will eliminate your too many worthless channels cable package, and substitutes the channels you want most at the least possible cost. I have friends that have already done this in the last year and are very happy with what they\u2019ve got. Incidentally, I just checked to see if one can still get google voice free. It appears one has to pay if they sign up now. But there\u2019s an original google voice I once had before the module service appeared, that just plugs one\u2019s phone into the computer, and a slightly limited free version of the GV service will appear. My GV is still free but appears to have been taken over by a company that sells voip modules that attach to one\u2019s router by ethernet cord and require signing into a website. Even when Google ran the service, I had to buy a module, which I think I got from Amazon though it was not their own product. Google Voice free is a total phone service I still have, with forwarding to other numbers allowed and a website called google voice to keep track of all of the phone calls ever received or made, all texts made over google voice. I have records and transcripts all the way back to 2009. Even when google operated GV there were times when there were too many users and one would be cut off during a long conversation. Or one couldn\u2019t dial in to the calling community without being simply told the service wasn\u2019t working just now, but not in those words. All phone services of any sorts have such limits but the limits of GV are modest. One gradually figures out how it all works. There\u2019s one more oddity to tell about though it may not belong in this discussion. I once had an Iphone in my 3 phone number forwarding chain, the first number being my GV phone. I dropped the IPhone for an Android smartphone, the Iphone is in a drawer now, but if I get a call to my GV phone now while the the Google voice menu is open on my browser, the old IPhone signature ring will go off in the browser, an oddity, since I\u2019ve had an Android cell phone for five years. It shocks me every time I hear the IPhone signature ring go off on my computer. Incidentally, when I travel, I take the computer and the GV number with me. In Mexico years ago, I hooked temporarily to an Honduras IP in a hotel and was able to make free calls back to the states. I\u2019ve gone back to that hotel but there was a new provider, the Mexican phone system owned by Carlos Sim. My calls were blocked on Sims\u2019 internet IP. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it still possible to have telephone service through a telephone company? Yes, of course. In many countries many companies still do offer POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) or as it is formally known PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) with a phone device that is actually wired to the telephone network. In Mexico we do have that kind of service: in some places still served with copper wires and internet through those wires. We do also have, from the same company TELMEX, POTS via fiber optic, which is the one I have and through that fiber optic cable, I do get my Internet connectivity at home. Also, there are companies, in Mexico we have a few, that offer telephone service, POTS again, using the old TV cable coaxial wiring. I also do have that at home and it also offer Internet connectivity via coax. In the USA, many companies offer similar services. Have in mind, that in some countries, France comes to my mind, that recently rules out to install more fixed phone lines. So, the french have declared the end of fixed telephony in their country.  Here is a reference to that PSTN imminent shutdown: The Final Countdown to PSTN Sunset ",
