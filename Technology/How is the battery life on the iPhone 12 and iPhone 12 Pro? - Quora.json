            "answer_text": "I read this from some websites (http://appleinsiders.com). According to Tom's Guide, new testing shows that the iPhone 12 lasts 10 hours and 23 minutes under 4G usage, but only 8 hours and 25 minutes with 5G. Similarly, the iPhone 12 Pro tested using solely 4G managed 11 hours and 24 minutes, but with 5G was 9 hours and 6 minutes. This is bad. Even at 4G, the 12 lasted only 10.5 hrs and pro lasted only 11.5 hrs? I can\u2019t imagine what the Mini will be at\u2026 Forget 5G\u2026 Why can\u2019t apple just stick a larger battery inside?????
