            "answer_text": "I'll try and answer this without ranting too much and referring or comparing the cycling menaces too much with the motoring menaces. Let's start with the usual caveats about who or what most people are. Sure, there are people who do go on about dangerous cycling, even I get annoyed by poor cycling . Firstly, the normal thing. Cyclists do not kill on anywhere near the same scale as motorists so how much of a menace is that, answer is hardly at all. Next, cyclists are vehicles and the second most vulnerable road users after pedestrians. Where is the vitriol about the menace of pedestrians with their walking across our roads and why dont they pay for our roads etc. Its a one way and very biased view within a society that has been blinded to everything except their right to drive fast on big roads. The automobile industry have a lot to answer for. Cyclists are menaces because they dont obey the rules of the road. Sure, it happens but what is the number if motorists who commit traffic violations. Of course the violations are very different and , as I say to my, red light jumping, fellow cyclists they dont help our case. It is irrelevant to the anti-cycling brigade we dont kill and maim and on the rare occasion it makes national and international headlines. How many RTAs make the news? How many cases of DUI make make anything beyond local news and when will drivers stop using the mobile phones at the wheel? OK, I also have to ask when my fellow cyclists will do the same. Cyclists are not a speeding menace but do we deserve proper facilities, of course we do, but does it mean segregation. I'll stop there as I'm moving away from this question. What else are cyclists accused of? Scaring pedestrians? Ok, it is a product of some cyclists being inconsiderate and also of a lack of infrastructure which makes people feel that , in certain parts of the world, cycling is dangerous and can only be carried out away from the rest of traffic but it does put them and us into the same conflict as us and cars. We cant be hated by drivers and pedestrians as it is only our fellow cyclists who love us. Oh, I almost forgot that most cyclists are also drivers so why are we only menaces when we choose to take a 2-wheeled spin? This question merely illustrates the illogical and irrational way cyclists are viewed and the real issue is why is it not possible for roads to accommodate all users. Of course we are not menaces. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this is obviously a troll question, so I will answer it appropriately. No, they are not the menace most people think they are. Most people don\u2019t think cyclists are menaces at all. I mean, who are they menacing? People in cars? Seriously? Let\u2019s say a cyclist runs into a car \u2014 what happens? Maybe a dent in the car or some scratched paint, but certainly the driver is fine. That\u2019s not menace, that\u2019s inconvenience at most. Now let\u2019s say a car driver hit\u2019s a cyclist. There will be damage to the cyclists vehicle, for sure, but also personal injury and a much, much higher chance of death than in the first instance. \u201cBut I see cyclists breaking the law all the time!\u201d You see car drivers breaking the law all the time, too, but for some reason that\u2019s OK? They can do far more damage, there are far greater consequences if their law-breaking results in an accident, but you want to take issue with scofflaw cyclists? I was waiting for a bus one day, observing a stop sign intersection \u2014 11 out of 13 cars rolled the stop sign. If I go the speed limit on the highway, I\u2019m among the slowest, with the rest of the drivers breaking the law. So don\u2019t even talk to me about cyclists and traffic rules\u2026 As a result, cyclists are not the biggest menace on the road \u2014 the biggest menace, born out by any traffic injury/fatality study you care to read, is other car drivers. By far. I don\u2019t even know why cyclists anger car drivers \u2014 it means less traffic and more parking for cars. And where slowing traffic is concerned, any driver will be more slowed down, more frequently by other drivers and things like school buses. Cyclists are not a menace, they are part of traffic, other vehicles on the roads. ",

There is an assumption that all cyclists run red lights, ride on the pavement in a way that endangers people walking and generally break every law there is However, most don\u2019t. But when you see someone on a bike doing something wrong it will confirm your bias. I\u2019m not calling you an idiot - that is just how humans seem to work and it is very difficult to see round it. So - when I stop at a red light rather than zip on the pavement and over the traffic lights on the pedestrian part - you may see me but once you are past you will forget I was there. If I shot across on red it would annoy you - which you would remember - confirmation bias. However, there are idiots who ride bikes - one rode in front of me about 2 hours ago - I don\u2019t even think he knew I was there - probably still doesn\u2019t even though I stopped only a few feet from him. However, there are also idiot drivers - one was driving a coach yesterday that turned right (in UK - we drive on the proper side of the road) directly in front of me - then stopped blocking the road. So - idiots exist - in cars (where they are more dangerous) - and on bikes - which is why you need to drive/cycle assuming that everyone is about to do something dumb - which is why I noticed the idiot on his bike 2 hours ago and didn\u2019t run him over!

I drive, and I cycle, and I see good, polite careful and considerate drivers, and I see careless, incompetent, rude and arrogant ones - and I see exactly the same behaviour in cyclists. It\u2019s true that in a collision with a car the cyclist will come off worse as a general rule - but in a collision with a pedestrian the pedestrian often comes off worse than the cyclist. Of course a careless or inconsiderate cyclist may cause a drive to swerve of take evasive action which may cause any accident that the cyclist is not directly involved in. I think it would be more accurate to say that some road users are menaces, rather than making a false distinction between drivers/cyclists. ",
