            "answer_text": "Most commonly spread myth regarding 5G is that it causes serious health issues. But the real negatives comes into play in the technical side. 5G is operated at 2 frequencies 6GHz and 60GHz which if you remember high school science says higher frequency lesser power. 1.One of the negatives is that because of the higher speeds at 60GHz with lesser range there would be lot of cell towers would be required which is huge installation cost. Because of this 5G would become expensive. Next, is that phones would require additional antenna to support 5g,4g,and 2g which increases the cost of the product. 2.5g is also touted to be used across industries, so, the amount of available bandwidth would also decrease. 3. With increase in number of cell towers per area, the amount of radiation people would be exposed will be slightly higher than in the 4g case which has been confirmed by multiple government agencies and scientific communities.

            "answer_text": "What are some disadvantages of 5G? Will only be available in very limited number of places. I gather AT&T say they are deployed and they are covering just 5% of the USA. You will find that the providers will talk about the percentage of the population, or even percentage of the business population. They won\u2019t want to tall about geographic area at all if they can help it!You will need to have equipment that is \u201c5G Ready\u201d. That isn\u2019t just your smartphone. It may be your router, your access points, your laptops etc.You really won\u2019t see a lot of benefit, probably. Browsing, email, streaming\u2026 None of these will be affected. Downloads, uploads and cloud computing are where it will show and how much do you do of those.5G is intended to get people to use \u201cthe cloud\u201d and rent their software rather than buy it. The big tech companies will squeeze much more money out of you as a subscriber rather than as a cash customer. ",
