            "answer_text": "Apply this math formula I've designed to your life. x +2 = a Simple right? In this formula, x  is the amount of times you have tried/will try to achieve your goals, and a is you finally achieving your goal.  So we can see that if you tried to achieve your goal only 5 times, then you will not have achieved success yet. Based on this formula, you will have to try 2 more times in order to achieve success. Now, say you've tried 2 more times and still have not achieved your goal. Well then logically that means you have yet to satisfy the formula, therefore you are required to try 2 more times in order to achieve success.  Here, x is an arbitrary amount, and is dependent upon a. Meaning the amount of times you need to plug a number into x depends on how big and complex a goal a is. (counterintuitively a is also dependent upon x)  For example: Walk the dog. That's your goal for today, and once you walk the dog, you will have achieved success in doing so.  If it only took you one attempt to do so, that means a is = 3, meaning your success score is equal to 3.  This makes sense, because the goal was so easy, therefore your score is low. The higher one's score is, the harder that goal was to achieve. Thinking a little more about this, you may come to wonder how to quantify the amounts of times you've tried to accomplish a goal. In that case, this only works for individual goals that make up a larger goal. For example, your goal is to become a neurosurgeon making $400k/year. Now going to med school and getting licensed and approved would be one attempt, thus your score would be 3 again. But since this is a very large goal, there are a lot of difficult steps in between that can be seen as goals themselves that require maximum effort to accomplish. Say you want to get the best job as a neurosurgeon, so your goal is to get a 4.0 GPA and get a perfect score on the medical exams. In order to do those you have to take these courses, in those courses you have to get perfect scores, to get those perfect scores you have to study this material, etc. Now that's a lot of \"attempts\" to get to one overarching goal right? So a good way to find your score is to define your life goal, and back pedal to everything specifically that you need in order to get there, in the most minute detail. Count those steps and add 2.  If you apply it to just shooting a basketball, just determine the amount of attempts you've made and missed, then add 2. If after those 2 shots you still haven't made it, then that means the formula is not satisfied and you must take two more shots, and you cannot quit until you find x. The whole point of this equation is to solve for x, and you cannot get the value of a until you get the value for x. Another thing I'd like to point out: Note how the formula is not 2x = a.  This is extremely important. This formula suggests you are trying to do the same thing twice. If the first attempt was not successful, it would seem illogical to try it again in the exact same way. You need to find another way that is possibly more effective than your last way of doing that attempt. So check it out: (x+2 = a) = (x+2x^0 = a)    x and x to the power of 0 (which just equals 1), are not like terms. This means that after your attempt, if you have yet to achieve success, then you must try 2 different ways of reaching that goal. So, I'm trying a math problem and I get it wrong, thus I need to try 2 more times. On the first re-attempt, I try a different method of getting the right answer, if that is right then I've achieved success. If it is wrong then I move onto the second re-attempt. I keep repeating this process until I achieve a.  Nobody said it would be easy, after all, E=mc^2 is a very simple equation, but very difficult to apply in real world engineering. Math can be both fun and inspirational! So apply the formula x+2=a to your life, it boosts boosts productivity and work ethic.  In mathematics, the solution does not find you, you find the solution. Likewise, don't wait for a to come to you, you have to solve it and grasp it.  Sincerely, Bradley Eversley ",

            "answer_text": "Trust yourself. Listen to your own inner voice. Build your skills and just be closer to yourself by appreciating yourself Keep in contact. Call a friend and go out with them, tell them how you feel, and maybe you two could motivate each other or go do something together (e.g. a fitness course). If you don't feel like talking to friends or family, then just go out there and meet new people. Free your head of all of the things that you have been thinking about lately. Don't bore yourself. Get up and do something, like cooking or taking a shower. It's very important to stay active Life is all about choices. If you think that your life is awful, you are probably making it awful. Stop comparing your life to others', because everything is not they way it seems. Go and visit hospitals and old people, and listen to their stories and what they have to say. Everyone has something to give and say. Life is a learning process. Listen to good music that makes you dance and stay active. Turn the music up loud. Smile and laugh as much as you can. Forgive everyone for everything. It heals your heart. Try it. Read great books. Learn that you are worth it, and that you need to do something for yourself. Stand up for yourself, otherwise everything you worked so hard on will go down. It takes time and hard work, but success is the most beautiful and powerful feeling. ",
