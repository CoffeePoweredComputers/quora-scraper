            "answer_text": "Only dial-up modem technology can be used to provide internet access over existing telephone / landline service at \u2018no additional charge\u2019. It\u2019s drawback is that you can\u2019t use he phone while utilizing the internet modem. Other internet access over telephone wiring are explained by Dennis E (below): ISDN and ADSL.
