            "answer_text": "No: You have to understand that radio and radio waves, and microwaves, are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes television, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, infrared & ordinary light waves, and more. When you refer to \u201cradio\u201d you are referring to a particular band of the electromagnetic spectrum, namely 560 to 1600 kHz. But weak radio waves are also emitted by many celestial objects and these are studied by radio telescopes. As to microwaves, this is a band that extends from 300 MHz to 300 GHz, and includes mostly communications applications such as military radar, cell phones, satellite communications, and much more, and microwave ovens occupy only as tiny portion of the spectrum, i.e. 2450 MHz plus or -50 MHz.
