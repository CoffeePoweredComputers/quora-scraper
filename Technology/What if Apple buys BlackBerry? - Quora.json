            "answer_text": "Is BlackBerry for sale? Does it even still exist? Do they have anything of value? Is it or value to Apple? My guess? If Apple buys Blackberry, I guess shareholders will complain because it seems like a monumental waste of money. Although the price could be negitave, in which case I\u2019ll be losses I didn\u2019t buy them. Or perhaps very low, and maybe worth whatever patents they have? They may still have some ongoing business running mail servers as well, which Apple wouldn\u2019t want, so might be able to spin off. ",

            "answer_text": "Why the heck would they? Apple was the main reason why Blackberry died. Blackberry has a completely different approach to consumer electronics to Apple, with Blackberry selling their phones for business and iPhones being for anyone who can afford them. The investment wouldn\u2019t be worth it and it would just be a waste of Apple\u2019s money. ",
