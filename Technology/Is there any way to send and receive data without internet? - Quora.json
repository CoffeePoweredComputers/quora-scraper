The postal carrier will come to your door! and bring you mail and pick up mail to send out. Your nearby postal office not only handles regular mail and packages but can also handle money orders - a quick inexpensive way to send money securely all over the world! Imagine! ",

These satellites listen on about 406MHz for data from a beacon.  I don\u2019t believe it is possible for a phone to send these messages. Even if a phone could act in place of a beacon if would not make sense as the beacon transmits a unique id number that is matched to your information such as address and phone number by the rescue teams. This info is provided when you buy the beacon and would not be available if your phone did it. ",
