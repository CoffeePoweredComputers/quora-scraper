            "answer_text": "A broad question. Even before that why do you want to do IoT development? Did you ask yourself that question? If you posted your answer to that question, then possibly giving a focused answer is easier. But if all you want to know is how to get a job in IoT, then the answer Laxmi gave is good enough. IoT is a vast arena. From automation to providing data for decision support to enabling better eCommerce or brick and mortar retail, IoT involves a wide variety of technology paradigms. For example, a company name Thingspeak is working on collection and visualization of data from IoT. A company named Digi works on RF transciever modules. IBM works on this using their old model.. support open source, use that to develop WebSphere based products. CISCO is betting big on the opportunity for M2M networking. Somebody else is working on parallel computing algorithms (OpenMPI) kind of algorithms on IoT. Some companies are researching on how IoT leads to pervasive and ubiquitous computing. IBM played a critical role in helping evolve the MQTT protocol, a specification on how P2P devices talk to each other. There are hardware integrators. There are domain specific IoT providers. There are RFID companies for supply chain logistics. There are companies powering retail shops via bot-based shopping marketing and experience. There are home automation companies. The field is vast, as I said in the opening comment. Where do you want to work? It is difficult to single out a company as the best. But you need to pick the specific area that appeals to your intellect and then ask how you can fit into that company. You need to look within. Your skill-sets, your long term satisfaction, your abilities. Those are the vertices. That is the shortest answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Great. Intent is a nice first step along the way. For IoT, I see it as an integration of two fantastic domains- embedded systems and Networking technologies. Of course, that's being a bit simplistic, but not too bad to begin. So, you need to decide on one of these domains to begin. If you go with embedded systems learn C programming, interfacing with various circuit elements, sensors to get the signals from the real world. You can get some good beginners kits from guys like Texas Instruments, Microchip, Atmel, or one of the many others. And keep improving in increments till you get into one of those 32 processors which can support Linux OS, that make developing networking solutions easier. One example of a 32 bit processor board is Raspberry Pi. On networking side, learn about the architectures, solution implementation for holistic systems like let us say in a factory, you get the data from various inputs (sensors) and present the overall report to the manager with details of possible interpretations. So, learning web programming , web services development using languages of your choice- Java, C#, Python, node.js will be useful. I hope it helps you  get started. ",
