            "answer_text": "What's the structure of a news report? There are four possible types of structures for a news report: inverted pyramid, the narrative, the hourglass, and the chronological order pattern. The most commonly used is the inverted pyramid. From the most comprehensive reference available for this question, the following are excerpts - (universalclass.com) (1) The Inverted Pyramid In this structure, the information is written in descending order, with the most important points appearing at the top of the article, and the lesser news written in a shorter, downward direction.The report leads with main ideas, and the remaining paragraphs support and explain them \u2013 giving greater detail to the classic \"who, what, where, when, and why.\"(2) The Narrative The story has three elements: a beginning, middle and end. The bottom allows the writer to tell a chronological narrative complete with detail, dialogue, and background information.There is greater license to use flowery language that reaches and influences the reader.It is not the proper format if you are trying to deliver information.It is a way to share with readers an experience or event that an individual may have endured \u2013 with perhaps a lesson to be learned along the way.(3) Hourglass Structure The hourglass is not as commonly used an organizational style in journalism.It is reserved for writing longer stories, such as feature articles for a Sunday edition. It begins by asking a broad question, then narrows it down by providing information, such as facts and figures and observations; then the scope of the story broadens again by offering conclusions and then generalizing back to the question.An hourglass structure actually incorporates several journalistic styles at the same time.First, there is the strong lead in \u2013 typical of the inverted pyramid. But then the story turns to a more narrative style, returning to the inverted style at the end.(4) Chronological order pattern A chronological structure has a place in journalism, but is not as popular as the inverted pyramid.It is common when journalists are explaining the order in which something occurred, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other natural weather event.Chronological order can be written in reverse order, as well.",

            "answer_text": "The news structure is the overall design of the layout of news works. The main components are: the lead - the main body - the end. The more common types are: (1) The inverted pyramid structure arranged according to the facts, putting the most important and freshest facts at the forefront. (2) The pyramid structure arranged according to the time of the event, also known as the accumulation of interest structure. It uses a factual lead, a paragraph is more specific than a paragraph, and the outcome of the event is written until the last paragraph. (3) Parallel structure, which arranges the equally important facts in parallel, also known as the double tower structure. (4) Delaying the structure of interest, the specific facts are not clarified in the lead, and the readers are not allowed to read the whole article. (5) The chronological structure, also known as the chronicle structure. It has an inductive lead, all materials are arranged in the order of event development, with a clear and general description, which in general forms a process that is both complete and vivid. (6) The synopsis structure, also known as the 1 2 3 4 structure, is a form of writing that combines the inverted pyramid structure with the side-by-side structure and is suitable for reviewing news. There is no fixed pattern of news structure. It is in constant development and change. When journalists write news, they should choose the best news structure to express the news content flexibly according to the principle of content decision form. ",
