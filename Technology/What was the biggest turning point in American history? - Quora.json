            "answer_text": "The biggest turning point in American history was when REAGAN got in and started the process which has TOTALLY DESTROYED AMERICAN DEMOCRACY first by doing horrible damage To labor unions which has HURT American workers, de-regulating checks and balances on owners of huge MANUFACTURING corporations which used to give them tax breaks ONLY if they used them to create jobs here in the USA. REAGAN's policies encouraged the corporations to ship the manufacturing jobs overseas which slammed millions of Americans out of jobs and into either slum living or HOMELESSNESS. REAGAN's tax cuts benefited the rich and DESTROYED most of the middle class in this country. BOTH BUSHES continued with REAGAN's policies. Clinton And Obama were NOT able to repair the damage caused by REAGAN and BOTH BUSHES because the increased wealth given to the Right Wing by REAGAN and BOTH BUSHES destroyed the checks and balances in this country giving too much power to the very rich and the corrupt religious fanatic fundamentalist leaders in this country, and as a result SEPARATION of church and state has also been DESTROYED as well. Had there been no REAGAN there would be NO DISGUSTING DONALD in the Oval Office. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest turning point in American history is arguably the mid-term elections of 1892, because that is when the real distinctions between the political parties began to disappear. The support of Democrats for individual liberty and free markets began to disappear. By the elections of 1896, the major parties had become indistinguishable in their ideologies: They favored large, intrusive, centralized government, and, especially, the use of government promote and benefit larges businesses and industry. From 1896 on, the parties struggled to distinguish themselves from one another, and grew increasingly to favor govern-ment as the leading social force. Today\u2014 and for some time\u2014 the major political parties are but one political class, with rival factions, both advocating and benefiting from the Leviathan federal government that holds sway today.
