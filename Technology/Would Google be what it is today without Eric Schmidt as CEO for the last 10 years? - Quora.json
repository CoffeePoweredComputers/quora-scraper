            "answer_text": "This Wall Street Journal article suggest that Larry Page is doing a decent job of taking over the reigns from Schmidt:  There have also been positives. His reorganization of the company was  largely well-received by employees; in April, the government approved  Google's purchase of ITA Software, which will help Google build a  travel-search service; and Google+, the company's fledgling attempt at  social networking, has seen early growth. Employees also credit Mr. Page  with facilitating a change in the look of numerous Google's services,  including the search engine and Gmail. The article goes on to say he has amazingly high standards for improvement of Google and has dealt with failure with resilience:  Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., said Mr. Page  \"has been a pretty quick study\" in communicating with investors. \"It's  clear that Larry Page isn't satisfied with Google's dominant position in  Web search and intends to broaden the areas of dominance,\" Mr. Rohan  added, even though that is inviting more government scrutiny and \"bumps  in the road.\"  Its hard for an outsider to say 1. What it will take for Google to navigate its legal issue with the government 2. Or to otherwise speculate how Schmidt vs. Page would deal with this issue.  My guess is that some of his larger challenges are growing into a greater role as a leader and public communicator with the range of Googles stakeholders.  Larry certainly holds the opportunity to write that portion of Googles legacy in real-time. Source: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903352704576536521984562128.html ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of folks seem to be following the question but no one is providing any thoughts...so I'll go ahead and start.  Answer is simple: NO. Without Eric acting as a balancing force, Google would never have achieved what it has. In the few limited interactions with Eric I was always impressed by the way in which he would combine deep technical expertise with sage wisdom acquired from decades in the trenches at Sun and Novell.  The follow up question is whether his \"elevation\" to Chairman will have a direct impact on the next 10 yrs. ",
