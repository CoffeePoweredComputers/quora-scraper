            "answer_text": "Share some ideas hope you like it\u2026 Innovation: Water filter/purifier at source  Names: Soring Lepcha, Class 4, and Subash Prodhan, Class 5, Lingzya Junior High School Place: North Sikkim, Sikkim The inspiration behind the idea: Most people today prefer to use a water filter/purifier at their home. Both the children have given the idea to have a filter/purifier at the source of water so that everyone has access to clean water without having to make an investment in purchasing a filter/purifier. Soring's idea is to have a centralized purification system at the point of distribution like a water tank while Subash's idea is to have such purifiers attached to public taps. Hand rest for a fractured hand  Name: Adi Kumar, Class 5, Deens Academy Location: Bengaluru, Karnataka The inspiration behind the idea: Generally shoulder arm slings are used to provide support to a fractured hand. Using this for a long time sometimes gives discomfort to the neck/ shoulder region. Adi's idea is to have a waist-worn appendage, which can provide support to a fractured hand instead of the sling. The fractured arm would be rested comfortably on the appendage and kept in position by straps. Alerting system for bus drivers  Names: Pradyumna Kumar Pal, class 7, Saraswati Sishu Vidya Mandir, Unit-3, Khordha, Orissa; and Rahul Kumar, class 9, Rajkiya Balak Uchh Vidyalaya, Patna, Bihar Sometimes accidents occur when a passenger puts his body part outside the bus window. Pradyumna and Rahul have independently conceived an idea of an alerting system for the bus driver, which enables them to know which passenger has put his hand or head outside the bus window. Reversible benches at public places  Solar seeder  A device to collect Mahua flowers from ground  Name: Lipsa Pradhan, Class 9, Government High School, Kamagaon Location: Bargarh, Orissa Mahua flowers have many medicinal properties and are also used to make pickles, jams, and now ice creams as well. Lipsa has suggested a manual device like a lawn mover, which can collect Mahua flowers, which are otherwise picked up by hands, which is a time consuming and tiring process. thanks for reading\u2026.
