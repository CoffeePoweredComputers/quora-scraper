            "answer_text": "I would recommend you 1-2 take lessons.  In doing so, you get a solid foundation that can then be applied later. Snowboarding is a sport that is very hands on\u2013meaning, it's difficult to simply learn the concepts without doing them. Like most things.  What you'll gain from taking lessons are the visualizations of \"the how\" from your instructors. Replicating the way they carve, stop, their form, etc., needs to be burned into your head.  Too many beginners don't notice what their body is doing when they're first starting out. Become acutely aware of what you are doing. Ask for help. Ask the instructor what you're doing wrong, and how to improve.  You really only need 1-2 lessons. Then it's try, fail, succeed, try, fail, succeed. Repeat.  Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "YES PLEASE. I would fully recommend that you take snowboarding lessons. I hate seeing total beginners trying to learn as they go, aka renting out a board and falling down a blue run. With a lesson you can avoid this humiliation, and laughs from others on the hill, and also learn much more in a shorter amount of time. It might cost more initially but it pays off after you don't have to rent out a board for a day of butt scooting. ",
