            "answer_text": "Mentally connected and emotionally disturbed. Social media makes people more depressed because people are showing off too much. You can't trust everything you see. Not everyone is as happy as their Instagram story looks like. People are pretending more and more and it's getting suffocating. Deep down we all feel emotionally incomplete. Sad and depressed. But yeah, obviously technology helps a lot. It plays a huge role in each person's Life. In this high tech modern world it takes less than a second to drop a message, Woah! You can connect with people all over the world. It has own benefits. \u2022 Use it as much as you need not as much as you can. Excess of anything is bad. \u2022 Don't get attached with people (on social media) easily, everyone can talk sweetly! ",
