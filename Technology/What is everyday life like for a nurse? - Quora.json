            "answer_text": "That is a question that will have SO many different answers! It depends on what area of nursing you work, in what capacity, and in what area of the country as well as specifically who you work for and with. I can only give you an example of my typical day. I work in Home health as a nurse case manager (we manage our own patients so I see all the patients I manage). I start my day at home getting myself ready and my daughter ready. After her bus picks her up at 645am (the joys of living in the middle of nowhere), I head to my first patient. Typically, they are assisted living for that hour of the day because no one living independently would choose to be up and ready for a visit so early. My first visit is at 7:30 as they are quite a drive away (again, joys of living here in the middle of nowhere). Maybe they\u2019ll need basic wound care and cardiopulmonary assessment, education on pressure ulcer prevention. Complete the visit and get a good start on my documentation. Then, give a report to the facility charge and write in the facility chart before heading to the next visit. I\u2019ll do this for anywhere from 5\u20137 people a day in their homes or facility apartments, for anything from wounds, colostomies, disease education (diabetes, COPD, etc). Then I\u2019ll get the occasional call requesting a last minute visit for labs or new wound from a fall, or physical therapist has concerns and I can save them a possible ER visit if I have time for a visit. Often times I\u2019ll have one new patient or two. Those patients require a full 2 hour visit to get initial paperwork filled out, head to toe assessment, medication reconciliation. At each visit I\u2019m doing just a portion of my paperwork because what patient wants to sit watching me type?? At the end of my patients I drive home, usually 3/4pm and I get started on completing documentation while also getting the kiddo to after school activities, making dinner, and finalizing the next day\u2019s schedule. This requires I call many of the patients I\u2019ll be seeing to finalize a time. I do this at 5- our office is closing so it\u2019s not likely a last minute admission will show up for the next day. And I\u2019ve had a chance to chat with the other nurses to make sure we are all good for the next day. I\u2019m bad about working after 5 so I end up saving whatever I haven\u2019t finished either for the next day or for after everyone is in bed. And if I\u2019m on call, the fun doesn\u2019t stop there. I\u2019ll usually get a call a day on average, more on weekends, that require triage over the phone. Occasionally they require a visit (like a pulled catheter or a new colostomy that\u2019s leaking). When you\u2019ve got a kid to young to stay home alone and a husband who works shift work, you better have an on call babysitter. Or a kid who is fine playing on their iPod in the backseat while you run into the building to slap a new colostomy bag on the anxious little old lady who panicked at the leak and forgot how to change it. I love what I do even if it\u2019s chaotic. I make a difference for individuals and I build relationships. Not to mention, the money isn\u2019t bad in home health and you can\u2019t beat the flexibility. I\u2019m an early bird thanks to the bus schedule. Some nurses sleep in and see their first patient at 9 but they aren\u2019t home until 5 or later. And if I need to make an appointment for myself, I generally can schedule around it. ",

            "answer_text": "Nursing has higher highs and lower lows than most working class career paths, I suppose. Here\u2019s my take on a typical night shift on Med-Surg, which is a common starting position for new grads. Apologies for the length, but I want to really try to paint the picture for you. The start of shift is kind of like waiting in line for a roller coaster you\u2019ve never been on\u2026 you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting yourself into and most of us feel a lot of anxiety. I notice that my lowest quality of sleep is leading up to a shift. The first hour is spend learning as much as possible about your patients. It feels overwhelming to get slammed with so much info at one time, so being fast and highly organized is a must if you\u2019re going to have a successful shift. As a new nurse, it\u2019s extra stressful because all info seems equally important: radiology results, lab results, orders upon orders to sort through and follow to a T starting the second you get report. Hopefully there is enough time to map out when each patient\u2019s meds are due, as this will serve as a basic framework if by some miracle you get to accomplish passing meds on time. The second hour-ish is usually spent \u201cputting out fires\u201d- performing patient physical assessments and tasks based on most immediate needs (help to the bathroom, pain/nausea/anxiety meds, etc). Hopefully there is some time in this hour to start passing scheduled evening meds, if the moon and stars are all aligned in your favor. The next 2 hours or more are dedicated as much as possible to passing scheduled meds for bedtime (usually more time is needed due to the likelihood of endless unanticipated needs pulling your attention away). Then, it\u2019s pretty much time for midnight meds. Hopefully there is enough time to squeeze in some of the profuse amount of charting that is required between med passes, if by some chance you have had some invisible fairy sprinkle her Lucky Dust on you tonight. The hours between midnight meds and 0500 meds are a window of opportunity to read all the doctor\u2019s notes, chart 5 minutes for every 2 minutes you spent tasking earlier, restock any supplies in your area, eat a meal, etc. This seems like a blissfully long period of time, but keep in mind you will be fighting fatigue after the marathon you just ran, and because we are working with sick people there are a million and one reasons that your attention will be drawn elsewhere. Some common examples: -A med you needed wasn\u2019t where you thought it\u2019s be, so you spend time looking in all the possible locations, can\u2019t find it, send a message electronically to pharmacy, check for it multiple times and eventually call pharmacy, check for it multiple times\u2026.. There will be many, many, MANY occurrences of this type of two-steps-forward, one-step-back throughout your shift. -You\u2019ll probably have to help with toileting or incontinence needs or repositioning or bathing or feeding more times than you can count. -The only constant is change! Patients\u2019 conditions will change, and therefore orders will change. Sometimes orders change without you being alerted to it, and so you will develop mental telepathy superpowers or get written up. -Your sickest patient, consuming most of your attention finally gets moved to ICU. Uh, oh\u2026 now you have an empty room. Not for long! You will get a transfer out of ICU, or fresh in from the ER, or fresh off the operating table from their emergent surgery. In any case, more tasks and paperwork are required, and this scenario is a common cause of getting derailed from the shift you had hoped for. 0400 Get busy with drawing labs, monitoring vital signs, bathing bed bound patients, and getting the heck ready for the dreaded morning med pass. 0500 -0700 Wake up patients for meds and getting in to their chairs to impress their doctors, make rounds with early doctors, respond to lab results, get pre-op patients ready, etc. Oh, and every patient will need to go to the bathroom. And there are tons of details which must be charted to sum up everything from the shift for each patient. 0700 Either give a glorious report and present how knowledgeable you are about each case and how you provided all the needed dressing change supplies and organized everything for their tube feeding and how tidy the room are and everyone who might need pain meds right away has already been medicated by you\u2026 or shamefully apologize for the disorganized state of things because your shift got derailed. If, and only if all the charting is done, you may now clock out. This is the best part of the shift, because regardless of how the various moments were, you know you participated in a difficult time for the people you cared for and made those moments as good as possible. It\u2019s utterly exhausting, but it\u2019s one of the best feelings in the world to have worked so diligently serving people that really need your best. And as a bonus, you\u2019re gonna sleep great after all that physical and mental work. To survive this roller coaster kind of job, I utilize mindfulness and just try to be in the moment. I also think in my head that I\u2019m kind of playing a game as the shift unfolds, like \u201cBONUS! I got all my assessments charted before midnight med pass.\u201d Or patting myself on the back after a difficult moment by thinking \u201cI just did that ______ like a Boss!\u201d It\u2019s also imperative that in your non-working hours you master self-care. I never feel guilty for getting a massage once in a while or taking time for my hobbies or being social when I want. I also don\u2019t hesitate to take advantage of counseling and even medical support to help me master my emotions, sleep and energy needs. I also remind myself often that I am the captain of my own ship, and if I become unsettled in my job, I just go get a different type of job as a nurse for awhile. To reiterate, the possibilities of what a nurse\u2019s day is like is really limitless. I wish you, and everyone reading this, well on your paths. ",
