            "answer_text": "It's a pretty ambiguous question. Stil\u2026. Let's learn something about servers first. Basically servers, as the name suggests, SERVE. It's basically a computer which is there to do a specific test. It also has operating system which is different from desktop computers since it's job is also very different. Generally they serve different terminals or requests coming from different sources and reply to the request and give back the needed info. Think of a website . When we type the web address, the web address gets converted into a number (by an intermediary thing called DNS). This number is called IP address . This IP address is generally of a server. The server sends us the code of the page which corresponds to the website address that we typed. It gets more complicated than that but it would be irrelevant to discuss that. There are many Servers. We could even create a server on our pc with proper software. when somehow server stops working, all the websites associated with are not accessible. Now That we know what a server does. Let's answer the question. Server is just a small part of the IT industry, but it's relevance is huge since it runs websites and has databases where data is stored. Much of the Internet rely on it. Servers are there to function 24*7. It's always ready to take requests. If we remove the server then the other ways to connect with each other on internet would be peer to peer connection, which is impractical. In short you could do whatever you want at your home computer or smartphone, but you would need to have server for most of the functions on the Internet. ",
