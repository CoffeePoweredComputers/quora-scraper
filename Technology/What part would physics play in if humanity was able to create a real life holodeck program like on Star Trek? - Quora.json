            "answer_text": "Physics would govern any interactions and behaviors in the real world, even within the confines of the holodeck. The Holodeck in Star Trek wasn\u2019t \u201cvirtual\u201d in the sense of not being physical. It used transporter and replicator technology to create physical objects within the simulation when they were called for. (In later canon, there was the whole \u201chard light hologram\u201d MacGuffin that was never adequately explained, so I\u2019ll leave that out of the equation) With that in mind, physical laws still apply on the holodeck. However, it could use \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d as well as more sophisticated projections and holograms to make something appear to be real that wasn\u2019t. In that situation, the laws of physics apply to the behavior of the light, reflections, refractions, etc. but not to the \u201cobjects\u201d within the projection. It would just be a fancier version of projecting images on the wall. They could be fanciful and seemingly defy all physical laws because they\u2019re just projections and not the actual objects. But, if you wanted the sensory experience, it would be real objects that had to obey real physical laws. The program could intervene to dematerialize an object, change the material properties, negate momentum, etc. But it would still be following the laws of physics (just within the bounds of technology that we don\u2019t currently have or understand) ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting word, \"physics.\" Yes, you've identified a serious problem. Holograms have no weight. Now, on TNG they say \"well, they're holograms, forcefields, and replicated matter\" so I guess a forcefield can be imbued with mass? They can make a holodeck character heavy that way? I mean, if the EMH on Voyager can pick up a surgical tool and use it on me, then does his hologram weight around 180 pounds? Is he pressing down on the carpet with his shoes? Interesting question. I think that, just like reality-based game engines now, with \"real physics\" built into them, the holodecks of the future will have rules, rules like gravity, built in. Obviously, you could turn the rules off, or break them, just like Neo in the Matrix, yeah? But you yourself would still have weight\u2026 unless you were supported by a forcefield\u2026 It really just depends on how we program the holodeck. ",
