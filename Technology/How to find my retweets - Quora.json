            "answer_text": "Twitter is gradually removing the Retweets tab from all accounts and merging it into the @username tab. If you're running a Twitter account for a business, or if you're just curious about your personal reach within your followers, it can be difficult to sort through the @user tab's plethora of information. So here's a quick fix for taking a look at your tweets, retweeted: Log in to Twitter. Then, in the search box type: include:retweets OR via @username replacing \"username\" with your Twitter name.  Screenshot by Nicole Cozma If you find that the people retweeting you are using a different syntax (like \"re:\" instead of \"via\"), just add it to the end of the two search terms already listed. For example, include:retweets OR via @CNET OR re:@CNET Screenshot by Nicole Cozma If you don't want to fuss with the search box, you can use this direct link by again replacing username with your actual Twitter name: Twitter. It's what's happening. For instance, if you were looking at CNET's tweets, retweeted, it would look like this: Twitter. It's what's happening. Now you can save the search on Twitter (through the save search button) or use a handy bookmark to see your retweets. It shouldn't be this complicated, but hey, at least the search function still shows them. ",

            "answer_text": "Use Twitter Advanced Search (click-here) Easy to use and several different ways to pull up a Tweet if you remember some of the keywords you used or the account you were tweeting to. I actually had to pull up a Tweet from 2012 recently to remind someone of a conversation on Twitter and found it within moments using Advanced Search. It\u2019s also a great tool to do prospecting and social listening when you know the keywords your interested in following if this is for business. Good Luck ~ ",
