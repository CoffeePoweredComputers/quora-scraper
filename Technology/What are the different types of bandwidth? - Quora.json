            "answer_text": "bandwidth  Bandwidth in signaling technology Bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency in signal technology , which is possible in a certain transmission channel. For more info visit this site. Due to its physical properties, each transmission channel has a lower and an upper limit frequency. The larger the bandwidth, the more information can be transmitted per unit of time. For analog signals, the bandwidth is in hertz ( Hz ) or in kilohertz ( KHz) or megahertz (MHz )measured. For example, an analog telephone knows a lower cutoff frequency of 300 Hz and an upper cutoff frequency of 3400 Hz. This results in the bandwidth of 3100 Hz, which is completely sufficient for a transmission of voice data. Relationship between transmission rate and bandwidth The term bandwidth is used, although not quite correctly, in the transmission of digital signals, although this usually means the data rate or transmission rate . The data transfer rate is calculated by the number of data units per unit time . The smallest transmission rate is the bit , so the data transmission rate is often referred to as the bit rate ( unit of bits per second - bps ). The data transfer rate, which can be transmitted maximum error-free over one channel, becomes channel capacity called. In the transmission of digital data, the transmission speed depends on the bandwidth and the selected encoding. If one bit is selected as the code per Hertz, the transmission rate measured in bits per second (bit / s) corresponds to the value of the broadband. At 200 MHz, that's equivalent to 200 Mbps. If you encode two bits per hertz you get a bandwidth of 400 Mbit / s. How much bandwidth is required? Since the transmission and reception of data in a network is in different directions, bandwidth for receiving ( downloading ) and sending ( uploading ) is specified in these cases . In most cases, the bandwidth for the downstream is greater than for the upstream. ADSL ( Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is called an asymmetric carrier method on which packet-oriented protocols are set up. The demand for high bandwidth still leads today to ever new transmission technologies. Over the last few years, the transmission speed of a broadband connection has continued to increase. With ADSL2 16 MBit / s are possible, with VDSL2 even up to 100 MBit / s. ADSL and the further development VDSL over the telephone line are today technically almost exhausted. That's why fiber optic cables are the future.
