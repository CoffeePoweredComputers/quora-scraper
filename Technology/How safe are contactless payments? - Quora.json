            "answer_text": "Contactless payments through NFC cards and technology was always there in India but with some concerns about security. However, since the onset of COVID-19 and related hygiene issues, contactless experiences are on the rise, whether for deliveries, payments, or instore shopping. Earlier only NFC cards were considered under contactless payments, however, with time, the contactless payments technology has evolved and expanded to include QR, UPI and SMS Pay links under the contactless payment portfolio. To know more about how they work, watch this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7VTRV59qE0&t=1s. All of these methods of Contactless payments are a secure way of making a transaction. From ordering food to watching your favorite show, we have been using the internet for almost everything. However, we are often leery of using technology for payment transactions. Well, you don\u2019t have to be. I list down all types of contactless payments and security measures taken by banks and FinTech players to make them safe and secure for all of us. 1. Contactless cards: The cards with a WiFi like a symbol are called contactless cards because unlike traditional cards, you can pay for your purchases from a distance, i.e. without coming in contact with the device or the cashier. If the bill amount is below Rs. 2000, you are not even asked for the PIN. Now you might wonder, \u201cIf they can charge the card without my permission, they can even steal my data\u201d. No one can steal your data, neither merchants nor hackers because these cards use a smart microprocessor chip technology, which keeps your credentials secure. It also performs a cryptographic computation, so the card\u2019s communication with the PoS terminal is protected. And any charge above INR 2000 requires a PIN verification. 2. QR Code Payments: QR code payment is a method where the merchant displays a black and white square pattern (Quick Response code), it is a code that can only be read by a camera using certain software. The customer scans that code via an app like Google Pay, Paytm, etc., which uses your phone\u2019s camera and then makes the payment. Data transferred by QR codes are encrypted, making this mode of payment secure to use. 3. UPI Payment: UPI payment is processed using the concept of a virtual payment address, i.e. your bank accounts, cards, and wallets can be associated to a unique, virtual address. The payment process can be carried out using your account number, phone number, or Aadhaar number. This kind of transaction makes one-click payment possible, taking convenience to the next level. To add to it, it eliminates the need of exchanging data such as bank account details, one-time passwords, or other sensitive information while making a transaction. Each UPI transaction requires a PIN authentication at your end. 4. SMS Pay Links: You receive a text message from the merchant or a delivery agent, which contains a \u2018Pay Now\u2019 link. The link takes you to a payment page, where you can pay via card, e-wallet, and net banking to complete the transaction. However, as a customer, you need to ascertain you only click on the payment links coming from the brand, for example, let\u2019s say, VM-AMAZON or VM-PHEASY. And as a merchant or a delivery service provider, you must ensure your Payment Service Provider is PCI DSS compliant. PSPs such as Ezetap take high-security measures to ensure your customer\u2019s transaction details are encrypted and secure.

            "answer_text": "They are just as safe as the credit cards you used. The real risk with contactless cards is something called backward compatibility. Many retailers still rely on POS terminals that read magnetic stripes, and they don't support EMV or contactless technology. To make sure that users are not inconvenienced by this, even brand new credit and debit cards come equipped not only with a chip and contactless communication but also with a magnetic stripe on the back. This stripe still hosts information that can be intercepted, stolen, and abused. You mustn't also forget that a contactless credit card is still a credit card. And this means that the information printed on it is enough to process an online purchase. Contactless devices and cards show that the act of paying for something without handing over any banknotes or coins has come a long way. Unfortunately, while we have seen a few massive steps up when it comes to security, things are still not perfect. If you are aware of the risks, however, and if you know how to keep yourself safe, you can enjoy the extra convenience. ",
