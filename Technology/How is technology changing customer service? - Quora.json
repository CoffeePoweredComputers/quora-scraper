            "answer_text": "A really important question for everyone doing business on any scale. Customers want a smooth experience. When there is friction, people get frustrated and leave. I believe technology can change that. Here are some important shifts that already happening. Omnichannel experience. The most successful businesses recognized the importance of multi-channel communication with their customers so they use social media, live chats, and calls, combined. Your customers should be able to smoothly switch channels whenever they feel like it. Say, if the customer described the problem via Facebook Messenger and it turned out more complicated, they should not be asked to describe the same problem all over again at any point of the conversation.Real-time communication. Thanks to technology, companies can answer customer questions 24/7. People now have a real conversation with bots; try calling Apple and see what it says. Essentially, businesses need to predict where the customer is in the lifecycle and what questions or concerns they might have. With this information, they can map out every possible issue and prepare answers. You want to have tools that can answer the questions in real-time and let a human jump in when a problem gets complicated, like a combination of live chat and bots.Predictive analytics and Big Data. 59% of customers say that companies knowing more about them from past interactions improve their customer experience. The global brands like Amazon, Nestle, Starbucks, Netflix, and others already use Big Data and predictive analytics to measure Lifetime Customer Value (LCV) and to improve customer satisfaction. Big data craze is huge these days, and it will only keep growing.Internet of Things (IoT). This emerging technology is slowly becoming a part of our daily lives and it can potentially change customer service forever. For example, if the business sells the water filters and all data is connected, they can notify the customer that the filters are about to wear out and will need replacement soon.As you can see, there are many ways in which technology is changing customer service. It will be exciting to see how organizations will keep up. That said, the most important thing for any business is being proactive. Don\u2019t wait for somebody to complain. It may be too late if it gets to the customer service department. \u2013 Solomon. ",
