            "answer_text": "Technology has always been a part of humanity and is older than humanity. When people invented fire and clothing, humans were using technology. Prior to that, human-ancestor-beings were using spears and other stone-flake tools: these deserve the name `technology\u2019 as much as any modern computer does. I think then, that you are asking was life better prior to 3.3 million years ago? because it is only prior to this time that technology was absent. The big problem then is that these pre-humans were not the same species even as we humans are today. This means that there is no time in the history of homo sapiens that there was no technology. This web-page shows this timing: Homo sapiens - Wikipedia Technology has always been a part of humanity and is older than it. And before you dismiss me for being petty and pedantic, the above implies that I need to ask \u2018which technology in particular are you asking about?\u2019 because basic agriculture, horse-drawn carts, aqueducts and sewers are all very ancient, very much life-changing technology, and our modern society only exists because these existed when they did. Because technology is a continuum, it needs to be viewed as a gradually growing item, so it is not possible to put down a finger in human history and say \u2018before this, there is no technology\u2019. Did you perhaps want to choose a particular kind of technology, say computers, and ask was life better before that? I can give this much of an answer: I think that life before humans had local anaesthetics was very often very agonizing and I am pleased that I live in a time when this is available. (It is a tragedy that some humans still do not have access to this technology.) I am suggesting that your question needs a little work on it before you can get a useful answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Without the modern technology our world will be will be in huge setback. Just think for instance if you live in lets say 16 century 17 century how would a person living in the 21st century be able to live in such change times of the 16, 17 century it will be extremely difficult for them. It is right that without the modern technology that we are having at our disposal now obviously makes our lives easier, like how much have we progressed in different fields of science,mathematics,inventions,business and technology. It is said that humans have been living on the planet for thousands of years on earth but the most important centuries that helped shaped our modern world are 19 and 20,just the past two centuries. MEDICAL FIELD Now if you want to live in a time where there is less medical advancements as compare to this age than you would regret to be living in that age. Just look how much has there been advancements in medicines,diseases that killed people once are now just treated by a pill now a days. New advance machineries have been established with time like MRI,x ray machines,ultrasound machines,infusion pumps,nebulisers etc there is a list on them.    INVENTIONS OF AUTOMOBILES AND AIRPLANES Imagine living in a time where there are no cars or airplanes and you have to use either horses or travel on your feet long distances which would cost a lot of time and can affect health. You will obviously find it hard to live with that kind of facilities. where as in our time there are cars(fast moving cars) that can take us from one place to another (usually local)with exceptionly less time than before and if you want to travel faster and to farther places than there are trains(bullet trains), airplanes that have reduced our traveling time from days and months to just few hours.    INVENTIONS OF ELECTRICITY THAT PUSHED OUR WORLD TO THE 2ND INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.  In late 19 century,there was time when everyone started to realize the importance of electricity,because of that famous war of currents time we are now living in a world dominated by electricity,every thing is run by electricity nowadays even cars are running on them. Just for a moment think about the importance of electricity and how are we dependent on it,if you have to live without electricity for a day or a week,i am sure we all would be dead by weekend \ud83d\ude11. That\u2019s how much it affects our life and it also leads to the creation of other thousands of inventions in which the bigger ones are described below, INTERNET  MOBILES PHONES  REFRIGERATORS  WIRELESS SYSTEMS LIKE CONTROL OF SATELLITE BY REMOTE CONTROL FANS,AC\u2019s AND OTHER USEFUL EQUIPMENTS   Other numerous inventions which are also useful and fulfills the need of the people and entertainment appliances, like Playstations,Xbox and PCs etc which do fulfill the needs of our youngsters.\ud83d\ude05But one thing has to be said,that you look at the lives and stories of people living in old times and in the past centuries,they loved and enjoyed the way they lived in those times,even when you ask your grand parents or even great grand parents which i have experienced. I have asked them they say that life in their time was way better and beautiful than ours(modern times),as their was less technology in the past so people could spend time with their loved ones while in the present , everyone is limited to themselves and spend less time with their friends and family. People now have more online friends than real friends, there is hate,people fight against each other these things were alot less in past times. Now that in it self is a valid argument but if you take present advancements in notice and the benefits it has given us,you would obviously choose to live in this world, every time has its own merits and demerits. We just have to make sure we live in a place where we love one another,take care of each other,respect our moral values and cultural values and in spite of fighting each other,we should solve our problems. I know in todays world it might be difficult but we can atleast try our best. As we know Rome was not build in a day. ",
