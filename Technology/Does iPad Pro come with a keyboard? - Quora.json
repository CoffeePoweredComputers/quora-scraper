            "answer_text": "No. That is a good thing. You\u2019d definitely be paying extra for the keyboard. Because it does not come with one, you have more options to buy a keyboard that fits your needs. I\u2019m currently using a Logitch K380 that bluetooth-connects to my Windows laptop and iPad Pro. With a tap of a button it switches between them. I foresee that once mouse functionality is introduced through iPadOS, it will be like having 2 PCs if I use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard. ",
