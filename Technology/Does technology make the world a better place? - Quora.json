            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The most universal answer is depends on what \"better\" means and on how technology is used. But if your question is a simple, practical one, then the answer is \"Yes\". We could talk about the engineering technologies and benefits of clean energy, computerization, the Internet and smart phones, robots, television, books (now including e-books), etc.We could talk about the behavioral technologies of writing, money, law, justice, capital, and democracy.But I think the most obvious was to see the beneficial impact of technology is to look at the human population. As recently as 10,000 years ago the total human population was only a few million world wide. Today, we number 7+ billion -- a one thousand fold increase. Land area hasn't changedWe still need to eatDiseases still existWomen likely average FEWER births per fertile woman than those 10,000 years ago. There is no reason to think ancient men and women had less sex on a regular basis than humans do today. In addition, they had NO birth control. We have and use a wide variety of ways to prevent pregnancy.So if everything generating or limiting humans is still in place or increased, what accounts for the lack of people 10,000 years ago and the explosion of people today? Technology. Tools. Ancient men and women lived nasty, brutal, disease-riddled, injurious short lives. 1. One of the reasons their population was so low was because of the high mortality rate due to disease. People were afflicted with all manner of parasites, infections, and chronic and acute afflictions. It's rare to find skeletons of elderly Paleolithic and Neolithic men and women. Those found are commonly middle aged or younger by today's standards -- and many are children. In short, a significant portion of who could have been a part of their 7+ billion died prematurely -- in many instances as infants and young children. What \"better\" changes did technology make? Clean water, refrigeration, hand washing, sanitation and waste removal, sterilization, canning, etc. are some of the many behavioral technologies which remove and/or prevent disease from direct access to humans.Breath tests, blood tests, saliva tests, urine tests, fecal tests, X-Rays, MRIs, CT scans, PET scans, EKGs, Ultrasounds etc. are just some of the many diagnostic tools which spot pathologies.Vaccines, antibiotics, surgery, radiation, chemo, prosthetics, vitamins, statins, etc. are some of the many treatment technologies that effectively eliminate or manage pathologies.Hospitals, clinics, health centers, etc. are just some of the many physical asset technologies that bring patient and care giver together.2. Another big reason their population was so low as endemic food scarcity and starvation. Almost no one farmed 10,000 years ago. No food animals had been domesticated. Hunter-fisher-gatherer populations were completely vulnerable to migrating herds, herd and fish diseases, encroachments by top carnivore competitors, drought, floods, extreme temperature changes, and so on. The innovations of 2 behavioral technologies -- farming and animal husbandry -- put an instant stop to much of the starvation that had plagued EVERY human population stuck at its Malthusian limit as hunter-fisher-gatherers. Today's productive farming technologies (irrigation, pesticides, hybrids, large planting and harvesting equipment, etc.) now generate enough food world wide to completely eliminate not just starvation but food insecurity. Those issues today aren't productivity problems but logistics problems. We have 7+ billion today BECAUSE technology has been so beneficial. Now our problem is how to replace the destructive EXTERNAL Malthusian limits (disease, starvation, war, crime) with non-destructive INTERNAL limits -- new or revised material and behavioral technologies such as birth control and family planning, revised cultural traditions/expectations/values, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "It's kinda hard to say. Technology has given us a lot but it's also been a trade off. Even old tech that is still around like the automobile. I can't imagine life without a car, but having that convenience has in many ways damaged the planet. Possibly the greatest contributor to pollution since they were invented. Not just the automobile itself but all of the roads and other businesses needed to make automobiles the convenience they are. Then look at the internet, mountains of knowledge in a matter of hours, sometimes even minutes. But the internet has also become a global problem. People are so addicted they can't even walk about safely, some people have walked straight into traffic because they were so engrossed in what they were doing online via cellphone. Tech has given really bad people lots of ways to do really bad things. But even when tech is being used as intended it can get away from us. Still I don't think I would want to give it all up and go back to depending on horses or walking to get around or having to send important communication via pony express or again, on foot. The bottom line is where tech is concerned we are forced to take the good with the bad or get left behind ",
