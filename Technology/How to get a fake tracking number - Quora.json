No, before you all ask\u2026 I am not planning to commit a felony and if I were I wouldn\u2019t post it to the internet first just for a bucket of I told ya so responses. I am asking because I am working on a development project that has a shipping component and I would like to validate the 3rd party shipping integration is working correctly to fetch the correct status for the right tracking number. Being able to quickly and accurately produce this test condition to make sure the resulting page layout is formatted correctly would be extremely helpful. If anyone has any idea on where to find these, please share. Otherwise, we\u2019ll have to use tracking numbers for personally purchased shipments. ",

            "answer_text": "Sounds like you\u2019re planning a fraud. Well, if you want a tracking number, to use at the post office, why not ask the post office? The post office staff can answer any question related to post office matters. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be happy to tell you what to do if you go into your local post office and ask \u201cHi, could you tell me how to get a fake tracking number?\u201d Or, check for the phone number of the nearest FBI office. The post office has it\u2019s own enforcement division to arrest people for mail fraud, but the FBI would have more branches. I\u2019m sure the FBI could give you answers about fake tracking numbers if the post office clerks can\u2019t. ",
