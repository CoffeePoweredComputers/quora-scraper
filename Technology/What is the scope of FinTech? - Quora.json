            "answer_text": "Fintech is the sum of financial and technology. With this etymological basis that has limited rigor there are financial practices that are extremely dependent on technology. However, as it is a term that is appearing bit by bit, some see it one way and others, of course, another. For example, some call Fintech \"technology companies offering financial services outside of traditional large companies\u201d. However, its scope should be defined as \"companies providing financial services through technology\". What services? This is where the entrepreneurial's creativity comes into play and his or her vision of what the market needs. Online banking, payments and transactions, market trading, raw materials management, collective financing, development of financial security systems, digital wallets and so on. The possible combinations to develop and create a startup referred to as Fintech are many as we have seen, or as those that whoever embarks on the adventure imagines. Everything in the area of websites, mobile apps, or with more traditional management but within technological environments.Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and robotic process automation are spawning a swarm of new industry players. At least 12,000 fintech companies are eyeing the $1 trillion in annual global bank profits. The size of the opportunity, the fundamental role of financial services in our lives, and the industry\u2019s ripeness to be disrupted make for an irresistible target. Signs of the potential upheaval fintechs may cause are everywhere. PwC estimates cumulative global investment in such companies could well exceed $150 billion within the next three to five years. Among those upstarts are a number whimsically labeled \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 private companies valued at $1 billion or more. At the end of 2012, there were 18 unicorns, according to venture research firm CB Insights. Fortune magazine\u2019s 2016 Unicorn List comprises 174 such creatures. Various analyst reports suggest varying degrees of fintech disruption and potential risk to financial services revenue and profits. Whichever reports you believe, the threat is real and recognized. PwC found the vast majority (83%) of respondents from traditional financial institutions believe that part of their business is at risk of being lost to stand-alone fintech companies. In the case of banks, the figure is 95 percent. Whatever the figure, fintech firms, including the unicorns in their ranks, pose a severe challenge to the incumbents. The valuations these firms are attracting suggest there is considerably more value to be captured in the financial ecosystem. ",

            "answer_text": "The scope of FinTech is enormous, and I am not saying this because of the size or growth of this particular industry. I am saying this because of all the other industries that it can directly or indirectly impact. FinTech is all about improving the currently existent financial services by using some form of technology. For example, it can be used to reduce the costs of a company, speed up certain processes or automate an entire process by cutting down manpower. It directly impacts banks, consulting and auditing firms, hedge funds, private equity and venture capital firms, insurance companies etc. I don\u2019t think FinTech will reduce the impact that these firms have, and instead of being deterrent for these firms, it will positively disrupt the industry by improving them. FinTech has also led to the formation of other new industries like RegTech (Regulatory Technology), WealthTech (Wealth Technology) and InsurTech (Insurance Technology). The latest FinTech \u201ccraze\u201d has sparked the interests of many to pursue research or start companies that solve some or the other issue, like having Robo-advisors to improve and automate wealth management, having Chatbots to quickly answer insurance-related queries available 24*7. Also, with technology mammoths such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple coming into the FinTech space, I believe the scope of FinTech will be way larger than what can be imagined right now. ",
