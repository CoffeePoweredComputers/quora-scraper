            "answer_text": "Yes, but not equally well! For example, you might have a mix of USB2 and USB3 ports:  The difference in speed is ten times - think 3 minutes to copy your photos versus half an hour! Of course, you need a fast USB3 card reader and a fast flash card (it won\u2019t magically make slow cards and readers fast), but, still, what I\u2019m trying to say is not all USB ports are made equal. Also, on some laptops there are USB ports specially made for charging other devices (like phones) - they will stay on even if the laptop is off (while the other ports will turn off together with the computer, so you won\u2019t be able to continue charging your phone). There might also be a difference in how much current they can supply (so your phone will charge faster in one of those, compared to the others). ",

            "answer_text": "The principle difference between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 is speed. So, in a sense, they all do much the same thing. But another difference between USB 2.0 and the newer protocols is that the newer ports make more power available. All of those \u201cportable\u201d USB 3.0 drives, the ones without the separate power block, require the power from the newer ports or they can\u2019t spin up their platters. USB 2.0 was called \u201chigh speed\u2019 when it was first introduced, but it is in fact abysmally slow. Never waste a truly fast drive by plugging it into a USB 2.0 port. The ones with a separate power block will work, but the device steps back to USB 2.0 speed. How to tell which ports are which? The USB ports have that plastic \u201ctongue\u201d that is always either black or white. USB 3.0 port seem to always have a blue tongue, and their logo has \u201cSS\u201d next to the logo if you can make it out. The US 3.1 ports on my newer machines have so been either yellow or red. ",

(This is a quick summary, I\u2019m glossing over many many differences between the revisions)USB 1.x - Supported LOW SPEED devices (1.5Mbit/s), mostly for keyboards, and other low speed devices.USB 2.x - Raised the speed to 480 Mbit/sUSB 3.x - Raised the speed to 5.0 Gbit/sThe main gist, is that there are plenty of differences other than the connector.For example, you can have a USB 2.x cable that has a type C connector. Type C connectors do not mean that it is USB 3.",

            "answer_text": "The most common types of USB port you find today are USB 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 (gen 1 or 2). USB 2.0 ports pretty much always use the tried-and-true Type-A connector. This is the rectangular one that was also used for USB 1.1 devices. USB 2.0 supports data rates of up to 480 Mbps. It can provide up to 5V and 500mA, although I've seen a few devices with USB ports that can provide more current for charging phones. USB 3.0 either uses a version of the Type-A connector with more data pins, or the smaller Type-C connector. The Type-C connector is reversible, so it can be plugged in either way up. USB 3.0 supports a transfer rate up to 5 Gbps. USB 3.0 ports can provide up to 5V and 900mA. USB 3.1 uses the same connectors as USB 3.0. The main difference is that 10 Gbps transfer rates are supported. USB 3.2 can reach 20 Gbps, but this standard is less than a year old, so as far as I know, it\u2019s not in wide use yet. ",

Backware compatibility is implemented in devices so they will still work with an older version of the standard, though not necessarily with the same performance. Whether a particular device will work on a given USB port may also depend on whether a driver for it has been installed on the computer. For things like external drives and keyboards, the drivers are always there in the OS by default. ",

            "answer_text": "To supliment the other answers: Before USB C it was a 4 wire bus, two for power, two for data. That two wire bus is similar to the I2C and systems management bus, only difference being (not jtag) protocol. These are semaphore bus, and any device can pull the bus low to get attention. Some USB ports, particularly on cheaper devices are contacts directly on the motherboard. These easily wear out, and tension etc. can crack the board doing extensive damage. It's better if the ports are mounted on their own. So not the same. There are also some nonstandard variants of the connectors for low voltage, for example. ",
