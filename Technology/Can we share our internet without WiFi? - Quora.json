            "answer_text": "YES, of course we can, there are two ways to share a smartphone\u2019s internet to desktop pc or laptop without WiFi.  Credit image: wikihow First is by Bluetooth. This is a Wireless Internet sharing feature available on all Android smartphones. Most Android smartphone users stopped using Bluetooth after releasing WiFi as Bluetooth Wireless data transfer is much lower than WiFi. This idea can be gauged from the fact that with the WiFi data can be transferred up to 250Mbps speeds while Bluetooth 4.0 can transfer only 25Mbps speeds. But you can use it as an alternative when your WiFi adapter is not working. Before starting Internet sharing you will need to pair your Smartphone with Desktop-PC/Laptop. After pairing both devices, you can share your android mobile Internet via Bluetooth Tethering. Go to Smartphone Settings>>More>>Tethering & portable hotspot>> And tap to Bluetooth tethering toggle or checkbox depends on your android version.Now right click on your PC/Laptop Bluetooth icon available in the notification icon area.Choose to Join a personal area network option.

Credit image: How to Get USB Tethering The other method is by USB tethering This is the simplest way but you will need a Data transfer cable.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Most home routers have four Ethernet ports allowing four computers or other devices to share the Internet connection. Add on to that an 8 port unmanaged switch such as a Netgear FS608, and you now have 10 ports that can be used for sharing. You can add more or bigger switches until you run out of IP addresses on the router\u2019s private subnet. My first router about 20 years ago allowed me to share Internet with my son. That router had only two wired ports and no WiFi. ",
