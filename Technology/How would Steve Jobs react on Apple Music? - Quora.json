            "answer_text": "When Steve Jobs was alive, he wasn\u2019t a fan of subscription music services. But in 2020? The market started moving there several years ago, and it would have gone there with or without Apple Music. If Steve Jobs was still alive, he would eventually move towards a music subscription service, because of course he would. (Whether he would have done it with the speed that Tim Cook did by buying Beats is a different question.) He also moved toward an App Store, and other things that he was originally dead-set against. Take with a grain of salt any pronouncements he made about something being a bad idea. Times change, people change, and Steve Jobs was as capable of being wrong about things as anyone else. ",
