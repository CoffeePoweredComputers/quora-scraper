            "answer_text": "While we often hear about the negative effects of excessive screen time and the dangers of social media, we don\u2019t always hear about the positive ways technology makes a difference in our lives, especially when it comes to learning. When used well, technology can help improve education for students, parents, and teachers. The \u201cold-fashioned\u201d pencil-and-paper methods of learning are still needed in the classroom. But technology introduces lots of great tools to help students learn more efficiently. How? Find out here: 1. Digital simulations There are many concepts in education that are quite difficult to understand on pure imagination alone. Things like how an engine works, how a ball bounces, or even things like how chemical reactions take place. New technology has allowed digital simulations to permeate into the modern classroom and get a more \"hands-on approach in topics they otherwise never would be able to. 2. Communication & the digital classroom Communication is a vital part of the transfer of information in any educational setting. Technology is helping aide this process through virtual classrooms and collaboration tools. These are online workspaces where students can communicate with one another, take quizzes, and plug into the school network whenever they would like. 3. Testing Essentially every aspect of the modern classroom can be presented and prepared through a piece of technology. If schools trusted students to learn on their own, though they probably shouldn't, students could complete the entirety of their lives' education sitting in a chair in their own room. 4. Learn Anytime, Anywhere The use of technology can mean that learning is no longer confined to the traditional time and setting of the classroom. In this way, it opens up the learning environment to anytime, anywhere\u2013and at a pace that is comfortable for the students as well. 5. Availability of Choices The timing and quality of learning feedback is critical for growth to happen. Students can also make choices about what types of activities they want to use and therefore are more empowered in their learning and can self-direct. If you give some of the control and leave the decision making to students to choose how to show what they have learned, or let them design their own homework assignment, they have the chance to be more empowered, and build momentum that can endure after the unit is over. 6. Relevant knowledge Resources One of the advantages of digital tools is that it can make some things more accessible; anytime, anywhere access to information, past work, groups, experts, and more are not the only benefit of technology. The resources and materials have more of an opportunity to stay up-to-date, and there are many so choices that each student can find something that is relevant to them. ",

            "answer_text": "I sense you're interested in the \"learning process\" in a broad sense, but since my work experience in education is heavily based on the public school setting, that is the realm I feel qualified to discuss here.  Technology, like any tool, depends on the skill of the person wielding it. Most everyone has heard the expression \"a shoddy craftsman blames his tools.\" The same goes for education, especially in light of the fact that the single greatest in-school factor in determining the success or failure of a student is the quality of her teacher.  That being said, I think that one of the greatest technological tools that is not yet being utilized to its potential is the smartphone that's already in the pockets of 1 in 4 teens. Since it's generally expected that the proportion of school-aged children with smartphones will continue to increase, educators should take advantage of the huge resource that is internet-enabled smartphones, which they're currently spending great amounts of energy trying to discourage.  There are already a vast number of education/learning apps that could be incorporated into the curriculum. Perhaps a platform could eventually be designed that would enable students to log into a class network and allow teachers to monitor what information each student is viewing. Smartphones could be used in lieu of traditional computers and would allow each student (under the guidance of a good teacher) to better individualize their learning process. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me start by saying this: The number one impact on improving outcomes for students is the teacher in the classroom. You can give a bad teacher the best technological resources in the world, but still not move the needle and impact the student. You can have a really good teacher with limited technology and I believe they will make more strides than a poor teacher loaded with technology tools. So to answer your question about how technology helps with the learning process, there are several ways. First, technology serves as a productivity and efficiency tool enabling students and teachers to receive information in an organized and applicable fashion. Technology also gives teachers and students opportunities to apply what learning in relevant ways. Today\u2019s students are born into a digital world so technology allows teachers to reach and connect with students in an engaging and relevant way. There are so many different tech tools in the market and each of them play various roles that support curriculum, instruction, assessment, and even social/emotional learning. For example, I work for an ed tech company that helps teachers and students see where they are in the learning process. Dr. John Hattie, a renown educational research did a big study where he looked at key indicators that improve student achievement. His idea of \u2018visible learning\u2019 speaks to the fact that students need to see clearly what is expected of them and have opportunities to reflect on their own data and become more self-directed taking ownership of the learning process. FocalPointK12, the company I work with brings multiple assessment results into a platform that organizes standards mastery reports for all stakeholders. From there, students and teachers can see where they are identifying their strengths and areas where improvement is needed. The platform then serves up relevant digital resources that meet students where they are helping them work through different materials that target problem areas. This is just one example of how technology can empower students and teachers. Another product that we offer is a tool called Communities. The platform allows students and teachers to create virtual groups that allow them to share documents, have discussions, do polling, and collaborate in a manner that helps facilitate the learning process. I like to look at technology as the fuel that helps ignite, engage, and empower students and teachers to go further and faster in the learning and teaching process while making the process fun and relevant!

            "answer_text": "Two terms, technology and learning process. Even though there is exponential advances in technology, why there is little difference in education? Simply because teachers reject the use of technology. It is not reject but they reluctant to use because technology is too advance and they can't use it. They can't assist students to use it. I hope that engineers also make friendly tools for teachers because some of them is too old to learn difficult tools. If teachers don't want to use it, students will not too. How many teachers who can't use educational technological tools? a lot But students still can use it by themselves, they learn by themselves. So there is two question here, how can technology help students in schools or how can technology help students personally? To help education in general, there will be a bit difficult. Because need a lot to with bureaucracy and administrative things. But for personal learning, technology has an ample room to improve learning process. I would suggest connectivism[1] theory as the ground basis of learning process. We can't use all type of technology. But we can choose which technology is the most suitable with us, to learn effectively.  There is many types of technology. We can use which one is the most suitable for us, and then it was called personal learning network(PLN)[2] . Personal is flexible because we choose what we use and how we use it and with who we use it. Network because we learn with other people and we also share and contribute. Learning because we also want to learn with some expert but in the same time we also share our thought about certain topics. For example I use the combination of quora, Ted talk, YouTube, WordPress and LinkedIn for professional development. We don't always ON 24 hours but we can choose what we want, offer what we want, take what we want, choose when we want, it will be always easily and accessible. I would say connected learning is the first step to make the most of the use of technology[3] . Because we can learn and share knowledge and share content or create video at the same time. Another ways to improving learning process is by providing effective assessment and feedback[4] . If there is a technology that provide a good feedback and comprehensive assessment, it can be used to enhance learning process. Technology can be used as effective feedback tools. We can learn better through feedback. Based on John Hattie idea, feedback has a significant impact on students achievement[5] . In this case, if technology can assist teachers to give effective feedback, it will be beneficial and make huge impacts for students learning. In this case I hope engineers also always revised their educational technological products, please include technological products for teachers based on teachers feedback and students feedback as well. Don't assume that education is like bussiness that will be easily gain profit or result. And what work in industry will be easily work for schooling system because both of them need communicate effectively. Well, that's just my two cents. Through personalised learning network and feedback.

            "answer_text": "As a teacher and educational manager, i have always been an advocate of utilising technology within the learning realm and explored or tested many variations of applying this new channel to help students achieve an educational outcome. But it was when I bought an ocean kayak to go fishing offshore that I personally experienced the power of technology to help with my learning. My problem was that I could not access one-to-one / face-to-face learning from an experienced kayaker in the vicinity that I wanted to go fishing (which I believe would have ben the best option). So had to find other channels to reach this learning that I needed. My concerns were safety (I could drown or float away in the ocean) and techniques to be mastered to eliminate the high risks to my life. So not only was I motivated to go and catch some great fish, but to also come home and remove the worried look off my wife\u2019s face. Youtube, Youtube, Youtube \u2026.was by far the master for gaining the amount of knowledge to give me confidence before my first real life experience. The first real life experience did give myself a large section of learning but it was the technology of Youtube that gave me the confidence to take on that first small step into the unknown. I have watched Youtube become a very powerful tool in education and it will continue to do so as more integrations occur on this platform. With my daughter studying now at university, I have watch her do almost all of her lectures through video/Youtube. Her study life now occurs in her \u2018downtime\u2019 of work and life, whereas my oldest son had to attend lectures (pre-Youtube) and work and life had to yield to the timetable schedule. My daughter also PAUSES or STOPS the video to attend to other aspects of learning e.g. reading the text / doing the worksheets. I have also seen her REWIND or MUTE the tutor in some practical classes as she said the voice was distracting from the action being performed. But the classic was the 2XSPEED of lectures or even FAST FORWARD to help reduce the duration of the lectures. This YOUTUBE technology has now given my daughter additional time in her week to be applied in whatever manner she desires. Sometimes it is further studies other times it is in developing her life skills. YOUTUBE has decreased the WEEKLY duration of time spent in completing the lectures but has not dented the YEARLY duration of study. The video on a YOUTBE platform can achieve some much more than the few snippets above, it can also do: multiple cameras at same timemultiple zoom views at same timeability to stich videos to provide a 360 degree viewvery little effort required by instructor to capture already happening eventvideo capture can be recorded in real time and can be relatively low quality (e.g. mobile phone quality) but with good audio.and stored for a long timeeasily retrieved and searchable on YOUTUBE with tags/title/descriptionsintegrated with STOP/GO questioning techniquescan be animation/graphic/3D modelling/text/pictures/music/audio/voiceannotations/transcripts/comments/descriptionsAll of the above can improve the elements or the cycle of ASSESS/FEEDBACK/TEACH/LEARN especially now that this cycle can be as small as 1\u20132 minutes whereas pre YOUTUBE the cycles were much larger with the traditional SEMESTER still holding strong as the accepted norm. But DISRUPTION and IMPROVEMENT usually upset the \u2018norms\u2019. YOUTUBE is now becoming the number 1 platform for \u201cHOW TO\u201d and at present it is treated and labelled as HOBBY, but I sense that the HOBBY HOW TO will quickly become the COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY HOW TO and where the money lies so too does the influence. Learning no longer just resides in educational organisations, but is now becoming the \u2018norm\u2019 for all outside of educational organisations. The majority of the population and Industry\u2019s will learn outside these organisations. And just as the printing press disrupted the Church\u2019s hold of reading and learning, so too will the video/YOUTUBE disrupt the learning by allowing the vast majority to learn in their downtime. I see two (2) types of learning occurring on YOUTUBE: Emergency learning - the thing is broken and I need to learn in the fastest possible time while keeping \u201cthe project\u201d alive. Learning in a forced downtime due to the stopped project.Relaxed downtime learning - where I wish to learn during downtime that I am experiencing due to my own decisions e.g. (travel time / late night study or a casual weekend learn)Both of these areas require a different formation of the content on YOUTUBE. The EMERGENCY learning should be no more than 2 minutes, no introduction, problem is identified in the TITLE and SOLUTION is delivered in under 2 minutes. If a longer duration is needed then it is better to have more videos than a longer video. The RELAXED DOWNTIME learning can be more accustomed to lectures of today but should be more like TED TALK style where there is a definite focus on a particular topic. Duration should not exceed 20 minutes as this is a well researched length of time to hold a participants attention to the topic being delivered. To improve retention many of the enhanced \u2018snippets\u2019 above can be included. FEEDBACK can be optional and is only required for either teacher or learner to appreciate what has been retained by one\u2019s brain. Remembering that this information can be readily accessed again and again if needed. No-one assessed my skill as a kayaker, the real ocean, the real waves did that too me. But I was glad that I did retain some information as I ventured into those ocean waves for the very first time. And my wife was happy to see me return with some fish. ",

            "answer_text": "As compared to other sector, technology has been a late entrant in the education sector. It has already made positive impacts in the health, infrastructure, etc. However, now that it has made the entry, it has brought forth quite a few positive changes. There are many eduTech organisations working relentlessly and researching to come up with new pedagogies that can be executed with technology. The motif of these organisation is to bring forth positive learning outcomes that has been neglected for a very long time.Next Education is one such organisation bringing forth positive learning outcomes. New age content: Teachers have struggled to hold students\u2019 attention for long. Now, with educational content available as 2D and 3D animated videos, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) videos, abstract content is given a real-life representation. Students understand such concepts better when depicted through a video. Learning management system: A software application, it facilitates creation, administration of content and its delivery. It as a platform opens space for collaboration between all stakeholders. Teachers can now share learning materials prior to conducting classroom lecture. Students can through the content beforehand, and the classroom can turn into a place of discussion and debate. Actionable reports on the performance of teachers and students can be extracted to understand the gaps and mitigate those gaps. Adaptive learning: It is an educational technology that responds to students\u2019 interactions in real time. Based on a student\u2019s response to a particular question, tools provide relevant hints, corrective feedback and resources. There are many resources available like simulations, YouTube videos, notes, etc. The tool recommends the use of one over the other as per the need and learning pattern of a particular student. Adaptive assessments help in identifying learning gaps. A mid-level question is presented to students. If they answer it correctly, the difficulty level of subsequent question is raised and if they give an incorrect answer, the difficulty bar is lowered. Thus, in a short span, the learning gaps and progress are identified. ",

            "answer_text": "In our current culture, in our current world, I don't think technology can replace the human element of a great teacher. I think the MOOCs have partially proven this, that even among a subset of people who have enough initiative to seek out independent learning only 10% actually complete the courses. Maybe it's also because the MOOCs are really just shoddy-to-mediocre LMS systems that could be improved drastically, but I also think change in education requires a more fundamental shift in how our culture views learning. So I think technology can enhance the learning process by making it more relevant to students, personalizing the content, helping teachers fill their classes with the most interesting material possible. I believe one of the biggest battles is simply proving to people that learning can be an interesting and compelling experience. Steve Jobs speaks for me.    That's what I believe technology in education can be: a bicycle for the mind.  While I don't think technology can replace education, at least not yet, I believe that it can enhance the learning process. And in one way or another, I'd like to help build the system that realizes this vision. ",
