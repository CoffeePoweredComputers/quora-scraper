            "answer_text": "It is rather difficult to be definitive about this for two reasons: It depends on how you define a modern programmable computer.It depends on which contributions you deem as significant.Firstly what is a modern programmable computer. If you mean one like your desktop, then the number of inventions/inventors is very numerous. The invention of the concept of a computing machine belongs to Charles Babbage. However, his concept was mechanical (not electronic) and therefore not comparable to any modern programmable computer. Often people choose the stored program computer as a landmark. This is a computer which uses the same memory for the program as for other data (*). The first stored program computer was Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine which was developed by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. (*) This is arguably architecturally different from a modern programmable computer which is typically a Modified Harvard architecture. ",

            "answer_text": "The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing, in his seminal 1936 paper on Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called \"Universal Computing machine\" that is later known as a Universal Turing machine. He proved that such machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is stored program, where all instruction for computing is stored in the memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.
