            "answer_text": "That can depend on terrain and many other factors. Some of which is how much fuel is laying on the ground, how many dead trees are in that fire. We have a fire in Northern Colorado now that is burning for at least the last month. It has stands of trees that are dead from the pine beetle that is being consumed now. When that hilly terrain burns it may change how the rocks and soil is stabilized so slides may happen. With our real heroes on the front line working to contain the fires they have to think of the safety of those people, they have to have safe places to be for when things go bad. We had a snow storm a bit over a week ago that dropped up to 18 inches of snow, that helped slow the spread and gave them a chance to redirect the efforts and they have done a great Job. Thank you to every person working on this fire and all the other fires everywhere. When a ran event happens it will make the atmosphere a bit more humid which is needed in this semi arid region. It is very dry still so any help we can get we will take. I am worried because of the storm systems that we have anytime can produce some wind events. All bets are off, my bug out bag has been packed and the RV is prepped to go in case I see the flames start over the ridge to the north. Many will lose what they have dreamed and worked for. We knew that when we moved into the woods, we worry but some are prepared. Send some good vibes to everyone involved. ",
