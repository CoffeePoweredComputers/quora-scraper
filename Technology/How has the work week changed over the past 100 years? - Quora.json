            "answer_text": "By 1920 the industrial standard 40 hour week was well established. Of course, at that time only men were in the workforce. Since then there has been a slow trend away from firm standard work schedules because people aren\u2019t uniform. A diverse workforce requires a diversity of schedules. It\u2019s obvious that we can\u2019t all work the same hours simply because we need each other\u2019s professional services. I can\u2019t use your services if you\u2019re only available during my work hours. Somebody has to give. Some people have lives that don\u2019t fit well with the standard work week. Parents, people with disabilities, and those with engaging hobbies may need certain times away from work. Supply and demand also play in scheduling workers. ",
