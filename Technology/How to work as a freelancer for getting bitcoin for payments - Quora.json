            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not entirely sure what you\u2019re asking\u2026 As a freelancer you can accept bitcoin payments either by directly having your client transfer bitcoin to your wallet as payment or by using a service such as bitpay to accept payments in the form of bitcoin. If you\u2019re asking, \u201chow do i get paid in bitcoin?\u201d I\u2019d say you just offer it as a form of payment for the work that your\u2019e doing. It\u2019s still super early in the adoption of cypto, So I would assume few people actually use bitcoin for payment at this point. I\u2019m sure there are some people who also are early adopters and do use crypto but, it will probably be a small group. ",
