            "answer_text": "We already have. Advanced AIs routinely pass the Turing Test with flying colours. And if a human can\u2019t tell the difference whether they are interacting with a real person or not it naturally means that the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d has been crossed. Now, we don\u2019t have convincing robotics to create in metal a passable robotic equivalent for human beings. That\u2019s not a problem with AI, and that is for human beings with normal cognition. Because e.g. robots are currently being actively deployed for the care of the elderly who entered senility. And they don\u2019t seem to be able to tell the difference between a robot and and an actual human. Robots seem to be able to provide sufficient comfort and companionship so as to invoke much the same emotional reactions that a human would when these people interact with them. Same is true for children up to a certain age. But then again, people seem to have a predisposition to suspending disbelief. People talk to rocks, plants and animals as if they are persons and think that they are answering back. As well as engage in sexual activity with most arbitrary things, including robotized devices and it seems to do the trick for them\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "In some places we already have, the problem is that as human beings we are not linear so a face that is slightly off bothers us much more than a voice for example. So with hands, feet, and voice we are quire comfortable and it does not bother us. But with a face and congruency of motion we are looking at a few years. ",
