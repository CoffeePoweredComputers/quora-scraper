            "answer_text": "Yes there are a few ways to use your mobile phone to make a call from your landline phone service. Get a landline handset that has Bluetooth. Use your mobile phone as a Bluetooth client. While I worked for Telstra, I took home and tested a couple of phones that do this. They were also smart enough to let me sync my mobile contacts into the landline phone's dialing directory.Use a VoIP service such as Skype that enables you to set the caller ID to your landline phone. You may need a landline phone that is able to receive an SMS, in order to set this up. Then you use your phone's own dialer or the supplied VoIP app to make calls via your Wi-Fi connection but the person you call will see the call as coming from your landline number.Get an Easy to use Videophone, ideal for older adults - Konnekt and use that as your main phone. Ask to have it set up so that calls appear to come from your mobile phone number, OR setup the Skype app on your mobile using the same Skype account and caller ID as your video phone. This has the added benefit of providing video calls and group calls.In Australia, Telstra also supplied an app that lets you do exactly what you have requested, via Wi-Fi from your mobile phone. Check whether your own landline phone service provider offers such an app.",
