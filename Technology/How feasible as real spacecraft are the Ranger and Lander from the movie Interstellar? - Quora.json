            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with the Ranger. It is an SSTO (Single stage to orbit) that lands on planets before returning to orbit. This counters the traditional idea of rocket-stage space travel, as it does not separate it\u2019s components. It SEEMS like far-out future tech, but in reality, SSTO\u2019s are already being tested.  Skylon is an SSTO designed to send cargo into orbit. A prototype has already been built, though it is being tested more for aerodynamic stability than it\u2019s ability to get into orbit and release it\u2019s cargo. So, at least the concept is solid. But, the Ranger looks completely different, and has small wings! Never fear\u2026 the lifting body is here to rescue it. Wings are shaped in an airfoil shape:  And if the BODY of the aircraft or spacecraft is shaped like an airfoil, then it produces lift without needing wings. And the ranger\u2019s curves match an airfoil. So we simply have the engines. The main engine of the Ranger is a chemical rocket. Chemical rockets are \u2026.. classic rockets. The type we use today. They have two chemicals which react to each other (Maybe with a lighter) to combust and lift the rocket into the air. Then we have the plasma jets. These are actually not that complicated, at least relative to rocket science. They superheat fuel (Typically some form of gas.) until it becomes plasma, right before it gets launched out of the aerospike engine. So, overall? I give the Ranger a nine out of ten for accuracy. The only reason it is NOT ten is the appearance of the aerospike engines. THIS is an aerospike engine:  And this is the Ranger:  Big difference, right? The nozzles are completely different. ",
