            "answer_text": "From Future Unicorns, an excerpt from my Entrepreneur Journeys book, Billion Dollar Unicorns:   As I think about where future unicorns are likely to be, what trends present the characteristics of opportunities that can scale to that extent, I have a few observations. I have had the opportunity to discuss these observations with a number of thoughtful industry leaders, and this chapter synthesizes some of those conversations in brief. If you review the types of companies in this book, they span a few specific industry sectors: Cloud / SaaS (Marketo, ServiceNow, Concur, Zoho, eClinicalWorks, RightNow, SuccessFactors), Big Data (Tableau), E-commerce (Eventbrite, MercadoLibre, Flipkart), Vertical Search (Kayak, Trulia), Healthcare IT (AthenaHealth, eClinicalWorks), etc. Of these, Cloud / SaaS is a mature market. Both horizontal business applications and vertical business applications are maturing. New opportunities tend to come from discontinuities, and mature markets don\u2019t necessarily present those. That begs the question: where are the discontinuities? The best answer to think question comes from the dynamics of small businesses consuming technology at a much faster clip than before. For every enterprise cloud app, you could, conceivably, have an equivalent offering for the small business market. Marketo, for example, is interested in larger customers, you could build an equivalent product and sell it to the low end of the market. Mobile / Smartphone penetration globally is a major discontinuity, so consensus is that there will be new opportunities in this realm. Uber is an interesting example of a mobile app that is essentially a front-end for calling cabs and limos efficiently. Currently, there is a frenzied search among entrepreneurs and investors for the next Uber-style mobile app that offers a hybrid between an online and an offline service \u2013 transportation, in Uber\u2019s case. In fact, the convergence of mobile and cloud is an area worth exploring as well, especially for apps that take advantage of the geo location capabilities of mobile devices. Less frenzied is an area that I believe has a lot of discontinuity, and a great deal of opportunity, although it is an operationally complex category. Similar to AthenaHealth, business services that not only provide cloud software, but actually outsources an entire business function \u2013 SaaS-enabled BPO \u2013 is one that I am bullish about. Especially, when you look at the current trend of modular, ultra-light small businesses, where solo entrepreneurs build $5 million revenue businesses by outsourcing EVERYTHING, it is easy to see that there will be entrepreneurs catering to this trend. Similarly, Big Data is a very hot sector right now, and there too, I expect to see large companies emerge who will not only provide software, but also services. Many Big Data offerings are extremely complicated to use. Customers buy them, but then, use only 10% of its full range of capabilities. Why buy a Ferrari if you are going to drive it like a Toyota? Perhaps, the answer lies in offering the drivers as well, not just the cars. Or, to extend the metaphor further, driverless cars may be the holy grail of big data and machine learning! E-commerce, although mature, continues to be an area rife with opportunities. One of the largest in this area is online fashion, a gigantic industry that is yet to fully feel the shift into e-commerce. It is becoming dramatically cheaper to build new brands starting with an e-commerce specialty store with a differentiated user experience, interesting merchandising, personalization, use of mobile shopping capabilities, etc. I fully expect to see Unicorns emerge in this corner of the digital universe. As an entrepreneur who started one of the first online fashion companies on the Internet back in 1999, I am watching this space with great interest. Also, the global opportunities are significant today, which is why I included Flipkart and MercadoLibre in this collection. Entrepreneurship is globalizing at an exhilarating scale, and even though Silicon Valley tends to think of itself as the center of the startup universe, who knows what the future has in store? Finally, the domain of Artificial Intelligence is progressing fast, and it would be safe to say that it will disrupt many fields from medicine to law to marketing, introducing automation at a scale unknown thus far. A computer has a more powerful memory and much better processing power to take imaging, lab, and other test data, run them against powerful algorithms, and do a much better job diagnosing patients, prescribing treatments. Media buying decisions online are already seeing real time buying as the primary trend, something impossible to do by hand. Unicorns will be born from such extensive automation for sure, although the societal impact of such massive scale automation is likely to be painful. By no means do I claim to have any grand view into the uniquely wonderful minds of entrepreneurs who are or will be building the next set of Unicorn companies. All I have tried to do is to simulate for a large, global audience of entrepreneurs, the experience of having a cup of coffee with people whom they would likely not meet in that capacity. There is much to learn from each of them. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been asked many times how to think of a fantastic business idea. After more research I feel this is one of the biggest barriers to young entrepreneurs. It all starts with the thought, but how do you come up with the upcoming great thing? Businesses Solve Problems A useful tool is something which solves an issue. A couple of years back somebody was frustrated by not being able to join two boards, and so that they devised a nail and figured something out to use to drive that nail; the arrival of the hammer. The real challenge of a great idea is making it personal. It is not finding only some difficulty to fix, it's locating the problem which you would love to repair. Keep a\"Problem Journal\" Carry a small notebook in your pocket. Each time you come across a problem write it down. There are so many issues on the planet, big and small. Just consciously considering these issues as opportunities has led to great businesses and products like Roomba, Uber, and AirBNB (the latter two being billion dollar firms ). This all possible as a result of an idea! Solve Everyday Problems About ten decades ago, before I had the guts to really go to it in entrepreneurship, I had a terrific idea. I lived in Wisconsin. They call it the frozen tundra for a reason. It was the middle of the winter and it only dumped about 8 inches of snow. As I was hoping to warm up the car enough to de-ice the windshield so I could scratch itI thought\"wouldn't it be awesome have something that you could just lay over the windshield until it snows you could just pull off whenever you are ready to depart the morning and never need to freeze your hands off since you scratch a window again?\" But I never acted. This is a real problem and I thought of a true solution, but not tried to build a prototype to test the idea, something that could have cost me less than $50 to perform. I have lately seen products on the market that do this specific thing. $50 and no follow through cost me possibly the chance of creating that great idea into a really prosperous business. Take your thoughts out of your journal and read through them. Which one drives you crazy? How do you fix it? If no great idea comes to you, visit another one. Create drawings and follow on analyzing your idea by building a prototype and using it yourself. Make changes to boost your own solution. The point is solved YOUR problem, then work on solving it for others. When it is a common problem your prospective customer base is huge and people will readily identify with your own offering. Find a Problem You're Passionate About A company is not easy. You need to enjoy your job and feel enthused about the problem you're fixing so you're able to sell your idea to others. I mean to sell in the literal sense and the figurative. You have to construct enthusiasm for your idea in other people, get their buy-in the issue and solution. So, what problem for you hate to face every day? What drives you bonkers? (Yeah, I am bringing back bonkers.) This passion is the trick to the remainder of the development. You have to have something that will drive you through in the hard days of building the business. Yes, there will be tough times, but so many more great ones if you love your thought! Produce A Problem Some of the maximum startups come from issues people did not even know they had. It is innovation. Many entrepreneurs fail to come up with a great concept because they don't even really think about what is possible. To understand what is possible, one has to learn and expand their context. I'm primarily a property guy and that I can solve a good deal of problems since I've researched a lot. I understand the perceived limits and that I really like to push them. That's what a great startup does. You need to push the limitations of something you love. Innovate and Challenge the Status Quo What do all these businesses have in common? Innovation and being one of the originals in their market. They created an issue and solved it. Before Apple and Microsoft, folks were simply fine working they way they did. The status quo was comfortable, but once these men which were mad enough to conceive of a planet with a working computer sitting on every desk in every office in the world. This computing power wasn't only confined to large corporations anymore. Presently a small company can compete with big ones. Look how this one thought changed the world! LEARN, LEARN, LEARN You have to be committed to the idea enough that you are hungry to learn everything about it. This is the most significant part of the puzzle. Doing a great deal of study and learning how to enlarge your context is similar to building the edge of the mystery first: it gives you the foundation to build everything else. You've got to learn the market. What retailers could carry your product (if physical) or how you are going to get it in the hands of as many people as possible so it is possible to solve the problem for them? Who is your ideal customer? Who are your competitors? How much would you pay to solve this problem? Go out and ask folks. Start with family and friends, but then get out to areas or areas where your perfect customers would hang outside. Read books, magazines, and online articles similar to you to continually enhance your knowledge. I will write a second article on this another day. The most useful startup idea is one you lovethat solves a problem that drives you bonkersthat you can produce on a large scale.",
