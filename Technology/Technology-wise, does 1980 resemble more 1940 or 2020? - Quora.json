            "answer_text": "It does not often happen, but for at least once here on Quora, I disagree somewhat with the previous three answers. There is absolutely no comparison between the years 1940 and 1980 - whereas, between the years 1980 and 2020, overall, there is very little to choose from. Furthermore, as I am old enough to have lived through the final years of the 1940's, I really should know what I am talking about here. For example, in 1940, scarcely anyone possessed a television set. In 1980, unless you were some sort of eccentric (and I do recall there there were quite a few of those around at the time), everyone had a TV. Just like today in fact. The only difference being, today folks can carry the thing around in their pockets. Not everyone had a telephone in 1940. Indeed should the old movies be anything to go by, only the rich and the famous could afford such luxuries. Today, everyone has a telephone, exactly the same as 1980, the only difference being... yeah, you've guessed it, in 2020 we carry them around about our person. There were no computers in 1940, but by 1968, I, barely out of my teens, as a young office manager was making programs for the things. In 1940, space travel was science fiction. In fact so unbelievable as to be the work of science fantasy. Perhaps up there with Superman even. In 1980, it had been eleven years since we had first landed on the Moon. As I have already intimated, compared with 1980, 1940 was way back there in the Stone Age. ",

            "answer_text": "The mass communication technologies of the 1940\u2019s had improved substantially from the 1940s but they were still dominant. Those technologies may have moved from radio and vinyl to television and cassette tapes, some folks had Sony Walkmen, the Apple ][ existed as a computer (though few people had hands on personal computers and there was no graphic user interface outside PARC). Technology is accelerating, because of that acceleration 1980 is technologically MUCH closer to 1940 than to 2020. The internet, which was broadly introduced in the mid 1990s and became dominant during the mid 2000s was inaccessible in 1980. The first time I saw the early internet was in the mid 1980s on an IBM luggable running compuserve. That was relatively exotic then, I saw it because I lived in Silicon Valley and lots of folks had fathers who worked for IBM. In 2020 you see the internet if you have a pulse and make more than $5 a day (and even for those $5/day users the internet is much more powerful and easy to use than the mid 1980s compuserve).   ",
