            "answer_text": "Brother, let me first clear that windows are not responsible for the performance in any laptop. Performance depends upon the processor and your RAM. Windows is just a platform to run a laptop. Which processor do you have? Whether you have SSD or HDD? How much is your RAM? Please answer above questions so that I can help you with your problem. You should check following ways I should suggest you to backup your data and reset your window. It will not delete anything but your softwares who are installed will be uninstalled.After reset, your laptop will work effectively. Please don't install unnecessary software, they run on your background and seizes your RAM.Please don't install any type of free antivirus whether it is avast or avira. From my experience the window defender( which is the antivirus provided preinstalled in windows by Microsoft) is the best antivirus.Delete your temp files regularly. Go to run. Type temp and then search. A pop up window with unnecessary file will come. Delete them all.Lastly please provide me the specs of your laptop so I can further help you ",

            "answer_text": "Because Windows 10 is a bloated piece of shit, is the simple answer. I run Zorin OS 15.2 Lite on this machine, and it\u2019s running just fine. It only has 2GB of RAM on board. If you are running 32 bit architecture, then forget any kind of performance from Windows 10. It will simply hog most of your system memory. This is just one of the reasons that I point blank refuse to install Windows 10. There is no need, no need at all to keep spending money on new hardware, because Microshite cannot build an OS without it being a bloated, insecure and unstable piece of CRAP, when there are much more sensible options available. Unless you are a hardcore gamer, virtually ANY Linux Distro will run far better on older machines than Windows. So you will find that the problem IS in fact the simple truth of the matter, that Windows is basically shit, and resource hungry as hell. ",
