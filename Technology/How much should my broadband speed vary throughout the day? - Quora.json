            "answer_text": "All internet resources are shared. If a lot of people use a lot of bandwidth at the same time, bottlenecks will develop and everybody will experience less speed. Cable internet providers generally place a \u201cnode\u201d in an ugly green box on somebody\u2019s lawn. The node serves several neighbors. If all neighbors stream video at the same time, the node might saturate and everybody will get less bandwidth. Fiber optic providers generally have a dedicated connection from the house to the switch office. Once in the switch office, all fiber users share the resources of the switch gear in that office. The amount your speed varies depends on the type of service (DSL, cable, fiber, satellite). It depends on the capacity at every step between your computer and the server you are visiting. It depends on the server you are visiting. This is often overlooked. The server you are visiting has limited resources. The company running the server has strategies for giving good service to most while sharing the server\u2019s resources among all. It depends on how much bandwidth you purchased. People with a very high speed connection experience bottlenecks sooner and more frequently than people with lower speed connections. This is often intentional. Slowing one user from 1 Gbps to 500 Mbps allows 5 customers with 100 Mbps to continue their activities. ",

            "answer_text": "How long is a piece of string? It varies enormously. Is this ADSL or VDSL (fibre to the cabinet) or Fibre to the premises? Are you on dialup? Do you connect using wifi? What speed is your internet? How good is your ISP? If you are using a vry low cost provider and you are on low bandwidth on say a 3Mbps ASDL connection, then you will find your speed varies noticeably a lot. If you are on Fibre to the premises then you will get pretty much exactly your stated speed the whle time. If you are on a cable model (in the UK Virgin) and you have say a 300 Mbps service then whist it may vary from 100\u2013250 Mbps, you will not notice it as you are only using a fraction of that. ",
