            "answer_text": "I have been doing their so called \u2018Data entry\u2019 shit for about 3\u20134 months and hence I think I consider myself eligible enough to answer this question. So it all begun with an executive calling me and asking me to join their work from home thing where they I am supposed to pay 4500/- for a single project and if they approve that particular project, then they would give a certain amount of salary, beginning with 4000/- to 40000/- (max). I thought I could have done the hard work (specifically looking at the amount (^.^)). I called the executive back and asked her to give me a project of Data typing. The company then mailed me ( the point to be noted here is that the company replied and not any individual, which is absurd enough). They issued me an authentication for that specific software after a hell lot of formalities. Then I started working for the given work. Here comes the real story. You are suppose to take daily backup of your work till the last date of submission (10 days) . Unfortunately, the software keeps on crashing every single time when you are working with windows 8 or windows 10. When I mentioned about this problem to the sales executive she asked me to change my system to windows 7 and a system containing Office 7. Well I dont understand the internal working of the softwares and all of that, but who the dumb son of a cat uses windows 7 and office 7 nowadays man. Anyways, somehow I arranged a laptop with those old school specifications and then started to working with the project again. So this time I had to make them believe that I have a \u2018Genuine\u2019 problem and hence requested them to issue another authentication key for the software as I was installing it in another system. The mail appeared to be as this - \u201cLast and final Auth key - ##########\u201d. Its like working for someone who pronounces \u201cSEQUEL\u201d (SQL) as \u201cESQEL\u201d. Dumb right? Anyways I started working for the project. The thing is that they give a target of completing 200 pages in 10 days. So that's 20 pages a day if you need the maximum amount from them. I have a pretty good speed of typing and yet I needed almost 1 hour to complete a single page of the given project. So for optimum production i needed to dedicate about 20 hours a day for the maximum amount. But its not about the time, its about the content that you are about to write. The content is like the Bibliography of a medical journal. They aren't someone who wants you complete the project. Their strategy is just like every other business plans - \u201c Try to get the profit by collecting the funds from people, when you arent making profits of your own \u201c. It was a total disappointment and a complete waste of time and money. I would never suggest to work for someone like that. Briefly its better to search for some other options. Dont go for MANTHAN SOLUTIONS EVER. ",
