            "answer_text": "Question: You are in charge of selecting 10 people to go to a planet just like Earth & rebuild civilization. Who would you pick? Am I already included, or do I count as one of the ten? Surviving is fun, so I\u2019m going to play it safe and put myself on the list. Some of the following people are included under the assumption that we are heading for an already inhabitable planet. Tyler Morton. Why not? I\u2019m young, smart, creative. Tyler Morton: The future of mankind. I like the sound of that. Not to be egotistical or anything, but if I have a chance to survive in favor of some other random teenager, I\u2019m going to choose myself.Rocket Scientist. I need someone who will be able to guide the ship and keep the rest of us alive in space. A rocket scientist would hopefully be experienced in other areas of science and therefore be able to act as our resident scientific genius.Historian. Who better to continue the legacy of the human race than a historian. The person would be preserving thousands of years of human knowledge.Botanist. What kind space exploration team/group of misfits would we be without a potato growing astronaut? All jokes aside, having someone experienced in plants and the cultivation of said plants would be an incredible asset when venturing into unknown terrain.Love Interest. My current crush because, again, why not? If I\u2019m going to have to watch the world implode as I fly away in my spaceship, I might as well do it with someone I wouldn\u2019t mind getting close to. And how am I supposed to help ensure that the human legacy continues when we\u2019d probably die out in a century or so.Geneticist. Inbreeding could become a big problem in the long run, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to bring along this almost obsolete player. This individual will be working hard day and night to prevent genetic disorders from arising in our very limited supply of humans. When our problems don\u2019t involve genetics, we can use him for manual labor.Hunter/Survivor. I honestly can\u2019t picture myself or a bunch of scientists picking up a knife and skinning a animal. Regardless of what I can imagine, I doubt that I could go much more than a week without meat. We\u2019ll need someone experienced in surviving in the wild with little resources.Fighter. What happens when a wild bear comes into our base and starts mauling our scientists? What happens when the locals show their faces and want us gone? I don\u2019t know how much of a difference one person is going to do, but if I get a Navy SEAL, geared up with hefty firepower, then I think our odds of survival are pretty much peaked.Talented Musician. Just because we\u2019re watching the world end, that doesn\u2019t mean we have to do it in silence, or even worse, to the sound of implosions. A skilled musician will definitely lighten the mood. If they also happen to sing, even better.Architect/Engineer. We\u2019ll be heading to new world, without any of the infrastructure that we take for granted now. We\u2019ll want electricity, machines, maybe even computers, and with the right equipment, I\u2019d expect that this person might be able to accomplish that. We\u2019ll need help building houses and other structures, and this person could assist.So there you have it: everyone I think is necessary for the survival of the human race. ",

            "answer_text": "The majority of the people would have to be survivalists. People who can take nothing and make something out of it. It takes a lot of manual labor to carve a living out of the wilderness. Obviously, there would have to be both men and women so that they could reproduce. I\u2019d want to ensure that the people selected have good strong genes (no major hereditary illnesses or defects). At least one would be a scholar to make records of their lives and efforts (because civilization is a heck of a lot harder without records), and would be charged with creating a system of education for future generations. Although I am a huge proponent of the arts, I wouldn\u2019t really worry about having a person dedicated to that. I would hope they brought relics of Earth\u2019s arts with them, but I have no problem allowing the new civilization to develop their own arts by themselves. At least two would be scientists/engineers \u2014 people who could begin advancing the technology of the new society. Probably not huge tech people, of course, since they obviously won\u2019t have the materials or machines to create things like computers and skyscrapers right off the bat. But once the new civilization is well-enough established, the wisdom of these two founders (who probably won\u2019t survive long enough to really see this day) can be used to jump ahead to the Industrial Age within just a few generations. Metalworking, chemistry, machines, etc. Ideally the party could also carry with them some designs and blueprints for Earth\u2019s most advanced technologies at the time, so that the new civilization wouldn\u2019t have to waste time discovering them all again.
