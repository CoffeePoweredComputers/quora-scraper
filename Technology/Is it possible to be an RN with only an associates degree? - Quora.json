            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Associates Degree nursing programs are still very alive and well. You would just need to go to a community college that has a specific program for nursing. Make sure they are accredited, and that it\u2019s graduates are eligible to take the licensure exam for Registered Nurses so that you can get a license as an RN to practice nursing after graduation. The test to get an RN nursing license is called the NCLEX Exam, and it is regulated by the NCSBN - National Council of State Boards of Nursing. Only graduates from a nursing program that is registered with the NCSBN are eligible to take the exam. There are thousands of ADN programs registered throughout the US. I do have a Bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing, and probably about 70% of my nursing colleagues came from ADN programs. I work with a great group of nurses, and have met many excellent RNs from both ADN and BSN programs. There may be more opportunity for advancement with a BSN, or more options on what type of nursing you want to do, but for the type of nurse that I am and for where I work the pay is the same regardless. Either way, you can\u2019t go wrong. More education certainly never hurt anyone. There are also many ADN to BSN programs. A smart move could be to go through an ADN program and start practicing for awhile to make sure nursing is a good fit for you. Get in with a health system that has tuition reimbursement and they can help pay for your ADN to BSN college courses. I also highly recommend getting a CNA (nursing assistants certification) and trying that for awhile. It\u2019s great practice and a practical way to learn the most basic nursing skills, like bathing, toileting, and transferring. It\u2019s also great practice to learn how to communicate with patients. Hope this helps what you\u2019re curious about :) Best wishes to you! ",

            "answer_text": "I graduated in 1977 as you can see on my bio, with an ADN. Worked for 27 years as an R.N. and decided to return for my BSN when online suddenly started looking good and the organization I worked for acquired a school of nursing in an acquisition. This story has a real twist, as I applied to the U of Phoenix for a BSN and was accepted. Then ordered my transcripts and was told that I did not have an ADN but a liberal arts degree. I go out to the school and talk with the bursars office and find out when I repeated the one class the school of nursing failed to notify the bursar that I was not graduating from nursing. Well I retired in 2017 and have since worked through temp agencies since retirement. It is much easier to get a BSN today and may university hospitals want BSN nurses, but it is not impossible to become employed. ",
