            "answer_text": "You shouldn't use your phone while it charges. Use it all you want, as long as you're not using a sketchy third-party charger. There are scary reasons behind this myth. People believe that using a phone while charging will make the phone explode, or electrocute the user. Charging your phone overnight kills the battery. Your phone is smarter than you think. Once it's fully juiced up, it knows to stop charging. That means the battery isn't even in use at all. You don't need to turn your phone off \u2014 ever. Your phone may be a machine, but it still needs to take a few breaks. An Apple Genius said that in order to maximize battery life, you should turn off your phone from time to time, especially when you go to bed at night. Turning off your phone is important for Android devices as well. A simple reboot can help restore battery life. Don't charge your phone until it's completely dead. It's better to charge your phone every day than to do a \"deep charge\" from time to time. Heat will ruin a battery. This is absolutely true. Heat and tech don't generally go hand-in-hand, and that's no different with phone batteries. Lithium-ion batteries heat themselves, and get hotter while they're being charged. Cold weather can also have a negative impact on a phone's life, and a cold battery will die faster than usual in low temperatures. Your phone will be safe if you keep it within its recommended temperatures; Apple says 32 degrees Fahrenheit is the lowest recommended temperature for an Iphone\u2019s environment. Samsung, on the other hand, guarantees its phones can function anywhere between -4 and 122 degrees. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes!! It\u2019s the best you can do to save your phone\u2019s energy and the device will charge faster. I tried this out many times before (using different devices), and it actually worked. Even laptops, macbooks and other electronics will charge faster and one thing I\u2019ve noticed is, some devices (with almost 95% storage full) become really hot while charging. If you switch your phone off, then it\u2019ll stay at it\u2019s normal temperature. You can also try hibernating your apps to save power. The battery drains out even when you\u2019re not necessarily using an app, because some applications keep working while you\u2019ve already logged out of it. There are various sources which completely drain out the battery in the background (do a background check), so it\u2019s better to switch off your phone while charging. ",
