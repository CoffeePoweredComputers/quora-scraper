            "answer_text": "Fighting with your girlfriend will make you write faster than you ever thought, but, you have to be passionate about it and commit to the process. If you don't want to try such a radical method, you could measure the time it takes you to write something, like a tweet or a Facebook post and try to improve your time. You could also ask for help from a more experienced fast writer to help you measure your time or have parameters and goals to reach. On a side note, but very important, the way you hold your phone (for big hands it is probably better to hold it horizontally), the complexity of your keyboard (the less extra keys and the more letters it has the faster you'll type) and the size of your thumbs will make a difference. I couldn't find a specific tutorial. But I'm willing to share with you my experience as a fast writer, even with capitals. Hope this helps. ",
