            "answer_text": "Greed. Their business practices, I think, are hurting them and the only thing saving them right now is exclusive games. They tried to stone wall cross play, even saying if people want to play with people on PlayStation they should buy a PlayStation. They have been hacked twice. Now you have to use a PS5 controller for only the PS5. For example, if you got a PS4 game on the PS5 you can\u2019t use the the PS5 controller you have to use the PS4 controller and vice versa. Let us not forget what happen with Modern Warfare 2019, Sony payed to have a certain game mode to be exclusive for PS for a whole year. It is these types of business practices that kill a company. Microsoft has had it shared of blunder moments but nothing that bad. They have pushed Sony to do cross play, they gave us game pass, and Windows 10 allows you to talk to people on XBox live. So Microsoft is trying to integrate their systems and to me that\u2019s a positive. ",
