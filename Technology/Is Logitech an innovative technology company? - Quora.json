            "answer_text": "No, it is not. It is a VERY innovative technology company. Logitech International S.A. is a Swiss provider of personal computer and tablets accessories with headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and American headquarters in Newark, California. The company develops and markets products like peripheral devices for PCs, including keyboards, mice, trackballs, microphones, game controllers, webcams, home and computer speakers, headphones, wireless audio devices, as well as audio devices for MP3 players and mobile phones. Here are a few examples: Transporter\u00ae Network Music Player - Since Logitech launched its Transport server it has become the everyman\u2019s high-end music streamer, and just like most highly regarded hi-fi components it has become a target for modifications and tweaks. But even without the Modwright transformation it was ahead of its time.    Logitech diNovo Edge - One of the first rechargeable Bluetooth keyboards, and despite years of competition, nothing else has come close to matching its slim, stylish profile, comfortable typing, and media features.     Logitech Air 3D Laser Mouse . The MX Air is a mouse that works both on the desk and in the air.   Logitech R400 With Ren Laser Pointer 2.4Ghz Wireless USB PPT Professional Presenter Remote Control Presentation    Logitech-Harmony-1100-Touch - Again, ahead of its time. A touch fully configurable remote  that allows you to control almost all the devices in your house.   One of my main issues of using a wireless mouse was/is the incessant changing of batteries. Logitech seems to have tackled this problem some years ago with either a mouse charger or a cable that lets you continue to use the mouse while charging.  \"Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981 by two Stanford alumni, Daniel Borel and Pierluigi Zappacosta, and a former Olivetti engineer, Giacomo Marini. The range of products offered improvements over the mouse originally developed at LAMI (\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne) by professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and engineer Andr\u00e9 Guignard, who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by Douglas Engelbart. Logitech has been focusing on new lines like wireless music speakers,  videoconferencing and video game controllers to offset a decline in personal computers and weak demand for mice and keyboards.\" Logitech     ",

            "answer_text": "Logitech introduced the Logitech Pop Home Switch Starter Pack and Pop Add-On Home Switch, putting smart home control at your fingertips. After initial set-up, with the push of a button, everyone in the home can control smart home devices to set the scene with lighting presets, Sonos playlists and more. Logitech Pop Home Switch is compatible with a wide range of lighting and smart home products including lighting, door locks, and blinds from companies like LIFX, Phillips Hue, Lutron, and INSTEON, and you can mix and match product controls on an individual switch. Each switch can trigger three actions using different presses \u2013 a single press, a double press, and a long press. For example, you can set individual switches to turn smart products on/off, adjust brightness and scene presets, or quickly access your favorite Sonos music playlists and stations. Setup is simple. The Pop app scans your Wi-Fi network for compatible devices in the home. Then, you can assign individual devices to a switch or combine multiple devices into a single trigger using Recipes -- simple combinations of product controls you can set up using the Pop app. So, if you want to set the mood with lighting and the music turned up for date night, you can do that easily with a single press of Pop. Or if your kids want the music tuned to a specific playlist or the lights bright to help them concentrate when they\u2019re studying, they can easily do that with another press.  ",
