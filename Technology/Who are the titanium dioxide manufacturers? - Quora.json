            "answer_text": "Refined titanium dioxide is produced by a lot of people. There are however a lot of big names in the business. The largest ones include DuPont, Huntsman, Evonik, Millennium, Tronox, and Kronos, but in truth the industry is highly fragmented and there are many small plants operating, especially in India and China. There are three processes used to produce it, all of them involving the use of a strong and concentrated acid solution to polish a titaniferous mineral. These are the sulfate process (using sulfuric acid), the chloride process (using hydrochloric acid) and the DuPont chloride process (used exclusively by its owner). Because titanium dioxide is highly resistant to acids, the concentrated acid will strip almost everything else away. It's slightly more complicated than simply dissolving things away, though, since the sulfate process is usually able to use lower-quality minerals as a feedstock like ilmenite or anatase, while chloride process titanium dioxide has been restricted to higher-cost rutile or titaniferous scrap. DuPont's technology has been able to get around this by using hydrochloric acid with ilmenite, but it's the only manufacturer out there with this technology. Titanium white produced from the sulfide process is generally considered to be of lower quality and has a lower opacity than that of the chloride process.
