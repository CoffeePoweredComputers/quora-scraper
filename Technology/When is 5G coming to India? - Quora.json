In the meantime 5G R&D standardization, spectrum auction, testing and prototyping and user equipment (UE) product design activities are ongoing. StandardizationIn June this year, 3GPP, the standardization body for mobile communication technologies, finalized the specs for 5G New Radio (NR) in their San Diego plenary. SpectrumIn the United States, the Federal Communications Commission is making more millimeter wave spectrum bands available. In addition to 28 GHz and 24GHz this year, now there are 37GHz, 39GHz, and 47GHz auctions planned for 2019.[1] In the UK, sub-6GHz spectrum, such as 3.4GHz band is being auctioned. Hong Kong would assign 4.1MHz of spectrum in the high-frequency, high-capacity 26GHz and 28GHz bands. This would apply if demand is below 75 per cent of supply.[2] TestingThe 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea was the first \u201cscale test\u201d for 5G. The objective was to stream HD video at 5Gbps for any mobile user willing to pay a premium for their services.[3] In Japan, the carrier NTT Docomo\u2019s \u201c5G Cloud\u201d has opened for business.[4] This is the first Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN), a key 5G technology, that has deployed commercially. T-Mobile is launching a new narrowband IoT network that operates in guard bands. It said that its service is the first NB-IoT network in the U.S. and the first one in the world that leverages guard bands, which are narrow slices of unused spectrum meant to separate frequency ranges and prevent interference.[5] PrototypingCarriers and vendors have been collaborating for 5G network, end-to-end solutions and user device prototyping activities. Nokia and China Mobile have begun the Chinese mobile operator's transition to a future-oriented network infrastructure, while providing seamless connectivity to more efficiently high traffic demand. [6] In the EU, the Horizon 2020 Program is spearheading industry-academic collaboration in 5G. RAPID Project - Welcome, Mammoet Project (About) User Equipment (UE)On the UE side, vendors like Skyworks Solutions, Avago Technologies and Quorvo (previously Triquint Semiconductors + RFMD) are carrying out product development on 5G mobile handsets.[7] One of the key challenges in such 5G UE hardware develepment is coexsitance (with the existing 2G/3G/4G bands). Qualcomm has successfully miniaturized its QTM052 millimeter wave antenna module to a point where multiple modules can fit into a smartphone form factor.[8] Footnotes[1] Qualcomm Tech on Twitter[2] Hong Kong in a race to get cheap superfast 5G up and running in city[3] Manish Nair's answer to Where will 5G be available by the end of 2018?[4] \u30c9\u30b3\u30e2\u30015G\u76f4\u7d50\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30b3\u30e0\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u306e\u5b9f\u8a3c\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u306b\u63d0\u4f9b | \u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af.jp[5] T-Mobile US launches NB-IoT network - RCR Wireless News[6] Nokia and China Mobile sign EUR 1 billion frame agreement | Nokia[7] http://www.skyworksinc.com/downloads/literature/Skyworks-5G%20White-Paper.pdf[8] Qualcomm takes major step in mobilizing millimeter wave",

            "answer_text": "#  Credit: image 5G is the newest wireless networking technology that phones, smartwatches, cars, and other mobile devices will use in the coming years, but it won't be available in every country at the same time. Some estimates, like this one from Ericsson, forecast that by 2024, 5G subscriptions will reach 1.5 billion, and that coverage will blanket over 40 percent of the world's population. 5g launch in each country is different according to the development process, keep reading to find out more when 5G launched in a few countries below: UNITED STATES 5G fixed wireless broadband internet from Verizon, C Spire, and Starry is currently available at a handful of locations, and Verizon and AT&T both have mobile 5G services available for select customers in a few cities. More areas will get at-home and mobile 5G in 2019, from those companies and others like T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular. CANADA Canada's Telus Mobility has given 2020 as the year 5G is available to its customers, but explains that people in the Vancouver area can expect early access. Rogers Communications will invest $4.7 billion USD on 5G in 2019 and is making a 5G test site on campus at the University of British Columbia, set to go live in 2019. Learn more about the plans Rogers has for 5G to see when they expect a live network. MEXICO In late 2017, the Mexican telecommunications company Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil announced the release of 4.5 networks in anticipation of a 5G release. Its CEO says 5G should be available in 2020 but could come as soon as 2019 depending on the technology that's available at that time. BRAZIL After having signed an agreement to help develop and deploy the technology, we expect Brazil to usher in 5G service starting sometime in 2020. This time range is also supported by Qualcomm director Helio Oyama, who has stated that 5G will most likely hit Brazil a few years after it\u2019s commercially available elsewhere in 2019/2020. SINGAPORE StarHub announced in November 2018, that they, in partnership with Nokia, completed their first outdoor pilot of 5G on the 3.5 GHz frequency band. However, there's no information on when StarHub will have a 5G network ready for Singaporean customers. The IMDA (Info-communications Media Development Authority) is an organization of the Singaporean government that says a 5G network rollout will take place by 2020. There might even be two networks coming to Singapore since IMDA plans to allocate millimeter bands for 5G that \"will be sufficient for at least two nationwide 5G networks.\" MOROCCO The telecom company Inwi, which covers over 90 percent of the country with mobile internet access, is bringing 5G to Morocco. The plan is to begin deploying 5G base stations in Q2 2019. The two other licensed telecom companies in Morocco are Orange Morocco and Maroc Telecom, but both have been silent on a 5G deployment in the country. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO The release date for 5G in the Congo is unclear, but according to L\u00e9on Juste Lebombo, the country's minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, we know that the 5G rollout will involve Applus and Congo Telecom: Investments in Congo\u2019s telecommunications sector are astronomical and the state needs credible companies to help it implement the digital economy ecosystem. This company will help our incumbent operator, Congo Telecom, to implement 5G. GERMANY According to the 5G Strategy for Germany, released by Germany's Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI), trial installations began in 2018 with a commercial launch by 2020. 5G is planned to be rolled out \"over the period to 2025.\" Deutsche Telekom announced in mid-2018 that Europe's first 5G antennae were being deployed in Leipziger Stra\u00dfe and Winterfeldtstra\u00dfe and that the company would continue rolling out 5G in other parts of Berlin. They plan to cover 90 percent of the country with 5G by 2025, starting with 2,000 new mobile base station installations throughout 2019. Broadband telecom provider Telef\u00f3nica Germany revealed in December 2018, that in collaboration with Nokia, they finished building their \"Early 5G Innovation Cluster\" in Berlin. It will be used to \"test and measure the performance and coverage of first 5G services in a dense urban area.\" German ISP United Internet AG is another potential 5G player, having announced in early 2019 that they'd be taking part in a 5G spectrum auction. UNITED KINGDOM The UK's largest network operator, EE, plans to launch 5G in 2019, starting with London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Birmingham, and Manchester, and then hundreds of other areas before 2020. The company will also be the first in the world to offer the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G smartphone, but will also deliver the HTC 5G Mobile Hub, Galaxy S10 5G from Samsung, LG's V50 ThinQ 5G, and the Huawei Mate X. Vodafone UK is another big mobile telecommunications provider in the UK that plans to release 5G in seven cities on July 3 and 12 more before 2020. The company also started 5G trials in Salford, Greater Manchester; tested how 5G can be used in car communications; successfully completed a holographic phone call using 5G; and in late 2018, began installing small antennae under manhole covers to improve 4G coverage and prepare for 5G. After announcing their commitment to invest billions in 5G, UK's Three is another company launching 5G in the UK in H2 2019 \u2014 it will be used first by Huawei's 5G phone. They've also tested 5G for home use and have said that it will use a 5G hub from HTC. O2 is looking at a 5G network, too, and plans to roll out its 5G network in 2019 in Cardiff, London, Belfast, and Edinburgh to start, with more areas getting 5G in 2020. In late 2018, O2 tested data transfers using LED lights, which they said was a stepping stone to prepare their network for a 5G launch. They also announced a massive MIMO test in 2018 to boost their London network and provide the groundwork for 5G deployment. Hope it helps! OKportal Technology ",
