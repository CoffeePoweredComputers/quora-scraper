            "answer_text": "A user interface is how humans interact with computer systems. It consists of the visual design elements on the screen when you are interacting with any application, website, via a computer, laptop, iPad/Tablet, smartwatch, smartphone, digital kiosk or remote terminal. As well with today\u2019s computer and technology evolving at a rapid pace, we are introducing NEW user interfaces that allow people to interact with technology in a more natural way. Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) & Voice User Interfaces (VUI) The first user interface also known as the Graphical User Interface (GUI) was created at a company called Xerox. They created the 1st desktop computer and mouse-driven GUI. Their design innovated people like Steve Jobs to go out and build Apple. Today we have companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung giving us Virtual Assistants - Alexa, Google Assistant, Cortana, Siri, Bixby. Changing how humans interact with computers using natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Today\u2019s User Interface consists of online chat/text messaging or voice to complete a task. The future of User Interface will be a medium between VUI and GUI, where humans will speak to machines as they speak to people. GUI\u2019s will be used in combination with VUI to show humans options to make a decision. What User Interface Principles are you interested in learning? ",

            "answer_text": "What UI Stands for in Design? When it comes to the meaning of UI, people may hold the first expression that someone who can draw icons is UI designer. Actually drawing icon is only one of the skills of UI design. Broadly speaking, the meaning of UI definitely refers to a large category. According to the traditional classification, the product consists of two parts-design and development. UI design belongs to front-end design. However, it is not easy to be an excellent UI designer. There seem to be lots of things to learn, such as product analysis, user feedback documents, flow charts, design sketches, design prototypes, etc. What is UI design exactly? So, what is UI? User Interface(UI), the overall design of human-computer interaction, operation logic and beautiful interface. A good UI design is to make software personalized and tasty, and easily accessible so as to adequately incarnate the orientation and feature of the software. Generally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface which makes it easy (self-explanatory), efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to use the software in the way which produces the desired result. The three levels of UI design a. Customer-centered experience research: Exploring what are customers\u2019 really demands through research and comparative analysis and make decisions according to users\u2019 experience. User interface design, an integral part of the product, is a complex project with different disciplines, cognitive psychology, design, linguistics and so on, all of which play an important role in UI design. There are three principles of user interface design: setting the interface under the control of the user; reducing the burden on the user's memory; maintaining the consistency of the interface. Namely, to meet the needs of general users. b. Interaction: It means the interactive process of the whole project. Through the interactive design of the interface and the conduct of the product, interaction enables the product and users to establish an organic relationship so as to effectively achieve the user's goals. This is the purpose of interaction design. One of the most important aspects of UI design: human-computer interaction. In general, the goal of human-computer interaction engineering is to create a simple and convenient interface for users. That is to say, UI embodies user and the interface interactive search instead of the simple user interface. Therefore, as an UI designer, what we should do is design a beautiful interface as well as comfortable, simple interface that users may be satisfied with. c. Study interface - Graphic Design: Including (web design, software interface, mobile interface design) 3.The aim of UI design After having a better understanding of what UI stands for, then we need to know the aim of UI design. The principle of \u201cPeople First and Customer Supreme\u201d is the core idea of UI design. UI design is not merely for looking good, but for excavating user\u2019s demands and sparing no effort to cater to users' habits with your creative thinking. 4.Requirements for UI designer An excellent UI designer who is aware of what UI stands for, should not only be capable of drawing icons and designing interface but also mastering a lot of interactive knowledge; if you want to design a better interface, you need to completely understand the structure of products and interactive logic. Only in this way can we complete a reasonable interface design. In the actual work of design, the UI designer should join the discussion in the early stage of product design, which will reduce the communication costs and misunderstanding of the interaction between product manager and the UI designer, ensuring that the software interface is in line with the project team's expectations.
