            "answer_text": "See..first of all let's see why all the products in the world are there. Billions of different kinds of products are there to either solve some problems or to make some jobs easier. That's it. That's the only purpose why there exists all these products. Let's assume the very first job humans needed to do was hunting. So to make this job easier they developed weapons made of stones and wood etc. After that there was transportation problem so they invented wheels. And subsequently there were all these problems like shelter, clothing, cooking,.communication so they developed some solutions that were getting these jobs done easily at that time. That was enough for that time. But time changes. So as human intelligence evolves. Humans keep on discovering new things, new materials, new scientific phenomenons. So we continously keep on seeing new problems to solve and new jobs to be done easier. And this will never end. Problems will keep on occurring and there will always be a better way to get jobs done. This is why there is always a need for new product development. ",
