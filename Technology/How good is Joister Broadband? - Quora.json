            "answer_text": "I am using currently the Joister broadband near Baner, Pune. we were using a local ISP whose service and support was fabulous with 90% + uptime. hardly single issue in a month. give a call and they\u2019re at your doorstep to resolve the issue. Joister acquired this ISP and messed everything up. Speed : currently my Plan is 100Mbps but i get 2G like speeds.  See Plan above.but i get barely 2G speeds when a single device is connected. They never receive calls. i\u2019ve waited for 2+ hours.their support website is creepy as well.  In above image, you can see i have created a ticket on 15th December. no word from them till on 23rd December. My neighbor have the same connection. which is not working since 8th Dec. This is how google maps users have rated Joister services:  And do check mouthshut reviews as well. how popular they are for their amazing services. I\u2019ll suggest you to get a joister connection and experience this trauma once in your life so that you would know what a world\u2019s worst service/support/website/isp looks like, and no other trauma can surprise you as you have already gone through the worst  Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "It is the worst service provider I ever used. Everyday I am facing, no internet connection issue. Everyday I do complaint. Local service provider never picks your call. Customer care will pick your call after trying for 2\u20133 hours and simply ask to re-start your router and log a complaint and ask to to wait for 24 working hours, that's 3 working days. And for the speed, I have a 20Mbps connection, but I am getting maximum 10mbps, and sometimes 1mbps. (It's an optical fibre) You can't escalate your issue. They will not respond to your Twitter complaint. They just don't care about their customers, they take advance money for almost 6 months or 1 year, and the rest of life you will suffer. I suggest never go for Joister connection. If you don't have any service provider at your area, recharge your mobile with internet pack. But don't go for Joister connection. Else you have waste your money for both Joister connection and data recharge for mobile. What I am doing now. Because, to work for office or online classes, you need internet. And believe me, they will not give that. ",
