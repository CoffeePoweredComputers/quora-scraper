            "answer_text": "Its NOT a battery made from CMOS. PCs need to save certain settings like boot device, time, and other options that are set in the BIOS. The old standard was to put these settings in very low power CMOS static memory. These were kept alive by means of a small lithium button cell that would have a 5\u201310 year life. The battery also kept a quartz-crystal-regulated real time clock running to maintain the time. Because of the clock, I suppose, PCs still have the CMOS battery, even though CMOS memories can be supplanted by non-volatile memory technology. On the typical PC motherboard, it looks something like this usually:  ",

            "answer_text": "You probably have your answer by now, Loring has answered it for you, in addition to that let me just show you how it looks.  The coin shape battery that you are seeing here is a CR2032 lithium battery with a nominal voltage of 3V. CR2032 battery This one runs the RTC or real time clock even when the PC is off so the PC won\u2019t lose track of time. It also helps remembering any user made change in the BIOS/UEFI. RTC consumes very little power so you can easily use such battery for 5\u201310 years which is more than you are going to use such a board for. ",
