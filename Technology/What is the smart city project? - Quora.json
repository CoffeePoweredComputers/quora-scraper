            "answer_text": "Across the world, the stride of migration from rural to urban areas is increasing. By 2050, about 70 per cent of the population will be living in cities, and India is no exception. It will need about 500 new cities to accommodate the influx. Interestingly, urbanisation in India has for the longest time been viewed as a by-product of failed regional planning. Though it is inevitable, and will only change when the benefits of urbanisation overtake the costs involved, it is an opportunity for achieving faster growth. With increasing urbanisation and the load on rural land, the government has now realised the need for cities that can cope with the challenges of urban living and also be magnets for investment and more jobs . The announcement of \u2018100 smart cities\u2019 falls in line with this vision to create more jobs.  If investment and more jobs fails then the smart city project will collapse. A 'smart city' is an urban region that is highly advanced in terms of overall infrastructure, sustainable real estate, communications and market viability. It is a city where information technology is the principal infrastructure and the basis for providing essential services to residents. There are many technological platforms involved, including but not limited to automated sensor networks and data centres. Though this may sound futuristic, it is now likely to become a reality as the \u2018smart cities\u2019 movement unfolds in India. In a smart city, economic development and activity is sustainable and rationally incremental by virtue of being based on success-oriented market drivers such as supply and demand. They benefit everybody, including citizens, businesses, the government and the environment. The origin The concept of smart cities originated at the time when the entire world was facing one of the worst economic crises. In 2008, IBM began work on a 'smarter cities' concept as part of its Smarter Planet initiative. By the beginning of 2009, the concept had captivated the imagination of various nations across the globe. Countries like South Korea, UAE and China began to invest heavily into their research and formation. Today, a number of excellent precedents exist that India can emulate, such as those in Vienna, Aarhus, Amsterdam, Cairo, Lyon, M\u00e1laga, Malta, the Songdo International Business District near Seoul, Verona etc. Challenges The concept is not without challenges, especially in India. For instance, the success of such a city depends on residents, entrepreneurs and visitors becoming actively involved in energy saving and implementation of new technologies. There are many ways to make residential, commercial and public spaces sustainable by ways of technology, but a high percentage of the total energy use is still in the hands of end users and their behaviour. Also, there is the time factor \u2014 such cities can potentially take anything between 20 and 30 years to build. ",

            "answer_text": "The definition of a smart city is an urban area that is smart of all spheres. Whether it concerns the use of technology at its best form being sustainable, environment-friendly, good water supply, being smart with energy management, surrounded by nature at its best form and living comfortably without any hassle. In a smart city project there\u2019s round the clock security services, which gives you that much needed peace of mind in today\u2019s time. The project is technologically backed as well as capable of conserving energy in the best possible manner. With popularity of such projects gaining rapid momentum, owning a flat in one of such projects is something that everyone would dream of. When you own a 2 BHK in Dombivali East, here you have a good quality of life while being amidst a very busy city of Mumbai. When you are here, you no longer have to worry about looking out for a comfortable home to live in. One such smart city project is the Palava city, a Dombivali property, which is a mini metropolis altogether. Right from allowing your child to get the best education to being exposed to Olympic level gaming structures and much more, there is everything that you need to live a good and comfortable life ",
