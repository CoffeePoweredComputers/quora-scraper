You need to be able to find someone, or several someones who know how to do the things you don\u2019t know how to do, and that need someone like you because you know how to do what they don\u2019t. There are plenty of opportunities if you start asking around, finding the local technology associations and attending meetings, and pitch your skill and knowledge set to those who can help connect people. And get your ego out of the way. Why do you want to be in technology? Why do you have to start it? Why do you have to run it? In this age it is teams who make it, not individuals. And while teams need leaders, asking this question shows you aren\u2019t the leader. You may not even be a good team player. If you are and you find the right team to join, then there is plenty of opportunity. ",

            "answer_text": "You should rethink your goals. Saying you want to start a technology company is like saying you want to build a manufacturing plant without any idea of what you want to manufacture. Technology is a tool and a broad one at that. If you want to start a company - start with defining some value you want to bring to people or companies that you think they will pay for. ",
