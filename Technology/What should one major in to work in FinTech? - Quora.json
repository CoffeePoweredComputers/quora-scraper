            "answer_text": "I would imagine that your original combination of statistics and computer science you asked about wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. Though, I think you would need some business knowledge as well. This is a hard thing because it involves non-similar fields. I have thought about this career path before and decided against it for a number of reason, mostly related to the work hours expected of employees. But that is all changing and company specific. You need to be have an intimate relationship with Statistics, finances, and programming I think. That order is important to think of as well. I do not know how your brain works or what you consider to be interesting or easy, that makes a difference. For me, I find programming and learning programming to be very logical and easy to make sense of. Statistics is pretty okay and I love business and human interaction. You will are not me so you need to determine what you want to focus on more. At my school I think there is a business information systems major and there is a Statistics degree and a business intelligence degree. So, check with the school you are at or want to be at and see what they have. If you can, learn how to program on the side and not worry so much about the tech aspects as much. That will be a part of it no matter what. You can learn R and python and all that stuff on the side throughout your classes. Unless by fintech you mean developing software for companies in the financial sector, then don\u2019t take anything but computer science as your major and learn finance on the side, which is easier that it sounds. I guess if I can summarize, you still need to focus your goals. FinTech is a huge field that consists of many different majors and skillsets. Decide what attracts you to this field and then what about that you want to work with specifically. Then, you can decide the major that helps you. Here are some questions to help you get further: When you read the Wall Street Journal or The Economist, what do you think of? When you are explaining the stock market to friends, what about it do you focus on, investing for income, retirement, the tools used to invest or something else? If you were able to have any job or business that you want, owner or employee, what would it be? If you never got paid for your work and this was a slave master society, what job would you choose to be a slave doing? Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Your best bet is probably a double major in math and computer science. This enables you to understand and perform modeling, while having the tech know-how to do so. A simple finance major is not a ticket into fintech (unless perhaps it\u2019s from\u2026 say MIT or CalTech). You should really get in some good programming and applied math. CS, math, and engineering (mostly electrical or mechanical) majors are in high demand in the finance world. Certainly a double major in finance and CS, or econ and math, or something of that nature would put you in a good standing too. ",

            "answer_text": "Another aspect to consider is the size/stage of the company you would see yourself enjoying. An early-stage fintech trying to go through regulatory approval will have different requirements versus one trying to market, grow, and scale. Your major will impact the pre-graduation experience you can get (i.e. undergraduate research, people hitting you up for side projects, internships) which will then impact what role you can play in a company. You would also want to find out what flavour of fintech excites you. Are you looking to join an infrastructure provider? a challenger bank? a start-up asset manager? ",

            "answer_text": "I see two big opportunities in the future of fintech (that are non-traditional compared to the \u201cget a finance degree\u201d answer). One is in the resource allocation game - how are businesses and people expending their resources and the second is in the consumer/business trust side - how to build trusted relationships with your client. I don\u2019t think your major is so important as the skills you develop. Adaptability is a more important talent to me than a major. ",
