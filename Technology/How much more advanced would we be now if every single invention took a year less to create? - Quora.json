Now if you had asked \u201cHow much more advanced would we be now if every single invention took one year less to create?\u201d that would be a much different answer. I won't go into detail, but all technologies are built on other technologies, sometimes hundreds deep, so the answer would probably be that we would have already reached the singularity by now. ",
