Trump goes to a ceremony honoring WW2 Vets \u2026 no mask. Mark Meadows states that the White House is the safest place on Earth \u2026 from a physical attack, I agree but this virus can strike anyone any time any place. They have been playing with fire and I hate to say they are about to get burned. ",
