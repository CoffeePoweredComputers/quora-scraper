            "answer_text": "Raikov Effect \u2013 Genius Brain Power Program says they\u2019ve based their program on the groundbreaking work of legendary neuropsychologist, Dr. Vladamir Raikov. Years ago, I\u2019d heard about Dr. Raikov\u2019s experiments. Using a 7 step method, he allegedly \u201cshort-circuited\u201d the usual way the brain fires and created a fast-track shortcut to instant genius. Dr. Raikvo was able to transform a science student into an artist and also turned a meek chess player into a very confident and self-assured chess player stalemating Russian Grand Master chess player \u2013 Mikhail Tal. Whether you realize it or not, you\u2019ve already been hypnotized. It can happen when you\u2019re driving home in your car. You pull up into your driveway and find that you\u2019re unable to remember part of the journey. You\u2019ve driven the route hundreds of times, and the whole process is automatic. You don\u2019t have to give it too much thought, and that means your mind can drift off. When that happens, you enter a mild hypnotic trance. Self-hypnosis isn\u2019t something you need to learn. It\u2019s something you need to learn how to control. To hypnotize yourself whenever you want, you need to do three things. You need to get relaxed, you need to enter a mild trance, and you need to concentrate on what you want to achieve. One of the easiest ways to get relaxed is by focusing on your breathing. An excellent way to accomplish this is to listen to some music or sounds of nature through a pair of headphones. This helps to shut out the outside world so you can switch your attention inward. You\u2019ll gradually enter a mild trance state. Research shows that when you\u2019re in a trance, your conscious mind is less active. That makes it possible for you to communicate with your subconscious. And as soon as you can do that, you can make suggestions that will help change your life for the better. How do you get those suggestions into your head when you\u2019re in a trance? One method is to use positive affirmations. Simply repeat the most important objective you\u2019d like to achieve over and over. Say it out loud as many times as you can, and then return your focus to your breathing. Read more here. ",
