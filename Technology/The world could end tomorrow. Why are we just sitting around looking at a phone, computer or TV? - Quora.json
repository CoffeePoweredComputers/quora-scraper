It\u2019s not sustainable. If I thought the world would end tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t pay my phone bill. If I thought the world would end tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t do self-care. If I thought the world would end tomorrow, I\u2019d try to pack so much into today there would be no way to keep it up without burning out. And then, when tomorrow comes and the world doesn\u2019t end, I haven\u2019t paid my bills and I haven\u2019t taken care of myself. I spend time on my phone, usually on Quora, because it relaxes me. Relaxation is important if you want to live for many tomorrows. ",

            "answer_text": "Because focusing on the device instead of the content is severely undervaluing the activity. I'm not staring at a phone. I am on the internet. I am in communication with at least dozens of people right now, I am accessing the commutative knowledge eof mankind, learning from others and in turn sharing my own knowledge and insights. I am also participating in one of mankind's oldest traditions, storytelling, whether I decide to watch a movie or TV show, listen to an audio book, read some comics, or otherwise consume more passive forms of content. These expose me to new concepts and ideas, overall enrich my life. Through my phone, I have learned new skills, created my own content, pursued and fleshed out new ideas, written stories, and collaborated with others to create works beyond our individual contributions. Dismissing all of this as \u201cstaring at my phone\u201d is disingenuous. ",
