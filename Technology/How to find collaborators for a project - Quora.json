            "answer_text": "I have been working in the field of media collaboration for quite some time, so my approach might help you. You should always contact the person or the organization with whom you wish to collaborate through E-mail . Never call them directly or text them , it might negatively impact the image of the organization and is unprofessional at the same time.Things to include in the mailA catchy subject , like Media collaboration , media partnership or collaboration proposal etc ., would work.Brief introduction about you or your organization.Purpose of writing the mail - mention why you wish to collaborate with them.Attach the proposal file with the mail for better communication of the deliverables .( at the end of the answer check out what to include in a proposal file )Insert link of your social media handles or websites for their reference.3. Provide your contact number, ask them if they could connect with you on a call for better communication. 4. Keep the mail short don't make it too long people really don't read it. Just mention the important points . Collaboration Proposal A collaboration proposal can be a one page doc or 2 to 3 page pdf depending upon what you wish to include . Ideally a collaboration proposal includes the deliverables . In other words a list of things you have to offer and you expect in return from the other person. If you are looking for a paid collaboration then you mention the amount that you can offer or if it's unpaid then mention the deliverables that you can or may offer and expect in return . Mention in your proposal and mail that the deliverables are negotiable( only if you wish to negotiate else dont mention) it increase the chances of the person reverting if he or she finds your deliverables unacceptable or has some doubt for that matter. The proposal should include the term of collaboration that you expect and other relevant information that you want your prospective collaborator to know beforehand. I have pretty much covered important points . Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re interested in collaborating with someone in your community, the best way to approach them is to just reach out and start the conversation. Come prepared with at least one idea for how you\u2019d like to collaborate, but be open to adjusting the idea once you learn more about what they\u2019re focusing on as a business. The language I recommend my clients use when reaching out is something to the effect of: \u201cI have a collaboration idea I\u2019d love to run by you, but it\u2019d be great to learn more about what you\u2019re focusing on in the coming months as a business to see if there are other ways we might be able to support one another through collaboration.\u201d The most important thing you can do to increase the likelihood of someone saying \u201cyes\u201d to a collaboration is to approach them in a way that feels like you\u2019re going to make their life easier by partnering with you. Put yourself in their shoes, and lead with their goals in mind so the idea doesn\u2019t feel like more work for them. Of course, you must also make sure that it\u2019s worth it for you as well, but when doing the initial outreach frame it in a way that doesn\u2019t scare them off with an unformed, one-sided collaboration idea.
