            "answer_text": "I agree with Mr. Fair - it's a matter of generational evolution of attitudes and expectations, so kids who expect privacy today will still be annoyed eighty years from now when they don't get as much privacy as they'd like.  So if not our generation, one soon after ours.  Of course you and I might be different generations as it is. I would draw a distinction between caring about privacy and expecting it.  It might be desirable but virtually impossible, so we'll get used to it.  I've found an analogy that has helped me think about the future: I think it will be as if we all lived in the same little town.  In a little town, if your pickup is in the wrong driveway all night, people will know.  In a big city, the chances are pretty low that they will.  But the technology to record and compile data is growing exponentially.  I see no reason that hourly satellite photos won't ever be available, or that real-time video of every intersection wouldn't exist. I have another theory, or rule: the availability of technology guarantees its use.  If it's easy to record what every patron at your restaurant ordered and keep it forever, why not do it?  Hell, let's track the temperature, the day the raw food was purchased, the size of the tip and the amount of time you spent before leaving.  I certainly believe that we'll all live to see the day when you fly to North Dakota for the first time, walk into a Chili's, and someone you've never seen before says \"Hello, Mr. Teal.  I'm so sorry but we're out of those nachos you like today.\"  Just like you had always lived in that little town. I've recorded my latitude and longitude, generally every minute or so, for the past two and a half years.  (I forgot the dang thing or let the batteries die a few times.  And once, but only once, I left it in a cab and it went all over town without me.  I know precisely where it went that day.)  I don't have any reason to hide that log from anyone, even assuming that better data analysis could yield a usable report about regular trips, unusual trips, trips to commercial establishments versus private homes - whatever.  If my car had such a device on it (and I don't know why it wouldn't in a few years), then the authorities could get to it, and so could my family.  Again, no problem unless I'm in the wrong driveway all night. And of course, I'm claiming to be a pretty virtuous guy, and willing to let my wife find out that I bought her Christmas present at Target and not Tiffany.  But this brave new world is going to be hell on the bad guys.  All those reality-based detective shows on TV will be dull.  \"Could Mr. Jones have murdered the clerk even though he said he was in Omaha?  Uh, yep, here's the video - he was at the 7-11 during the murder.  Join us next week...\"  Maybe - and I swear I'm not joking about this - nobody will shoplift or take a swing at anyone or throw a rock through a window unless they're just crazy. I foresee a time when sounds and even sights will be routinely recorded.  It would be sort of nice to rewind and see what the price was for that TV, or exactly what that painting looked like.  The really, really disturbing application will be in settling arguments (\"I did NOT call you a 'liar'!\" ...reeeeeeeeewind... \"...you are such a big liar...\")  So I also foresee a time in the future where two people do something even scarier and more intimate than taking their clothes off; they'll turn off all the electronics and go off the grid entirely.  No record of what they said or did.  Unless there's a parabola mic nearby. ",

            "answer_text": "The first and the last at the same time. There are many different definitions of privacy, therefore there can be no single answer. I will explain based on the definition of privacy which I hate. Since you ask about \u201cpeople caring about privacy\u201d I guess you mean people from Germany and elsewhere EU who say to be \u201cproud\u201d of \u201cprivacy\u201d as they understand it. The concept of a street being a place where one can expect privacy is very recent. It was made in 2009. Their \u201cprivacy\u201d means a camera car may not drive on public streets, unless faces and license plates are blurred and unblurred backups ditched. This concept didn\u2019t exist, say, 20 years ago. Streets were not private.Eventually historic value of unblurred Street View will be recognized as value itself and then the \u201cprivacy\u201d of streets will vanish. And the most funny thing about it - is that I wish this happens as soon as possible. I hope it won\u2019t last longer than 2017. There is some chance it\u2019s already no longer the case. But it\u2019s too early to be sure. But what about privacy? Would it be lost? No. Well, yes, but only according to this specific unethical definition. ",
