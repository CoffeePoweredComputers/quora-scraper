            "answer_text": "First of all take a back up of all your data. Then factory reset your phone. You can do this by holding the volume up, home and power buttons all together for some time when your phone is switched off if you are using an android phone. You will see the android logo and will be led to a page where you can factory reset, reboot or clear cache. Now click on factory reset. After doing this switch off your phone for some time and then switch it on. Your android phone will probably be back to normal. ",
