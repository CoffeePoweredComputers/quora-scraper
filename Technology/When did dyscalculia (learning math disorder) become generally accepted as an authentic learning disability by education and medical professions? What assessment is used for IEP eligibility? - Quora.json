            "answer_text": "Adding to the previous answers, there are a number of testing tools that measure both math fluency and comprehension against standard grade levels. If you aren\u2019t familiar with those terms, math fluency is typically tested with numeric problems (e.g. 2+2=?) and math comprehension by forms of word questions. At early grade levels there are pictorial tests. One of the issues, not an easy one, is distinguishing actual dyscalculia from previous bad education.

            "answer_text": "Hi Robin, dyscalculia, or a math learning disability was around since the mid 1940s, but not really official until 1974 by the department of education. School psychologist and a diagnostic team of maybe another teacher/department head will do testing. They will go over their results. Then if the student does have the math disability, a parent-teacher meeting is held with the student present, so they understand what is going on, as well. If the parent agrees to services, and IEP is written to help the student. Math disability or dyscalculia, is not being able to understand, or manipulate using number, doing arithmetic operations or mathematical calculations. It\u2019s a deficit in number sense. There is between 3 to 6% of the population that has this math disability, and of that population, 11% has ADHD. ",
