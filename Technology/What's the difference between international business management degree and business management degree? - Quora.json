            "answer_text": "Bachelors of Business Management (BBM) differs from the Bachelors of International Business Management (IBM) not only in the academics but also in the observation perspective of businesses as well as global talent impart techniques. Human Resource: This discipline of IBM will actually have the international perception, issues involved, cultural impact of various countries on the human resource, handling people from various sections of the society, etc. For example, the chapters of depatriation and repatriation are absent in the BM but present in IBM. It gives an edge to the IBM graduate to grab the opportunities easier in understanding and dealing with global clients. Marketing: Pricing mechanism, global fluctuations due to the free market trade groups, mega regional groupings, impact on one\u2019s own service or the product can be quoted under this to be on advantageous side. For example: My University syllabus during my graduation has widely covered the ASEAN, APEC, etc impact on the marketing subject Corporate Law: BM takes into consideration the law of only the country in which one studies but IBM widely covers the WTO norms in particular, common laws across various countries, differences of developed and emerging countries\u2019 laws, etc. Supply Chain and Logistics: Again here, knowing the developments in global value chain will have an extreme edge for IBM graduate Soft Skill modules: IBM graduates have edge over others in coping up with the extrra-ordinary situations as they include problem solving techniques within their curriculum. Situational intelligence is imbibed through the course. However, practical knowledge can be gained only on the field of the business or the floor of the corporate houses. But one thing for sure is that IBM can give wide exposure that one can gel through any kind of politico-socio-economic-legal conditions Accounting and Finance: It is the only common module I believe, that has no much difference. However, in the present day, B-schools are ensuring of good exposure even through the BM. Nevertheless, IBM has additional advantages under its curriculum. ",

            "answer_text": "Business management degree usually only learn about how to manage a company from financial, operational, human resources, and marketing aspects. You will learn about law for business but it depends on where country that your university attend. For example, if you learn business management degree in USA, then you will learn about law for business based on US law. Then, international business management degree also learn the same things like business management degree. But, there are some additional aspects that you will learn. Like introduction to international business, cross culture management, export import management to support your skills and knowledge about how to manage a business internationally. I think, the difference aspects on some subjects that you will learn, will give you different output when you have learnt and graduated from the degree. ",
