            "answer_text": "The best features for a corporate LMS are usually ones that are powerful enough to manage large numbers of employees but simple enough for you to do it with ease. TalentLMS has some great features that help to organize users and courses like, Single Sign-On, Integrations, Branching, Automations and more. 1. Single-Sign on The beauty of Single-Sign On is that you can prompt users to sign in with a username and password they already have. There\u2019s no need to create a new one specifically for TalentLMS. This way users don\u2019t have to remember another set of login information. This keeps your company more secure. 2. Integrations Another way to keep your company secure and simplify your processes at the same time is to integrate apps you\u2019re already using with TalentLMS. TalentLMS has native integrations with Salesforce, BambooHR, Wordpress and video conferencing tools like Zoom and GoToMeeting. Through Zapier, you can integrate with hundreds of other tools like Slack, Mailchimp and Trello. TalentLMS becomes part of your work stack, without demanding more space, time and resources. 3. Branching Branching is what TalentLMS calls multitenancy. Branching lets you create as many independent training environments as you like, under a single account. Why is this feature vital for a corporate LMS? When you have a variety of training audiences, whether that\u2019s employees across different departments, along with customers, partners, and others, it\u2019s likely that each group will have different training needs. You\u2019ll also want to keep them separate from each other. Branching lets you do this. You can create separate portals for each audience and you can even customize each portal to have it\u2019s own branding, language, courses and users. 4. Automation A corporate LMS must also offer automations for the repetitive tasks that are needed for training. One of the reasons TalentLMS is considered the best LMS is because the combination of ease of use and powerful automations cut down implementation time and work time. You can set up learning paths so that courses are automatically assigned in order. You can send automatic notifications and alerts when a new course is out or when a certification is up for renewal. There are over 16 different automations that will help you manage your training without spending your entire day on the platform. These are just a few examples of the platform\u2019s wide range of features that are beneficial for corporations. No matter who you want to train, or where in the world they\u2019re located, TalentLMS\u2019s intuitive design and setup will help make the process smooth and successful. ",
