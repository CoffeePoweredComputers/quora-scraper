            "answer_text": "CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor), is a lot of things. It is a technology used to make low power integrated circuits, it also refers to a chip that is based on CMOS technology. It is also a battery that powers such chips. More commonly we use it to refer to the chip itself and will do so here as well. A CMOS in mobile phones is used for digital image sensoring. An image sensor captures light and converts it into electrical signals. There are two types of sensors CCD and CMOS. CMOS is more common as it uses less power, works in burst mode and is faster.  This is how a CMOS looks. It consists of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. Its working would be quite difficult to explain as you would need to know transfer gate, selection gate etc. But I have provided a wikipedia link in case you are curious. CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) is the term usually used to describe the small amount of memory on a computer motherboard that stores the BIOS settings. Some of these BIOS settings include the system time and date as well as hardware settings.  This coin shaped thing is called a CMOS in computer terms. Active pixel sensor - Wikipedia ",
