            "answer_text": "This is a question I hear a lot. Can Bitcoin (or other crypocurrencies) be the next PayPal? In may ways were are comparing Apples to Oranges and I am going to contradict myself and say, in many ways, we are also doing the right comparison. What exactly constitutes as the next PayPal? I am sure if probed and asked, most would say availability, i.e. the availability of PayPal i nearly all geographies. Yet, PayPal by all measures is small. Granted it has traction, but then again it also has roughly a 17 year advantage. Bitcoin (for example is barely 8 years old). If you look at the functionality of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, they certainly have all the charateristics of what PayPal offers as a payment system. Not as a stored value mechanism.PayPal itself relies on external \u2018tokens\u2019 or \u2018currencies\u2019 in which it can aid the transfer to (transaction) of. Predominantly US Dollar, etc. Bitcoin itself has the underlying technology to handle payments and Bitcoin itself is a value-token, i.e. it has an intrinsic value attached to it. What Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrencies need are more merchant associated transactions, i.e. more and more merchants needs to sign-up and accept these cryptocurrencies. Then we will truly compete and scale with PayPal. The payments world is extremely fragmented and it will take some time for these technical hurdles to be overcome. Here is a piece I wrote quite a few moons back, it discussed the fragmentation of payments, and inadvertently, it drew attention to what a cryptocurrency can do. Consider the following ten scenarios (juxtaposing both examples): Regulatory Restrictions on Geography I\u2019m not sure if I can even send you an email\u200a\u2014\u200aNo route. Not sure if I can send you money from my city/country to your city/country Cost of Transaction If I do send you an email, most of the time I am not sure how much data will be shaved off (truncated) from the message? I\u2019m not sure how much it will cost me to send money to you\u200a\u2014\u200aits not clear. Currency Conversions or Forex Restrictions If I send you an email in Chinese will you receive it in Chinese or English?I\u2019m note sure when I send you Chinese Renminbi, will you receive Renminbi or US Dollars at your end? Delivery Times are Uncertain I\u2019m not sure how long it takes for you to receive my email? I\u2019m not sure if I send you the money on Monday 10:00 AM my time, I am not sure when you will get it? Lack of an International (Open) Standard for Moving Money Simply Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) is what I use to send emails What protocol do I use if I have to send you money? I\u2019m not sure! Universal Addressing Mechanism What\u2019s your email address? Okay, got it! Sending email now. What is your bank / mobile wallet information? Why don\u2019t you have a SWIFT Code? What does \u201cfor further credit to\u201d means? Why is there a correspondent account? Transaction Tracking Email Read Receipt. Received your money! Interoperability I\u2019m sending email from Lotus Notes to your GMail I\u2019m sending money from my app/bank to your app/bank KYC (Know Your Customer) & Lack of Worldwide KYC Standards Let me instant message you on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger I know who you are so let me send you money Anti-Money Laundering Controls My service provider has some really good spam and messaging filters and rDNS checks, but sometimes mail may get stuck in one of these I\u2019m sending you money, the bank will do all the necessary OFAC and others regulatory checks to ensure the transaction is genuine Original Article: Collaboration and not disruption, may just be the key!
