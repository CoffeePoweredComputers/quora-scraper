Nigeria\u2019s issues aren\u2019t really a lack of talent, financing, or even corruption honestly in my opinion, although I won\u2019t deny none of that really helps. Their problems are mostly bureaucratic. Nigeria makes it very hard for large entrepreneurial endeavors to be undertaken by its citizens let alone individual foreigners. Let\u2019s take housing for example. In Nigeria, clear cut land ownership isn\u2019t something you can just pick up from some random property seller and purchase on the fly like we do in the US and Foreign land ownership isn\u2019t even a thing there. It\u2019s not allowed. As a potential investor, this fact alone is a huge detractor for me. What they do however, is allow people to basically lease the land for a term of say 99 years. That\u2019s not even the worst of it though, when you do \u201cpurchase\u201d property you have to get approval from the local leaders. In Lagos this means getting approval from the Governor in addition to other registration requirements. The same essentially applies to the tech industry. Local laws make it difficult to build large infrastructure projects like railways and power grids. It\u2019s gotten so bad that even their own government has issues funding projects and needs other more wealthier nations to do it for them. I\u2019ve attached an article that basically sums this up. While governance is listed as number three I feel that it\u2019s the biggest issue preventing the first two. 5 Major Challenges Of Doing Business In Nigeria (2019) ",
