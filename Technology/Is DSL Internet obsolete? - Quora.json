            "answer_text": "Q: Is DSL Internet obsolete? Certainly not. Many people have their Internet speeds met with the sorts of speeds offered by ADSL, and its ability to be delivered over POTS cabling is a massive advantage both to the Internet companies and many house holders. My son decided to switch from a DSL service to a cable service and had part of his garden dug up to lay the cable from the roadway to the house. He mainly watches Internet TV services rather than cable services and he could get the most of the Internet services over his old type of DSL service. In the UK, many areas are now getting FTTC (Fibre To The Cabinet in the street) and the ISP and phone companies use the existing copper cables, many of which are underground, to deliver VDSL services of up to 100 Mbps to homes. The copper is already there, and there is no need for the companies to undertake expensive work laying fibre to every house. For many housing estates built 25 to 50 years ago, the services were all laid underground when the estates were built. There are no cable services where I live, but for my son, one of the cable companies installed cable along the road but only one or two homes have had the cable connected to the house. Installing cable one home at a time is expensive compared with FTTC and VDSL and often offers no better speeds. ",

            "answer_text": "It has not gone away yet. I did speak to someone recently who had DSL service and was fine with it. I depends on your individual usage as to what you or your family needs. Most families have a lot of data usage with streaming or playing video games, so DSL would not be enough speed to satisfy their usage. Others use email only, and maybe look at some websites, so all that speed is not needed for that type of usage. ",
