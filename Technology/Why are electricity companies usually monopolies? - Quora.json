            "answer_text": "Because: EVERYONE needs electricityThe infrastructure costs are enormousWhen you don\u2019t have the option to pick and choose who you supply electricity to because of the primacy of the utility of electricity, the costs go beyond merely enormousEnormous costs price out most competitors and create natural monopoliesServing everyone makes the market unattractive in many ways so natural monopolies give extra power that often becomes abusive monopolies and trusts (which in the US are illegal) - because human nature includes a tendency to abuse and take advantage when there are no checks and balances to stop itGovernment often must be involved to assure everyone has fair availability of the utility of electricity. Regulation is part of that check and balance system.#3 is largely because of last mile costs of infrastructure (90%+ of costs are in the last 10% of infrastructure distance - the last mile of it). Last Mile costs are made far worse by suburbia which makes the last mile especially inefficient and costly. Last Mile in an urban environment is far cheaper which is part of why the best electricity and internet service tends to be in urban areas and the very worst is in rural areas. Electricity arrived in the rural US last during the Great Depression because of this and it required the US government to enact and implement rural electrification via the New Deal agency called the Rural Electrification Administration now morphed into the Rural Utility Service. Free markets were incapable and unwilling to electrify rural areas on their own. We are actually seeing a replay of these forces with internet connectivity. In rural areas you really have NO internet at all for the most part; even cell service is super spotty. This is because of #5 and the lack of regulation #6. The entire discussion of Net Neutrality is an argument over #6 in part because of #1, #2, #3 and #4 have resulted in #5. Industry wants to keep #5 and avoid giving everyone the same service and availability. The one option that has worked many times before is to have the government regulate the industry harshly to assure #6. We are not at that point with internet as were already are for other utilities such as electricity. The market and industry for internet are immature just as electricity was 100 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, because it is expensive to string more than one set of power wires to a house. There is no point in spending twice as much to put in the wiring, so originally one company got a monopoly on supply. However, where I live (Alberta), the government broke up the monopolies. The company that owns the wires to the house is different from the company that owns the power plant, which is different from the electricity marketing company I buy the electricity from. There are multiple marketers, and they all send me brochures, so I pick the deal I like the best. The marketer then buys electricity from various different generating companies and delivers it through the one set of wires to my house. My electricity bill includes charges for generation, marketing, and delivery, plus of course a lot of money in taxes, all nicely split out in case I am interested in what I am paying for each, which I usually am not. I only really care about the number at the bottom of the bill. Most Canadians have their electricity delivered by provincially owned government monopolies, but that is falling apart because provincial governments have made a lot of really bad decisions in the past and people\u2019s electricity bills and taxes represent a lot of stranded costs from bad investments. In Alberta the provincial government went bankrupt during the depression (a little known fact), and couldn\u2019t afford to build any power plants, so electricity has always been supplied by private companies or by city governments. The cities usually owned the electricity distribution networks, but often bought the electricity from private companies, or built their own power plants, or both. In rural areas, the farmers often formed electricity cooperatives and built their own distribution systems themselves since they couldn\u2019t afford to pay a company to do it, but bought the electricity at a discount from private companies or occasionally from city owned companies.

            "answer_text": "The main reason electricity companies are usually monopolies is because of the nature of the utilities industry. Any sector of the utilities industry has extremely high barriers to entry/set up costs, for example the National Grid in the UK which is a highly complex and expensive system. This deters other entrepreneurs from even considering entering this market and competing with already established companies. Therefore it is typically not profitable for a new firm to enter this market and at the end of the day this is the main goal for most businesses. ",
