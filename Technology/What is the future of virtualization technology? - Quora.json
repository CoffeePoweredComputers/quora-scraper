            "answer_text": "Automation Although automation isn\u2019t exactly a new trend, it is taking on a head role in the advancement of enterprise deployments. In particular, network functions virtualization (NFV) automation has taken the telecom industry by storm, enabling operators to spin up virtual machines (VMs) that perform desired functions automatically. While management and orchestration have faced their fair share of challenges, significant progress has been made in 2017, especially with the Linux Foundation\u2019s open network automation platform (ONAP). The platform enables end users to create, automate, orchestrate, and manage services and virtual functions. Augmented reality and virtual reality Major steps were taken toward augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies in 2016, which have persisted throughout 2017. IPhones have been flooded by AR apps, which provide a digital representation of a user\u2019s surrounding environment and layers it with information in the form of texts and images. Just last month, Apple announced a tool called ARKit to provide AR capabilities in iOS. Within the year, Apple is expected to put AR software in as many as one billion mobile devices. ",
