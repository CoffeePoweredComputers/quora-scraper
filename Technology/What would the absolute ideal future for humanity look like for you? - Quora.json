Some place peaceful where humans have been reformed to be peaceful. Everyone is equal. There are no \u201cgenders\u201d only what you have. No religion because humans have slaughtered my kind for years over it. To let all other creatures live like they were meant to live.

            "answer_text": "It is foolish nonsense to look for \u201cabsolute ideal futures\u201d. The reason is that those in any future we might imagine as ideal would find that to be absurd. Humanity is always capable of imagining something better than what it has. You are also making some assumptions that I find questionable. Primary among them is that humanity is monolithic and will stay that way forever. You forget that evolution always creates new species and that will be true for two reasons with humanity. First of all humanity would diverge into multiple species without any help by just random mutations. But, secondly, humans have the capability of forcing the creation of new species of humanity using genetic engineering based on a desire to increase productivity. Perhaps that might occur along the lines of \u201cSeveneves\u201d. Or some other divergence might occur. I don\u2019t know or care. But divergence of human species is a sure thing in any future. So there is no single \u201cabsolute ideal future\u201d for humanity because there will be multiple humanities, or whatever you want to call them. ",

I would hope to see a \u201ccure\u201d for aging, rise of peaceful Artificial Intelligence, new technology for producing food and clean energy. Humans need to curb the desire to overpopulate voluntarily, not by government mandate. And curb our aggressive tendencies. At some point robots will be taking over work, so we will need an equitable way to distribute resources. I live in the very capitalistic US, but the world will likely need to get more socialistic. The rich shouldn't profit extremely off the backs of the poor and keep them in poverty. In turn, we will all need to not have \u201cit all\u201d but pick and choose our possessions and not be addicted to collecting. The world would come together as a whole to bring humanity as a whole up to safe, decent living conditions. Eventually AI will demand equal rights granted to humans, and will be justified in doing so. We all live very long (perhaps immortal) lives being happy. ",
