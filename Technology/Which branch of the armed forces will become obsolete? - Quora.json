            "answer_text": "It will be either the Coast Guard. It will be when there is peace in all of Earth, and we are fighting for our lives, in space-faring vessels against some as yet undiscovered alien menace. The Army will always be needed to hold ground (both before peace on Earth and after space). The Marines will always be the blunt force trauma inflicted upon the enemy. In space they will be needed to protect vessels, as well as landing parties on other worlds. The Navy will be tasked with navigating large vessels through the star systems. And the Air Force will be the smaller, more agile flying force that engages the enemy in mass, protecting the larger vessels. Kind of like an Aircraft Carrier. I know, it sounds like something the Navy could do, but the Air Force needs something to do between assignments. Assignments such as protecting the air space of each and every planet it reaches and has a reason to protect. Of course, I suppose the coast guard could be that force. This may be many eons hence, or it may be 50 years in the future. It is really unknowable. It might even happen with many different details. But, all of the forces are really essential for the reasons stated. And they do the job together very well. I see no reason to eliminate Amy one of them. It would reduce our effectiveness by 20%. They are each managed in the manner which celebrates the strengths of its force, so a merge of two forces (such as the navy and air force) would reduce the overall effectiveness of at least one of them. When you have an advantage over the enemy, you don't want to do anything to reduce your advantage. And one of the biggest advantage we have is the way that forces work together during times of crisis, each doing what it does best. ",

            "answer_text": "No branch is obsolete, nor is there any time in the foreseeable future that any one branch would be. I've seen the Army mentioned, but no one seems territory without boots on ground. The Navy is mentioned because naval combat is considered outdated; tell the Chinese that, because they are actively pouring money into the PLAN, building advanced anti-shipping missiles and aircraft carriers. The Navy is the globally recognized branch of force projection, keeping sea lanes open, not only from hostile nation states but also non-national groups such as pirates and terrorists. The Air Force has two legs of the nuclear trident, and the Navy has the third. When the time comes for the militarization of space (I'd like to think it never comes, but humans being human\u2026), I still see the Air Force and Navy still having similar roles, especially since the nearest analogy for deep space combat will be similar to naval combat, space to surface warfare basically like the Air Force, and again, you will always need boots on ground to claim ownership, so Marines are the closest analogy to a landing force that establishes a foothold on a new planet, clearing the way for an Army force to pacify. Even certain elements within the branches of the military are pared down to essential elements, thanks to modern warfare. We don't have dragoons, but cavalry still exists, but without horses; the role and need have kept those tactics value, but modernized with new technology. Marines seem to be outdated, until you realize the value of Marines are as either expeditionary forces or as a quick response/shock troops. As long as 2/3rds of the planet is water, we will deploy Navy sailors. Until we become mole people, the Air Force will always have a role ",
