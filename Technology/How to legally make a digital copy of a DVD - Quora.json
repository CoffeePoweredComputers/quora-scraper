            "answer_text": "Legally? You cannot. As others have already pointed out, there's a Digital Rights Management, sometimes mockingly translated as Digital Restriction Management, which will make copying either impossible (the copy software will refuse to do it), or the copy will not be readable/playable. As such, anything you do will always be illegal as a matter of law, so your thought process should be: How probable is it that my home gets searched by law enforcement and these copies get discovered? Do I live in an appartment building full of shady-looking neighbours who probably grow marihuana or sell other drugs or traffic humans/weapons? Am I likely to get accused of being a child molester, or drug dealer or terrorist? If the answer is \"somewhat likely\", then don't -- the prosecutors might easily want to capitalize on \"Arresting a dangerous DVD-pirate\". ",

            "answer_text": "In the US, the relevant Supreme Court ruling is the Betamax case (Sony v Universal). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that you can legally make copies of copyrighted material that you legally own for your private, non-commercial use. Copies made for purposes such as time shifting, device compatibility, or backup are explicitly protected uses. You cannot make copies of material you don\u2019t legally own outside of Fair Use, or sell your personal copies, or exhibit them commercially, or profit therefrom. Copyright is a limited legal monopoly to make copies of a creative work. The important word here is limited. It is not absolute - copyright law contains numerous, long-standing exceptions and limitations. There are numerous Open Source and commercial software packages that will let you rip a DVD or Blu-Ray disk, transcode it, and burn it to a physical medium. The act of making a copy is not inherently illegal. Your intent for making the copy matters. How you use the copy matters. ",
