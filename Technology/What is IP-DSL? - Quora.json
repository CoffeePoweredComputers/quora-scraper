            "answer_text": "IP-DSL is DSL that does not use asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). ATM is a cell-based protocol rather than a packet-based protocol like IP. Cells have a fixed size of 53 bytes, while packets may be 1,500 kilobytes (or larger, if jumbo frames are supported by ISPs). As such, ATM-DSL may require more time to transmit the same payload as IP-DSL, but would minimize jitter when multiplexing real-time traffic such as telephony. However, since QoS/CoS can prioritize real-time traffic, the latter point is not necessarily a disadvantage for IP-DSL. ",
