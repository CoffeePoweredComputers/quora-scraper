            "answer_text": "Wired broadband is usually faster and more reliable compared to wireless Internet connectivity. It is not always true as even for Wired connection speed may be limited by plan signed up with the service provider. A commercial wireless connection or a 4G connection in good signal area may be faster than a speed limited wired connection. In general wired connections are more reliable as signals flow through a specific well defined medium like cable pairs, coaxial cables or optical fiber or even power lines. They also get affected by interference, signal loss etc with length of medium and how close they are with things causing interference. Wireless connections go through air or open space and can be affected by environmental conditions like solid objects, buildings, metal structures, rain, water bodies in surroundings etc resulting in reflections, multi path and absorption which can degrade the signal in many ways before it is received by a receiver.
