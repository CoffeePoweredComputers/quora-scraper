            "answer_text": "The current realities of the business world are such that you must be customer-centric in order to survive and get a competitive advantage. Indeed, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to run a business successfully if you don\u2019t focus on your customers\u2019 satisfaction and continuously work on improving their experience with your brand. Here just some of the key advantages of improving your customer service: More sales and higher revenue. If your customers are satisfied with what they have already seen, they are likely to try other products of yours and recommend your business to their friends and acquaintances. Besides, on a number of occasions, especially if the products you sell are not highly differentiated, the customer will not be against paying more for better service.Better brand image. Customer service can make or break your public image and reputation. If you fail to please your customers and provide them with the care they expect, it\u2019s likely they will not leave any good feedback for your business. In fact, they could easily bash your reputation by wiring an angry review online (social media has changed the game entirely!) and leave you in the situation where you need to work even harder on attracting new customers.Increased customer loyalty. Customers that enjoyed your customer service are likely to make repeat purchases.Employee motivation. If you think that only customers benefit from well-organised customer service, you are wrong! The need to provide high-quality customer service forms a purpose for the teams responsible for it and raises the company\u2019s morales.",

            "answer_text": "From my perspective there are few basic and worth chasing goals of good customer service: Getting to the roots of the request/order/problem - it is not on the customer side to know everything about your product or services. For that reason only it is completely normal that it is not easy to made a well-described request. Experienced customer service is able to cooperate with requester to understand the foundation of the issue and find together the best solution for it.Being informed - for customers all the uncertainities are making even small problem a nightmare. Good customer service provides details about any changes on the situation so the client can be assured there\u2019s a progress and the request is not forgotten. It also makes the possibility to customer to respond on any stage of the process before the final results are provided. For some services it is crucial to be responsive in such cases before making unacceptable costs on any side.Timely service - with nowadays attitude toward attention and time being the final currency it is considered unprofessional to waste customers time (IVRs being perfect example of the opposite). Of course it is almost impossible to provide specific time frame for unknown problem but it\u2019s one the biggest demands. Nobody wants to keep many tasks at hand so customers derved well will know when they should be back to the problem after delegating it on company side.Anticipation - with modern technologies it becomes easier to forsee what demands attention from the service reps. Good service will handle some issues before requested or contact the customer in a moment when needed.Onboarding - even the easiest products and services needs some explanation to use them in a best possible way. To be more effective user some help is a good service provided.",
