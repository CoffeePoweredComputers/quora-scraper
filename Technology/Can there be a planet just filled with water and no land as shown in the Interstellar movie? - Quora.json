With water that deep, it seems it would be solidified at the core, but that much pressure would generate heat, prevent freezing\u2026.I guess I\u2019ll have to set up a model to calculate. But I probably won\u2019t come back to this question. And it\u2019s still much easier to have a rocky core with a wet surface. Entirely wet, even. Miles deep. ",
