            "answer_text": "I do know of one possibility that could have a huge impact. It has do with baking and improving access to banking services. In rural areas access to banking services can be very limited. This hinders the ability for people to make socioeconomic progress. However, there is the possibility of bringing banking to every corner of the globe provided there is eitheir internet access or cell servce. It would all be done via people\u2019s smartphones which is an industry that has expanded immensely. Essentially, any business owner could become a banker. If someone had some cash they would take it to the business owner who would take the money. This money would then be in said person\u2019s account while the business owner would be able to use the cash to expand the business. If the persone wanted to access their money they could go to any other business owner on the system and access the cash via them. This is only done via an app. I read about this a while ago but can\u2019t remember what it is called. My apologies for that as well as a potentially shaky explanation. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology that people in western nations take for granted can make an enormous difference in the developing world. Like text messaging, which literally has the potential to save lives in parts of Africa, and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. African farmers are finally getting the chance to anticipate and plan for changing weather conditions, thanks to the advent of several text-messaging services. These services reach farmers using even the most primitive mobile phones, without requiring any special downloads or app installations. Best of all, they cost farmers next to nothing to use.
