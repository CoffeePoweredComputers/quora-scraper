            "answer_text": "1 - Quantum computing: Moore\u2019s law is failing[1]. Both physically and economically we are at the end of our silicon rope. We are almost at the physical limit of how many transistors we can cram into a chip. This is why over the last few years it has been all about adding cores and better load distribution rather than architecture. You can do so much with silicon and classical computing. To preserve the long term exponential growth of computing power per dollar cost we need a paradigm shift. That paradigm shift is coming from quantum computing. However using qubits instead of bits has its own limits. Quantum computers are very good at somethings and very very inept at others. Over the medium term (10\u201315 years) most advances will come from designing hybrid systems that combine quantum and classical components. This will require hitherto non existing computer science jobs and topics. If I were 20 I would definitely devote some serious effort to follow quantum computing innovations. 2 - Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing: These two are in fact indispensable for building a system that can apply a general learning ability (we are not there yet) using existing, non-structured (i.e. specifically designed to be input into the system) sources of information (we are halfway there). If we are to move towards general artificial super intelligence we will have to build a system that can do unsupervised learning on multiple domains without explicit interference from programmers. Much effort will be spent to develop learning algorithms that are not designed for specific problems but general information processing. 3 - Data visualization: This will sound strange to most but in my opinion existing data visualization practices are well behind our ability to make inferences from data. Many good routines exist but many are still very labor intensive. We are yet to develop an intelligent interface between analytical inference and visual representation of that inference. I am not an expert on this but in the next 10 years we might witness dramatic changes in how we translate data analysis results to end users. 4 - Autonomous systems: Self driving cars, homeostatic control systems for your house, health monitoring implants, robotic asteroid miners, self-replicating robots for space exploration and the like. Internet of things is here but it has still not exploded. A lot of room for rapid development is on the horizon. People who can design efficient and seamless communication and coordination between the \u201cthings\u201d in the internet of things will be high in demand. 5 - Neural interfaces between digital and biological systems: As Elon Musk says the main bottleneck in brain - computer communication is human output. Our input system (visual cortex) is incredibly high bandwidth. We can absorb immense amounts of information through our visual (and auditory) systems. The problem is output (or input to the digital system). We have a very precise but very inefficient meat stick method (i.e. typing commands) and a much faster but more difficult to process vocal system (speech recognition). Speech recognition has reached impressive levels but we are still way short to match our own input bandwidth with our output bandwidth. In order to match our visual information processing capacity we need direct neural interfaces with computers. Systems that can interpret neural signals as information output. Some rudimentary success have been reported over the last few years but real development is still ahead. I think we can probably think many more future topics of computer science. If we go into details I think we will see some interdisciplinary cross-breeding between medicine and computer science (very much similar to what happened in genomics and bioinformatics), and probably many more that few people can predict.

            "answer_text": "To be completely honest, there haven\u2019t been any. OK, controversial territory here. Harinarayan Tanha has a good list. It would have been a good list a decade ago, or two decades ago. Machine learning (ML) specifically and artificial intelligence (AI) generally have developed because of the ubiquity and speed of hardware. There are interesting things happening, but the last truly fascinating fundamental advances I saw were in social network and topic/sentiment analysis a decade ago, like Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Recent advances have been very mechanical. By far, the most interesting thing now in ML is adversarial AI, in which people are showing that ML systems are vulnerable to data that they can\u2019t anticipate and don\u2019t understand because ML systems don\u2019t understand anything, and if you know how a model was built, you can undermine it. However, adversarial AI isn\u2019t really new; it\u2019s the same problem and approach (to some extent) that was taken in exploring network unrolling 20+ years ago to comprehend neural networks; it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t do even minimal unrolling anymore, so it\u2019s easier to show flaws through demonstration, not derivation. As for security, there\u2019s a malware war, and we\u2019re losing. Part of the reason we\u2019re losing is predictable by a model I totally dissed in grad school, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which allows us to understand how and when tech is actually adopted and used. I thought the model was overly simplistic and not insightful, but any security analyst will tell you that the number one vulnerability is not some new zero-day \u201csploit\u201d; it\u2019s admins who don\u2019t know how to patch and monitor systems/networks. I could go on, but what I think is happening is that CS is stabilizing into a typical, relatively moribund scientific discipline. We won\u2019t have as much innovation as we did in the past. It\u2019s possible that something new, like smartphones, will come along, but while smartphones were enabled (to some extent) by CS, they were far more a product of hardware engineering, and they certainly didn\u2019t come out of CS research. They were spawned by the market. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my thoughts on it: Mobile devices have become extremely popular, especially with the recent tred of laptops, ultrabooks, tablets, and smartphones. With these mobile devices, wireless networking is also a big topic. Wireless networks are inherently \"messier\" than typical wired networks, and a lot of research has gone into improving wireless communication. Social has become very big with the abundance of social networking websites (or websites with social features) - Facebook for \"general\" networking among friends, Twitter for news and following celebrities, LinkedIn for professional networking, Quora itself has a social component to it. There are many many others as well. On the topic of social and mobile is data. You may have heard of \"big data\" - \"big data\" has become even more prominent because of how much data websites like Facebook and Twitter are generating. Additionally, with all these smartphones generating sensor data like geolocation, apps that track your fitness, we have even more data. Cloud computing is also very big - look at services like Box, DropBox, Google Drive, Microsoft SkyDrive etc. The ability for users to sync files across several devices has drawn a lot of people to using these services. The fact that I can read my Kindle book on my laptop, close my laptop, take my Kindle/iPad/Android/tablet with me to a bus stop, and have the page synced to where I was on my laptop still impresses me. Datacenter networking is also becoming important - again going back to social, websites like Twitter have had issues with scalability, and have been rapidly establishing data centers everywhere to keep up with the demand. This is definitely not a complete list, but is what I can think of off the top of my head. In terms of keeping up to speed, I use a combination of books, following the key people on Twitter, article aggregation (I recommend Prismatic), and watching talks online (or going to them in real life).

Computing science is the basic theory of computation, the very fundamentals. There are not really latest trends, these principles were laid down a long time ago. A lot of answers here are about trends in computing. That\u2019s OK, but it is not computing science. The thing in computing science is to understand the principles laid down by Church and Turing, and then expounded on by others like Hoare, Dijkstra, Strachey, and others. I find myself going further back to the thinking of the pioneers to gain understanding of what computing is about. That should be the trend. Anything that talks about implementation is the application of computing science, but not computing science itself. ",
