            "answer_text": "As the youth of this country, we have an opportunity to contribute to the country in many ways. But before we jump into anything, it is very important that we enhance our own abilities and competence, because just a desire to contribute is not enough. We must have an equanimous mind which allows us to apply ourselves in every situation. But at the same time, we must be do our jobs with full exuberance. This is necessary so that our work is effective enough. Coming to how we can contribute, there are a variety of issues in our country. We need to be observant enough to know what is best needed for the people around is and to enhance their lives. The issues can be divided into local issues and issues which may cover larger territory, maybe, a district, state, or country. Your observation and attention is needed to identify the local issues and innovate ways to solve them. If you look carefully, every district or every state represents a distinct set of problems. However, most of them could be solved if the local issues get sorted out. Because ultimately, the state issues are more or less a reflection or net summation of various local issues. Essentially, I feel it is important to work at the grassroots level. And just not your contribution is enough. We need youth from all over the country to take responsibility. The policies brought on the state and the national level should support the activities taken up on the grassroots. Only then we can see some significant change. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t tell if this question is about how you, personally, can improve society, or whether it is about what it is going to take to improve society. But I\u2019ll take a crack at each. What an individual can do to improve society For you, personally, to improve society, basically means you have to be able to organize people together into an organization that can make improvements for vast numbers of people. Some people do this by starting businesses that improve the lives of vast numbers of people. The founders of companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla might be able to make arguments that they have accomplished this task. Others attempt to improve society by organizing people to push for government policies that will benefit lots of people, such as making sure that everyone has a job, or everyone has access to health care, or everyone will be taken care of in their old age. Sometimes people work for policies that indirectly affect these things, by working for policies that will protect the planet we depend on by reducing pollution or keeping the weather from destroying places we live in. To organize people to work together, you need to have ideas and you need to be able to convince people to work together to accomplish that idea. Generally, you need to be able to meet their needs while they work together, so it is easier to do this in an organization that makes money, then by asking people to volunteer, or by having to ask people to donate money to the cause. The easiest way to build an organization that can improve society is to build a business that sells products that people want. If you start a non-profit organization, you will always be dependent on other organizations for donations. If you try to organize a government, you will also always be dependent on other organizations for donations. You will always have more capability if you are independently able to build the resources you need to organize than if you depend on others for donations. How to improve society Generally people want their lives to be freer. They want to be free from struggle and free to express themselves as they choose and free to do what they want. Most people want to feel safe. For human beings, this generally means feeling connected to others in a way that seems strong and unlikely to be broken. Our greatest survival trait has been our ability to cooperate with each other. So the best way to improve society is to improve humans\u2019 ability to cooperate with each other. However, there is a lot of disagreement about how to accomplish this goal. Some people believe that cooperation can only be managed from a central power source. Others believe that a central power source cannot effective manage everyone, and the only way to generate cooperation is by empowering individuals to work on their own behalf. Evolution is a process where living organisms generate all kinds of strategies for survival, and they compete with each other using these strategies. The strategies that are most successful end up being taken up by more people. It is not clear whether a centralized managerial source or individualized management or some combination of these alternatives is best. Different groups of people use a wide array of combinations of these strategies all over the world. They each generate different amounts of success and distribute that success in different ways. People have opinions about which method works the best, but there\u2019s no objective way to decide. Only time will tell. So which method should you choose, when it\u2019s not clear which method works best? You probably have an opinion, and your opinion is no better and no worse than anyone else\u2019s opinion. You opinion may or may not be shared by many others, but that probably has little effect on your ability to build an organization that can provide the resources to improve society. So the best thing to do, I think, is just go with your current opinion, and start working to build your for-profit organization. Most people who are successful in building an organization to improve society seem to have few doubts. I don\u2019t know if they would ask a question like this. They seem to start at an early age, and always know what they want to do without question. They try and they usually fail many times, but that never stops them. They try again and again until they find an idea that appeals to many others. They never seem to run out of energy and never give up. They keep on trying, failing many times along the way, but eventually start building the resources they need to improve society. I have a feeling that asking this question probably means you don\u2019t have what it takes to improve society in a big way. However, you may be able to make a smaller contribution. You could work within one of these organizations \u2014 choose one that fits your values the best. You\u2019ll do your part in improving society, although not many people will know your name nor credit you with what you have done. That may or may not matter to you. However, most people who actually improve society are more interested in improving society than in getting credit for it. They work hard just because they are driven to work hard. The credit comes later, and doesn\u2019t matter that much when it comes. ",
