On election night by 11:59 PM, we get a red herring when the \u201clamestream\u201d media flashes up a US map on TV like this one:  342\u2013196?! Bam! Total dominance over the radical left! Who called Trump winning Minnesota and New Hampshire? This guy! Trump up 52\u201343 on average in the Rust Belt, and up 5 and 6 points in states Hillary barely won. Huge lead in the national popular vote. Keep America Great! Wait.. that graphic shows the current leader\u2026 we don\u2019t have but just over half the vote counted in most states. Forgot about all those mail-in/vote-by-mail/absentee/whatever you wanna call them ballots still floating out there. Here\u2019s the actual map we wake up to on November 4:  Meh, nothing too shocking so far. Looks like that Maine 2nd congressional didn\u2019t pan out for Biden, and Texas which was never actually in reach, has been called. Biden goes on to only lose it by 4.5%, inching ever closer to purple territory. Meanwhile, 250,000 mail-in ballots arrive just a day late in mailboxes across the country, despite almost all being requested before state deadlines. By November 5 a few more results trickle in:  Looks like Trump takes Iowa, no surprise there, as well as hung on in Obamaha. Sleepy Joe pulls ahead in New Mexico and is officially projected to win the Maine 1st congressional along with the state. Virginia is called soon thereafter. Still, 155 electoral votes up for grabs, and some concern in the Biden camp starts to creep in that Nevada, Minnesota, and New Hampshire haven\u2019t been called yet, much less the other supposed swing states. At this point, 8:30 PM on 11/8/16 is the equivalent of November 5, nearly 48 hours after the polls closed. Still tons of votes trickling in slowly through the US Mail. With no overtime allowed and sorting machines now smashed to smithereens, the process becomes painful and contentious, and fraud \u201cevidence\u201d, manufactured on far-right, dark web message boards starts making its way to qdrops, InfoWars, then Fox, then Trump\u2019s Twitter feed and then of course CNN with their \u201cwell both sides\u201d arguments. November 6 (equivalent of 9:30 on 11/8/16):  Well that\u2019s okay. Biden has already exceeded Hillary\u2019s electoral vote total from 2016 taking New Hampshire, Nevada, and crucially Michigan becomes the first Rust Belt state to be called. Polling had Biden up ~6 points the week before, but his final margin will go on to be just under three points, so a little worrisome as to what that means and why more states haven\u2019t been called yet. This was supposed to be a blowout, or at least decisive enough to be over. Trump takes Ohio fairly easily with a 4-point win, and Georgia stays in his column by about 3%. Voter suppression would likely have not affected the final outcome in these two. By Sunday night 11/8, the race shapes up a little more, but we still don\u2019t have a winner (11:30 on election night 2016):  Okay, now we\u2019re ready to call this thing for Biden. He survived a squeaker in Minnesota, and survived and advanced in the Keystone state albeit by less than 2% in both, again under performing. Meanwhile voter ID helps sink the Dems in North Carolina with a tough 1.9% loss. Well, it\u2019ll be over any day now and we can officially declare Trump fired. A week after the election we still don\u2019t have a declared winner. The democrat party is trying to steal the election! Both sides are now claiming fraud, election \u201cmeddling\u201d, and the news media has a field day. They sure have raked in money since Trump came along! By now all of the mailed ballots have come in for processing, but Trump sues in the remaining three states to prevent any ballots postmarked ON election day from being counted, regardless of what state laws say. The problem is no one can tell which ones those are, and massive unrest starts up and people demand answers as to what is going on. November 10 - Despite a 2.5% lead for Biden in exit polling, Florida is finally called for Trump. Even with all those convicted felon voting rights supposedly being restored, Cubans buy into the lies that Biden is a far-left socialist, so he under performs with that group. Previously in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, poor ballot design placed Biden\u2019s name orphaned at the very bottom of the first column, sometimes cut off by a sabotaged, misaligned paper cutter, thus placing Hawkins, Jorgensen, Trump, and Write-In at the top of the second column. Many people dumbly write Biden in the write-in line, and state courts decide that doesn\u2019t count as a Biden vote. In other places, electronic machines fail resulting in long lines with people socially distanced. Thus Trump goes on to win the state by just 536 votes, one less than George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 victory. Trump flotillas commence, and old folks living in the Villages have a \u201cWhite Power Parade\u201d in their golf carts, because winning. Still two more chances to win though\u2026 November 12 - Arizona is finally called. Trump wins it by 0.1% after hand recounts it is determined that Trump won by 3,700 votes despite Biden having a big lead in the polls going into election day. Ballots trickled in quite slowly, even more so than in 2018 when Arizona elected a Democratic Senator. Another is elected to fill John McCain\u2019s seat. Turns out astronauts are more popular there than Biden is. November 15 - Matthew Wolff wins the Masters, Tiger Woods style. Biden officially takes a three million vote lead in the national popular vote. Trump\u2019s margin in most solid red states falls slightly from 2016 levels, and solid blue states move even further left in blowouts for Biden. So it all comes down to Wisconsin. Despite leading comfortably in the polls much like Hillary did going into election night, Trump again over performs with his silent majority which is really just an aging, whitening electorate that is skewing polling among likely voters. They\u2019re mostly pro-Trump anyway, but more fired up to go vote after all the rioting and looting. The Trump team quickly hones in on the ongoing recounts there. The Republican led legislature engages in a standoff with the Governor on deciding which mailed ballots should count. The argument is they can\u2019t be sure if ballots that slowly trickled in around Milwaukee late should count or not, regardless if it was the fault of a slowed down, neutered Postal Service or not. Trump sends federal operatives in to oversee the operation and ensure a free and fair election. With him clinging to a 1,000 vote lead, the conservative state supreme court declares the election over. Appeals to the US Supreme Court effectively decide the election with a 5\u20134 ruling, the majority basically punting, saying \u201cwell shucks, we can\u2019t get involved and overturn a state ruling\u2026\u201d. On November 23 (Same as 3 AM 11/9/16), AP FINALLY calls the race for Trump. Biden concedes the race and goes back to his basement (well, concedes FROM his basement on Zoom). All just in time for a nice Thanksgiving meal for politically polarized families to heal and the nation to come together after all the divisiveness.  When the final votes are tallied in California, Biden wins the overall popular vote 70,426,851 to 65,389,343. The five million vote margin is larger than Obama\u2019s PV victory in 2012 in which he won 332\u2013206 in the EC, and his loss is to an opponent who still received less votes than Hillary in 2016. About 0.0001% of them are fraudulent, mostly for Trump, and thousands more ballots either aren\u2019t returned or mysteriously disappeared. No one knows if the result is legitimate or not. Chaos ensues, buildings burn, crime rises, and stock markets crash as there\u2019s no incentive for the government to keep them artificially propped up anymore. The COVID-19 vaccine from Russia turns out to be a fake, and the bogus investigation into Biden and his family is dropped. Mr. Law and Order golfs, tweets, claims voter fraud, and instantly ceases to care for anything but himself. He goes on a rampage of a victory tour. Seriously, after November 3 what are people gonna do, not vote for him? Don\u2019t boo, vote! EDIT: 10/26 - Looks like my Wisconsin prediction already came semi-true but in a different way - Supreme Court just ruled 5\u20133 that ballots received after election day won\u2019t count. If you haven\u2019t voted yet in Wisconsin, either drop that ballot off like it\u2019s on fire or go vote in person immediately. This move alone probably handed Wisconsin to Trump, and Pennsylvania is next in a few days. ",

            "answer_text": "Very easy answer. Trump will win. (Notwithstanding unprecedented widespread electoral fraud, but I doubt that will occur.) To begin with, his approval rating is higher than both Obama\u2019s and Regan\u2019s at this point in their presidencies. His voter base is fired up by the fact he has been exonerated by the Muller report, and the fact he has kept most of his campaign promises. In addition, people who didn\u2019t initially support him now do so because of the lies told by the Democrats and the media, and because they have shown they are more committed to lying and scheming up ways to get the president removed rather than working with the president to make peoples lives better and honestly reporting the news. All the deranged lies about Trump and negative coverage of him which fizzles out, in the end, has only helped him gain support. All of this aside, historically the incumbent has an advantage. Only five incumbent candidates were not re-elected for a second term (not including candidates who were assassinated or resigned), and this usually happened because of an economic downturn under their watch. The economy under Trump has thrived so there is no chance of that happening. In addition, short of the pain of economic troubles, most people re-elect the incumbent because it is someone familiar. They know what to expect and if it isn\u2019t bankruptcy and unemployment they tend to go with the candidate they know rather than the candidate that is a mystery. So yeah, get ready for four more years of Trump. I look forward to it, I am one of those people who reluctantly voted for Trump in 2016, but after all of the childish behavior by the left, I will be actively campaigning for him. There is a lesson in that, if you scream and act crazy when someone you don\u2019t like wins an election, you drive people into the arms of the one you don\u2019t like. Edit: I would like to update my answer to reflect recent developments a year onward. My answer remains the same though that yes, Trump will win the 2020 election. This is despite the economic downturn caused by Coronavirus. Usually, this would be the death-knell for any incumbent, but this is an extraordinary situation in which The President has a few things playing in his favor. The Democrats have selected an extremely weak candidate:Oh sure, Biden was Obama\u2019s VP. But only the most deranged Democrats will actually vote for him. Most other people are already judging him as senile and incompetent. Even within his own party, there is dissent among more local lawmakers, for example, State Rep Vernon Jones from Georgia. So aside from driving away independents, he is also driving away some voters from his own party. Again, only the ones who hate Trump more than they care about the well being of the country will vote for Biden.Trump has shown exemplary leadership:Despite media lies about how badly he has handled this, Trump has shown exceptional leadership. He has taken direction from Dr\u2019s Brix and Fauchi, and this is made apparent every day during his daily press conferences. This is why Trump's approval rating has spiked above 50% in March and April in polls conducted by The Hill and Rasmussen. This, of course, is significant because Left-Wing media outlets have broadcasted claims that President Trump is the only President to never break 50% approval. What this shows is that voters resonate with how Trump handles the crisis.People are seeing the Democrats play Partisan Games:First, with phase 2 of the Coronavirus Stimulus and phase 3.5 which was meant to refund the SBA loans to preserve small businesses, the American public has watched the Democrats try to exploit this crisis for their own gain. And you can best believe that even if they haven't seen it yet, they will soon. For those of you who haven\u2019t of course, I will fill you in. Democrats held up Phase 2 by claiming it was a slush fund for large businesses, however, they tried to force a bill which legislated the demands of their New Green Deal, added funding for the NEA, and other items from their policy wishlist which had nothing to do with addressing Coronavirus or the Economic Fallout. And in 3.5 they tried to force in funding for Vote-by-Mail, which they are pushing since it is easily exploitable for committing voter fraud. Even in Phase 2, they managed to force 25 Million in funding for the Kennedy Center before they would stop holding American livelihoods hostage BTW. This will come back to haunt them in November, not just in the presidential race but also in House and Senate races as well.People will be more pissed at local authorities than at Trump:This will be especially true in places like Virginia and Michigan where totalitarian politicians have exploited the lockdown to push totalitarian policies. The more totalitarian they are, the bigger the backlash. And even if it doesn\u2019t drive all of them to vote Republican in local elections, many will think twice before voting for Democrats nationally as they have encouraged this or even turned a blind eye.At this point, the only ways Democrats will be able to win is if:A. A sufficient amount of red states remain on lockdown into mid-july.B. Democrats are successful in getting Vote by Mail approved and they commit fraud in a sufficient amount of states to flip the electoral college.Since A isn't likely since testing has become easier and there are multiple cures in trials (Including the drug Remdesivir), I just have to hope Republicans don\u2019t give in to these games of chicken and allow B to occur. But both are unlikely, and if on top of this there is a huge economic rebound before November, you can enjoy another 4 years of Trump and probably 4 years of a Republican Majority in both houses of Congress.
