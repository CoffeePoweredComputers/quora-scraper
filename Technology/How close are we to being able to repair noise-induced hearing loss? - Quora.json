            "answer_text": "Hair cells sit on top of the basilar membrane and vibrate as sound waves are received and amplified. As the hair cells vibrate, microscopic projections (stereocilia) perched on top of the hair cells bump against an overlying structure and bend. This bending causes pore-like channels to open up, releasing a rush of chemicals and inducing an electrical signal. The auditory nerve then carries this electrical signal to the brain which translates it into the sound that is recognized and understood.  Permanent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is often caused by the damage and eventual death of hair cells. Since hair cells are essential to the hearing process and currently impossible to replace, effectively treating NIHL is a very difficult task. While there is some research that may suggest a path forward, it is far from certain how long it will be - if ever - before NIHL can be repaired. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is cochlear implants.  The procedure has been out for many years.  When I was first evaluated for the procedure, my hearing was basically 0% in the right ear and 2% in the left.  Three years later, after having both ears done about six months apart and activation of each ear one month after surgery, my hearing is a s good if not better than most people.  I can use my iphone (at 50% volume), appreciate music, breeze through conversations, hear sounds, etc.  My weakness, like most people's, is hearing in intense noise (like a bar playing loud techno).  For more info, google cochlear implant. ",
