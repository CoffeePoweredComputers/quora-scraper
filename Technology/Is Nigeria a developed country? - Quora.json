            "answer_text": "Dear Questioner, Yes, Nigeria is now a developed country. I know this is quite difficult to believe, but it's true. We're now developed industrially, economically and mentally. Few more years and we will be the world power. After we've figured out how to defeat China. From a very average life expectancy of 52 years, we've climbed to 90, beating countries like Japan and Italy to it! With a golden Per Capita Income, our literacy rate is now hundred percent. No jokes. Lately, the government has been contemplating on educating our dogs and other pets; they deserve better lives too. Plus we still have plenty education left to give; even after accommodating all the students from Europe, America, Asia and other parts of Africa. You won't believe our recent Human Development Index. 0.9! You read that correctly. Our leaders now are young, agile, patriotic, and full of sense. The constitution has been revised so that measures that ensure creativity, growth and development prevail. Crime rate is in its all time low. The only form of corruption you'll see is a mother bribing her son with another piece of meat to eat the two in his plate. We're blessed. With skyscrapers littering everywhere, Nigeria is now home to thousands of industries. Military. Technology. Commerce. Transport. Food. Clothing. Agriculture Telecommunications. Manufacturing. Etc. We import nothing and export all, including our specialists to help some struggling western nations. We provide them aids too. Poor guys. Currently, our military personnels are busy saving the USA from the cold jaws of Russia. We do this helping thing a lot. Last month, Nigeria launched her 3000th satellite into space. We've really come a long way. Who would believe this is a country that once struggled with providing electricity even to her urban settlements? It is now extremely difficult to die in Nigeria. People won't just die. The health system is so efficient that they treat you for a disease you haven't even gotten yet. Too much motivation is troubling our health practitioners. We have senile men and women roaming the streets, complaining, getting lost and found. What used to kill us, like accidents, malaria, hypertension, and other illnesses have been eradicated. A 75 year old man was recently sued by his healthy 120 year mother for not \"allowing me to die. He keeps taking me to that highly effective hospital.\" Now in Nigeria, seeing a person carelessly fling things from their car is like seeing a dinosaur spit at you. It is impossible. Even if someone does, there are little robots on every corner of our carefully restructured roads, ready to grab the dirt and stop the offender's car automatically, because we now use electric, centrally-controlled vehicles. I wish I can tell you the story of how crude oil tragically died. But time. We still have it though, we just don't pay much attention. The world has moved on. Let me shock you, Nigeria didn't split to achieve all these. We are still that big nation with plenty little nations in it. In my next letter from the future, I'll tell you how we made it possible. Yours from the future, Soogun. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Nigeria is not a developed nation. It is a third world country, which means: a underdeveloped. Why? Because in Nigeria there is: low income, unequal distribution of wealth and income, high population growth and low life expectancy - which means poor health care, and education system, and Nigeria is a commodity economy: highly dependent on oil for its revenue. Though there are other parameters used in knowing whether a country is underdeveloped, developing or developed. Some of the parameters are: HDI (Human Development Index), Industrilusation and GDP. The Nigerian economy in terms of nominal GDP is bigger than the economy of some developed countries, such as Portugal, Denmark, Hong Kond and even Norway who is considered the most developed country with a Human Development Index of 0.944. Nigeria has a HDI of .532 in 2017 - which make the country a low development nation - which means: poor standards of living, low access to education and unhealthy life (low life expectancy). This marked Nigeria as undeveloped nation. ",
