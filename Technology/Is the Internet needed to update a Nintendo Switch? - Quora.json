            "answer_text": "You need to get the update from somewhere and as a switch generally has no USB drive or floppy disk, you would generally send the update over the Internet to the switch. So the switch needs to be connected to something. And whatever it is is determined by the software on the switch, as a switch generally contains the logic to update itself based on some source. If this source happens to be an update that you could upload to the switch from your computer then great! All you would need in that case is your computer and a connection between your computer and the switch. But many switches want to download the update straight from the source before installing it, which means that it needs to be connected. And in some cases, the update is an executable that you have to download and execute on your computer, and have the computer connected to the switch in some way. So if you have the update, you would not need Internet but you would need a computer that can execute this update! (It sucks when the update is Windows-only and you use Linux. Or if the Update is for Windows 95 and your Windows 10 64-bit refuses to execute it\u2026) All in all, it depends on the model and brand of your switch. Some will need it, for others you might provide one through an attached computer instead. ",

Yes you need an Internet connection. All modern consoles require an Internet connection to update. Doesn't matter if it is a Switch, Xbox One, PS4, Xbox 360, PS3, DS, etc. ",
