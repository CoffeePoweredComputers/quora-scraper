But I wonder what makes you think you need to turn off sensors on the iPhone. Do you think you\u2019re saving battery life? No one is more concerned about battery life than Apple and they\u2019ve spent millions making sure these sensors run on very little power so you don\u2019t have to worry about it. Are you worried that these sensors are spying on you? If so, all you need to do is put on a tin foil hat and that ought to take care of it. ",
