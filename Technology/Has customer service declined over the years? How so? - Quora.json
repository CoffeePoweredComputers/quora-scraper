            "answer_text": "Yes and no. The tricky thing here is that the number of ways that companies and customers can interact has increased by leaps and bounds. When I was a kid, you generally had 2 ways of getting customer service: in person and over the phone. Email came on the scene and opened yet another way for companies and their customers to interact. And with each layer of connectivity we add on, there are more and more ways to fail our customers. And even when we\u2019re not failing, there\u2019s the perception that we are because you miss out on seeing the long line in front of you or don\u2019t realize that customer service is helping out too many people at once. There are also more and more ways for customers to share about their experiences online. Yelp, reviews on a company\u2019s website, Twitter, Facebook\u2026you name it. Companies try to be everywhere their customers are. The problem with that is that if they\u2019re not offering amazing support through every channel, it will get out that they have bad support. They may have the best customer service on the phone, but if they have a Twitter page and aren\u2019t doing anything to help customers there then no one will care. It\u2019s the reverse of \u201cIf a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it\u2026does it make a sound?\u201d If someone is shouting into the void and there\u2019s no customer service to respond, well that\u2019s just bad customer service. Problem is, there usually isn\u2019t someone to staff it. Some VP thought they were being cool and added one more thing that no one has time for. Unless a company can staff the necessary help then they shouldn\u2019t have a presence everywhere. The other issue you have is that companies tend to look for quantity over quality. When you\u2019re running an online business where orders come in from all over the world, you\u2019ve got a lot more people to deal with than you would be limited to in a brick and mortar situation. There\u2019s a pressure on customer service reps to knock the queue down as quick as possible. I\u2019ve known reps for tech companies like Apple who are stuck in over 3 live chats at any given point. When you\u2019re expected to have that many conversations at one point there are clearly diminishing returns for both the rep and the customer. Then there\u2019s the problem of the \u201cniceness meter.\u201d A lot of cities in the US deal with downtown parking by having paid meters. If you want to keep your car somewhere, you put some change in or pay with your card and go. Stop putting the money in and your car gets a ticket or worse\u2026Ya get towed, bub. The niceness meter is something all people have. You wake up, have a cup of coffee and leisurely breakfast and that puts some change in the niceness meter for the day. Get 12 angry customers in a row and you\u2019re fighting back tears? You need a break, a brisk walk, maybe a snack to help put a little change back in the meter. But for many CS reps, they don\u2019t get that. When I worked clothing retail, I was lucky if I got one of my breaks over the course of 2\u20133 shifts. When I worked in a call center, I\u2019d get the one old and lonely lady who would keep me well over my lunch break\u2026and I just wouldn\u2019t get a break at all. Try talking to 60\u201380 people in one day with hardly a break. I\u2019m an extrovert and even I can\u2019t deal with that. The niceness meter empties out. Shifts that put you working until after midnight and coming back at 7am (or earlier) the next day? The niceness meter runs on empty. Companies that don\u2019t back up their employees when a customer is being straight up abusive? Still empty. Customers who think that because we chose the field of customer service that we must not be intelligent? Now we\u2019re just moving into middle finger emoji territory. There are so many things that could be done to make things better. Companies shouldn\u2019t see customer service reps as a dime a dozen. Treat them right and they\u2019ll stick with you. Reward the people who actually care and help the ones who hate people find what they love doing. Please don\u2019t kill your reps. Customers also need to understand that help is not instantaneous and that screaming does nothing to help that niceness meter stay full. Please don\u2019t kill your reps unless you\u2019re killing us with kindness. And both companies and customers need to understand that while you may not see a line in front of you, there almost always is one. ",

There are some exceptions and even exceptional customer service with companies that might not excel at customer service. As example, specific outlets in a fast food restaurant chain. I believe the missing factor when we experience \u201cpoor\u201d customer service is there aren\u2019t supervisors/bosses who care enough to do a good job working with employees to get them to at least pretend to care about providing good customer service. I believe three things would help: Employees should be asked \u201cHow would you want to be treated?\u201d And within reason for what makes sense for the business (and a honest response from the employee) the manager\u2019s response is: \u201cOk cool! Do that!\u201dWe\u2019ve all heard: \u201cThe customer is always right.\u201d I disagree as strongly as I possibly can and would tell my employees exactly that. I would also say in order to give great customer service we need to remember: \u201cThe customer is never wrong.\u201dOne of the best managers I ever had said: \u201cIf a customer starts \u2018ripping you a new one\u2019 politely excuse yourself and come get me. Even if they are yelling at you to return walk away come get me.

            "answer_text": "Some stores, yes of course it has. Especially large department stores like Macy\u2019s , Belk\u2019s and Dillards for example. Now it seems more effort is expended upon surveillance to catch shoplifting clients than customer service. I have even seen signs in some ladies dressing rooms that the store is videotaping. Really?!! So I make my selections and take them home to try on, and therefore have more returns. I live in a large county that is rated the second most diverse county in the United States. We are all accustomed to seeing what could be the United Nations while shopping, eating, walking in the park. We get along well, people strike up conversations spontaneously amongst each other, and I feel we have less racism than I hear about in other areas of the country. Because people are just a bit more friendly, I believe that in general, we receive better customer service. One\u2019s experience of good customer service is also a reflection of how the worker is being treated by the customer. It\u2019s easier to be pleasant and helpful when your customers are nice. If you want to see fantastic customer service, go to a Chic-filet. The food is not fantastic (to me, but many love it), but fresh and pretty good. But oh my goodness, the customer service! Smiles everywhere, always someone offering to take your trash away and refill your drink, but not in an obtrusive way. Whatever they are doing to train their staff, it is very effective! Jimmy Johns also has excellent customer service and they are quick and efficient. I know the owners murder lions, but that\u2019s another issue. The customer service at Jimmy Johns is always pleasant, if you don\u2019t like your sandwich, give then a minute and they will remake it. Again, smiles all round. Pleasant place to eat. These are just two examples of excellent customer service that stand out to me. There are several others, as well. I believe that good customer service is directly proportional to how the customer treats the salespeople or other workers. If you show respect, that is usually what you get back. Where I live, customer service is pretty darn good. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a vey broad question and the answer is yes, and no. When I get my haircut I get great service. My stylist is funny, knows me well and always make me look good. We enjoy each other's company and it's always a good experience and I learn a lot. How? Because like old school barber shops they know Everything that happens in town and they share. The grocery store, like most big boxes have turned to convenience foods and prepack. Meat is processed, cut and packaged off site and brought in for sale as if the butchers still do all the cutting. A lot of the food for sale is like that and automation is taking a toll on the human experience. Older customers come to the store for some human interaction with their frozen dinners. What the get are two frazzled cashiers and a row of do it yourself machines. Staffing has been reduced to force customers to \u201cdo it themselves\". When that doesn't work they flog those cashiers to \u201cgo faster\" . They don't care about their employees or you, just bring your own bags, (saves them bag $$), bag your own food (no baggers). I usually give good service, sometimes exceptional and sometimes I just want you to leave, sometimes that's all you want too. As automation rises and online sales increases there will be less service and more do it yourself. If you don't like it, vote with your wallet by giving your business to companies that serve and value you. Sometimes it may cost a bit more but remember what you're paying for. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Generally speaking, corporations are trying to suggest to customers to go online to see benefits at least in the health care industry but also banking. Sometimes customers don't have the time because they are rushing to a meeting, or going on break or lunch and are hourly employees with rigid schedules. The reps are monitored usually by how many calls they handle and if they have resolved the problem, how long it took to resolve the question or issue and if they have complaints or have been commended by customers as providing excellent service. The reps are often in an a hurry and want the customer to look up info or ask their employer when that happens. So I would have to say that in some cases the service levels have gone down, but some companies have updated and improved their service standards and reduced wait times. Not all corporations and industries are created equal. To be fair, questions have become more complex particularly when it comes to healthcare and health plans since plan designs change and often sales does not share new laws and requirements with the customer-facing staff until they deal with their sales numbers. I've seen this create problems with the quality and accuracy of information communicated by the CSRs to customers because they've been left out of the loop. For example, when changes were made to COBRA ( health insurance Continuation coverage after a qualifying event for loss of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage), CSRs were the last to know because sales managers only advised the sales reps, not the member facing customer service reps resulting inaccurate communication to health plan members. Accurate communication is key  here! ",

Bottom line, to feel special. They proceed to be demanding and argumentative. Then, they can't understand the lack of customer service. Blame shifting. Pride blindness, inability to be self aware. Narcissists. Crazy people need to shop, too. Recently, the night manager arrived at 9 pm, to find 2 cashier's in tears, after dealing with a nasty customer. Why is it customers feel entitled to treat retail workers and restaurant servers like they are beneath them? Why do insecure people need to insult and disrespect others to elevate self? Why insult and disrespect the person who handles your food and drinks? Are you aware, that servers will spit in your food and drinks, after they are treated badly? Each week, l deal with customers that show up on a Friday for a sale that begins on Sunday. It's clearly marked in the ad. All you gotta do is read, people. Instead they begin with arguing about the price being wrong. I don't argue, I just show them the ad. Usually, they silently walk away. Try looking in a mirror, before blaming others for poor customer service. Good day. ",

Privately owned business didn\u2019t typically have customer service training. Now most businesses are corporate own and to compete they have to give a certain level of service. In addition, with social media and websites like Yelp good customer service is a requirement. Before trying a new restaurant or staying at a hotel I check the reviews first which I think a majority of people also do. I also do the same when considering almost any business. I agree with the volume some businesses have it isn\u2019t possible to have high standards for customer service. The unwillingness of some businesses to pay better and retain employees also affects the level of service it provides. Some businesses don\u2019t have the luxury to be very particular about who they hire. These businesses tend to overlook things and give certain employees too many chances to succeed. ",

The customer service staff want to do a good job, but they get instructions from corporate to do things like up-sell, sign them up from credit cards, be annoying as frak, etc. Corporate mandates these things in the name of customer service, but they insist on it to a point where it\u2019s harassment. A good customer service agent knows when offering additional items will be beneficial for the customer. But corporate pushes it so they are just hounding the customer to buy more. When I worked at Office Max (over a decade ago), we had to ask every customer if they needed ink and paper while they were here. They\u2019d look at me like an idiot and usually say, \u201cum, no, I would have picked some up if I needed it.\u201dOh, but the real gem was when the customer came up to check out and already had ink and paper in their cart. I had to say \u201cwould you like to add\u2026 more\u2026 ink and paper\u2026 to your purchase today?\u201d And then I had to sell them a $4 warranty service for the $.50 mechanical pencil they bought.

We had bonuses, they gave us an extra week of vacation, and the food, my god the food. An amazing time. Now, nothing! Retail associates no longer feel valued. If you don\u2019t feel valued, you won\u2019t put in the effort. It\u2019s why I left. As a Loss Prevention associate and manager, I have been exposed to AIDS, HIV, Hepatitis, I have been stabbed, choked, punched, spit on, dragged by a car trying to prevent an associate from being kidnapped, had human shit and piss thrown at me, meth scabs thrown at me, you name it, it has happened to me and every other person I have worked with. When a major retailer refers to you has nothing more than a pencil, because you don\u2019t create sales, you become very disgruntled!!! In fact I must end it here, my blood pressure is going up!! Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas!! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tricky one but I\u2019m going to weigh in that customer service has gone WAY up over the years. I hear the answers shared and the concerns with those working in retail or on the phones and their lack of enthusiasm or knowledge. There is often a limited ability for the support team to actually act in a way that solves the issue. And yet I\u2019ll stand strong that support has gone way up over the years. Here\u2019s why. Historically customer service was in person, through the phone or by US Postal mail. Companies evolved their phone support with Interactive Voice response (IVR) to self serve. Then the Internet came and turn things upside down for companies when it came to customer service. Now a good customer service team is integrated with the Marketing team and the social teams. You can find support on YouTube, via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. If you don\u2019t like the help you\u2019re getting from the company then you reach out to their user base for support. I don\u2019t keep user manuals any longer because I know I can get them online; companies have had to improve their presence to keep up with expectations like mine. I watch YouTube videos to trouble shoot my products when I have a problem. These videos are sometimes made by a company and other times made by enthusiast of people making money on providing support. I get that walking into a store the clerks don\u2019t know as much as they may have in the past. I believe most companies have invested in other multiple channels to provide a broader level of support. IMO, that\u2019s effort and means that support is way up compared to the past. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only speak from personal experience. I think it has gone down overall but the reason as I see it is that we have little interaction with small businesses. Large businesses have outsourced so much of their call center service to other countries we have a definite communication problem because of culture and accents. Although having worked with international customers I figured out how to listen to many accents. That is helpful for me but few customers have had that exposure. While many of the service representatives usually have excellent English language skills some terms or requests don\u2019t translate well. When a representative introduces themselves with an American sounding name but their accent belies that name sincerity is lost. If Kevin or Julie has a thick East Indian accent, it\u2019s hard to accept that you are speaking to Kevin or Julie. Large businesses have to rely on call centers to provide their customer service. Call centers however create the need for automated answering which is often frustrating with voice recognition and limited choices to direct the call. If the center is a contract center, there\u2019s even less of a feeling of connectedness to the company the customer is calling for service. Sadly scaling up customer service simply has its advantages, usually for the business and disadvantages, usually for the customer. ",

Destroy the world via social media, give me whatever it is I was trying to get for free, I WANT TO SEE THE MANAGER!!!!

Unfortunately this same tech has an affect on our personal social interactions which has carried over to some business settings.

I'm ok with paying a premium or going our of my way knowing that I'll be taken care of.Encourage family and friends to do the same.Never forsake your dignity to save a few dollars or for convenience. Your time and money are valuable. There are plenty of places that will respect you for spending both on their place of business. ",

Because the basic \u201cgood customer service\u201d is friendly employees. But believe it or not what an individual customer considers \u201cfriendly enough\u201d is different in my experience. I\u2019m not very good at \u201cChit chat.\u201d I am one of those cashier\u2019s that smile, greets the customer, but doesn\u2019t always hold full conversations while scanning and bagging their things. At the end I will hand them a receipt and say thank you, have a good day or whatever friendly goodbye will do. But little talking in between. Some customer\u2019s like this. Others do not and prefer me to be less quiet. It really does depend on what a customer expects out of their experience. Another example is some customers think I bag perfectly, and others have yelled at me for my horrible bagging. That is also apart of good customer service. Bagging well. Obviously you don\u2019t want to be rude and just throw their groceries and other items into the bags. But you do want to try and bag them how they\u2019d like. And sometimes how one person thinks is acceptable bagging isn\u2019t how another does. I know that sounds weird also. But if you become a cashier you\u2019ll find out quickly that some people as long as the meat is in a plastic bag will not mind putting it with other things. While other people are like me and feel it should be separate from all other items. Same for cleaners and food together etc. Some people want very little in their bags because it\u2019s heavy, others want as little bags as possible and want you to fill them with as much stuff as you can. So if I don\u2019t bag how they personally like it. Then that\u2019s also considered bad customer service. Which is fine. I always try to fix it next time they come into my line and do things how they would like me to. But as far as customer service in general goes. I don\u2019t think it has gone down. I think it\u2019s about the same as always. ",

During that time period everyone was after the new customer, the one who just refinanced and had plenty of money in their pockets. Retaining existing customers wasn't high with many companies, especially banks and other financial institutes as well as many retailers. After the bubble burst, everyone was hurting and now we're at the point were customer service is the focus of attention. Now, not only profits but the long term health of many companies is dependent on them keeping existing customers satisfied.  So, i'd say at this point delivering good customer service is becoming important once again and making an upswing rather than a decline. ",

Note: this can vary wildly by company, as higher paying positions attract customer service professionals armed w more knowledge and soft skills than most.

What\u2019s happened, in my opinion, is that companies are actually tracking service levels beyond a simple customer satisfaction survey. Beyond that, there\u2019s a general trend to automate processes that take live interaction and intimacy out of the equation. What I mean is that we have more effective ways to measure the overall customer experience, which has uncovered deeper areas where customers reach a point of churn or disengagement. Add in the that the migration to alternative (and cheaper) channels like chat, self-service, and email, as well as the insertion of AI and bots to service these new channels, it seems that it\u2019s not a case that the level of customer service has gone down, but that the state of person to person contact has gotten less frequent. As an aside, I\u2019ve noticed that consumers the age of my kids (18 and 21) seem to shy away from personal interaction. They\u2019re more more prone to check an app, or a site and to interact via chat or email instead of dialing a number. I may be old fashioned, but I think customer satisfaction is more tied to the level of intimacy of interaction. So, the more direct the interaction, the higher the level of satisfaction. But the trend is to move away from direct contact, so customer satisfaction may seem lower. ",

A good business strategy includes the following foundations: the uniqueness of your product or service, customer service, and retention, distribution of your goods and services, targeted audience, operating costs, etc. Great customer service doesn\u2019t happen easily or overnight. It takes great thought, planning, communication, and implementation. Yet, many case studies are indicating that customers for some reason aren\u2019t seeing the results of this investment. Before answering the main question, let\u2019s step back a little bit and see what are those key factors for the great customer service? First of all \u2014 the team. You must have the right people by your side. They will grow, mature, learn and adapt to new challenges, therefore \u2014 provide a better experience for your customers. Secondly \u2014 communication ethics, patience, and attentiveness. It\u2019s much better if you know what to say and when to say it. Delivering personalized customer service makes a huge difference for the business. And last but not least the ability to \u201cread\u201d customers. Has the level of customer service gone down over the years? No, not at all. Among the countries with a high customer satisfaction rating, you will find the USA, New Zealand, Canada, Norway, Australia, Denmark, Israel, UAE, and other countries. Technology and cost-cutting in modern business didn\u2019t actually take the human element away, it only reduced it by a small percent. The implementation of the AI/neural networks and chatbots has increased customer retention and satisfaction dramatically over the past couple of years. Since more and more customer interactions take place online, consumers expect help to be available whenever they need it. For instance, over the last five years, the number of U.S. online-store shoppers who used live chat increased from 38% to 58%. ",

The store\u2019s training of personnel is another factor as some stores even in nationwide chains can lack in training from time to time. It could also be due to the person\u2019s personality and them being good around people or not. I try to keep a high level of customer service no matter what I do and sometimes it\u2019s people above me that fail to see that. A lot of the employees at Walmart, Target, and other stores tend not to stick around as much with their being a lot of higher paying jobs around and the existence of Uber and other related jobs. So unfortunately one will deal with new people 5 times out of 10 due to the high rates of turnover that these companies tend to have. Bottom line it is due to a wide variety of factors and can\u2019t be singled out to one or another. ",

They work with headphones on listening to music instead of paying attention to their environment. They arrive late. They leave early. They feel they\u2019re entitled to a 1\u20132 hr lunch, every day. They call at the last minute, or not at all, when they don\u2019t want to arrive for work. They argue about processes or procedures. They don\u2019t take direction from older staff trying to show them the ropes to a positive career development. There have been a few customer service people I\u2019ve come across that understood what it means to be in customer service, just as I\u2019ve been myself for well over 35 years in varying capacities.

Nonetheless, I feel the current social expectations about wanting a solution NOW are also to blame. No one has any patience for people trying to help, problems are expected to be sorted within minutes and sometimes that it not possible. There needs to be empathy from both sides in this type of situation. A lack of training and a lack of manners means that yes I believe customer service has deteriorated.

I did work at a shoe store after that for about a year and found, just as was stated in one of the other answers, that the younger people weren't nearly as attentive to customers as they should have been.

While some of that thought is still alive at companies such as Sweetwater.com, many companies, especially larger companies tend to treat customers as an annoyance. Visit most web sites and it can be hard to impossible to find a phone number or email address where a person will respond. Generally it\u2019s the \u201cSupport Team\u201d. So it\u2019s inconsistent and your experience can vary greatly. For the most part when you can contact someone you get at least the appearance of good customer service. But often what they can do for you falls short. I do consider customer service to be one of the most important aspects of any business. With a hot product you can get away with slacking off because the number of new customers will outweigh the ones that are unhappy. But at some point that can catch up with you and then you are going to be in trouble. And anyone that contacts you should be treated as a customer with the best possible service and consideration. They may never become a paying customer, but chances are they will talk to others who may and you should want them to speak well of you and not ill. ",

Several times it is well over 90 seven before the CSR comes back on line. One of the biggest things I was told not to do with the caller is leave more then 10 seconds if dead air ( when the CSR neither speaks or places you on hold.). Many times I have been a caller and experienced well over 10 seconds of dead air. I I\u2019ve started on a previous answer I never yell or complain to them. As also previously stated I mention that I used to be a CSR. I then in a very friendly and understanding way I give them little tips on the hold and dead air time. ",
