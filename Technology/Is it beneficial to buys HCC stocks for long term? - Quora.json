I tracked HCC (Hindustan Construction Corporation) for almost four years, after given up on it. When I put it in my watch list, Its future seems to very bright, Its was constructing Lavasa City in Maharashtra [1], the one of first close to nature private city and lot of contractor work in Delhi metro too ( I have seen lot banner displaying them as prominent player in Metro railway construction). However soon I saw its declining in share value as well as debt pilling, harmed the company much. Also Lavasa city embroiled in controversies [2], though which later clarified,Though lot of time is lost, making company neck deep in debt as they are sitting on unsold inventories for years. Currently Its on uptrend, and I have checked results of last 4 quarter, their is nothing extraordinary, though all figure are in green.
