            "answer_text": "Update for mid-2019 This is a general guide and is subject to opinion, but this is what I suggest Operating System: If you are doing any kind of hacking, you are going to want to run Kali on a virtual machine (possibly more than one). Macs work fine if that\u2019s your taste, but there is no significant advantage of running a Unix-based host machine. There are plenty of text editors (I prefer Sublime) for writing every kind of code, including bash scripting, Pearl, Python, and a zillion others; furthermore, even if you are running a *NIX host, you should not test scripts in your \u201cproduction environment\u201d anyway. Since you should (obviously) test your scripts in a test environment, your host operating system becomes almost irrelevant. Processor: Get a processor that is designed with virtualization in mind. Unless you have a sky-high budget, the best processor out there for virtualization in a laptop is the Ryzen 7 from AMD. Don\u2019t let the 2.2 GHz clock-speed fool you - believe the benchmarks, and overclock it if your device can handle the extra wattage and heat. If you are using a MacBook Pro, I think an intel i7 works better for this than an i9, but as of this post, AMD is better for virtualization. You can take my word for it, but if you are knowledgeable on how processors work and are looking at something else, do your research and look at tech specs and benchmarks, not advertising. RAM: Since virtual machines cannot share RAM, you will need plenty. You can get by on 8 GB, but 12\u201316 GB or more wouldn\u2019t be a waste. SSD: Have one. Spin drives are as slow as a windows update in comparison to an M.2 SSD, and should you need to wipe everything, it\u2019s not forensically recoverable. You shouldn\u2019t be using any magnetic media anyway unless it\u2019s for stability in backups. Virtual machines can share drive space dynamically, and as long as you aren\u2019t running big games like Elder Scrolls or Siege on your laptop, you can get by with just 128 GB if you need to trim to fit your budget. Storage space is almost a non-issue in priority compared to the speed of an SSD. Networking: If you are getting a laptop with anything close to the specs listed above, it will already have the latest WiFi and Bluetooth standards, but there are a lot of laptops that forgo an ethernet port. This is an important feature to have, but there is a work-around if there isn\u2019t one - get a USB-3 to ethernet dongle. Security hardware: Fingerprint scanners are nice, but know the current and future possible risks of having biosignature information on your mobile device. Personally, I already have my fingerprints in six or seven different government databases, (voluntarily, not from arrests! :P) so the chances of my fingerprints falling into the wrong hands is significantly higher than the average person, and the people who would be stealing that information are more likely to target me. Cover your camera. It sounds paranoid and stereotypical, but it is a very real vulnerability. If want something more classy than a band aid or masking tape, look them up on amazon, or get them as company swag. Security software: Use a VPN. If you are asking about what computer to use, then you are probably fairly new to IT security, but I\u2019m sure you are already discovering the dangers of using unencrypted or weakly-encrypted traffic. Use one that is reputable, even if you have to pay a few dollars more. You have no choice but to implicitly trust your VPN provider. This is exponentially more important if you are using a proxy. Encrypt your drive. If you use Windows 10 pro, you can use BitLocker. Be sure to use a PIN number along with the key, as BitLocker is susceptible to a 3 month long brute-force without it. A 6-digit PIN bumps that up to a couple hundred thousand years. Another great option is VeraCrypt. If you are worried about the limited read/write operations associated with SSDs, know that drive encryption happens in the RAM, not the drive itself, so encryption does not affect the life of your drive. There are some people who would fight me on this, but Windows Defender is just fine for endpoint protection. There is no special need for an anti-virus software for home use, and rarely a need for it outside of an enterprise or otherwise high-profile network. Personally, I treat Kaspersky, MacAfee, and Norton as bloatware and purge them on every machine I work on. If you feel the need for endpoint protection on your device, I have frequently heard professionals recommend Malwarebytes, but as with anything, do your research. Graphics: Despite the portrayal in media, hacking does not use fancy 3-D graphics and other flashy stuff. Although it looks pretty cool on TV, the reality is that consoles still give you the most information in a reasonable space, and most of the time, there isn\u2019t a graphical interface even if you wanted one. Ignore graphics specs. Accessories: These are all personal opinion, but I would like to recommend a few. A privacy screen is nice to have to avoid freaking people out at coffee shops when they see a console up. A good D3O+carbon-fiber hard sleeve will make sure your livelihood is protected against pretty much everything, and is important to have especially if you ride a motorcycle like I do. As stated above, have an ethernet to USB-3 dongle if you don\u2019t have an ethernet port, and always have an ethernet cable handy as well regardless. Other accessories are up to personal taste. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate to sound clich\u00e9d but it depends. I had a look at the other answers but they were mostly subpar. I personally use a 2015 MacBook Pro 13 inch maxed out. I got it for a couple of reasons. For all of the apple haters I understand you but apple makes some of the most high quality laptops physicallyMac OS uses unix which means integrated perl, C, python and bash. A perfect mix out in the field when you need to whip up a script.MacBooks can run virtual machines, dual boot or boot off a USB stick. So for all of the people whining \u201cLinux is the only OS to use when hackign ur all srcubs\u201d are not judging Linux on day to day performance.Mac OS has great compatibility. I video edit and photo edit and that means I need a decent video editor. I need access to FCP X or premier Pro. Linux has support for neither.In conclusion hackers use a laptop that has atleast an i5 so they can run a could of scripts at once and atleast 16gb. I'm setting it at 16gb because coding SUCKS up memory. A decent amount of storage but you would use a bootable USB for linux. The laptop needs to reasonable light and have decent I/O. I use my Ethernet, HDMI and SD card on a daily basis. More USB ports the better. Brian Kelleher ",
