But if you just want a new phone, the best time is as soon as a new model becomes available. Here\u2019s why: If you are looking for all the latest features, then buying as soon as a new model is introduced is the way to go.If you are looking to save money, the previous model usually is reduced by $100.",

You can get deals on existing iPhones during the late summer as inventory is being cleared out. If you want the newest phone, it\u2019s best to wait until the fall when the phone finally comes out.
