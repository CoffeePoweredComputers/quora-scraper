            "answer_text": "It\u2019s like the difference between the restaurant owner (asset) and the head chef (property). The owner is concerned about overall financial position, growth, profit, and administrative overhead such as taxes, insurance and bank loans. The chef is in the chaos of day-to-day operations. Serving clients, dealing with complaints, getting customers in the door, maintaining the equipment/facility. I\u2019ve been both. Asset Management is the far easier workload.
