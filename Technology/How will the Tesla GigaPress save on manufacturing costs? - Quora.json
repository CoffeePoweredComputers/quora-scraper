            "answer_text": "It is essentially a huge die cast machine that makes a single piece very large precision aluminum component that replaces dozens of individual parts that need finish machining and welding/bolting together. Normally aluminum parts are either stamped from sheet metal or cast, then finish machined where they join and assembled into the larger part. This entails multiple machines, scrap metal and labor to make the part. This GigaPress does it in one step. It casts the part into one large die, and when still molten, clamps the liquid under extreme pressure to endure proper filling of the die. Then cools the part resulting in a complete single large part ready for further assembly. It would also have the bolt holes molded in eliminating drilling. Furthermore there is is zero waste material that normally would be trimmed or machined off multiple parts. The whole part is made faster and of higher quality than the bunch of individual parts and with very low labor content. It would also replace welding and attachment bolts that normally hold the individual parts together. Hence far cheaper. Tesla casts a new strategy for lightweight structures ",

            "answer_text": "I have read that these presses save costs in several ways. (1) Each large press replaces several smaller presses. (2) Using presses means less waste metal scrap. (3) They save energy. (4) Each press replaces numerous assembly robots. (5) The resulting vehicle is lighter, meaning that it has a longer range. (6) The resulting vehicle is safer. ",
