            "answer_text": "You can easily fall in love with the Oneplus x as it is one of the best budget phones of the year. This is the undoubtedly the best mobile phone one can get under 20k keeping in mind its brand value, hardware and its absolutely gorgeous looks. To anyone at first glance, it looks like at least a 50k phone. It has a nice slim design, with black glass both at the front and back. The metallic rim has lines engraved for superior grip and feel.   Key points about this phone are Brilliant performance with no lag whatsoever. Gaming is butter smooth. No complaints here.  As I have mentioned before, this phone looks costlier than it actually is. It's slim body gives it superior feel. And, surprisingly it is not heavy at all.  It's 1080p AMOLED screen is treat for the eyes. Color reproduction and pixel density is perfect for crisp sharp display with high color contrast.  I personally like the 5-inch phones because they are easy to handle and operate with one hand.  The quality of both front(8 MP) and back(12.4 MP) camera is quite remarkable with sharp images. Low-light images are somewhat grainy but not too bad for my liking.The camera app is stock android with in-built features of Time lapse, Slow-Mo video recording, Panorama etc.  Overall, despite its flaws and trade-offs, One Plus X is a solid phone. And at a price of Rs 16999, it is the best smart phone money can buy! That is \u2013 if you can get your hands on an invite. This time, however, invites are available in plenty, and more often than not, you can grab an invite with a little effort. In my opinion, no phone is perfect. And everything comes at a price. For me, I need great looks, a great performance, and decent battery life. Issues like lack of NFC, a 64bit processor, 5GHz WiFi band, a finger print scanner and fast charging doesn\u2019t matter to me, for I don\u2019t use any of these. And I like a minimalistic and aesthetic design, so I like One Plus X more than the One Plus One too. So, in my humble, personal opinion, I love the OPX. I think it is a great phone. Some of cons do not affect me, others I trust the company to fix soon. But,I diligently, mentioned all the pros and cons of the device, to the best of my abilities, now the choice is yours.  Hope this helps you guys :) ",
