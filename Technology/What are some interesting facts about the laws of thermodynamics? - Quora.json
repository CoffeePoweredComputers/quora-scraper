            "answer_text": "First law of thermodynamics; When energy passes, as work, as heat, or with matter, into or out from a system, the system's internal energy changes in accord with the law of conservation of energy. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the first kind(machines that produce work with no energy input) are impossible.Second law of thermodynamics: In a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems increases. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind(machines that spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work) are impossible.Third law of thermodynamics: The entropyof a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.[2] With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.In addition, there is conventionally added a \"zeroth law\", which defines thermal equilibrium: Zeroth law of thermodynamics: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law helps define the concept of temperature.There have been suggestions of additional laws, but none of them achieve the generality of the four accepted laws, and they are not mentioned in standard textbooks. [1] [2] [3] [4] [6] [7] The laws of thermodynamics are important fundamental laws in physics and they are applicable in other natural sciences. ",

            "answer_text": "The order of the thermodynamic laws They are not necessarily arranged chronologically, but the incremental advancement in physics favoured this way generally. Generally a smaller number means that the law is more fundamental. John Lo's answer to How do you arrange the order of the laws of thermodynamic? The entropy concept The concept of entropy originating from the second law of thermodynamics is widely applied to other disciplines, like chemistry, biology and information theory. John Lo's answer to What are the applications of the second law of thermodynamics in our daily lives? ",
