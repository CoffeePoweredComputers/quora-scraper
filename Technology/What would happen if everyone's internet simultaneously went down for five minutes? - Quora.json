The next day however, the web would explode with conspiracy theories and people discussing what mundane thing they went on doing while such a historic event went by in front of their noses. Some hacker kids could come out and brag that they did it, but who would believe them? Al Quaeda might claim responsibility too. Some engineers could lose their jobs over this. W3C might come up with some new protocol to ensure that this wouldn't happen again. ",

And TV will try to use this unpredictable miracle to convince their previous audience to come back and forget about online life. So the funny  question is what could they do in five minutes to convince us to do so. On the Web , I heard you have six seconds to convince or get people attention. So five minutes...it's the new eternity ;-) ",
