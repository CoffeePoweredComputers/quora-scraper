            "answer_text": "That depends, the original props on the very first film required huge batteries that meant the actors had to have wires running down their sleeves and robes, which is one reason they aren't moving around as much as they did in later films like Empire. In the prequels they used sticks with a special coating that wouild allow them to apply the lightsaber effectIl in post. In the most recent film they switched to something very similar to the high end prop dueling sabers that fans can buy, with actual lights in in the plastic blade. ",
