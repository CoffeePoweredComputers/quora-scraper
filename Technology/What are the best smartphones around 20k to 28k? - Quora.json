            "answer_text": "There are plenty of smartphones in this price range having top notch features and top of the line hardware. The first one in this list is far below 20k and I am placing it on the first place only because it\u2019s the best value for money phone from a well known and well established brand. I am not going into specs of each phone as you can easily get the specs from sites like gsmarena. So, here is the list lenovo Z2 plus (18k) 2. Xiomi Mi 5 (25k)  3. Xiaomi Mi Max prime (20k)  4. Moto Z Play (24k)  5. Asus Zenfone 3 (17k)  Its my personal choice but you can see the specs and choose according to you preferances. ",
