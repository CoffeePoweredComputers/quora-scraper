If you buy a Macbook Pro 13in 2018 now from Apple student site, for $1379 and you get a AirPod, for the machine itself, is about $1330. Only 10bucks more than your specs. I5\u20138257U/16GB Ram/256GB/brand new. i5\u20138257U is about 230% faster than i7\u20135557U. 2015model was a dual core when the 2019 edition is Quad-core. Actually MBP19 is faster than all models of 2015 Mac include the one was over 3000USD(i7\u20134980HQ) However, if you insist to get one, anyway, it is not my problem. Go for the cheapest one, you can change SSD yourself easily, 300USD can give you the fastest speed now/ Above ",
