            "answer_text": "Which do you use spelled or spelt? As a British person, I use both - which I use depends on my mood at the time and how it lies with the rest of what I am writing. The same with \u2018learned\u2019 and \u2018learnt\u2019, and \u2018burned\u2019 and \u2018burnt\u2019. The fact is that all of these forms are perfectly correct on both sides of the Atlantic with no difference in meaning. The suggestion in one answer that it has to do with whether it is used transitively or intransitively or in passive contexts is utter gibberish. Sometimes, if I am feeling mischievous I deliberately use \u201cspelt\u201d knowing that someone will come back to me with some supposedly clever quip about \u201cspelt\u201d being a type of grass - thus giving me an opportunity to reply and point out how ignorant they are \u2026..

Does that mean a different type of spelt the grain? It was spelled differently. OK, I use the Irish spelling and he the British spelling (amn\u2019t vs. aren\u2019t: Aren\u2019t I tired? vs. Amn\u2019t I tired?) I like to know whether we are discussing agriculture or English. ",
