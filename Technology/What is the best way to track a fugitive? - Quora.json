            "answer_text": "Question: What is the best way to track a fugitive? Depends upon the fugitive. Most people are terrible at hiding so they are relatively easy to catch. They go to places where they are known, and they continue to stay in contact with people from their former lives when it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to do so. They are essentially waiting to be caught. For the few who might have the skills and the cash (or the ability to obtain it) to remain hidden, (assuming that you re not in law enforcement) then: Using social media can help - If you put up a missing persons web page and them broadcast it around social media, you may get a number of false leads. However, you\u2019ll also get some legitimate hits and you\u2019ll need to check into them.Using television can help - There are a few missing persons syndicated series which might be convinced to air the person\u2019s photo and information. People who don\u2019t use social media, might watch television.Traveling to locations and putting up flyers can help - If you know where this person might be and you travel to there with flyers ready to post, you might uncover some clues.If they are foolish enough to keep their mobile device, if you can access their billing information, they can be tracked - You can see there called from (assuming that they didn\u2019t \u201cspoof\u201d the number and you can concentrate your search there.If you know the family or are a member, if there are letters and/or postcards, you can see where they are/were when they sent them - Concentrate your search on that area and roughly a 3-hour radius around it.If you know their sexual preferences, then it couldn\u2019t hurt to look at nightclubs and bars in areas where they might have gone to - If they are gay or bisexual, the number of bars that cater strictly to those patrons are actually diminishing. However, it might be difficult for a stranger to connect if he or she was new in the area. They may have to forego social media and travel to a bar or nightclub.If they work out a great deal, then they are going to use a gym somewhere - Vanity will usually win out over security consciousness and eventually they will have to go to a gym. If they use steroids, that will make it even easier to track them as they have to obtain them from somewhere.Laundromats - Even if the fugitive is able to obtain discreet housing, most such places don\u2019t have laundry facilities. Unless the fugitive can find a partner who is willing to do their laundry for them, then they are going to be going to a laundromat at least once a week.Fast food restaurants - Most fugitives aren\u2019t going to be smart enough to stockpile food or to find a companion to cook for them so they are going to go out to eat quite a bit. If you know their food preferences, you simply have to stake out certain fast food restaurants in an area where you believe them to be and wait.Wait patiently - This seems to be counter-intuitive, but it\u2019s not. Most felons will eventually screw up. if you can wait for that to occur, then they can become exponentially easier to find.Again..the above is for people who don\u2019t have access to law enforcement databases or tools. Those can shorten the length of searches and also quickly rid their searches of \u201cfalse positives,.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are several things investigators can do to track and capture a fugitive, but for starters, it is important to define a fugitive as an individual that has been identified in connection to a crime that fled to avoid due process. Today, it is very easy to track a fugitive, but it gets exponentially easier the more serious the charge/crime that the fugitive is running from because the investigators have more resources. For starters, a fugitive cannot flee and avoid detection in any vehicle that is registered to them because it will be captured on traffic surveillance cameras that record license plates with recognition software.Nor can they simply switch tags because any tags they steal are going to also be reported and tracked.They also cannot rent a vehicle or use public transportation that requires identification confirmation.They also cannot get a hotel or motel room for the same reasons.So they are going to need help from someone else that they more than likely know and would be willing to go through the hassle for them.And, yes, it\u2019s a hassle, because not only can they not work anywhere but they also cannot access any bank funds to carry their own weight.Everybody needs to sleep somewhere, and it won\u2019t be outside in the elements once winter arrives. So they are going to a close friend\u2019s house.Now it would be smarter if they just randomly showed up on their close friend's doorstep unexpectedly without notice from any sort of technology (like a phone call, an email, facebook, twitter, text message, etc.) but that would be rude and less likely to acquire trustworthy support. However, they can not show up on the doorstep unannounced of even their most loyal accomplice if they failed to stay in contact with them (over the years) and are not 100% sure where to find them.So the first thing investigators are going to search is your internet history (which is very easy for anyone, even without a warrant). You see the internet already tracks all internet activity associated with cross-database information including identified name, username, password, email, ip address, and cell phone confirmation log in numbers.This means the fugitive would have to remain completely off the grid and out of contact with anyone they know, without a job, without transportation, without a place to sleep, and without food or a place to cook food.Once they realize this they will be begging to be found just to get a decent meal, a place to sleep, a place to shower, and a clean set of clothes. i.e. they\u2019ll come to you.",
