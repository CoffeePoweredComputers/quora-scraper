            "answer_text": "Most TV\u2019s today are based on LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) Screens. LCD\u2019s are great at producing an image, but they do not emit any light. In order for them to display an image there must be a light source behind the LCD, a \u201cbacklight\u201d. The LCD then selectively blocks or allows light through to create the image. Backlights for many years were CCFL (cold-cathode fluorescent light), but now are typically LED\u2019s (Light Emitting Diodes). LED\u2019s can either be used \u201cedge-lit\u201d with several along the edge of the screen, or in an array with many LED\u2019s placed behind the LCD panel. ",
