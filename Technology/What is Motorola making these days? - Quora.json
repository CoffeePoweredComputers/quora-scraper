            "answer_text": "Short Answer; Motorola is two companies today:Motorola Mobility makes phonesMotorola Solutions makes communications equipment. TL:DR; Motorola was divided in to Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions in 2011. Motorola Mobility was purchased by Google in 2012, and then by Lenovo (minus its Advanced Technology division) in 2014. Motorola Mobility still operates as a division of Lenovo and actually absorbed Lenovo\u2019s own internal phone division. They still produce many phones including the Moto Z series to this day (the Z4 was released in 2019), as well as many more models of phone that are only available in Asia or developing markets. Motorola Solutions is generally seen as the true successor to the original Motorola company. Motorola Solutions manufactures communications and telecomunications equipment, inclduning two-way radios, Push-To-Talk (PTT) systems, and other equipment mostly aimed at commercial customers.

            "answer_text": "Since people only ask me about cell phones, Motorola is currently known for the Moto E, Moto G, and Moto Z lines of phones, with a smattering of other ones thrown in. They are known for having software pretty close to stock Android (very few changes to the Android phone software) I'm actually posting from a Motorola phone, but that is another conversation for another day.
