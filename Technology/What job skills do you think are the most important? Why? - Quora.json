            "answer_text": "The job skills are dependent on the different types of jobs that are there. Some jobs require Good Communication Skills.While some require Good Analytical Skills.Some jobs require Good Technical Skills as per the job-role that there is.IT and Software jobs require Good Coding Skills. Having said that the most important aspect of hiring has become skills and passion. Every employer expects their employees to be skilled in work or domain in which they are hiring. So it must be your primary target to acquire these professional skills so that you stand out ahead of others. Based on these one thing I can say for sure that if you acquire the professional and technical skills then, its a sure shot way to get you hired. So if you have the talent and skill you can show-case it by presenting a project actually done by you which can itself validate your learning and knowledge in a way which is way better than certificates. A lot of companies now prefer these over certificates as they give some task or assignment to test the actual skill of applicants. A lot of coding competitions are there from which companies hire on the basis of the performance. So certification is just a physical proof of doing it but actual skills are what will always be used to get through. There are so many options available online to start your learning. But if you are looking to start your career in this particular domain then I would say you can go for below mentioned platforms: e-books and books can be a good way to learn anything new but it would lack the interaction and learning experience.Youtube is also used by many to acquire new skills and learn new things. But the interaction is one-way and there would be no motivation to learn without any benefit.MOOCs like edWisor.com , Udacity , Udemy , etc but you should opt for one where you may learn new skills as well as practice as per industry standard and create something which may actually get one a job which is one thrive for.",
