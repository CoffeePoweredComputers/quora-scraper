            "answer_text": "That would depend on the technology. Let\u2019s discuss Nanotechnology for a moment. So what is nanotechnology? Nanotechnology is the branch of technology that deals with dimensions and tolerances of less than 100 nanometres, especially the manipulation of individual atoms and molecules. Samsung has used nanotechnology for years on their computer keyboards and in the drums of their washing machines for germ sterilisation purposes. What most people don\u2019t realise is that there are zero disposal policies both locally and internationally governing the use of nanotechnology. What does that mean? It means there are no checks and balances in place ensuring the recyclibility or disposal of this type of nanotechnology. So hypothetically speaking, if someone dumped one of these sterilisation products into a river, they would decimate certain bacterial organisms passing over them for centuries. Technology products brings with it the responsibility to safely use, recycle or dispose the product at the end of it\u2019s lifecycle. ",
