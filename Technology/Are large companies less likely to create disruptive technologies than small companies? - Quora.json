            "answer_text": "Large companies are less likely to create disruptive technologies than small companies. There are following reasons for the same - Its very tough for them to get out of the sight of their customers and focus on niche set of customer for their different needs. They are earning significant profits by offering current products and services to their current customers, hence any innovation they think is essentially around the needs of their current customers. Even if large companies try to set up a team to work in startup mode to create disruptive technologies, their current organisational structure and culture becomes a bottleneck for the team members to work effectively. There are policies, regulations, hierarchies which slows down pace of the team.",

            "answer_text": "A disruptive innovation is an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market leaders and alliances. The term was defined and phenomenon analyzed by Clayton M. Christensen beginning in 1995. More recent sources also include \"signi\ufb01cant societal impact\" as an aspect of disruptive innovation. Not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the automobile was not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in 1908. The mass-produced automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not. Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders. The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruption when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations. A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations, but once it is deployed in the market, it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets.
