            "answer_text": "Technology has impacted almost every aspect of life today, and education is no exception. Yes, it is. In some ways, education seems much the same as it has been for many years. A 14th century illustration I would rather say it as a painting to be more precise by Laurentius de Voltolina depicts a university lecture in medieval Italy. The scene is easily recognizable because of its parallels to the modern day. The teacher lectures from a podium at the front of the room while the students sit in rows and listen. Some of the students have books open in front of them and appear to be following along. A few look bored. Some are talking to their neighbors. One appears to be sleeping. Classrooms today do not look much different, though you might find modern students looking at their laptops, tablets, or smart phones instead of books some may even chat in social media and swipe through face-book. A cynic person would say that technology has done nothing to change education. However, in many ways, technology has profoundly changed education. For one, technology has greatly expanded access to education. In medieval times, books were rare and only an elite few had access to educational opportunities. Individuals had to travel to centers of learning to get education. Today, massive amounts of information through books, audio, images, videos are available at one\u2019s fingertips through the Internet, and opportunities for formal learning are available online worldwide through the LMS\u2019s , MOOCs, podcasts, traditional online degree programs, and more. Access to learning opportunities today is impeccable in scope ,thanks to technology. Today, technology enables forms of communication and collaboration undreamt of in the past. Students in a classroom in the rural INDIA., for example, can learn about the Arctic by following the expedition of a team of scientists in the region, read scientists\u2019 blog posting, view photos, e-mail questions to the scientists, and even talk live with the scientists via a videoconference. Students can share what they are learning with students in other classrooms in other states who are tracking the same expedition. Students can collaborate on group projects using technology-based tools such as wikis and Google docs. The walls of the classrooms are no longer a barrier as technology enables new ways of learning, communicating, and working collaboratively. The role of the teacher as the \u201csage on the stage\u201d has been in education for a long time, and it is still very much in evidence today. However, because of the access to information and educational opportunity that technology has enabled, in many classrooms today we see the teacher\u2019s role shifting to the \u201cguide on the side\u201d as students take more responsibility for their own learning using technology to gather relevant information. The global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered new ways of conducting the teaching-learning process online. This is a completely new way of education. Most nations have already initiated e-learning in their schools. Many schools in India have also adapted to the new normal of e-learning with varying degrees of success. Many progressive schools had already done a lot for the adoption of technology in their schools, which helped in quickly transitioning to a completely online delivery of teaching during the current crisis and with significant success. A recent survey conducted by a NON GOVERMENTAL ORGANISATION showed that more than 92% of students and parents were happy with the online delivery of lessons. UNESCO initiated the modern MOOC movement seven years before and now it has reached 110 million learners . In 2019, providers launched over 2,500 courses, 11 online degrees, and 170 micro credentials. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A PUBLIC INTEREST TO MY DISCUSSION. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), \u201cthe world is facing a re-skilling emergency.\u201d WEF estimates that \u201cby 2022, over 40 percent of core skills required to perform existing jobs are expected to change\u201d, and that by 2030, \u201dmore than 1 billion people will need to be re-skilled\u201d into the transformed jobs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The economic effects of COVID-19 have accelerated and intensified this gap even more. Entire sectors are racing to interface, re-skill, and re-vector people and businesses, and it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to address this. SO I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE THAT MAKE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND RESKILL YOURSELF FOR THE MERE FUTURE AND BE WELL PREPARED FOR THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. Thanks for reading.
