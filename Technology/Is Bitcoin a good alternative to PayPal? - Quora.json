            "answer_text": "I don't claim to be an expert but in my spare time I have read about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great alternative for the following reasons:1. Security - Bitcoin's core is cryptography. The payment method has no databases or accounts that can be hacked.  2. Merchants - Services like Bit-Pay make accepting Bitcoin's rather easy as it allows for funds to be exchanged for domestic currency so exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal.  On top of that, as Bitcoin is essentially a form of digital cash there is no way, as with traditional bank accounts/Paypal etc, that funds can be frozen and payments can be blocked. Thus reducing the chance of fraud to practically 0.  However, it is isn't all good news: 1. Security - Bitcoin places the responsibility for security mainly in the hands of the user which can be dangerous for those who aren't quite sure what they're doing. However, there are no encrypted wallets that help protect the average user. 2. Usability - The need to exchange the user's currency into Bitcoin creates an arduous first step. Secondly, although the use of Bitcoin is growing it is still not widely accepted and there are many (false) connotations that have created a drab image for the average user, i.e. Bitcoins = drug money.  Furthermore, companies such as Paypal, SumUp and Payza have had some time to perfect their user interface.  Overall, Bitcoin is by-far the better of the two. The core of the product is security, the lack of a centralised authority controlling the flow of Bitcoin ensures fees and charges are absolutely minute, the removal of chargebacks and freezing funds is a huge advantage for merchants as you only have to read some of the stories where companies have been crippled by chargebacks or frozen accounts.  Last but not least, anonymity. Most services like Paypal are directly connected to your bank account and payments through such services are no where near anonymous. Although this isn't a huge point for merchant or sellers, it's poignant considering the Snoopers Charter (UK) and the NSA (USA), that although a history of every Bitcoin transaction ever made is available on their site, transactions are not tied to a bank account or an individual and transactions are essentially anonymous if some basic precautions are taken.

            "answer_text": "Bitcoin, of course. Now there will be a small correction, after such a rise - this is a common phenomenon, do not worry. In any case, a positive trend will be continious - I mean, the rise of the entire market and prices in general. But this will happen gradually, step-by-step, but with small back bounces as well. In any case, even the fact that there is a correction is already a positive signal for the market. After all, before there was only a serious increase, followed by a no less serious fall. Now, after an increase, there is a small pullback, but at the same time, the overall positive dynamics is still here. It is a symbol of a healthy market. And these are some other symbols: 1. Large corporations start using crypto. An example can be is Facebook and its project Libra. Or Telegram and its Gram project. A bunch of banks creating their own coins and blockchains. Corporations like Amazon, which use blockchain in their internal relationships. 2. Altcoins have awaked already and become stronger. An example is SilentNotary and their project Ubikiri. 3. Good attitude of the whole states. Recently, China recognized Bitcoin as a good investment opportunity. Some states in the US are already using the blockchain to manage government processes. ",
