            "answer_text": "I think the best answer is that the best camera drones cost a lot and it\u2019s best for beginners to learn with less expensive drones since crashing is very likely and it\u2019s better to crash a $100 drone than a $1000 drone. A DJI/Ryze Tello is very stable, has a Mode 2 controller, and is small enough to fly indoors until you\u2019ve mastered flying it. Fly it enough indoors until you can do figure eights reliably, and fly it around your head without spazzing out and pushing the sticks the wrong way when the drone\u2019s headed at you. Get the controller! Flying from the app on your phone just isn\u2019t the same and it\u2019s impossible to be as precise with spots on a screen as sticks on a controller. Avoid using any of the autonomous or intelligent features and learn to fly the drone and land it in Mode 2 without depending on the app. When things go wrong in the field you\u2019ll need skills with the control sticks. I suggest indoor flying with a light drone to learn. You can practice plenty flying through doors and furniture, set up increasingly difficult courses through your rooms. A Tello is also heavy enough to fly outside in a little breeze, and light enough, less than .55 pounds, so it doesn\u2019t smash up your belongings or need to be registered with the FAA. When you\u2019ve got the skills it\u2019s time to get the best camera drones you can afford. You\u2019ll need to register with the FAA, FAADroneZone, and comply with safety regulations as a hobby or recreational pilot to fly legally off your property. When you\u2019re ready to sell your stuff get a commercial certificate. I believe DJI builds the best and does a good job with their Care plans when you crash. A Mavic Air does pretty good for $500+ but it can\u2019t get as steady 4K video or fly as far away as a Mavic Pro for $900+. The Mavic 2 series, $1500+ is even better if you can afford $1500. I love my DJI Inspires, just got a new one for $1175, they\u2019re heavy and dead stable, have retractable gear and gimbal can rotate 360 degrees, can map an 80 acre site off one battery, and are the most badass looking and sounding drones on the market. I\u2019ll fly a Mavic Pro under trees and close to a roof in a wooded lot, but won\u2019t go there with the Inspire. DJI, with 70% of the market also has a lot of 3rd party software available at reasonable rates. Powerful Drone & UAV Mapping Software | DroneDeploy has excellent mapping and 3D modelling apps. Litchi for DJI Mavic / Phantom / Inspire / Spark has really good mission planning software for making videos. Parrot Bebop 2s are OK but bob and weave a bit, IMHO, and don\u2019t get steady video. They are cheap and good value for some people. I\u2019d like to get a Parrot Anafi and try it, just haven\u2019t yet. Yuneec Typhoon Hs are excellent for wide open areas over trees, aren\u2019t good for close in work, but have a really good but cheap 1 inch sensor, and they have a relatively inexpensive thermal camera available. There are _lots_ of competitors out there I haven\u2019t tried, but I\u2019m brand-loyal to DJI and Yuneec Typhoon H and can\u2019t recommend any\u2026 ",
