            "answer_text": "When I saw your question, I went, \u201cPyGame has buttons!?\u201d And \u2026 it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t implement buttons using PyGame which I have done many times. I\u2019m often tempted to answer programming questions of the form \u201cHow do I do X \u2026\u201d by saying, \u201cYeah. Do that.\u201d This is basically my answer. If you have implemented a button in PyGame, that means you\u2019ve drawn some visual, and designated some area around that as a hot zone where a mouse click in that area means you have activated the button. If you want to move it, move where you did the draw and where the hot zone is. When I do this, I always give the button a position and draw the button imagery and set the hot zone relative to that position, so for me, moving a button is as simple as updating the position and invoking a redraw. For you maybe it\u2019s different? Since I don\u2019t know how you implemented your button, I can\u2019t say more. ",
