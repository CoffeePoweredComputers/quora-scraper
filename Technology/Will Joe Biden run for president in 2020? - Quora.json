            "answer_text": "I think Joe Biden will win the 2020 election, but it is still not guaranteed. There is only 16 days left until election day, and Biden has been able to maintain such a consistent lead over Trump. In 2016, Trump had the advantage of being the outsider and was trying to convince the voters that he was the lesser of two evils. There was a lot of hatred towards Hillary Clinton, and she had a high unfavorable rating. Now Joe Biden also has a more unfavorable rating, but not nearly as unfavorable as Clinton ever was. There are people out there that don\u2019t like Joe Biden because of his policies, but there isn\u2019t that hatred towards Biden like Clinton had. After the 2016 election, the exit polling showed that Trump won the lesser of two evils, and the last minute voters by big margins. Trump won\u2019t have that advantage this time around. I believe Trump hurt his own chances over the last couple of weeks. When Trump tested positive for COVID-19, he missed a chance to gain some votes. After Trump was cleared by the doctors, and tested negative for the virus, he could have changed his view on the virus. He could have said something like please start to wear a mask and social distance because the virus is not good at all. But no, he said on Twitter that nobody should be afraid of the virus at all, and it is not a threat at all. Well he just pissed off a ton of people who had lost family members to the virus, or people who have had long term effects after having the virus themselves. He still doesn\u2019t take the virus seriously. The elderly voters aren\u2019t pleased by Trump\u2019s response and he needs their vote to win the election. Another factor that could help Biden is that Democratic voters aren\u2019t so apathetic this time around. Many Democratic voters chose to not vote, or vote third party in 2016 because the media was telling them that Trump had no chance of winning. And the polls were showing Clinton had the lead in key swing states. This time around, those apathetic voters aren\u2019t so apathetic this time and are going to the polls in full force. Many Democrats don\u2019t trust the polls even if it shows Biden with a lead. Trump has the advantage of high enthusiasm among his supporters compared to Biden, but there is also a huge anti-Trump vote. It\u2019s going to be an interesting race. Trump still has about a 14 percent chance to win according to FiveThirtyEight election forecast. Those odds aren't good, but he still has a chance. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably, but...okay, let me open by saying I LIKE Joe Biden. As a neighbour or drinking buddy, he\u2019d be fine \u2013 but as a PRESIDENT? NO. Of late, his touchy-feely ways with the ladies have drawn ire from the #metoo and #timesup movements. However, his unsuitability as POTUS stretches beyond that. First comes the fact that while Barry O was ALPHA \u2013 he is decidedly BETA. A perfect example is the Osama Bin Liner hit: Joe advised Barry to hold back until the intel improved, but despite the fact that Seal Team Six (there ARE no one-through-five) had made a DEBACLE of Operation Eagle Claw, costing Jimmy Carter his second term \u2013 Barry WENT for it and WON his second. Also, Veeps are famous for only being there to make POTUS look good. Think Pence, Quayle, Agnew \u2013 idiots all. But the main problem I have with Biden is his AGE. Right now, he\u2019s seventy-six. If he won, he\u2019d be seventy-EIGHT when he began his first term \u2013 and EIGHTY-SIX when/if he finished his second. Old geezers do NOT make good leaders. Think Mugabe, Reagan, Bolkiah \u2013 fine when they started, but SENILE by the end. And after four disastrous years of Trump, America will need someone with youth and vigour to rebuild her. Biden is NOT that person. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see an Electoral College landslide for either candidate. It will be won by 1 or 2 states. I think it is certain that Biden will have a landslide win in popular votes. Probably more than the 2.8 million Hillary got in 2016 but we don\u2019t elect presidents by popular vote. At this point in time, Oct 22nd, I am leaning on a prediction that Biden will win but as I said, it is by no means certain. Trump won, in 2016, by an exceedingly narrow vote in three states. I don\u2019t see any evidence that Trump has increased his popularity during this first term. He does have a solid base of support but I don\u2019t see anything to indicate that he has gained more support.Biden is not Clinton. I don\u2019t think anyone hates Biden. What conservatives seem to hate is the progressive wing of the Democratic party. The question is can hating a wing of the opposing party turn the election against the Democrats? Maybe . . .Both sides are pretty enthusiastic. The right strongly supporting Trump and voting against the progressive wing of the Democratic party. The left strongly voting against Trump and moderately supporting Biden. Moderate support might not sound like much but I am very impressed at the public restraint the progressive wing of the Democratic party has exhibited throughout this campaign. That restraint is a form of enthusiasm.Corona virus and the economy - There is no denying that the effects of the epidemic loom large in the present day largely against Trump. However you want to view the events of this year, it is happening on Trump\u2019s watch. This being so unusual it is hard to say how the events of the response to the epidemic and the resulting economic downfall will play out. While Trump supporters like Trump\u2019s handling of the economy pre-Covid that was a long time ago (politically speaking). This being a close election, what happened 10 months ago may not be as influential as the present.",

            "answer_text": "Historian Allan Lichtman has written a book The Keys to The White House. The book gives a prediction system for the presidential election. Based on the premise that a pragmatic public uses the presidential election system as a rating of the incumbent president, the system has accurately predicted all but one election since 1984. Asking thirteen basic questions to gauge the election, if six or more questions are false then the challenging candidate is predicted to win the election. In 2016, Lichtman\u2019s system predicted Donald Trump. This was obviously against many polls at the time. But guess who is the predicted 2020 candidate? It has switched to the Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Why have the predictors now waged against the incumbent? Lichtman analyzes that it is because of the numerous disasters of 2020, which has led to three more key questions turning false about the current state of the nation.  Licthman\u2019s prediction, based upon this consistent and proven analytical system, is at the very least a profound testament to the unsettling times. No system is 100% foolproof(the Keys system has been criticized by some and did incorrectly predict the 2000 election), so it could end up that the election knocks holes into the theory. I really am not sure either way as to what exactly will happen. It is reassuring that there is a record turnout for early voters. Meanwhile, other polls show Biden has the lead in the national polls as well as states like Pennsylvania. However, all of the polls, plus Licthman\u2019s system, seem to be indicators of who might be more likely to win and not who will probably win. One thing for sure is that if the incumbent does win his White House reelection bid then it will certainly be time for the experts and pollsters to revise their theories and systems. ",

            "answer_text": "Joe Biden will win handily, primary due to the ineptitude of Mr. Trump. Let us not forget that while running for office, 18 Trump associates had contacts with Russian operatives on at least 150 different occasions. Many of them lied about it and Trump went out of his way to obstruct any investigation into those contacts. When confronted with the choice between the US intelligence community and Putin, Trump chose Putin. Kim Jung Un manipulated Trump into stopping US naval exercises in the vicinity of North Korea, all the while not offering any concessions in return. He has so fractured America\u2019s relationships with our allies that it may take a decade or more to recover. Several times over, world leaders have been filmed laughing at or making fun of Trump. Plenty of funny stories of them manipulating him at world conferences. Like the time the President of France tricked Trump into meeting with a representative of Iran. Then Trump got caught in an attempt to extort the president of the Ukraine. It was all part of a Russian hatched narrative. Something about it not being Russia that interfered into the 2016 election on behalf of Trump but instead it was the Ukrainians who interfered on behalf of Clinton. They even wove Hillary\u2019s emails into it. Trump tried to get the President of the Ukraine to make public statements incriminating Joe Biden. For this, Mr. Trump was impeached. Although he was clearly guilty, Senate Republicans refused to do anything about it. Joe Biden is going to win in large part because he is a reasonable alternative to Trump. At some point the monied interests in America, the captains of commerce, industry and finance got together and decided Trump had to go. The harm he was doing to the country was just too great. Biden was chosen because they didn\u2019t want Bernie Sanders, who is too radical for them. This election cycle all of the money and creative talent has sided with the Democrats. Those who would normally be creating attack ads against Democrats are now creating attack ads against Republicans. The Republicans are stuck using the B team. Not only will Biden handily win, the Democratic majority in the House will expand and the Senate will be taken away from the Republicans. ",

But Hillary Clinton is a good reason why I do not believe Joe Biden will win the 2020 Presidential election. Let\u2019s load up the way-back machine and remember why Hillary Clinton won the 2016 DNC nomination. Yes, a lot of people say the nomination was rigged, but if you pay close attention you\u2019ll see that Hillary was organized and focused, with a clear message for voters. She started fast in her campaign and grabbed the lead. Sanders had his moments but was never the front-runner. But once the general election campaign started, things changed. Trump pounded Clinton at every opportunity, and seemed to be limitless in energy. Clinton began to show the strain of the long days and endless travel. She began to cancel appearances and twice appeared to collapse in public. The last week of the campaign, Clinton took most of two days off, at the same time that Trump was visiting over a dozen states. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin may both have been decided by that finish. Joe Biden is well-funded and has great name recognition, but he starts in a weaker position for 2020 than Clinton was for 2016. Add the fact the Democrats are the challenger party against an incumbent running for re-election, and Biden\u2019s age becomes a danger factor. Biden is not built for a long campaign, and given the number of opponents he has to beat out to claim the DNC nomination, he will be spent long before the end of October. ",

I\u2019m not a huge fan of Biden\u2019s politics. I will be supporting Sanders if he runs. However, Biden is one of the more electable democrats(though Sander\u2019s approval ratings are higher). I think there are two issues in Biden\u2019s case: a) he needs a very detailed independent medical examination. That should be done in any case, but his age makes that more essential(as it would in sanders\u2019 case also). b) He needs a running mate that is younger, highly competent and ready to be a more active VP. Cory Booker or Andrew Yang for President - Humanity First might fill that role if either can prove themselves on the campaign trail. This person needs to be a very strong campaigner, and someone that can clearly step in if Biden has health issues. If the polls and prediction markets hold up, I think Biden will run. However, I think part of the motivation may be to prevent big money from appointing a candidate less electable than Sanders. I think Biden wants to become POTUS. However, I think he wants to see Democrats win in 2020 more. I doubt Biden will pander to the more negative elements of the DNC. If Biden thinks he is less likely to win than Sanders, I think he may bow out. A Biden/Sanders contest will be one of electability and ideas. I think Biden believes in his ideas. I think he is wrong on a many points, but I do not doubt his sincerity. I also think it will be a clean contest, within the rules that now exist. I think if Biden does win the nomination, he might let Sanders have a big voice in choosing the VP/Cabinet, to unify the part. ",

They say Trump devides the country, well unless youre living in denial America has been divided way before him, which is why a young kid like Trayvon Martin can get murdered by a racist person because he looks like he did not belong to that neihgborhood, as a black person i would rather die instead of voting for Joe Biden, it would be me signing up my kids for slavery, the black community dont see it like i see it thats why we are still living like slaves, shot down like dogs by white cops and those politicians stood there and watch as we march and beg for equality, may Biden rest in peace he is an old white racist person who sees things the same way from the world he came from ",

Trump has voter enthusiasm to a level not seen in a Republican incumbent since Reagan. While his white, non college demo is lower than it was in \u201816, his Hispanic and African American support is greater than any Republican in a generation. His support among white gay males is near 45%. I think if you add those up along with the lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden and the fact that a good majority of Dems are afraid to stand in line to vote, add up to a Trump victory. I should qualify that I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll win the Hispanic or AA vote, but I think he\u2019ll take a larger percentage than any Republican in a generation. That will hurt the Dems. ",

Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump\u2014regardless of what you think of each of them personally, I feel each one of them is too old for the position. It\u2019s too easy for someone in their 60\u2019s to quickly go downhill from dementia or some other aging issue. And our current President shows how poorly we are set up to confront issues around the temperament and mental capability of the President. Additionally, all you need to do is to look at how the position aged George W. Bush and Barack Obama (both young men, both VERY physically fit, strong marriages, good kids, great support systems). You truly need someone who\u2019s willing to put in 16 hour days 7 days a week and has the physical and mental strength to still portray a positive and \u201ccan do\u201d outlook to the nation. Right now we\u2019ve got a President who usually is \u201cin the office\u201d from 10am-4pm, and spends 1/3rd of his first two years at Trump properties (where yeah, some work gets done but let\u2019s be honest\u2014he\u2019s eating and playing golf and watching TV\u2026he\u2019s not reading briefing papers or chairing 3 hour discussions about urban planning or mass transit or infrastructure policy).

Trump will win in an electoral landslide based on the substance of his accomplishments (which his supporters like) not the style of his way of dealing with the constant vilification the left media throws at him. Think of the vote this way: Do you support: Deregulation and economic growth? Tax Reform and repatriation of jobs to America? Border control and high employment of American underclass and working class citizens? Trade Treaty renegotiation ending things like China, Japan and S Korea charging the US 25% tariffs and the US charging them a tenth of that at 2.5% tariffs? Ending the endless wars? Energy independence and much lower energy costs? Negotiating peace treaties Between Israel and the UAE & Bahrain or Kosovo and Serbs that the establishment could not do in the last 30 years? Rebuilding our military and bringing our troops home so that we can strengthen to deter the real threat to our liberty long term - the new AXIS powers of China, Russia and Iran allied to control Eurasia? If your answer is YES - Vote for Trump If your answer is NO - vote for Biden But vote on substance not style or media manipulation (especially when you realize the media is owned by the multinationals and billionaires who support the Democrat and RINO party and do not have your interests at heart.

            "answer_text": "Normally I would say no given his age and that he chose not to run last time , however I think watching Trump is something that forces Biden to at least put his hat in the ring in case the democratic party tries to go with another candidate like Clinton. The real thing is which wing of the party is strongest in the primary, usually you have 2 or 3 serious candidates but they do not all come from the same political ilk: Expect Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Jerry Brown to come from the populist side. Both are on the liberal end of the Democratic section. I could see Sanders stepping aside for the younger more energetic Warren if she wants to push the progressive movement harder. Joe Biden would be more centrist for the party and Jerry Brown is talking about moving California\u2019s primary up in the order and that could get interesting. He\u2019s not really a populist but on the left side in terms of social issues. Corey Booker also is on the center line here policy wise and its really a question of when not if he\u2019s going to declare. Tammy Duckworth if she wants to run could be extremely political if the democratic base is energized enough to get conservative democrats to the primaries. She\u2019s one a dark red house district before, she could get race baited by some into believing shes foreign but as a disabled vet she\u2019d be hard to take on directly. Chris Murphy could also come from this direction. It\u2019s hard to see the democratic coalition fielding more than 3 viable candidates after the first 5 or 6 primaries though. So If Biden wants to go that direction he\u2019s got to worry more about Jerry Brown and Corey Booker than Trump at first. ",

Yes, former Vice President Biden is making a run for President, just as he did unsuccessfully two times previously (1988 and 2008). In his defense, it is often said that he \u201cwithdrew\u201d in 1988, but he did lost to Obama in 2008\u2014-and ended up on the ticket as Vice President, which he was from 2008 through 2016. Prior to that, going all the way back to 1972, Joe Biden served in the Senate. He ran numerous times and, aside from the 2 presidential races mentioned in this paragraph, has won every time. His chief rival, Bernie Sanders, also began serving in various capacities in 1972. However, in his runs for office he lost six (6) times, two times when involved in a run to become Governor of the state of Vermont. ",

CNN focus group rejects Biden If Biden joins the race he will come out ahead and get the media behind him\u2026 then he will open his mouth with some of the comments that those who watch out have seen, things like telling Millennials to give him a break and that the rich are patriotic. Just poor taste comments that will turn off voters. I imagine he would split the vote away from the other establishment favorites like Harris and Booker, he would shine brightly early then like a falling star fade away before the first primary. So do I think he will enter the race\u2026 probably, he has some serious backers. But in the end I don't think he will last and will just serve to break up the establishment donor base which will serve someone like Sanders very well. I'd also add that Biden's tough on crime stance regarding the 1994 Crime Bill had him proudly saying on the Senate floor that the papers were saying Biden wanted the death penalty for everything except jaywalking so good luck in Florida where 1.5 million ex-felons just got their voting rights restored.

            "answer_text": "Q: Do you think Joe Biden will win the 2020 election and why do you think so? A: If Biden manages to win the Democratic primary to become the party\u2019s nominee, then yes, I think he\u2019ll win in the general election. But my guess is that Biden will not win the nomination. I think there are better candidates, but currently they are buried in a pack of way too many contenders for the voters to have made much sense of it yet. I\u2019m guessing that after a few debates, a bunch of candidates that have still failed to gain any traction will exit the race, and we\u2019ll finally have a chance to really focus on a few serious contenders. And then I think there\u2019s a good chance that at that point someone else - Harris, perhaps, or Warren, or Booker - someone - will start to look like a much better choice to Democratic primary voters than good ol\u2019 Uncle Joe. But if indeed Biden emerges as the nominee, all signs seem to point to him having the edge over Trump in the general election. Current polling certainly suggests that outcome. But in addition, I don\u2019t see in Trump any ability, or even inclination, to expand his support beyond his current fervently loyal but not-big-enough base. Also, I don\u2019t think the next 17 months are going to go well for Trump. Court decisions will be gradually removing his ability to hide documents or block testimony from Congressional investigations. Before the election, I expect a lot of embarrassing revelations to become public knowledge. And there\u2019s also the investigations from the Southern District of New York into matters like Trump\u2019s bogus charity, his company\u2019s fraudulent under-reporting of income and assets for tax purposes and over-reporting of same for securing loans, and various misdeeds of his campaign and his inauguration teams. I won\u2019t be a bit surprised to see a downturn in the economy come about before the election to further nail the coffin closed on Trump\u2019s reelection aspirations. Of course, it\u2019s still very early. Anything could happen. Trump could win. But I suspect he will lose - and I think he may even lose in a landslide. ",

If Hillary ( very doubtful), or Bernie Sanders run, and are the front runner,,Biden will run. Neither is electable, especially Hillary. Now,,if a new young face joins the race on the Democratic side, and they are doing very well in the polls. Joe will not run. So, I don't think age will factor his decision. The political climate, and who the Democratic nominee is will influence Joe Biden's decision more than anything else. If Joe decides to run, I really hope he picks a woman VP candidate.

In all seriousness, though: he\u2019s got the charisma, the experience, the support, the gravitas, and the ability to serve as an effective President. Remember: Obama picked this guy as the man to pick up the Presidency if anything happened to him, and served faithfully and well in that office for eight years.

Lincoln is turning in grave with how far his party had fallen. Violent Crime at a 30 year high. Citizens being murdered by the police in their beds. The world closer to a world war. Hundreds of thousands of citizens dead from a lack of coordinated response. The largest stock market bubble in history coupled with the worst economy since the great depression.

The consequences were a disaster for America, but billionaires did quite well, thank you. It\u2019s not like the election of an unpopular president has never before been supported by the highest court in the land. The Supreme Court will make sure any appeals by Trump are heard and ruled on in his favor. The coming 2020 election is pointless.

He will be 77 in 2020. It seems incredibly unlikely that he would run based just on his age. Additionally, he has campaigned twice for the nomination in the past and never gotten it. The same is true for Sanders and Clinton, who are 75 and 69 respectively and would have beaten or tied the previous record of 69. Their political prospects decrease as they age, leaving aside the overall perception of them as \u201closers.\u201d Incidentally, that Record for Oldest President was previously held by Ronald Reagan. It was in fact beaten by Donald Trump, who is 70. Yes, no matter who won they would have beaten or tied the record for oldest president ever. ",

Biden\u2019s biggest problem is that he tends to speak before he thinks and, quite frankly, he has not mastered the art of productive and effective speech-making.
