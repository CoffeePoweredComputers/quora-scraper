            "answer_text": "As the first poster (Chris Allen) noted, a pervasive problem in today\u2019s world could be solved within just a few years with technology we currently have but aren\u2019t using because of legislatures. But his solution (autonomous vehicles) actually can do far more than just solve traffic. If all new vehicles were autonomous, the following effects would start to ripple across whatever nation implements the requirement: Basic Traffic congestion would ease slightly; Traffic congestion resulting from accidents would decline (as autonomous vehicle ownership rises) over time to nearly nothing, eliminating nearly half of all major traffic congestion incidences (the other half usually being due to storm damage or road work); Road Rage and the frustration of Traffic Congestion would drop tremendously as drivers would be free to text, email, watch videos, and play games will going to their destination; insurance rates would drop (with fewer major accidents, injuries, and deaths); more people would be able to advance in society as the barriers to vehicle ownership would drop (a lot of people could own single or double occupant vehicles, if not for the insurance costs); Driving while intoxicated or under the influence would disappear amongst individuals with autonomous vehicles (Because they aren\u2019t driving and the vehicle performs the same whether you are drunk or not); the incredible number of injuries and deaths that occur each year due to DUIs would dwindle as autonomous vehicle ownership rises; tourist businesses would see profits rise (Parents will be more willing to do \u201cday trips\u201d to tourist locations when they can into the car at 3 am, sleep until they arrive at DisneyWorld at 8 am, then sleep while heading home at 12 am. 10 hours of driving is daunting and dangerous when surrounding a 16 hour day of fun); Taxis will stop being an entry level job as they will become completely autonomous; Long-Haul Truck Driving (aka Semis) will stop being a career (as autonomous vehicles can do it safer and for longer hours) in exchange for Truck Nannies (entry level jobs where someone just sits in the cab and entertains themselves until an accident happens or the vehicle needs to be refueled) which will then be replaced by Full-service Truck Stops every 2 to 4 hours where the attendants refuel autonomous vehicles and verify that everything is in order (with a small side-business of retrieving and fixing vehicles that have broken down); no real change in employment opportunities for automotive mechanics, but increased employment opportunities for autonomous systems repair; and The Elderly and the Disabled will been able to increase their independence as they will no longer be reliant on other people for transportation whether for a job, basic shopping, or amusement. I am sure that I have missed somethings, but I think that is a good start. As to another current issues that could be resolved with up-and-coming technology, Exoskeletons for the disabled and elderly. ",

            "answer_text": "There is th problem of high HA Inection rates. 99,000 Americans Die of Healthcare-Aquired Infections Every Year https://www.healthline.com/.../aging-healthca... There is my hypothesis-theory that the cause is fecal dust* I, it is so sad to say it, realized that Health Institutes are unwilling (why?) to give any answers to the questions: 1. Is there FECAL DUST* in hospital wards? 2. Could it be hazardous for patients? Those ansers, if positive, , inevitably would lead to new technologies and to implementing measures, in order to reduce high HAI rates and UTI. *FECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left after wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air it travels to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a 4-6 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density in the wards is a one more factor that increases their chance of developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust\u2019s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative. That means that nobody had done any relative research work.
