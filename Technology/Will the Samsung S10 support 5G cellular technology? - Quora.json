            "answer_text": "No, I have no clue why the other guy said \u201cyes\u201d The galaxy S10 is not only available in 5G. The standard versions of the S10 don\u2019t have 5G. You can get them in either 128gb or 512gb I do Believe. Another difference with the 5G is that it is only available with 12gb of ram and a ceramic back. The s10 can also have these options I do believe (atleast the s10+) without 5G. So you have a lot of options. But to answer the question No the Galaxy S10 is not only available in 5G, there are standard versions of the phone (not as many people will buy the 5g ones bc of price) ",

            "answer_text": "The Samsung s10 does support 5G if you bought the specific model. There are ways to find out which one you have though. The s10 5G has 4 rear cameras, charges at 25w, has two front cameras which are housed in a larger pill module than the s10+ and has a 6.7 inch screen. If it isn't the 5G version though, it can't support the network. ",
