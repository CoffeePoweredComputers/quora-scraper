            "answer_text": "A few years back, I was extremely confused on which freelancing website is best for me to start my career.  I researched and learned about a cornucopia of websites with their pros and cons. Fast forward a few years, now I have a substantial client-base. So it all started with the research. I strongly believe useful information should be freely shared, so here are 15 websites (with a bonus site) that I personally believe will be a game changer for you: 1. Fiverr  Having a presence on multiple freelancing sites gives you the most exposure. Yes, many designers are offering their services on Fiverr, often cheaper and of questionable quality, but don\u2019t let this discourage you. If you can create your own niche and specialization as a freelancer on Fiverr, it can be a reliable way to find new projects and earn additional revenue. Some people may dismiss Fiverr, but it can be one of the best freelance websites if you\u2019re willing to do the hard work it takes to be successful. 2. Upwork  Upwork may be one of the best freelance websites for finding work no matter what type of freelancer you are. Those in web development, graphic design, and even freelance writing will find that Upwork has much to offer. The seemingly unending feed of job postings is continually updated. From small businesses to huge corporations, many different types of companies are looking to hire freelance designers through Upwork. Upwork has a bit of a learning curve when you first get up and running. You have to learn the artistry to writing effective proposals, and you may have to bid below your pay rate to build up your feedback rating. Many freelance jobs are posted on Upwork, but there\u2019s a hungry audience competing for them. Unless you\u2019re an Upwork superstar, bidding on a project that already has 30 proposals usually isn\u2019t worth it. That being said, some freelance designers secure plenty of work on Upwork and score project after project. Upwork can be worth the time \u2014 it offers the potential for great returns once you\u2019ve established yourself on the platform. 3. Toptal  Toptal pitches themselves as a place to find the top 3% of freelance talent. Their screening process is so rigorous that out of the thousands of submissions they get every month, they only accept a few into their ranks. This exclusivity sets them apart from so many other freelance websites out there. It may seem intimidating getting in, but if you do, you\u2019ll get the chance to put yourself in front of some pretty big names \u2014 Airbnb, Zendesk, and Thumbtack are companies that have used Toptal to find designers. Do you have what it takes? The only way you\u2019ll find out is to sign up. 4. LinkedIn and LinkedIn ProFinder  Whatever your field, especially if you're a creative, you should have a LinkedIn profile. You can post examples of your work for each role you've had, making it more than just a resume. And by having your skills searchable on this platform, you're bound to bring in some traffic to your profile and connect with people who may be looking for your exact design expertise. Another smart feature that LinkedIn has rolled out is LinkedIn ProFinder, which helps businesses find qualified people to work for them. LinkedIn ProFinder also sends project leads your way via email, giving you the chance to write a proposal and bid. And let\u2019s not forget LinkedIn job postings \u2014 finding remote, part-time, or full-time work may be just a few searches away. There\u2019s a reason why LinkedIn is one of the best job sites: they continue to deliver what job seekers are looking for. 5. We Work Remotely  We Work Remotely boasts that they get around 2.5 million users a month. That\u2019s huge. They have a multitude of job postings with many design-related offerings. We Work Remotely may feel a bit less personal than more design-centric websites, but the volume of job postings makes up for this. People or companies seeking designers have to spend a fixed price of $299 to list on We Work Remotely, which acts as a screening process and weeds out a lot of low-quality job leads. With heavy hitters such as Google, Amazon, and InVision all listed as companies who\u2019ve posted on it, this is a legit platform. And what's even better, you don't have to create a profile \u2014 all you need to do is click on a job link and be brought straight there. Whether you\u2019re looking for part-time work or freelance jobs that will keep you busy full time, We Work Remotely has freelance jobs to fit your skill set. 6. Behance  When seeking creative inspiration, you've no doubt landed on Behance. It features so much great work to soak in, including illustrations, animations, web design, and more. When you fill in your Behance profile with great examples of your work, your work is put in front of an audience of like-minded creatives. And if your work earns the coveted spot of featured project, you'll get even more positive exposure. Who knows who might see it and might want to hire you. Behance also functions as a social media network to connect with other designers. Expanding your list of contacts may bring you new design opportunities. Behance also offers a jobs sections, which has quite a few leads for quality freelance work. You won\u2019t find an endless scroll of jobs, but what\u2019s posted falls in line with Behance\u2019s fantastic reputation. 7. SimplyHired  SimplyHired doesn't charge people to put up job postings, which opens a floodgate of job opportunities. And for freelance workers wanting to be seen by potential clients, SimplyHired makes it super easy to upload a resume and get your profile up and running. Their job search functions also come in handy, letting you narrow down your searches only to what you\u2019re interested in. Having a focused search is much more valuable than sites that display only loosely related results. The site also offers great resources for job seekers, with guides on resume writing, cover letter writing, and other information to help you out. SimplyHired puts those looking for work at the center of their experience, and what they offer shows that they are invested in helping others succeed. 8. Dribbble  Wherever you\u2019re at in your career as a designer, you need to have a profile set up on Dribbble, which continually amazes us with the quality and variety of killer projects that get shared and the community of supportive creatives. Having a high-quality Dribbble profile is a great way to market yourself and to show potential clients what you\u2019re capable of. Dribbble gets a lot of traffic, with plenty of clients looking for talented designers. All you need to do is write a stellar bio and show off the best of your portfolio. Dribbble also gives you an easy way to update your work availability and lets you flip the switch on and off whenever you need to. And if you upgrade to the pro level, you get access to an exclusive freelance design job board. Web developers, graphic designers, and others with related skill sets won\u2019t only find inspiration on Dribbble but may also find their next freelance gig.  9. PeoplePerHour  PeoplePerHour markets themselves as doing a better job of pairing clients with designers. At the beginning of a project, a client inputs the important details of it. This data is then sent through an artificial intelligence program that analyzes it, then matches the client with designers who would be a good fit. PeoplePerHour aims for a more streamlined process, bringing together designers and clients on their freelance platform in a more precise way. 10. Guru  Guru has an authentic, grassroots feel to what they do. They encourage transparency on their freelance platform and value trust, making sure that whatever your role, expectations are met. These sensibilities also extend to their job postings, which all clearly communicate what a project entails. There's nothing sketchy here, making Guru a reputable source to go to if you\u2019re looking for new freelance design work.  11. Freelancer  Freelancer covers many different facets of design work \u2014 everything from graphic and logo design to SEO and content marketing. Their website offers a good looking and easy to navigate space, removing the pain points for both designers and clients alike. They\u2019re huge, and many people consider Freelancer one of the best freelancing websites to search for new design jobs. If you\u2019re after flex jobs, remote work, or other types of positions, http://freelancer.com has a wealth of potential leads. 12. AngelList  Working with startups can be exciting. You may get the chance to shape a brand\u2019s identity and flex your creativity a bit more than with established companies. AngelList connects freelancers with these up-and-coming businesses. Who knows which startup will rise up and become the next huge company? You may just get to be a part of the next big thing.  13. DesignCrowd  DesignCrowd covers lots of design disciplines and has jobs from all over the world. It\u2019s a comprehensive freelance marketplace with a wide variety of job listings. Clients can court multiple designers, allowing them to find just the right fit. Like many freelance sites, they offer crowdsourcing to do their work. If that\u2019s your thing, you should definitely check out DesignCrowd. 14. 99designs  99designs is another great freelancing website that allows designers to connect with businesses around the world. From finding opportunities to joining a community of designers, 99designs makes you feel supported as a freelancer. 15. Working Not Working  If you\u2019ve ever checked out the Working Not Working magazine, you know that they\u2019re serious about design and empowering those with the tools to help people grow in their careers. This branch of their company works so well in complementing this mission. Their landing page features profiles of some of the designers who inhabit this space. Read through these bios and you\u2019ll see that the designers who come here are serious about their craft, with impressive credentials and skill sets. You\u2019re among good company if you sign up for your own account. Along with giving designers visibility, Working Not Working has a solid job board with a ton of great jobs. Bonus: Webflow Experts  If you're a Webflow all-star, a great place to find clients for website and design related projects can be found on our very own Webflow Experts. There are many businesses out there looking to hire freelancers and agencies that offer services related to Webflow. If you have any skills in design, development, site migration, or marketing, Webflow Experts might be worth taking a look at. I hope I provided value.

            "answer_text": "The following list of sites for finding freelance work is broken down into four categories: Job BoardsPortfolio SitesCurated PlatformsFull-Service Platforms Category 1: Job Boards Job boards are still an excellent source of project leads. Here is a list of some of the best job boards for finding freelance work: LocalSolo  LocalSolo is actually a hybrid between a job board, a curated platform and a portfolio site (see next sections). In addition to adding your own bio to the site so employers can find you, you can be pro-active and browse jobs by city, or filter by jobs where remote working is okay. Many of these jobs are specifically for freelancers, which is why it is such a great site for those not necessarily looking for a full-time job. Find Bacon  There are dozens of high-quality job sites out there that offer positions both full-time and freelance for web designers and developers. Find Bacon is a site that aggregates each of these sources for a single searchable database of opportunities. WeWorkRemotely  WeWorkRemotely is a job board that focuses on the niche of remote positions. While not every job on the site is a freelance position, you can easily search for the term \"Freelance\" to narrow down your results. Many of these jobs are medium-long term freelance positions, which can be great if you are yearning for some income stability while maintaining the benefits of being an independent worker. Workshop  If the thought of perusing job boards sounds daunting, then let Workshop find the leads for you. Workshop sends a daily email with hand-picked job opportunities custom-tailored to your skillset. Robert Williams and his team monitor over 300 job boards, and distil the posts down to contain only the best jobs, saving you time and landing you the right jobs faster. Category 2: Portfolio Sites Just as a job board lists available jobs, a portfolio site lists the profiles of available people to fill those jobs. Typically, it is free to post a profile, and as long as you use the appropriate keywords within your biography and skill-set, you will likely appear in search results when a potential client is looking to reach out to a freelancer like you. Sortfolio  Originally created by the team behind Basecamp (who have since sold the property), Sortfolio is a popular portfolio site where you can display your creative work, typical budget, and physical location to be discovered by those looking to hire you for a project. Hubstaff Talent  Hubstaff Talent is another site that allows you to post your profile and get found by companies looking for remote talent. Whereas a few of the other services in this list cater specifically to designers, and thus use graphics-heavy portfolios, Hubstaff talent has a broader approach, allowing you to write up a bio, include links to your work, and upload a resume. Krop  Krop is a hybrid portfolio/job board site that allows visual portfolios for agencies and freelancers. These are some of the most beautifully designed profiles available as templates, but are geared heavily towards visual design and photography. Carbonmade  Carbonmade is focused only on online portfolios (it does not have a job board). Many visual creatives host their profiles on this site, which can be easily searched by potential clients. Profiles can include about and contact pages in addition to project-based pages. Category 3: Curated Platforms In order to save time and reduce the risk of hiring a sub-par freelancer, some clients are opting for services that curate a list of independent workers in order to fill their needs. Getting listed on these sites might not be easy, but if you are accepted, you can begin the client/freelancer relationship with a greater sense of trust, since they know that you have already been vetted. Toptal  Toptal is another site specifically for freelancers that differentiates itself by claiming that it provides access to the top 3% of freelance talent. They claim this percentage because of their own proprietary screening process through which apparently only 3% of the applicants to the site are accepted. Folyo  If you're a freelance designer, consider applying for Folyo, a curated shortlist of available freelance designers. Folyo currently has over 1000 designers in the system, so if you do high-quality work for a reasonable price, it shouldn't be too hard to join up. Crew  Crew is another platform that pairs freelance designers and developers with companies who don't want to sift through a lot of profiles or applications, and are willing to pay to receive only a select few that are qualified for the job. To become a member of Crew, you need to apply to join the waiting list. Hirable  Hirable is a curated list of developers, up-to-date with current availability listings. You can mark yourself as hireable, hireable soon, or busy. This makes it nice for those times when you book a large project, and aren't actively looking for new projects, but will be doing so again in the future. Gun  Boasting the highest placement rate in the industry, Gun matches select freelance developers with clients. This service is more hands-on than the others in this space, by actually doing the screening on a per-project basis, and talking to developers before handing a short list over to the client for final selection. Category 4: Full-Service Platforms Taking the concept of a hybrid job board and portfolio site a step further, full-service platforms add in the additional services of handling communication, payments, proposals, bids, and conflict resolution. Some even employ escrow services to ensure fair payments are made. Upwork  Two of the top platforms for freelancers (Elance and Odesk) combined a few years ago to create a new company, Upwork. Upwork may just be the largest platform of the following, and because of this, has a huge potential to provide a never-ending stream of clients your way. Freelancer  Freelancer is a members-only job board where you can browse and bid on jobs after creating a free account and selecting your areas of expertise. A price range is given for every job so that simplifies the screening process to ensure you aren\u2019t chasing a potential job with little upside. Fiverr  Before you dismiss Fiverr as a source of client work because you would never dream of working for $5 (each job starts as a five dollar gig), know that there are plenty of people who sell their services on there and make a nice living. \u2014 For more ways to find steady freelance income, and slightly more information about each of the sites listed here, check out 27+ Ways to Find Steady Freelance Income ",
