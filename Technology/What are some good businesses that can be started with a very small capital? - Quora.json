            "answer_text": "Completely anecdotal but I started my last venture with ZERO capital. That\u2019s right, zero dollars. And honestly, if my lazy, dumbass can do it, so can you, you smart Quora reader! I stumbled across an idea that seemed genius to me. It was so revolutionary, I HAD to try it! The idea? Foodperk! It was an online platform that allowed restaurants to offload any last minute food items at a heavily discounted price, rather than throw food away. Better some cents on the dollar than none at all.  Restaurants often have enough leftovers at the end of the night that they would simply end up in the trash. Donating the food wasn\u2019t much of an option as it required special packaging and pick up arrangements in many cases. It was easier for the restaurant owner to just discard the food. Until Foodperk came along. At Foodperk we offered awesome meal deals at up to 85% off. Instead of throwing out the last few pizza pies, sandwiches or burgers, restaurant owners would put the deals up on our app with the discount amount and time the food was available for purchase. Foodperk would take a small percentage of the sale, like GrubHub or Seamless or any other food app. Except our food app also helped reduce food waste. Yay! I designed the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) overnight and ran the first version on Wix as it was the easiest, cheapest and fastest way to launch something. Total cost- Zero dollars. Just my time (which is valuable). The Wix site was free for 30 days.  Then I recruited a programmer friend to help me put an iOS app together and a slightly customizable backend where restaurant owners can log in and input their own deals. Nothing fancy. Just something that worked. My friend loved the idea so much, he joined me as a co-founder and worked alongside me, for free. While my partner did the coding, I did the selling and got over 100 restaurants to join our platform. I cold called, cold-emailed and just straight walked into restaurants and asked to speak with the owner or manager. Shit, I was so determined. And it worked. Again, money spent was just my time. The pitch was clean and simple; Foodperk will help get customers through your doors when they\u2019re needed most. Not many restaurant owners ignored my calls or emails. Our best customers used the app 3 times a day, getting all their meals from Foodperk. Restaurants reduced waste, got new customers and customers could always afford to return to those restaurants without a Foodperk discount as they weren\u2019t fancy Groupon type dining. Win, win.  So, what happened to Foodperk? Circumstances forced me and my partner to take on a full-time jobs. So, naturally this passion project began to stall in growth. I failed us when it came time to secure funding to help keep the dream alive. All investors I met with wanted to see a bit more growth before committing to us. And understandably so. Money coming in from Foodperk was simply not enough to sustain us both. At least not yet. But I digress as the point of this write up was to serve as inspiration that you can start (nearly anything) with very minimal capital. So long as you\u2019re rich in drive and desire. If anyone reading this would like to learn more about Foodperk- hit me up. I\u2019d love to chat. ",

            "answer_text": "Starting a business with very little capital is very challenging, but it can be done. Entrepreneurs are often restless and it\u2019s always tempting to \u201cget going\u201d with a business idea even when you don\u2019t have everything you need. We glorify \u201cbootstrapping a business\u201d and idolize companies like Mary Kay and Domino\u2019s Pizza that were started with a few hundred dollars. But the reality is if you run out of cash you\u2019re done - even if your business is \u201ctechnically\u201d profitable. Starting with very little capital works best if you get paid immediately, have low overhead, and don\u2019t have high inventory or labor expenses. In any business, cash flow is everything and there is often a big gap between the time when you get paid and when the bills are due. Unexpected expenses, fraud, or a customer default can sink your entire business if you don\u2019t have a cushion or line of credit with a bank. Some entrepreneurs have used personal credit cards to keep things going. At one time, I had $50,000 in accounts receivables and deposits waiting to clear, while simultaneously searching my couch cushions for spare change and borrowing from friends and family to keep the lights on until the payments came in. As your business grows, this problem will compound past the point where credit cards and personal loans can keep you afloat. If you are going to start with very little capital, you need to plan carefully and conserve all the cash you can. This starts with your business model. Ideally, you are starting a business with very little overhead, with you as the primary source of labor, and a model that can scale as you grow. Keep in mind that any business with this model is going to have lots of competitors, so you\u2019ll need to compete fiercely for customers. Some things to keep in mind: Don\u2019t spend a single dollar without thinking about how that dollar is going to grow your business. If what you are buying isn\u2019t getting you more customers or enabling you to serve more customers, don\u2019t spend it. Keeping a lean mindset will keep you humble and focused. Keep your costs low and make every dollar count.Your business account is not your personal piggy bank. Be prepared to take little or no salary for the first year of your business, even while paying employees. For the first few years of your business, you may be the lowest paid employee. Get your personal expenses down to as close to zero as you can.Don\u2019t assume you have to buy everything for your business. Leases are available for almost everything. If you are just starting out your business won\u2019t qualify for a line of credit without you personally co-signing and guaranteeing a loan. But if you can rent a piece of equipment for $50/month versus buying it for $1,000 when you\u2019re starting out you can use the $950 on something else.Leverage the cloud and software as a service (SaaS) capabilities. Before you spend a single dollar on any software see if an alternative is available that can be used for a monthly fee - accounting software, CRM, sales planning, project management, email, cloud file storage. Cloud apps let you pay per user per month and you can scale up or down as your business needs change.Hold off on opening a physical office space unless you absolutely have to. Office space is expensive, and unless you need to meet customers in your office or have a physical retail or manufacturing space, don\u2019t open an office. I worked for a consulting firm that didn\u2019t open an office for nearly 18 months after they started. By that time, they were making over $1 million in annual revenue.Don\u2019t buy any equipment new: Businesses go under all the time. Almost anything you need from office furniture to manufacturing equipment can be purchased used. Talk to your business banker - they often know of other businesses that went under and are liquidating and the banks want these assets off their books. Sometimes you can walk into a business with very little capital. (For example, Dominio\u2019s Pizza was started for $900, by buying a Domi-Nick\u2019s pizza. They didn\u2019t have enough money to change the sign, so they made a quick edit).Make your business banker your best friend. If your business receives cash or checks in payment of services, walk those deposits into your branch during business hours and make sure you say hello to the bank manager and the business banking manager weekly. Eventually, you will need a line of credit or a loan from the bank and that is not the first time you want to meet a banker. If they know who you are and they see you frequently, you will have a much easier time getting help when you need it.Learn some basic accounting principals: You don\u2019t have to be a CPA or even an accountant (you can always hire one), but you need to understand how to track your income and expenses and be able to determine which activities are profitable and which aren\u2019t. You also need to be able to forecast cash flow - I can\u2019t stress this enough. Unexpected events and expenses will pop up. Without sufficient capital, you can look successful to the outside world and still go out of business. The more you know about your business, the more control you\u2019ll have.Be slow to hire: Full time employees are a huge overhead, and you can hire business services and freelancers to do almost everything your business needs until you are at the scale where you need a full time employee - and even then 2 or 3 dependable part time freelances may still be a better option.Choose quality customers over quantity: A good customer who is easy to work with and pays on time is better than a three bad customers who spend twice as much but never pay on time and are difficult to deal with. If you track the time spent dealing with lousy customers, you\u2019ll quickly find out that you\u2019re actually losing money. Don\u2019t be afraid to fire your customer.Always keep in mind that \u201ccash is king\u201d and net profit (what you actually keep after all the bills are paid) is more important than lofty revenue goals. If you run out of cash, and can\u2019t secure a line of credit (or have exhausted your lines of credit) you are finished. To be successful you really have to focus on high value activities and investments that grow your business. On the plus side, the habits you learn growing a lean business will serve you well in the future. Sometime having too much starting capital is worse for a business - it gives the early illusion of success and leads to wasteful processes and business practices. By starting lean, you\u2019ll be more likely to maintain disciplined financial practices as your business grows. Hope this was helpful. ",
