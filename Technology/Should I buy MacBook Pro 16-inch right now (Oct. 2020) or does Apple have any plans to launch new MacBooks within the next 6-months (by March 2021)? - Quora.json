I got a great deal on Amazon and saved 25k. feedback after a month\u2019s use\u2026its a beast laptop\u2026it hasn\u2019t disappointed me a tiny fraction yet. Amazon had a great offer using which you have discount of nearly 20K(currently out of stock) + you can avail card offers - link - Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage, 2.6GHz 9th Gen Intel Core i7) - Space Grey  coming to the new macbooks- its a new range all together as the tech is changing because the new macbooks will be Apple silicon. If you are not in urgent need and want to check what the new tech brings then it\u2019s worth a wait for the new laptops to be launched( they should be launched in Nov 2020). If you are urgently looking for laptop then the current macbook 16 inch is great buy when you get discount. ",

            "answer_text": "If you urgently need a laptop right now, buy that laptop right now. Tech is always moving forwards, and there will be a newer version of everything \u201ccoming soon\u201d. The main buying factor is your need and the urgency of that need. That said, it\u2019s rumoured that apple will be hosting an event in November, which is likely to be for the Apple silicon macs but besides that, they may also update the MBP16\u201d to Intel 11th Gen. So if you can wait a month, it\u2019d be worth the wait. Besides, if your needs aren\u2019t that high, maybe, who knows, you like the feature set and pricing of the upcoming apple silicon macs better? So while the wiser decision would be to wait, you know your need and urgency of need better. ",
