            "answer_text": "I have worked in both the companies Hcl (3yrs) & Tcs (1year). Let's talk about TCS first :\u2014 Tcs is good for women due to shift flexibility, good maternity leave policy. Tcs gives good shift allowance. Tcs appaisal pattern is different. They can give you good hike based on band (rating ) you have got and at the same time they can reduce your package if your current band is lower than previous band. (Yes it's true!). TCS is mainly driven by managers , if your manager is not good enough to listen your life is hell . HR is controlled by manager . TCS has good bench policy and doesn't throw you out of company even if you are on bench for one year or more (yes I have seen my friends sitting on bench from last 1.5 yes and than got the project and now sitting onsite ). TCS gives you better and frequently onsite opportunity. Bad leave policy. Good medical policy. Typical Indian company (total sarkari !) Let's talk about HCL now :\u2014 Good Transport facility. HCL moto is employee first customer second and trust me it's true ! Job security 10/10. Good medical policy. HCL gives normal annual leaves (22PL, 5/7RH, few comp off based on project you have received) Good onsite opportunity. Good technical learning, Specially for freshers. Awesome infrastructure . Too many co curricular activities within hcl. Good official parties /trips (funded by company) No shift allowance Shift rigidity (doesn't matter if you are girl /boy , married /unmarried you have to work in shifts). Awesome cafeteria, too many food varieties and food joint. ",

            "answer_text": "None! Best companies in the industry are none out of the two. If you want a comparison between the 2 companies here are some of my personal comparisons. Market presence: HCL is nowhere near TCS when it comes to business both in revenue and geography. TCS has in last few years grown leaps and bounds. Clients and projects: Here also I would rank TCS better than HCL owing to its rich past and goodwill of brand name. HCL as a brand is catching up but it will take years to win trust of some of the biggest IT customers across the globe. Business model: Both companies are equally motivated to promote as well as adopt best in class and advanced technology services. HCL is adapting to the changing business needs and targetting different areas of market with minute details. They have been engaged into some ambitious engagements in near past which are so far proving fruitful. TCS on the other hand have a robust business structure that had been constantly fine tuned by management. Work culture and employee satisfaction: Here HCL takes upper hand on TCS. My personal experience with HCL as an employee have been way better than it was with TCS. I understand that depends majorly on the section of the organisation you work with and people with whom you spend larger part of your day and share your expectations with. ",
