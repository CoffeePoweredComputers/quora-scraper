            "answer_text": "This depends a lot on the setup of your computer. If you are on a Windows PC you can go into \u2018This PC\u2019 and it will show you all the drives you have on the computer. You can then open up each drive and see what\u2019s on the drives. On my desktop tower I have it set up so that the operating system and programs are installed to the SSD, but that files in my home directory are generally stored on the hard drive. If you ordered your computer with both drives it\u2019s possible that you have drivers set up different from what you would expect. If you have a Mac this gets a little more complicated as it depends on how your specific machine is set up. MacBooks will generally have one or the other rather than both but on desktop Macs they can either be set up as separate drives or what Apple calls a Fusion Drive, where the computer treats the combination as a single drive and the SSD is treated as a cache. If it\u2019s set up as separate drives you can see all the drives on the desktop but if its set up as a single drive there\u2019s no way to tell except that files will open a bit slower if they\u2019re coming off the hard drive rather than the SSD.

Press the Windows key on your keyboard, or click the icon in your taskbar.This should appear:  Type (or click on the magnifying lens and type) \u201cThis PC\u201d and press Enter. You can see the 2 disks, C: and D:. I named them SSD and HDD. By clicking on each one of them you\u2019re going to see what\u2019s inside of them clearly.  Hope I helped, have a nice day! ",
