            "answer_text": "I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BY - PRODUCTS. IN TODAY\u2019S WOLRD, I THINK EVERY THING HAS A USE SOMEWHERE FOR SOMETHING AND IF THE INDUSTRIES BEGIN TO WORK A LITTLE MORE TOWARDS MANAGING THEIR BY-PRODUCTS, THE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION WILL REDUCE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. WHEN SOMETHING LIKE ASH CAN ALSO BE UTILISED, I THINK LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS THAT COME OUT IN VARIOUS FORMS CAN ALSO BE UTILISED OR MANAGED MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THE PRESENT SCENARIO. ",
