            "answer_text": "Getting out of safe mode is quite simple but first, what is safe mode?. Safe mode is android pones recovery mode, it comes about when the phone cannot complete boot normaly, this may be due to corrupted files so the phone only loads the necessary apps to allow the user to back up their data incase the phone crashes completely. If your phone starts in safe mode on its own then it is highly recommended that you exit safe mode after backing up your data . Finally, to exit safe mode just reboot your phone and you are good to go. If safe mode persists then you will have to reset your phone and this means losing all your data that you havent backed up.
