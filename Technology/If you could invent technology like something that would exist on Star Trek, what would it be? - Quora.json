            "answer_text": "The diagnostic table. Imagine how the world of medicine would open up if a person could lie on a bed and have their entire system scanned for illness and injury - not just an MRI or CAT scan or X-ray or ultrasound\u2026but something that could look at everything, down to the DNA. Mystery diseases could be identified, treatments begun earlier, cures developed. They would know instantly if an experimental cure was working, and be able to identify side effects and tend to them immediately. No more waiting for blood tests. No more waiting for genetic tests. No more waiting. People die while we\u2019re waiting. I think that would be a great advancement. After that, the Replicator. No more famines or shortages of medications. No more waiting for organ donors. After that, the Holodeck. Or Holosuites (as in Star Trek: DS9). Forget the transporter. I\u2019m with Doctor McCoy on that one. I don\u2019t want my atoms dissolved and reassembled somewhere else. I won\u2019t think it would be me on the other end\u2026I would be blasted apart, and I think what is reassembled would be a copy of me. Screw that. However, if we could have a Stargate, I think I could handle a wormhole. (Different show, I know, but I love the idea of a Stargate.) ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, you asked for it.  I would absolutely invent a machine that picked up your dog poop, cat poop, whatever poop. It would compost it, and then delicately scatter the fertilizer on the appropriate areas of the garden where appropriate plants were grown. Sanitary pads would be replaced by an ergonomic, tampon sized device that filtered menstrual blood into biological debris and\u2026.water. The water component would effortlessly evaporate. Instead of the tedious need for wall space in order to hang shelves, in order to then have places on which to put items, items would instead be made so that they specifically didn't crash to the Earth from gravity. They could remain stationary in fresh air, slowly rotate around the room or move in other programmed ways. Tattoos would function as location markers for pets. I'm talking about a tattoo the size of a flea. You could have the same code tattooed on any pet in several different skin areas, just to be sure. The location of stolen or lost pets would be immediately accessible to owners. Obviously there'd be safeguards to ensure that only owners could access such information. I have to go to bed now. Thanks for a fabulous question. \u2665 ",
