            "answer_text": "No - quite the opposite in fact. The concern is that a \u201cgeneralist\u201d AI (GAI) that\u2019s more intelligent and/or faster than a human could serious damage or destroy humanity - and that because it could out-smart us - we\u2019d have little to no chance to stop it from doing so. Elon Musk set up a company called \u201cOpenAI\u201d who were tasked with trying to find ways in which a GAI could be created that would be able to serve mankind usefully, and without any risk of it destroying us. The basic conclusion was \u201cNO\u201d. Since then OpenAI went in directions that Elon did not approve of - so he resigned from it and ceased to work with them (although he still does give them some funding). Instead he seems to have decided that: A GAI is a danger to humanity.Because a business or country might find a GAI to be hugely beneficial, they\u2019ll probably go right on trying to make one anyway.The only strategy that can prevent this is \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em\u201d.So his next effort was to start \u201cNeuraLink\u201d - which as a bunch of short-term goals that will (theoretically) benefit mankind - things like fixing a wide variety of degenerative mental conditions - but seems to be heading for the long term goal of melding the human mind to a computer-based \u201cneural network\u201d. The idea is that if human intelligence can be boosted alongside a GAI being built - we can stay ahead of the game - and GAI\u2019s will become just like ordinary computers - thing that do the mundane stuff while we consider higher matters. So to do that (and ostensibly, for the short-term gains) NeuraLink have built a robot that can insert an ungodly large number of exceedingly tiny electrodes into the human brain with very great precision and without the need for general anesthetics. They are also working on ways to read the state of the neuron next to each electrode AND to be able to convert an electrical signal into a neural input. This would enable humans to do things like \u201csee\u201d using cameras (this kind of thing has already been done on a small scale) - it might also allow use to patch in a piece of computer-based neural networking to replace a damaged part of the biological brain - and thereby cure stroke victims. But it also opens up the possibility of making ourselves MUCH more intelligent. A computer can simulate neurons MUCH more rapidly than actual biological neurons can activate. We could (at least in principle) make a larger brain out of electronics. This might allow us to think faster and be more intelligent than any GAI. If this works - the potential is insanely huge. If we can \u201cgrow into\u201d our electronic brains - then perhaps we can continue to live on when the biological part dies? Immortality!!If we can \u201cread\u201d neurons and \u201cwrite\u201d to them - can we make functional telepathy by connecting your neuralink to mine?You could probably interface to the Internet - and instead of having to \u201cGoogle\u201d some piece of knowledge, you could just have a desire to know about it - and **POOF** an entire field of knowledge pops into your brain.We could slow down and speed up our brains - higher speed would slow down time - and allow us to think much more quickly. Lower speed would allow us to do things like fly for 1,000 years in a spaceship without getting bored - which would open up the galaxy to human colonization.You could make a backup of your brain every so often (say once a day) and if you have a bad day - just rewind to the previous day\u2026or if the computer your mind is running on goes wrong - you can just reload from the previous backup and aside from a day of amnesia - you\u2019d be fune.Heck, you could make two copies of yourself\u2026and\u2026I can\u2019t even imagine what that could be like!But from Elon\u2019s perspective, I think his idea that only by becoming digital beings can we be better than a GAI. It\u2019s an interesting thing - something I\u2019ve definitely considered before - and it\u2019s super-cool that someone with the money to back this has come along to try to see if it can be done.

            "answer_text": "Please read Steve Baker answer to this one. Elon Musk\u2019s fear is not General AI (Please read Culture series from Iain Banks). But General AI controlled by the wrong people. We are already seeing this happening today. A subtle change to FaceBook, Google\u2019s AI algorithm can change the elections. Cause or prevent riots (eg. removing articles that are critical of the police from search results). You will never notice the change but it will change your perspective. Here are some things to consider from Elon\u2019s mind. AI will be smarter than humans in every aspect. Whether it is in 5 years, 50 or 500 it will come.AI just like science, can be used both to destroy end help humanity. How do we ensure it will help humanity?The tipping point will be quick. One day we will have no AI the next day there will be more smart computer in the world than human beings. Government are reactionary so if the laws to govern AI capabilities and application is not made today. Once they exist it will be to late. Once such AI exist it will impossible for us to kill it. (Eg. We will have to coordinate our efforts without the use of Radios, Cellphones, Computers etc).OpenAI (although he doesn\u2019t want to say this to loudly) is an attempt to interact with the AI in an effective manner. Either communicating or use the AI capabilities as part of your own. Think of your primitive brain and your thinking brain interacting. The next part of your brain could live outside your body (some people believe already does).",
