            "answer_text": "Islam supports education and making lives easier; seeing as Technology is a by product of education and makes life much easier, I would say yes.Education The Prophet(SAW) is quoted many times encouraging education: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"The seeking of knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.\" - Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 74  The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \u201cOne who treads a path in search of knowledge has his path to Paradise made easy by God\u2026\u201d - Riyadh us-Saleheen, 245  The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"A servant of God will remain standing on the Day of Judgment until he is questioned about his (time on earth) and how he used it; about his knowledge and how he utilized it; about his wealth and from where he acquired it and in what (activities) he spent it; and about his body and how he used it.\" - Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 148  The Prophet also said: \"Knowledge from which no benefit is derived is like a treasure out of which nothing is spent in the cause of God.\" - Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 108  The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"God, His angels and all those in Heavens and on Earth, even ants in their hills and fish in the water, call down blessings on those who instruct others in beneficial knowledge.\" - Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 422  The Prophet also said: \"Acquire knowledge and impart it to the people.\" - Al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 107 Advantages for Muslims Muslims are also encouraged to take advantage of things that are made easy. This would also support technology. With current technology it's easier to remember when to pray because my phone has an alarm, it's easier to find time to read Qur'an because I have the whole thing in my pocket all the time, it's easier to memorize Qur'an because I have 4+ recitations on my phone, it's easier to learn more about Islam and the world in general because I have a nearly endless pool of knowledge at my finger tips, and as I said before Islam highly encourages learning.

            "answer_text": "A2A Very much so. There are many hadiths that promote the seeking of knowledge and its application in everyday life (knowledge in every field including technology) which can be found elsewhere and in many of the answers given on Quora, so I won't dwell on this answer. The two hadiths in my opinion that express in very strong terms the high status Islam places on  knowledge are these two: 1) \"The sleep of the learned man (the man of knowledge: scientists, scholars, etc.) is better than the worship of the ignorant\", In a similar hadith: \" ...better than the worship of the devout\"   2) \"The ink (of the pen) of the man of knowledge is better than the blood of martyrs\". Here the man of knowledge is the one who writes his discoveries and inventions, thinking models, etc.  for posterity to benefit from. ",
