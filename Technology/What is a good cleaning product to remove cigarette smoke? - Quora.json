            "answer_text": "Your don\u2019t remove the smoke, unless you put out the cigarette. You are talking about the odor from the cigarette smoke. Two ways. One is to wash the article that has the smell and the other way is to air it out. I don\u2019t usually recommend products or brands but this time I will. There a product you can buy called \u201cSimple Green\u201d. Or you can make your own solution of warm water, baking soda and a small amount of dish washing soap. You can add vinegar if you want. One quart of warm water, three teaspoons of baking soda, 1 or two teaspoons of dish washing soap and two table spoons of vinegar. Wipe the article with the solution but do not soak. Let dry and the smell should be gone. ",

            "answer_text": " This stuff. Make sure you dilute it per instructions. Just mist it on, wait no more than a couple of seconds, then wipe off. There's a similar purple product that has the same property; that of making water wetter. Disclaimer; I don't sell this stuff, and have no financial interest in it. I just use it on tough stuff to clean and it works. ",
