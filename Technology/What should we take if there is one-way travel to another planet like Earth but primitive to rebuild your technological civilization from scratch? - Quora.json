            "answer_text": "This is worst possible decision. Firstly, with theoretically possible engine(orion drive) which we could build right now, it would take to get to Proxima Centauri about maybe 80 years. We have no ability to predict how the ship we could build would last for such long time. Even worst outcome of this decision is, that if the planet we want to colonize has its own biosphere then landing on it is recipe for total human race dying off. If you really want to save human civilization then you need to stay in solar system and start to build rotating habitats as fast as possible all the while improving their construction and finding problematic points in their construction. In fact this option is the best we have if we don\u2019t want to have decreased our numbers drastically, which will happen sooner or later if we don\u2019t leave Earth. In a few thousands of years there will be ice age coming. That would make earth largely as habitable as Antarctica is. It won\u2019t really be the best place to live. We can\u2019t really make Mars habitable because it receives much less energy in comparison with Earth and there is the whole issue with radiation, mars toxicity and low gravity\u2026  This could be host for tens of millions people and there is enough material in asteroid field moons and small planets like Mercury(the best source for material probably) to build billions of these.

            "answer_text": "If the planet was exactly like earth in all ways, then you would only need a few hand tools of old. Starting again does not mean we need to get to this level of tech in the first year. We could take lots of books in order to teach the offspring of us in what to build and what not to build. We don't need to build concrete cities in the first 20 years. We don't need to pollute the land in the first 50 years. We don't need to dirty up the air in the first hundred years and so on. Start simple and maintain the purity of the planet along the way. You may take a few solar panels and some wind generators if you want but we would not want to make the fossil fuels mistake twice. We could search out the minerals and materials needed to start making new lights and other solar powered things. But we would not want any oil being pumped from beneath the ground if at all possible.
