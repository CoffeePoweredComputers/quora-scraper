You may know what you need to do to be better at this or that, or to be a better person, but that doesn't mean you're able to implement your knowledge into your actions successfully. Much of what we do is habit. It's the way our brains work. We get used to doing something a certain way and then that \u201cway\" gets logged into our more subconscious mind and thus becomes habit, you dont need to think about it anymore, it's both a habit and instinctive action. Now, if you want to replace this action with a more effective one, of which you have the knowledge\u2026 you'll need to really put your effort into this. You have to now push back your old way of doing it but still, you remember it because you cannot forget by choice! And you have to learn a new action and repeat it enough times that it gets logged into your subconscious. ",
