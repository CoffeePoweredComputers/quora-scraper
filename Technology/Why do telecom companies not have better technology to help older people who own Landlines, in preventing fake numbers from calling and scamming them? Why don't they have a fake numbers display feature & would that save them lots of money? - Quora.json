Some will ask you to handle the steps below for them so be prepared for this First helped them reduce/eliminate their snail junk mail - see my other posts on this topic. If they ha e a deceased spouse have them sign up this individual with the program DMAChoice deceased option. If they have a caretaker inform the caretaker of DMAChoice caretaker option.Register their phone number with the National do not call list - Google FTC unwanted calls. I also registered any old phone numbers as well. Help the poor sole(s) who are receiving their telemarketing/spam calls on their old phone numbers. By the way we ALL receive the past owner telemarketing/spam calls that they opted into by doing business with a company.Have them contact their phone provider (land line/cell phone, etc.) and opt out of \u201csharing\u201d. This is easily done via the companies privacy policy or by logging into their account and changing their preferences.Google cleanse their phone numbers (current/past - basically Google this number and request removal from any website listed. Start with whitepages, peoplefinders, intelius, Melissa Data, spokeo, radaris, beenverified",

            "answer_text": "Think about what you\u2019re asking - that would require developing a database for confirmed fake numbers, a process for identifying and vetting suspected numbers (often they are hijacked numbers), a query system that would scan every incoming call and bounce that number against the database then let the customer know it MIGHT be a fake call. A resolution process for when a number gets wrongfully blocked (bring lawyers and a checkbook). Add in the ongoing operational and support costs, work out the contractual issues with the other telecoms, the legislative and regulatory issues with the cities, states, and federal government agencies Now, scale that for every wireline and VOIP telephone in the country. 100,000,000 lines, anyway. A billion dollar project? Yeah, I\u2019d start the budget discussions with that number. ",
