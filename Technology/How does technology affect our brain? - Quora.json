            "answer_text": "Okay.. lets get this simple. Our intelligence is kind of determined by how many neuronal connections are made. These connections are called synapses and synapses are the reason behind recollection memory recognition calculation and other functions of the brain. In simple terms more the synapses higher the mental functions and more intelligent the person. Technology has somewhere relaxed the mind to an extent that it is taking on this system. Entertainment media, social media etc influence our thoughts in a rather devastating manner. That is another issue of concern. Here what I am stressing on is even the beneficial aspects and apps of technology. For example if you are given a problem say multiply 75 and 36. Manually calculating will require the help of vision, calculation and method of multiplication along with motor skills for writing it down. This would require thousands and thousands of neurons being stimulated at a time to bring out the answer. If we habitually use a calculator all we need is fingers to type the numbers and operation and vision to plainly read what is there on the screen. So the brain is no longer acting in the same way as before. Brain structurally modifies based on our activity. The reason why practice makes us better at a particular skill as the brain now analyses remebers and gives an apt output as required. On the other hand lesser used parts of the brain tend to shrink in size rendering them not as useful. As per a recent study people who use GPS over long periods of time cannot assess place and topographical relation of places because that function was being fulfilled by an external device which did not require much of thinking and analysis. Overall I am not against the use of technology but rather the unrestricted use leading to overuse and abuse is what is of great concern. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me just start with this: The idea that technology is on its own somehow detrimental to our pscyhe is hogwash! There are a lot of reasons our brains are amazing things, but one of the biggest ones is its ability to adapt. Human neuroplasticity affords this. The brain forms structures of stereotypes and convention and then attempts to apply that to other means. Its how a completely normal brain can and should function. So, technology affects the brain in which the environment normally would and should; humans adapt to use their tools. This is no different than when the first human decided to tie a rock to a stick instead of just hitting things with the rock. Humans who were there to experience this transition had to relearn how to put down the rock and pick up the stick-rock. This is not to say that technology isn't necessarily detrimental in some cases. We have a field of study called ergonomics that studies this exact phenomenon. Some psychologists have proposed that prolongued exposure to television or other screens could be a cause of the rising number of cases of ADHD, since our natural attention mechanisms aren't engaged in the same way it was in our non-screen viewing ancestors.  Or is that just technology providing scientists and doctors with more ways to identify the symptoms?  But, this is no different than its always been. A medieval farmer could work long hours, bent over pulling up weeds and hurt his back because his sickle was poorly designed. The rate of lumberjack deaths could have increased as a result of more efficient axes. The point is that technology has always and will continue to effect us in positive and negative ways.  It is true, the printing press did remove our need to memorize epic stories, but it did not eliminate our ability to do so. Go ahead, try it, spend a year memorizing Homer's Odyssey - I promise your brain can still do it. By all means, memorize every phone number in your iPhone. Your brain still functions the way our ancestors' functioned, it has only adapted to a different world with different rules. ",
