            "answer_text": "Just after the INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION it seems something very strange happened sometime from late 19th century up until 1914. Technology seemed to run amok. The out break of WORLD WAR ONE was mystifying due to the level of technology employed for humans to kill each other on grand scales. It seems many technologists where finding strange ideas and innovations like Nikola Tesla and others. Professional astronomers like Schiaparelli, The Royal Observatory, and the predictor of Pluto, Percival Lowell, where all noticing something telescopically going on in our solar system that was quite enigmatic. Astronomers today are still trying to criticize their amazing findings. It all seems as if there was some sort of imponderable super-sentient activity was going on then ending in some metaphysical (MP) Grand Origins Designer restriction of the MP antagonists to the vicinity of Earth. Then as an act of anger, opposition, and resistance, they shared grandiose technological things with human mediums like Tesla and other unlikely human characters for such sophisticated things way over their heads. According to the highly credible ancient philosopher Plato, this ostensibly happened before in a very ancient time period in his book Timaeus. I know all of this sounds so esoterically ridiculous to some here but Shakespeare said it well:\u201dThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy\u201d ",
