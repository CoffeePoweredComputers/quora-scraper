            "answer_text": "Nature? The wild blue yonder(but it is mostly brown and green when you get there). The great wide open(but upon closer inquiry, one is usually told that area is closed indefinitely and is under investigation for dragons, defiling, too many united states, and the unprecedented manufacture of Oz guncotton by wizzers). Wilderness( for a profusion of mold growth, it is actually milderness than the city) Nature is often a thing referred to as the world without us. Such a thing is just for military attack's purposes, because the natural debt cannot afford to exterminate us unless we pay back respects borrowed when people needed words(but the interest accrued is worth more than the principal). Nature is the only thing we people can depend on. God says so. When I asked Nature about what God had said, she said \u201cOMG!\u201d. I didn't understand and she was kind enough to explain that the lead deity once was a woman named Guy, uh\u2026I think\u2026and now the lead deity is a man named Godiva. Go figure. It tares out the heart weight. ",
