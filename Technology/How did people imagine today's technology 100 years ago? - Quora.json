            "answer_text": " Written by Sushruta in 6th Century BC, Sushruta Samhita is considered to be one of the most comprehensive textbooks on ancient surgery. The text mentions various illnesses, plants, preparations and cures along with complex techniques of plastic surgery. The Sushruta Samhita \u2019s most well-known contribution to plastic surgery is the reconstruction of the nose, known also as rhinoplasty.Medical science & surgery - Around 800 BC, first compendium on medicine and surgery was complied in ancient India. In 1748, Jacques Daviel was the first modern European physician to successfully extract cataracts from the eye.  Cataract surgery was known to the physician Sushruta (6th century BCE). Traditional cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract out of the field of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged.Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that it should only be used when necessary  Mathematicians of ancient India often applied their mathematical knowledge to make accurate astronomical predictions. In his book Aryabhatiyam, Aryabhata (born 476) sketched his mathematical, planetary, and cosmic theories. The parameters of Aryabhatiyam have, as their origin, the date of Friday, 18th February, 3102 BC. Aryabhata took the earth to spin on its axis; He correctly propounded that the Earth is round, rotates on its own axis and revolves around the Sun i.e the heliocentric theory. He also made predictions about the solar and lunar eclipses, duration of the day as well as the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Aryabhata was aware of the relativity of motion as is clear from this passage in his book,``Just as a man in a boat sees the trees on the bank move in the opposite direction, so an observer on the equator sees the stationary stars as moving precisely toward the west.''represented the pinnacle of astronomical knowledge at the time. Preservation of body  Vladmir Lenin may have been dead for 90 years, but his corpse looks better than the day he passed. This is the claim made by his embalmers, who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary's body. Pictured is his body in 1997 But dated back centuries this been practicing  Egyptian mummies Physics - Concepts of atom and theory of relativity were explicitly stated by an Indian Philosopher around 600 BC.They believed that the smallest particle which could not be subdivided further was paramanu (can be shortened to parmanu), a Sanskrit word. Paramanu is made of two Sanskrit words, param meaning ultimate or beyond and anu meaning atom. Thus, the term \"paramanu\" literally means 'beyond atom' and this was a concept at an abstract level which indicated the possibility of splitting atom, which is now the source of atomic energy. The term \"atom\" however should not be conflated with the concept of atom as it is understood today. Paper  The invention of paper greatly affects human history. Paper already existed in China since 105 A.C, however, a eunuch named Cai Lun (ca. 50 AD \u2013 121) made significant innovation and helped drive its widespread adoption. His advanced paper-making technology then spread to central Asia and the world through the Silk Road. Papyrus was first manufactured in Egypt as far back as the fourth millennium BCE  Still paper is mainstay of literature work and sciences and educational documentation. Concept of flying  Ellora caves monuments, and artwork, dating from the 600\u20131000 CE period  The Columbian 'planes': Considered to be well over a thousand years old, this tiny gold object certainly has a similar appearance to a modern aeroplane. Thought to come from a pre-Incan culture, it measures just two inches long.  Apart from the obvious overall similarity to a plane, the object has several interesting features. What is most noticeable about this object is the tail-fins, never seen in nature, but specifically placed for aerodynamics. There is also what appears to be a 'cockpit', and it is said that the resemblance to a modern plane was complete even to the existence of an insignia on the tail fin Earthquake director.  According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe. Edit: Adding few more things which even with current technology advances makes us wondering how they done it that's too centuries ago Ellora Caves  Carved from a single piece of rock, the sheer engineering skill required to make this temple was nearly a miracle, especially in the year 800 AD. After all, the only tools available were elephants and basic building materials. This particular temple is a set of 34 monasteries and temples known as the Ellora Caves.  This temple you are benumbed seeing that it is carved out of a single rock. It is one of the largest Megaliths in the world and the most stunning part is that it is whittled vertically, i.e. from top to bottom. Just imagine how much efforts would have been put in to quarry the rock to carve out for the temple with precincts embracing 45m width and 85m depth. Archaeologists consider that in approximately 18 years after digging out around 4,00,000 tons of rock, this mammoth temple would have been built. If we calculate roughly it would amount to 60 tons of rock daily and that too with the hammer, chisel and picks. Can you believe this to be humanly possible? Now when you look at the extensive carvings, over hundred feet pillars as well the bridges which link the small buildings to the main dome, at one hand you are enthralled seeing the exquisiteness and on another hand you are wide-eyed imagining about the anterior planning the builders would have done to bring out that perfect geometry. Even today if we employ the modern machine\u2019s exhuming cannot be done with such finesse.  In the present world where foundations are laid first, have anyone heard anything like this . Our maximum technology know-how which can consider similar to this is 3D printing. The mystery is not only about the architecture but also about the scooped-out rock and sand. When the temple was made, large pieces of rocks must have carved out to give it a shape of Kailash mountain range. So now the question arises that where are those stones now? Archaeologists have found no traces of such large chunks of rocks and sand around the temple premises. What type of technology it was that evaporated those unwanted large rocks.  Machu Picchu  Machu Picchu's walls, caves and buildings are widely adorned with intricate carvings in the citadel, boasting carefully selected cave entrances, strange altars, 600 impressively engineered terraces, a 1km long aqueduct and exquisitely engineered buildings. Quizzical llama lawnmowers help to keep the grass around the buildings all beautifully manicured, showing off their best features. It is indeed a sensory feast for 21st century eyes.  architectural features of Machu Picchu are all closely huddled together over it's total area of 32,592 hectares, an assortment of structures, each with an archaeological and spiritual back story.  They know how to make earthquake resistant structures In 15th century.  These stones were cut so precisely, and wedged so closely together, that a credit card cannot be inserted between them. Aside from the obvious aesthetic benefits of this building style, there are engineering advantages. Peru is a seismically unstable country.Machu Picchu itself was constructed atop two fault lines. When an earthquake occurs, the stones in an Inca building are said to \u201cdance;\u201d that is, they bounce through the tremors and then fall back into place. Without this building method, many of the best known buildings at Machu Picchu would have collapsed long ago. Still wondering are we technology advances in structural engineering like earlier time?
