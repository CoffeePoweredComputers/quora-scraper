We can congratulate ourselves for \u201cinstalled capacity\u201d twice that of evil coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generators, and ignore the reality that solar and wind intermittently generate between 4 and 10% of capacity per annum, increasing load balance complexity and risking grid burnout.

We\u2019ve studied history, and history suggests you\u2019re too weak and disorganized to stop us, especially since we\u2019ve been working these last few decades to demoralize you by indicting your national symbols, accusing them of moral evil and deriding your institutions as sources of intellectual and moral oppression.

            "answer_text": "The Bipartisan Climate Solution: H.R. 763 https://citizensclimatelobb... A Market-Based Bipartisan Climate Solution : H.R. 763: A POLICY FOR A HEALTHY, STABLE AND PROSPEROUS AMERICA ========================= The best bet is to simply QUIT SUBSIDIZING those human industrial activities which are causing \u2014\u2014-Anthropomorphic Global Warming. \"There is no need to add additional taxes to combat climate change. . World-wide, Fossil Fuels & industries suck up subsidy Dollars. They SUCK UP roughly 6.5% of GDP ... TRILLIONS of DOLLARS in subsidies / supports / Freebies (non taxable supports & subsidies!) In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won\u2019t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that\u2019s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist What\u2019s emerging is the following: Electrify everything. Convert all energy services to work directly from electricity instead of fossil fuels. Transportation, industry and agriculture. All of it. All gas appliances must go. All road transport must be electric. Most trains and a lot of planes must shift to electric. All heat from electricity. The USA throws away two thirds of all primary energy, mostly in the form of waste heat from fossil fuels used in inherently inefficient combustion processes. We only have to replace a third of the actual primary energy we use today to maintain our lifestyle and economy. Overbuild renewable generation. All other forms of generation with the exception of nuclear were overbuilt, so we\u2019ll do the same with wind and solar, and they are really cheap, so that\u2019s not that expensive. After all, $3 trillion USD would provide all primary energy for everything the US does. Build continent-scale electrical grids and markets, and improve existing ones. HVDC became much more viable with high-speed hybrid circuit breakers in 2011, and is an essential technology for long-distance, low-loss electrical transmission. Build a fair amount of hydro storage, and some other storage. While storage of electricity is an overstated concern given over built renewables and continent-scale grids, some is still required. Pumped hydro resource potential is far greater than the need, is efficient and uses very stable, known technologies. Shifting existing hydro-electric dams to be passive, on-demand storage as opposed to baseload is also key. Fast response grid storage can be provided by existing lithium ion technologies, as Tesla has proven in California and Australia. By 2050, we\u2019ll have roughy 20 TWh of batteries on wheels in US cars alone, available both for demand management to reduce peak demand, soak up excess generation and to provide vehicle-to-grid electricity as needed. Plant a lot of trees. We have cut down about 50% of the six trillion trees that used to grow on earth. Planting a trillion trees would buy us a lot of time as they sucked about a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere per tree over 40 years. Change agricultural practices. High-tillage agriculture is a process that keep releasing carbon captured by the soil back into the atmosphere. Switching to low-tillage would buy us a lot of time as the CO2 captured by farmland would stay in the soil a lot longer, and some of it would be permanently sequestered. Fix concrete. 8% of global CO2 emissions come from making Portland cement. It\u2019s absolutely critical to urban densification and industry, so we won\u2019t stop making it. But it\u2019s a huge source of CO2, about half from the energy and half from CO2 that bakes off limestone as it\u2019s turned into quicklime. Electrifying that energy flow helps a lot, but capturing that CO2 is one of the few places where mechanical carbon capture makes sense. Price carbon aggressively. The simplest way to get a lot of people and industries to shift away from emitting lots of CO2 is to make it expensive. That\u2019s what carbon taxes do. Shut down coal and gas generation aggressively. Getting rid of coal is already happening, but it\u2019s by far the biggest single source of CO2 emissions. Aggressive actions to eliminate burning coal are needed. For gas, the question is how few gas plants can we build, how many of them can we run on biologically sourced methane and how fast can we shut them down. Stop financing and subsidies for fossil fuel exploration, extraction and use. The USA alone spends tens of billions annually on subsidies of various kinds for the fossil fuel industry, and hasn\u2019t done a thing about it since committing to eliminate them in 2009. The G7 and G20 have committed to eliminating subsidies, but progress has been very slow. The World Bank continues to finance coal, oil and gas projects, despite commitments to end them. Eliminate HFCs in refrigeration. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer targets the unforeseen side effects of displacing ozone-depleting CFCs with high-greenhouse gas HFCs. Project Drawdown puts this at #1 on its ranked list of solutions by cost vs benefit. The USA has not ratified this Amendment, although 65 other countries have. There are some mildly controversial things left out of this list. Nuclear power is too slow to build and too expensive. That\u2019s empirical reality, not an advocacy statement. The conditions for rapid build don\u2019t exist. And we need a lot of clean electricity very quickly. Nuclear need not apply. Keep existing nuclear going, don\u2019t stop new nuclear build out in China, pretty much the only place building new generation capacity, but don\u2019t expect it to be more than a rounding error in a few decades. New nuclear technologies are decades from commercial deployment at any scale, and we have technologies that are reliable, predictable, cheap and fast to build, so there will be nothing for them to do once they actually make it out of R&D. Mechanical carbon capture and sequestration is a mostly dead end. This is an overhyped figleaf for the fossil fuel industry. Virtually every CCS site is actually an enhanced oil recovery site which recovers oil that couldn\u2019t be pumped out, typically enough that 2\u20133 times more CO2 is generated from the oil than was put underground. Exceptions are natural gas wells with too high a concentration of CO2, leading to 25 times the emissions once the natural gas is burned. Expensive, unscalable, wasteful. As stated, it might be useful for concrete. Air-to-fuel technologies are dead ends. Solutions such as Carbon Engineering\u2019s direct air capture with hydrogen electrolysis to create synthetic fuels is a broken model. It\u2019s vastly more expensive and higher CO2 emitting than electrification or biological pathway fuel synthesis. Any money spent on this would have vastly better results if spent on renewables instead. It\u2019s not an either-or, but in this case policy makers should ignore this and governments shouldn\u2019t fund it. The military is a hard problem. They require vast amounts of high energy fuel in places with no electrical supply chain often for months at a time. The US military is considered by many to be the single largest CO2 emitting organization in the world. However, eliminating global fossil fuel strategic military actions \u2014 which describes virtually everything done in the Middle East for the last 100 years \u2014 will diminish the need for the US military substantially. A great deal of their current emissions, which hopefully will start coming to light once the US signs the Paris Accord either in 2021 or 2025 once Trump is gone, are related to the ongoing Middle Eastern deployments. There\u2019s only so much we can do for biofuels, but to be clear, the world has been in a period of diminishing military conflict since the end of WWII. Globalization may have downsides, but the ties of trade and treaties which bind countries together have been highly effective in allowing diplomacy pathways to work, and making the military option increasingly difficult to consider. Where statements diverge from the above, question what lobbying groups are involved, where revenue will be lost or gained and in general what the motivations of the people or organizations involved are. This is all empirically grounded analysis. It\u2019s not rocket science. We have the solutions. We just need the will to execute, which is being sapped by the losers in this necessary transformation, dominantly the fossil fuel industry. ... Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or overly expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. ... 1] Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. . ((solar & wind Cost less & are quicker to construct + + they produce FAR less expensive electricity than coal)) . Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. ... 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of \u201cno regrets\u201d solutions\u2014actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] ... 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] ...

The vast majority of the polluting nations of the Earth must become fully engaged in efforts to slow down and ultimately reverse global warming which, even if we succeeded today would remain in effect for a century or more.

The human influence on the the climate is minimal; but we have been relentlessly told by a manipulated Media that somehow our CO2 emissions have a major influence. However if you look at the image below it rather casts some doubt about that. Forget West and East; we are all in this together. Best we turn our attention to adapting to any change if need be.  ",
