            "answer_text": "If I had to select building materials, being a construction company, I would pick a reliable platform that has most reliable suppliers and then I would look for the building materials on the platform. This would be the easiest way for me to find building material. Here\u2019re some considerations that construction companies keep in mind in order to select building materials.  Resource efficiency Sustainable materials promote a more efficient use of resources such as money, materials, labor and other assets while minimizing waste and improving occupational health and safety management. This is a consideration that most of the construction companies prefer. Recyclability, reuse Proper waste recycling reduces the demand for new resources, cuts down cost and effort of transportation and production. So, while looking into the Building material supplier product listings, businesses mostly prefer such products that are recyclable and reusable. Locally sourced Regional materials or locally sourced materials are those produced within a certain distance from the project site. Building contractors basically prefer locally sourced ones because they think they are more reliable. Rapidly renewable A rapidly renewable material is a material that has the capacity to regenerate itself in 10 years or less. This includes bio-based products made from plants harvested on a 10-year (or shorter) cycle. This is consideration taken by top construction contractors today. So, I believe the choice of building materials is done based on above mentioned points. If you have any question regarding the points mentioned above, revert me back and I would happy to help you to find building material for your project in case you are seeking help for it. ",

            "answer_text": "This is from a presentation by Anand Subramaniam on product design, but works for selection of construction design materials also:  If this is a standard \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d project it goes like this: The design team, the Owner\u2019s Architect/Engineer firm usually makes the first decisions based upon the client\u2019s vision, budget and time-frame. Then the Owner decides what to add or subtract based on a multitude of factors - all of which are listed in the diagram. Some elements are more important than others, of course. Then the final design and product specifications are made. At that point a contractor is brought in or bids are sought. The contractors will use the design plans and produce a construction number. That number may or may not take into account every design item and element. If it doesn\u2019t, they will recommend changes or alternates. It may be because of \u201cconstructability\u201d but it is usually because of cost. This is lovingly referred to as \u201cvalue engineering.\u201d The general goal of the contractor is to bring the project in on time and in budget. In a \u201cdesign-build\u201d project, the contractor is in charge of the design and build process completely. The Architect, Engineer and all consultants work for and are directed by the contractor. In this case the contractor is responsible for all selections, but again, the design consultants make the basic specifications of material. The construction industry is rather conservative because using materials and methods they are not usual can cause problems. It is the design team that pushes the envelope. ",
