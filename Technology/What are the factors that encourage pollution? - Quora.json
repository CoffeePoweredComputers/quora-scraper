            "answer_text": "Pollution, or more accurately, the acceptance or tolerance of pollution, are affected by several \u201cforces.\u201d If the levels of pollution are low enough to not pose a strong and immediate danger to any forms of life it\u2019s exposed to, little effort would be justified for limiting the pollution. If a culture or civilization is too poor to be able to afford pollution controls, priorities of food, clothing, shelter and other basic survival needs will be higher than pollution controls. Just for starters. Hope that helps. ",
