            "answer_text": "You can get literally the best rig imaginable with 20 grand. I maxed out a build on Alienware's website and that only came out to $14K, and they're already extortionate. The \"bestness\" won't last longer than 6 months though. To give you an idea, you'd probably have the top of the line Intel processor, probably server grade. You'd need an expensive motherboard, probably that supports dual CPU. You'll need something like a server grade amount of RAM, like 64-128GB of the newest and fastest DDR4 (though the bandwidth probably would make it useless beyond a certain point). You'd need the largest and most expensive of solid state drives, probably multiple. Something like the multi-terabyte options. Back up harddrives in the 4+TB range. The most expensive and flexible full tower case. A fully integrated water-cooled system on the board, CPU, GPU, RAM, etc. External radiator as well, if you prefer. Top end sound card, probably Quad-SLI nVidia GPUs like the newest GTX980-Ti that just released. Or twin workstation cards. A bitchin' power supply, probably 1500W or something. You'd be pretty set. You'd probably have 3-4 grand left over too. You could spend that on the endless high end peripherals and doodad accessories that attach to said PC. ",
