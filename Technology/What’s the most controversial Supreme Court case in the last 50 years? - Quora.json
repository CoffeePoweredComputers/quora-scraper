            "answer_text": "There is no one US Supreme court case since the beginning of this country\u2019s judicial history, more controversial than the last. Every case that reaches the US Supreme Court is already controversial, and since you seek cases since 1969, I have a list prepared, which includes the most \u201ccontroversial\u201d cases the court ruled since 1969. Marbury v. Madison, 1803 (4-0 decision): Established the Supreme Court's power of judicial review over Congress. McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819 (7-0 decision): Established the federal government's implied powers over the states. Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857 (7-2 decision): Denied citizenship to African American slaves. Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896 (7-1 decision): Upheld \"separate but equal\" segregation laws in states. Korematsu v. United States, 1944 (6-3 decision): Upheld internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 (9-0 decision): Separating black and white students in public schools is unconstitutional. Gideon v. Wainwright, 1963 (9-0 decision): Criminal defendants have a right to an attorney even if they cannot afford one. New York Times v. Sullivan, 1964 (9-0 decision): Lawsuits based on libel or defamation must show intent or recklessness. Miranda v. Arizona, 1966 (5-4 decision): Prisoners must be advised of their rights before being questioned by police. Loving v. Virginia, 1967 (9-0 decision): Invalidated state laws prohibiting interracial marriage. Roe v. Wade, 1973 (7-2 decision): Women have a constitutional right to an abortion during the first two trimesters. United States v. Nixon, 1974 (8-0 decision): President cannot use executive privilege to withhold evidence from criminal trial. Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978 (5-4 decision): Upheld use of race as one of many factors in college admissions. Bush v. Gore, 2000 (5-4 decision): No recount of the 2000 presidential election was feasible in a reasonable time period. Lawrence v. Texas, 2003 (6-3 decision): Struck down state laws that prohibited sodomy between consenting adults. District of Columbia v. Heller, 2008 (5-4 decision): Citizens have a right to possess firearms at home for self-defense. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 2010 (5-4 decision): Corporations and unions can spend unlimited amounts in elections. National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 2012 (5-4 decision): Upheld the mandate that most Americans have health insurance. Shelby County v. Holder, 2013 (5-4 decision): States and localities do not need federal approval to change voting laws. United States v. Windsor, 2013 (5-4 decision): Federal government must provide benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015 (5-4 decision): Same-sex marriage is legalized across all 50 states. The Court has ruled on abortion; securing evidence for impeachment proceedings of President Nixon; affirmative action; ruling on 2000 presidential election result; sodomy laws; expanding gun ownership to private individuals; allowing corporations to spend money to elect people for all offices in federal, state and local elections; the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for Americans to have health insurance; allowing southern states to avoid federal oversight for changing voting laws; benefits must be provided to legally married same-sex couples; and making same-sex legal across the 50 states. The issues presented before the court were controversial when argued and remain controversial today. In my opinion, Roe and Citizens United are high on my list. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure you could narrow it down to just one. But 50 years? Okay, so you want to start with Roe v Wade and Gates v Collier, both 1974. The former is obvious. My 6 year old grand daughter knows what Roe v Wade is. And the latter prohibited the trust system inside prisons such as Mississippi that turned almost entirely black prisoners into slaves for the Wardens. Mississippi University for Women v Hogan, 1982. That decision made gender limited universities of gender consideration a thing of the past. Romer v Evans in 1996 and Lawrence v Texas in 2003, made gay sex between consenting adults legal and overturned laws first in Colorado and later on Texas. Being from Texas and a gay man, you can imagine my thoughts. The Texas case came about because a couple of idiot cops (Harris County Deputies) working warrants busted in the wrong apartment having heard screaming through the door. Little did they know that Lawrence and another gentleman were in the throws of passion on the living room floor and were clearly seen in the act siding. They were arrested and the dominoes began to fall. The conservative community severely chastised them because they knew the sodomy laws would not withstand Supreme Court scrutiny but by not arresting anyone on the charge it allowed the law to remain since in order to challenge it someone had to have standing. In order to have standing, someone had to be injured by the law. But by having the law on the books they could keep out gay teachers or pretty much any positions for the state. Private business and Ben corporations could refuse to hire gay employees because that was technically illegal. It forced anyone who was gay, especially if they lived in a same sex relationship from living in very many places outside the gay ghetto. Goodridge v Department of Public Health also 2003 was the first state case allowing gay couples to marry in Massachusetts. ",
