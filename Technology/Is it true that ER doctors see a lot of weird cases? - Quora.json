            "answer_text": "Warning : sexual and possibly graphic content ahead. The following case is the weirdest I have ever witnessed. It was during my casualty postings as an intern. The day so far had been calm with less patients than usual. The CMO had gone into his room to relax. Me and my Co intern were chatting with the duty sisters. Usual hospital gossip and stuff. In came an young man with a weird walk. He saw the sisters and stood at the entrance of the casualty room with a lot of hesitation. I sensed his discomfort and called him in. He came limping in. The sisters also left us alone as they also understood the patient wasn't feeling comfortable with their presence. I asked him what his problem was. He was wearing a dhoti. Without saying anything he opened his dhoti and showed me his genital area. His penis was stuck inside a bottle. Fully engorged and erect. The bottle looked something like the one below without the cap obviously.  I have read about Priapism before. But this was my first time seeing it (and my last time too). I asked him how the hell he ended up with something like this. My co intern who had was in shock initially was trying his best to not show any emotion. He had tried to be innovative and used the bottle to masturbate. But at one point his penis had engorged so much that it got stuck in the opening of the bottle. The constriction prevented blood from returning back and his erection as a result did not subside. The poor fool had been erect for more than a couple of hours and as a result in a lot of pain. He had already visited the local quack who had suggested breaking the bottle which had mortally petrified him so much that he had decided to come to a tertiary center. Can't blame him. It was a glass bottle. We thought of helping him before sending him to the surgery emergency ward to protect him further embarrassment. Obviously we had to call the sisters to help and they registered the same series of expressions, from shock to a strong urge to laugh but instead trying to maintain dignity and professionalism. Unfortunately no matter what lubricant we used we could not pry the bottle off. After some 10 minutes of struggle we sent him to the surgery emergency ward. Immediately after he left I have never heard so many people laughing so hard for so long. Weirdest of them all indeed! ",

            "answer_text": "Life in ER is usually quite repetitive but as ER lays at the boundary between human behavior and reality sometimes you see cases that defy your understanding and sometimes even your imagination :-) Without even going into prurient stuff (yes you\u2019ll often need to retrieve misplaced objects) I\u2019ll never forget my FIRST time in the ER as a young intern, left alone by the attending physician and killing time reading and rehearsing guidelines, flowcharts etc. Then I heard the ambulance siren and Adrenalin shot up. It stops right in from of my stall, the doors open and off it hops a small black creature all crooked and twisted which strongly smelled of sulfur. I could NOT avoid thinking for an instant \u201cWow it\u2019s the devil himself\u201d and only after the poor thing started talking things got a lot less ethereal and plainly mundane. It was the poor custodian of a political party section which had been bombed with a rudimentary black powder bomb and was covered with dust and powder but luckily with little physical damage. Right after him the next siren screams and I get a large comatose guy on a stretcher and the diagnosis of an heroin overdose. I go get the antagonist and prepare it but am stopped by the veteran nurse which said \u201cHey Doc, you\u2019re brand new, are you?\u201d, yup, \u201cWell let me restrain the guy before you inject naloxone since usually the moment after you do they get up and try to beat the crap out of you!\u201d oh I said, that\u2019s not in my books. And so on. So yes, a rotation in ER will teach you a lot about life and its accidents and generally make you a lot more tolerant than before. ",
