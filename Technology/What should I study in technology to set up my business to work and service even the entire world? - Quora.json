            "answer_text": "Be careful with technology. It empowers you but you can also fall flat on it. Those certifications from the 1990s? Forget them. How about learning the latest zippity-doodah language for mobile apps? Yeah sure, until it\u2019s superseded by another language. Technology moves so quickly every quarter that you need to be flexible in what you study so that you can apply skills and not domain knowledge. Skills such as sales, marketing, entrepreneurship, teamwork, management and problem solving will keep your future job and business going. Knowledge will be superseded, optimised and obsolete faster than you can finish that next level in your mobile game. So my advice to you is to sharpen your skills and study a general, broad base that will serve you for the coming years. If I had the youth and energy again, I would join as many hackathons around the world in the coming months. You will come out bleary-eyed but a lot wiser! Plus they look good on your resume. ",
