            "answer_text": "I have a manic personality for the most part. Addictive is not a wrong word. It aided my business success because to achieve my goal, I could better focus on what was needed to achieve the desired outcome. An addictive personality to me can focus on a particular area bed a drug gambling or success. For me it required a need to balance that with life in general but as far as business I wouldn\u2019t have traded my manic/ addictive personality. ",

            "answer_text": "Having an addictive personality is no fun at all. I have it in both side of my family so it\u2019s no wonder I was smoking weed out of a crack pipe when I was 12. I damaged my brain in a way that effects my memories and it also stunted the growth of my frontal cortex so I also suffer very sever ADHD. In relationships I often get too attatched way to fast and I am very loyal right off the bat which makes for very violent emotional trauma by even the smallest of break-ups. Shit I might not even have to be dating the person if I just like the way they look I get extremely infatuated and I don\u2019t focus on anything but them. So in my experience of having a severely addictive personality no good can come of it. ",

There is no such thing as an \u201caddictive personality\u201d. It\u2019s a myth. The only unifying factor that has been found is a tendency to be slightly higher in impulsivity, and even that doesn\u2019t by any means apply to all people. When we label ourselves and others we do great harm. We mislead ourselves about our true nature and potential. We typecast ourselves and live out lives based on misconceptions of what we are \u201creally\u201d like. Or worse yet, we typecast and demonise others. ",
