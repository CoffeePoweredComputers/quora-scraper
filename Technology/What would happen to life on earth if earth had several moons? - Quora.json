            "answer_text": "Who says we don't have more moons? A definition of \"moon\" according to the OED, says that it is any \"natural\" object orbiting a planet. Currently, there is a \"mystery\" object orbiting Earth, temporarily designated 9U01FF6, with an orbital distance between 50,000 and 460,000 miles and an orbital period of about 31 days. It is a mystery since its origins or makeup is unknown, but is probably only about 2 or 3 meters in diameter. Not really that big, is it? Mars, which is roughly half the size of Earth, has 2 moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small, probably captured asteroids. Pluto, technically no longer classified a planet, has 5 identified moons. The answer to this question really depends on size. Is it possible for us to have more moons? Absolutely. If we make this a \"what if\" where a second moon of around the size of our current one, and simplify the physics by saying they are in a complimentary orbit with each other (basically the same orbital periods, avoiding a collision in the near future), several things would happen. The interior of the Earth would be much hotter than it is now, due to the tidal forces. this means the tectonic plates would move much faster, mountain ranges would be much higher, Volcanoes would be more numerous and more active, releasing more sulphur, carbon dioxide and other toxic gases into the atmosphere, but also much more dust. Earthquakes would be more frequent, and of a greater magnitude. Earth's surface would be much colder, based on the history of past large eruptions. The Earth's magnetic field would be much stronger due to a more active core. This would translate into spectacular Auroral displays and decreasing the amount of solar and cosmic radiation from reaching the surface. The tidal action would continually churn the oceans, making the coastal tides much higher and would erode the coasts much faster. On this colder Earth, the oceans would continually ice over, only to be broken up cyclically. If this ice is not given a chance to melt, eventually the oceans would almost completely freeze over. Assuming the big freeze or volcanic gasses don't prevent life from evolving to greater complexity, extinction events caused by large asteroids would be less likely, with both moons sweeping our vicinity of objects better than it does now. The diversity of life would be greater, but with organisms more specialized and more prone to individual extinction because of it. If these moons have a more erratic orbit, the Earth's axis of rotation would likely be much more wobbly, increasing the severity of the seasons, but also making them less consistent. Ice ages would be more frequent, shorter lived but of greater intensity. Weather patterns would be more erratic and of greater severity.. If the moons' orbits were too erratic, they would eventually collide, or one (or both) be flung out of Earth\u2019s orbit. A collision essentially end any life on Earth, or at least the vast majority. Losing both moons could also mean the end of life on Earth, but in a more gradual way. Adding more, similarly sized moons would only increase these effects by orders of magnitude. ",

Yeah, that huge meteor which was responsible for extinction of Dinosaurs in Cretaceous  period wouldn't have occurred because at least one of the moons would have attracted the meteor with a huge crater on its surface just like present moon.Coastal areas will be less populated and we may not find big cities near coasts. More moons means more gravitational pull on ocean water causing more and more tides - both in frequency and height. So people prefer not to live near coasts. And this makes economies based on fishing and Port operations to decline than what we have now but not completely gone! (Assuming Dinosaurs got extinct)Religions which are based on Lunar Calendar gets into dilemma on picking the appropriate moon for their auspicious days. Ramadan month might be very complicated in this scenarioLord Shiva of Hindu Mythology will fall in a dilemma in deciding which moon to carry on his head.More moon\"s\"light now at night and I guess nocturnal creatures don't like this. So they may turn to diurnal or become extinct if lot of moons are there.Almost every month we can find Solar Eclipses on Earth. And when all Lunar Eclipses occur at the same time, may be it gets difficult to differentiate between day and night!There will be skincare lotion for \"Moon Burns\" too!Few of the migratory birds, that were dependent on moon position, may loose their returning path or they wouldn't even have evolved!There might be a slight chance of mountains being taller than what they are now due to gravitational attraction of the moons.Earth would have bulged little more than present shapeAll Mars missions and other Extraterrestrial missions have to be calculated carefully so as not to bump into these moons while departing EarthMany folk stories & songs for kids based on Moon have to be restructured!

            "answer_text": "as such nothing would happen. but there could be one possible thing that the earth would stop rotating bit early than it would with one moon in its orbiti meant, the Moon's orbit (its circular path around the Earth) is indeed getting larger, at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. (The Moon's orbit has a radius of 384,000 km.) I wouldn't say that the Moon is getting closer to the Sun, specifically, though--it is getting farther from the Earth, so, when it's in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, it's closer, but when it's in the part of its orbit farthest from the Sun, it's farther away. The reason for the increase is that the Moon raises tides on the Earth. Because the side of the Earth that faces the Moon is closer, it feels a stronger pull of gravity than the center of the Earth. Similarly, the part of the Earth facing away from the Moon feels less gravity than the center of the Earth. This effect stretches the Earth a bit, making it a little bit oblong. We call the parts that stick out \"tidal bulges.\" The actual solid body of the Earth is distorted a few centimeters, but the most noticable effect is the tides raised on the ocean. Now, all mass exerts a gravitational force,  and the tidal bulges on the Earth exert a gravitational pull on the Moon. Because the Earth rotates faster (once every 24 hours) than the Moon orbits (once every 27.3 days) the bulge tries to \"speed up\" the Moon, and pull it ahead in its orbit. The Moon is also pulling back on the tidal bulge of the Earth, slowing the Earth's rotation. Tidal friction, caused by the movement of the tidal bulge around the Earth, takes energy out of the Earth and puts it into the Moon's orbit, making the Moon's orbit bigger (but, a bit pardoxically, the Moon actually moves slower!). The Earth's rotation is slowing down because of this. One hundred years from now, the day will be 2 milliseconds longer than it is now. This same process took place billions of years ago--but the Moon was slowed down by the tides raised on it by the Earth. That's why the Moon always keeps the same face pointed toward the Earth. Because the Earth is so much larger than the Moon, this process, called tidal locking, took place very quickly, in a few tens of millions of years. Many physicists considered the effects of tides on the Earth-Moon system. However, George Howard Darwin (Charles Darwin's son) was the first person to work out, in a mathematical way, how the Moon's orbit would evolve due to tidal friction, in the late 19th century. He is usually credited with the invention of the modern theory of tidal evolution. So that's where the idea came from, but how was it first measured? The answer is quite complicated, but I've tried to give the best answer I can, based on a little research into the history of the question. There are three ways for us to actually measure the effects of tidal friction. * Measure the change in the length of the lunar month over time. This can be accomplished by examining the thickness of tidal deposits preserved in rocks, called tidal rhythmites, which can be billions of years old, although measurements only exist for rhythmites that are 900 million years old. As far as I can find (I am not a geologist!) these measurements have only been done since the early 90's. * Measure the change in the distance between the Earth and the Moon. This is accomplished in modern times by bouncing lasers off reflectors left on the surface of the Moon by the Apollo astronauts. Less accurate measurements were obtained in the early 70's. * Measure the change in the rotational period of the Earth over time. Nowadays, the rotation of the Earth is measured using the Very Long Baseline Interferometry, a technique using many radio telescopes a great distance apart. With VLBI, the positions of quasars (tiny, distant, radio-bright objects) can be measured very accuarately. Since the rotating Earth carries the antennas along, these measurements can tell us the rotation speed of the Earth very accurately. However, the change in the Earth's rotational period was first measured using eclipses, of all things. Astronomers who studied the timing of eclipses over many centuries found that the Moon seemed to be accelerating in its orbit, but what was actually happening was the the Earth's rotation was slowing down. The effect was first noticed by Edmund Halley in 1695, and first measured by Richard Dunthorne in 1748--though neither one really understood what they were seeing. I think this is the earliest discovery of the effect. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets take a case of two moons. The idea of an Earth with two moons has been a science fiction staple for decades. More recently, real possibilities of an Earth with two moons have popped up. The properties of the Moon\u2019s far side has many scientists thinking that another moon used to orbit the Earth before smashing into the Moon and becoming part of its mass. Since 2006, astronomers have been tracking smaller secondary moons that our own Earth-Moon system captures; these metre-wide moons stay for a few months then leave. But what if the Earth actually had a second permanent moon today? How different would life be? Astronomer and physicist Neil F. Comins delves into this thought experiment, and suggests some very interesting consequences.  Our Earth-Moon system is unique in the solar system. The Moon is 1/81 the mass of Earth while most moons are only about 3/10,000 the mass of their planet. The size of the Moon is a major contributing factor to complex life on Earth. It is responsible for the high tides that stirred up the primordial soup of the early Earth, it\u2019s the reason our day is 24 hours long, it gives light for the variety of life forms that live and hunt during the night, and it keeps our planet\u2019s axis tilted at the same angle to give us a constant cycle of seasons. A second moon would change that. For his two-mooned Earth thought experiment, Comins proposes that our Earth-Moon system formed as it did \u2014 he needs the same early conditions that allowed life to form \u2014 before capturing a third body. This moon, which I will call Luna, sits halfway between the Earth and the Moon. Luna\u2019s arrival would wreak havoc on Earth. Its gravity would tug on the planet causing absolutely massive tsunamis, earthquakes, and increased volcanic activity. The ash and chemicals raining down would cause a mass extinction on Earth. But after a few weeks, things would start to settle. Luna would adjust to its new position between the Earth and the Moon. The pull from both bodies would cause land tides and volcanic activity on the new moon; it would develop activity akin to Jupiter\u2019s volcanic moon Io. The constant volcanic activity would make Luna smooth and uniform, as well as a beautiful fixture in the night sky. The Earth would also adjust to its two moons, giving life a chance to arise. But life on a two-mooned Earth would be different. The combined light from the Moon and Luna would make for much brighter nights, and their different orbital periods will mean the Earth would have fewer fully dark nights. This will lead to different kinds of nocturnal beings; nighttime hunters would have an easier time seeing their prey, but the prey would develop better camouflage mechanisms. The need to survive could lead to more cunning and intelligent breeds of nocturnal animals. Humans would have to adapt to the challenges of this two-mooned Earth. The higher tides created by Luna would make shoreline living almost impossible \u2014 the difference between high and low tides would be measured in thousands of feet. Proximity to the water is a necessity for sewage draining and transport of goods, but with higher tides and stronger erosion, humans would have to develop different ways of using the oceans for transfer and travel. The habitable area of Earth, then, would be much smaller. The measurement of time would also be different. Our months would be irrelevant. Instead, a system of full and partials months would be necessary to account for the movement of two moons. Eventually, the Moon and Luna would collide; like the Moon is now, both moons would be receding from Earth. Their eventual collision would send debris raining through Earth\u2019s atmosphere and lead to another mass extinction. The end result would be one moon orbiting the Earth, and life another era of life would be primed to start. ",

            "answer_text": "Difficult to fully answer this. It depends on what size of moon your are talking about. The most important this to note about the Earth/Moon system is how different it is to most of the other planets in the relative size of the moon to it's parent planet. Almost every other planet in our solar system has moons that are very small compared to the parent body; you can almost think of the Earth/moon as a dual planet. I think the very size of our moon precludes any other large secondary moon as I don't think a secondary moon could exist in a stable orbit, unless it was a small moon and much further out. In that case it would have very little affect on the Earth, beyond being a very bright object in the sky. The moons of Mars are in fact rather like this. Mars has two moons, but they are quite small, and I don't think they'd appear as moonlike discs in the Martian sky. How would a small moon affect the Earth? It might affect animal behaviour to some extent, but tidal forces would be negligable - if not our present large moon would tend to either pull it in to impact on the Earth or the primary moon, or more likely eject it from Earth's orbit. A similar fate of ejection would probably befall any small distant moon as well, as will also probably happen to our existing moon in the very distant future. Of course the earth could have formed with two small moons like Mars has. These could exit in Earth orbit, but would not exert the tidal forces that our current moon does, and nor could they help stabilise the Earth's rotation in the way our current moon does either. Life on Earth it it took off at all would evolve very differently in such a situation. There could be a sweet-state with a couple of medium sized moons in stable orbits, but the chances of this happening would be quite small. However the universe is a big place so maybe somewhere out there there are planetary systems like this. ",

It is a minor planet in solar orbit that, relative to Earth, orbits in a bean-shaped orbit that ultimately effectively describes a horseshoe, and which can transition into a quasi-satellite orbit.[4] It has been incorrectly called \"Earth's second moon\".[2][5] Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun.[6] Its orbit takes it inside the orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Mars.[6] Cruithne orbits the Sun in about 1 year but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around the Earth.[6]The name Cruithne is from Old Irish and refers to the early Picts (Irish: Cruthin) in the Annals of Ulster[6]and their eponymous king (\"Cruidne, son of Cinge\") in the Pictish Chronicle....\" @3753 Cruithne@Aten asteroid   ",

There would be huge differences in the planet\u2019s climate history and life may never have developed here, or may have developed and gone extinct. Our large moon keeps the Earth steady on its axis limiting the range of temperature variations with seasons. If the axis was able to flip to point the poles at the Sun (as on Uranus), half the planet would fry in continuous sunlight for nearly half the year, while the other hemisphere froze. The giant impact (hypothesised) which formed the Earth-Moon system, mixed the rocks of the Earth and the material which formed the moon into a molten mass, with masses of debris raining down on Earth. Residual heat from this remains in the core. The large moon in a very low orbit, created massive tides once things cooled enough for there to be liquid surface water. and at that time the Earth was spinning very fast from the oblique collision, making a day only about 5 hours long. It would not be possible to have multiple large moons in stable orbits, so with only small moons, the entire climate history and geological history of the planet would be different. ",

However location is important. If you put it parallel to our Moon\u2019s orbit, it will pull on the side the moon is facing. But remember, that moon also has a tug on the other side, the one the Moon is tugging on. Let\u2019s say the tug is 1/4th the Moon\u2019s tug. This causes the tides to be 1/4th more powerful. The same happens on the other side. If the moon were to be placed in an orbit where it is close to our current moon but doesn\u2019t collide with each other, it would be mayhem. When the moons allign, the side facing the moons would be mayhem. The combined gravitational pull of the two moons would change Earth\u2019s surface forever. The Earth\u2019s rotation would constantly cause the moons\u2019 tug to interact with every part of the world. Now if the moons were the sane size, this would somewhat be true. But size matters. A smaller moon means the moon could drag that moon towards it, resulting in collision. A bigger moon is the same. ",

Difficult to predict the extent of these, without computing a potential size, mass, and orbit, but if the orbits were NOT the same (i.e., one moon each side of the earth), the tides would be very variable, as gravitational attraction would combine when they were close together in the sky. Other effects might include increased seismic activity, extremes of nighttime luminosity, not to mention interactions between the moons, which could be cataclysmic, possibly even leading to \u2018rings\u2019 a la Saturn around the Earth.

Assuming the combined weight would be similar to what our single moon weighs or less, the effects wouldn\u2019t be terribly drastic. Tides would be much more complicated, obviously, and two moons could possibly affect plate tectonics, leaving Earth\u2019s crust even more dynamic than it is now. There is a theory that without our single large moon to create tidal pools life would not have arisen on Earth, but this is largely discounted. Today most theories suggest that life arose around deep sea vents long before migrating closer to the surface where solar radiation would have destroyed most early life forms. If this was the case, life might actually have started sooner on a world with two moons since there would likely be more thermal springs, but the truth of th ematter is, until we find life on a world with multiple satellites we may never know with certainty.

Tides would be similarly interesting, especially when the three moons were in alignment and the mother of all king tides came crashing in. Those are just the first two things that come to mind, but it would definitely make life more challenging! Note that in my hypothetical, I made the moons all different sizes, distances, and orbital periods, because that\u2019s the likely scenario that would allow three moons (or two, or nine, or thirty-seven\u2026) to stay separate and not crash into each other.

The only positive side to having such a massive new moon would be that Earth would have a much better shield against solar storms, large asteroids and other nasty stuff like that. ",

Gravitational offset might effect the amount of gravity we feel, making us lighter,(for example). ",

Any other moon would likely change it\u2019s face to the earth, and that would have prompted earlier the concept of celestial bodies spinning and being three dimensional, not just discs. ",

Ganymede is the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System; but its mass-ratio to Jupiter, is only 1/156 the ratio of the Moon (Luna) to the Earth. Similarly, Saturn has visible rings, because its moons are larger in proportion to it, than to Jupiter\u2019s moons to Jupiter. ",

We would probably be expecting a whole lot of debris and destruction in the near future, as any body coming too close to the Earth or Moon of sizeable mass will disintegrate instantly. This would be compounded by the chaotic motion that three or more bodies face (or the new Earth System). Further, tides would change to be slightly irregular, due to the pull of both Moons, and very large mini tsunami-like tides could be expected when all two moons and the Sun line up with the Earth. ",

If there were 2 moons, then when they were either in conjunction or on opposite sides of the planet, the tides would be at maximum. While depending on the size of the moons, the tidal effects could be nullified or at least reduced when the moons were a quarter of their orbits apart. The gravitational effect of moons does reduce with increasing distance, though, so the size of the moons and their orbits would really dictate the effects. ",
