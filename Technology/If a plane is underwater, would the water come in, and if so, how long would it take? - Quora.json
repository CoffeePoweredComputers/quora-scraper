            "answer_text": "if a plane is underwater, it is already well on its way to the bottom. I\u2019m presuming that we\u2019re talking about an airplane that is basically intact following an unscheduled water landing (crash). Most aircraft have catastrophic damage following impact (landing). The consciousness of the airplane occupants will dictate whether any will survive. Being under water the plane is already sinking. Imagine throwing a several thousand pound rock into the water. The sink rate is unimaginable. The water pressure at the resultant sink rate will collapse the fuselage within seconds. Those occupants who weren\u2019t able to extricate themselves immediately following impact would stand no chance following fuselage collapse. Survival following a water landing is dependent on the minutes that the wreckage remains afloat. The float time will be dependant on trapped air within the wreckage. The water will displace these trapped air pockets in seconds but no more than minutes. The water landing on the Hudson River is a classic example of every thing going right following their engine failure. They were indeed, very lucky that day.  ",
