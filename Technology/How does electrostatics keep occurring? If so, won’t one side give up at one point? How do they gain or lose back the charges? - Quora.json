            "answer_text": "In the case of the similar situation of annihilation it appears to be a case of two opposites which totally neutralize and annihilate each other. However in case of \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d charge it appears possible that it is closer to a question of one being more and the other being less, but of the same quality. Since the free agent appears to be represented by electrons it is possible that more charge means more of what we call charge, while the opposite polarity in actuality is one with less or totally without charge, but which we presently call positive. Electrostatics would then simply be nature\u2019s way of wanting to equally distribute existing charge but that the nature of charge itself and the phenomenon of quanta makes it hard or impossible to share it totally evenly.
