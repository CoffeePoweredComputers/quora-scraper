            "answer_text": "To best of my knowledge\u2026..1. Whole of UK is connected with copper wire not fibre optics\u2026..2. There are only two telecom companies who own door delivery facility in UK they are BT and Kingston communications\u2026.3. As a free market rest of the providers i.e ISPs are able to rent lines and sublet it to their customers.4. So the broadband experience is the same wherever you go\u2026.. But the customer service experience change as the ISP\u2019s customer needs\u2026i.e if your ISP (internet service provider) needs more customers then (s)he will bend over backwards to serve you\u2026 giving you a pleasurable customer experience, on the other hand, if the organisation is required to control their customer base by monopolies commision, then even your reasonable requests are down the drain\u2026.5. There were some trunking companies like Atlantic Telecom who wanted to build bigger pipes between towns of UK did not succeed and got sold off to talk-talk for example.6. After being a loyal customer for orange telecom on mobile and fixed line customer for nine years, how I was treated by BT on takeover of EE is only for me and a few experienced it to know.7. incidentally my current fixed line provider is Sky and mobile provider is Three.8. During the course of the year they are to be changed as Sky is already announced that they are hiking my rental by 25%9. Please belief the minimum service agreement is governed by not this ISPs, it is governed by OFCOM\u2026. therefore you should get the minimum service level wherever you decide to go\u2026.. on the other hand the service level\u2026.10. The service level is controlled by mergers and monopolies commision\u2026 if mergers and monopolies commision says that your service provider has to shed some customer count then that will happen\u2026..11. Sum it all up, this is not a traditional wedding where \u201cuntil death do us apart\u201d\u2026. this is a contractual relationship, can only last until the contract period, let it be 12, 18 or 24 months to the most\u2026..12. Therefore it is potluck if you are with a company who are growing and in the need of customers or who acquire smaller companies and have to shed customers periodically. Coming back to your question\u2026 BT or SKYAll I can say isBT owns most of the doorstep delivery for landline & BroadbandwhileSky is becoming the monopoly in virtual landline & broadband market I hope you understand my answer, please do not ask me weather it is better to be in the frying pan or the fire\u2026For me, there is a place near the fire which is hot & cool enough but manageable..Once again it is commercial world, and \u201ctill death do apart\u201d doesn\u2019t work ",

            "answer_text": "Ex BT customer here. Here\u2019s a recent survey with credible results: Best And Worst Broadband Providers In The UK For 2019 - Which? You\u2019ll note that both Sky and BT are near the bottom of the table. My current ISP is Zen[1] , ranked number 1 for several years running, but which most people have never heard of. One of their positive points from my perspective is that they are a pure ISP provider (they also provide landline phones but not TV) and this shows in their attitude to customer service. Soon after joining them, I had a disconnection. I called them, got an immediate answer by an actual human who understood the problem, didn\u2019t try to bullshit me, carried out some checks while I was on the call, and fixed it in under 30 minutes.
