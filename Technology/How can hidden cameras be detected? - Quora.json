            "answer_text": "Easiest way is to use your webcam on your computer, if it's one that is detached and free from computer on a wire, you swing it around your room filming slowly, up high down low, all around, AND out the window at trees and telephone poles and then have you a look see on playback on computer or smart tv. Your webcam eye picks up their camera eye showing and glowing red, or white, up on your screen. Or use your phone and do same thing then upload to computer and it will show up them. Your human eye can't detect it but your phone and computer eye can. Your gamecam, same thing. It takes 2 devices to be able to see it. But you can't miss it, it will glow loud and proud. Or if no computer use your phone and film room and outside of your front door AND YOUR tv. Then cast back to smart tv and voila you can see the red. Just like animals they see the red without any help. To put me to the test film yourself using your remote control (pressing the buttons) while filming then cast to tv and see how bright red your remote control shines out see hoe bright it really is?! That's how animals see the cameras out in the wild. Or why your dog/cat shies away from you and your camera. They see the red. Always film/record your TV when you are checking your rooms to be sure its not filming YOU! On playback on another device it shows the red eye of the other cameras lenses. Try it. It's very interesting! Samsung tv's are known to have cameras in them. Also, now this is my own theory, I believe our light bulbs are filming us constantly. Yes light bulbs! Why do I say this? I was using an app that you use to reverse lookup a phone number the other day and part of the information it released was location where call was placed. It went to Google maps. On map it had a pin on an address. I clicked it. It took me inside a room in this fellas house. I could look all around the room just not leave room. From in the middle of room I could swing around 360 degrees. I saw their computer over on the desk and it was not on. How am I all over this guys room? I could read what the paperwork said on his desk!! Got me to wondering how? The computer was off. So not there. What else is in the room? A light bulb. It has to be the light bulb. You know the light bulbs they are making us buy. Then then I saw on a spy sight that they actually make these bulbs! For 5 dollars. So it is incredibly easy for our government to put a camera in every room in every house in America! Also I was sitting in the dark the other night going pee and had the door shut and noticed a moving beam of light coming down from the ceiling and wondered why? So, idea here, according to my theory I should be able to film my bathroom in light and dark and see that camera eye of their bulb camera eye! I will try that later! So Good luck and remember it's not just paranoia when it's really happening!! ",

            "answer_text": "Do you feel like you're being watched? Maybe you just want to make sure your privacy is protected. Here are some different ways to locate hidden cameras and microphones.http://...Method 1 of 3: Initial Sweep 1Do a physical search of the premises. This involves a slow, meticulous sweep of the room or building you suspect is wired.Look around for anything that seems different or out of place, such as flower arrangements, pictures on the wall out of level or in unusual areas, or lampshades that don't look normal. Check for smoke detectors you didn't add, look for a speaker that might have a camera in it.Look inside flower pots, light fixtures, and other places where a microphone transmitter can easily be hidden.Look under couch cushions, table tops, and shelves. Underneath shelves and table tops are excellent places for miniature cameras.Look for wires that do not seem to go anywhere, such as an appliance or other familiar device. \"Hardwired\" (that is, not wireless) spy equipment is less common with modern technology, but is still used for permanent surveillance in commercial businesses for loss prevention.2Listen as you walk the entire room quietly. Many small, motion-sensitive cameras make an almost inaudible click or buzz when they operate.http://...Method 2 of 3: Use Darkness 1Turn off the lights and look around for tiny red or green LED lights. Some microphones have \"power on\" indicator lights, and if the person who sets it up is careless they may fail to cover or deactivate this feature.2While the lights are off, grab a flashlight and carefully examine all mirrors.These can be made transparent from one side so that a camera can see through, but they rely on the observer's side being darker than the area observed in order to keep the other side of the mirror reflective.3Search for pinhole cameras in the dark. A pinhole camera might have a charge-coupled device (CCD) sitting behind a tiny opening in a wall or object. Get an empty toilet paper tube and a flashlight. Put the tube over one eye like a telescope and close your other eye. As you sweep the flashlight over the room, pay attention to any small glimmers that reflect back at you.http://...Method 3 of 3: Use a Signal Detector 1Buy an RF signal detector or other bug detector. If you seriously believe you are being spied on, buy an RF (radio frequency) detector and do a sweep of your room, building, or home. These portable devices are small, simple to use, and fairly inexpensive. However, there are bugs that use multiple frequencies in rapid sequence called \"spread spectrum\" that an RF detector will not pick up. These bugs are used by professionals and require a spectrum analyzer and an experienced technician to find.2Use your cell phone to pick up an electromagnetic field. Place a call on your cell phone, then wave the device around where you think there might be a camera or microphone. If you can hear a clicking noise on the call, it means your phone might be interfering with an electromagnetic field.",
