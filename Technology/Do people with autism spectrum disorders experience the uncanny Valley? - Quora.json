            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a really good question. The important thing to understand about the uncanny valley is that it\u2019s a concept that has never really been tested. It\u2019s just generally accepted because it \u201cfeels about right.\u201d A lot of questions haven\u2019t been answered. Does everyone have it?Is the \u201cgeography\u201d of the valley the same for everyone?Can it change over time for a given person?I\u2019m going to guess that everyone on the spectrum has at least a bit of uncanny valley. It\u2019s going to vary a lot from person to person, but it does seem to be much much smaller (perhaps an uncanny ditch) for autistic folks on average. I think we\u2019re also more prone to normalizing the things that other people find uncanny. What we find uncanny at first just becomes a quirky feature later. I think this partly explains the observation that certain fandoms contain a higher than average percentage of people on the spectrum. These are fandoms with anthropomorphized or exaggerated human characters, like anime, furry, brony, etc. The fact that these characters \u201clook weird\u201d is much less likely to bother us. ",

But, no I did not want to try asking further to call out the systematic prejudices that are clearly being intentionally fed into their learning by humans. Yes, I guess that completely is secondary to your ask, and that is because personally I wanted to share something interesting because the answer to this question is likely disappointing\u2026 Depends on the individual, just like with neurotypicals, but we can run a study if the robot lobby complains or dishes out the dollars :) Hope this helps \u2014 Thanks Diego!

I suspect it varies like everything else to do with autistic people, but as autistic people are often the subjects of uncanny valley type feelings we're more likely on average to sympathize with or find innocuous things that others find creepy. They already say we're like mannequins, after all. Why wouldn't we be given to sympathy for them? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great question. I don't think the answer is black and white. Many of us on the autism spectrum suffer from alexithymia and this can make it difficult or cause feelings to fluctuate. I do believe heightened curiosity is a common autistic trait and we tend to not be judgemental because we know how unpleasant it feels. We tend to like to take the time to learn and understand something but can become easily overwhelmed too. This can make us less likely to fear what we don't understand and we may not be bothered by how lifelike a robotic may appear - we may in fact be quite fascinated by it. Some of us have sensory processing issues though and may feel that something so lifelike is quite discomforting. For me I feel a mixture of both due to alexithymia. Sometimes I'm deeply fascinated by anything unusual or out of the ordinary, but can at times feel quite uncomfortable, overloaded or even confused. ",
