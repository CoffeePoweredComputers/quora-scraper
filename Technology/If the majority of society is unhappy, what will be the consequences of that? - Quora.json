            "answer_text": "Unhappiness in individual people show in different ways, some find escaping in effort to get away, physically ran away from the problems. Others find depression and self blame hence render themselves ineffective. Some will develop habits, drinking or drugs which start as attempts to remove symptoms of unhappiness but then these substance can act us triggers to violent thinking, then acting out. Mass killings in institutions and acts of terror. Targeting innocent public but each trying to change their circumstances but in despair choosing oblivion. People will eventually get together and discuss problems causing the difficulties and then find solutions to eliminate them. First they will protest to agencies deemed able to correct matters and also make others aware. Many so called governments around the world are fighting their own people, others create situations to distract the general public by finding excuses to wage war on usually weaker nations to sending trouble makers to die in foreign lands for glorious nation. Those which return usually physically and mentally broken, unable to fit into community, sometimes made ill by chemicals they were made to encounter with proper gear in the conflicts yet their own nation denying their suffering. Having seen killing and these trained killers will practice their art and encourage others to join them with the country. ",

            "answer_text": "Just look at the other answers. Evidently mankind is going to hell in a handbasket. And it\u2019s all our own fault because we are stupid and mean and \u2018don\u2019t pay attention\u2019 to History. We love god too much, we don\u2019t love God enough. Everyone is lazy or beaten down by the system. People who have it made, don\u2019t help anyone else. There seems to be a strange place in people\u2019s lives, when stuff was good, but then \u2018the man\u2019 went and screwed it all up. I like this site because so often people do look on the bright side. I can\u2019t begin to understand the vitriol this question brought out. The worlds that a lot of people wrote about will be our destination, because we are mean, selfish, stupid, whatever. That\u2019s not going to happen. At 65 and after a lot of study of History, I\u2019m willing to say that sometimes people do not act like Human Beings. But life is not made up of people who can only be good or evil, smart or dumb. Life is mostly the people in between the extremes. In this world, there will always be the unhappy (the poor), but you cannot make people be happy when they are not. And being unhappy is just a part of life. But \u2026 there\u2019s always a but, right? MY life does not sound like a great life. I\u2019ve lost two husband (by the time I was 47), my daughter has been on drugs, off and on for 15 years. At 40 she decided to have a baby with a father that beat her when he found out she was pregnant. When I thought she had her life together, I gave her over $100,000 (my entire life savings, except some I had to use to pay taxes) to buy her father\u2019s house. Yes, that\u2019s right, she went right back to drugs. I drive a 20 year old little Toyota Tacoma. My step daughter is mad at me because I won\u2019t sell 10 acres of land for half of what it\u2019s worth, so she can blow that money on something, I don\u2019t even know what. But \u2026there\u2019s always a but, right? I am a happy person. I volunteer, I donate blood, I work with special needs people. I accept what I must and enjoy the rest. I really think people are about as happy as they decide to be. I decided to be happy. I wish everyone would decide to be happy. ",
