            "answer_text": "Because it took so long for my phone to finally receive the upgrade from Jelly Bean (4.3) to KitKat (4.4), I ended up reading a lot about this. Let me summarize it for you.   Image source: Pocket Now   Visual Changes When you update from Jelly Bean to KitKat, the first things you'll likely* notice are:  Update to the interface with more white elements, instead of blueThin font for all clock numbersApps can now be fully 'full screen'Generally, the design feels much lighter* The difference in appearance will depend heavily on the phone and carrier you're using. For example, if you are using an HTC device, HTC will have added their own layer of visual eye candy on top of the native Android OS. If you happen to have Verizon as a carrier in the US, you'll notice that they too have added a bunch of different apps and visual aspect on top of HTC's version of Android as well. As a result, what you see might deviate greatly from what I described here.   Image source: Ars Technica Additionally, apps are now given the room to use the whole screen.   Image source: Ars Technica - left Jelly Bean, right KitKat  Perfomance Improvements Performance improvements are not the most sexy things about the upgrade of Jelly Bean to KitKat, but they can make your phone feel like a much newer phone again. From all the changes under the hood, the following changes will be most noticeable: Support for lower RAM phones (512 MB and up)In the past, Android was built for phones with at least 1 GB of RAM, but with the improvements made in KitKat, phones with 512 MB of RAM will work well now. The changes have also led to Android being able to run to some extend on phones with memories down to 340 MB [1] Core Applications SpeedupYou'll notice that the core apps will startup faster, as in 20% faster [2]. A lot of work has gone into the core app performance, making your phone feel quite a bit faster than it used to. [1] Android version history[2] Android KitKat: A Noticeable Bump In Performance   Overall, KitKat is a major improvement over Jelly Bean, and if you get the chance to upgrade your phone, especially if Jelly Bean feels slowish to you, I'd recommend you do.
