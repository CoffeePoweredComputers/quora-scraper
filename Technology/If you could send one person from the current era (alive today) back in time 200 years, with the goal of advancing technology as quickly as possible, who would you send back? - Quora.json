            "answer_text": " When I consider that 200 years ago means the destination year is 1812, I realise how many massive events and power struggles went on in those two centuries.  The events of 1812 include Luddites attacking mills in the UK, the USA declaring war on the UK and Napoleon invading Russia.  Native American society had not yet been destroyed, Australia hadn't even started her genocide in earnest, and many environments that would be scarred and many species that would become extinct had not yet been touched by human impact. So I would like the person we sent to be broadly educated regarding history so that they may have some sense of the effects they may have as deliberate or side effects of what they say and do. I believe the person would have to be a great communicator.  It is hard to explain new ideas to people.  They are likely to face resistance and even hostility - from all sorts of people.  Apart from speaking well, it would be good if the person could write well. As technologists go, I don't think extremely advanced knowledge such as high energy particle physics would have far reaching effects.  And I think computing developed about as fast as could have been hoped. I also think that relatively simple ideas were key to preventing much spread of disease and suffering.  (Separating sewage from drinking water, dangers of mites on fleas on rats, smoking causes cancer, cooking food properly, washing hands with soap and water, etc etc.) So a doctor is not essential although an understanding of health is. There are various ways to advance technology.  Lifting economic activity, improving education, conducting fundamental science, contributing ideas, inventions and demonstrations, improving general health, broadening the group of people who consider developing technology and preventing disasters that kill lots of people including scientists.  Note that wars may breakeven because while they kill scientists, they tend to result in rapid technological development including health care.  However, preventing the Holocaust and other genocides in Russia, China, Cambodia and other places would only be a good thing. Ideally I would be able to name a food scientist or agricultural chemist who fits the bill.  But I can't - even with Google's help - which just means I'm ignorant. Instead I'm going to vote for Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg from Berkeley.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg At 79, I think he's a bit too old.  Considering his mission may involve ships and storms and horses and time travel etc. However, we know Steven can argue for science in front of a panel (he testified before Congress regarding a supercollider) and can write about science for the common man (he has written numerous books and articles about science for the general public). But perhaps most importantly, we know he can argue for science in a world more used to obeying the authority of the Church. That may be the biggest problem to overcome in connecting with the people of 1812.  And it is a clue as to what may most benefit the advance of technology - the advance of reason and the scientific method. Greater rationality might see women's oppression ended sooner and that would swell the ranks of non-domestic technologists. ",

            "answer_text": "The beginning of the industrial research laboratory started with chemists deriving new compounds (such as dyes) from coal tar. The money was quite lucrative  but only until competitors discovered how to also make the compound. So it was a never-ending race of research. This industry made scientific research into a commercial enterprise and the wild profits to be had spurred the growth of these research labs. That was all around 1848. If you got a chemist back an extra 35 years, especially one that was experienced in exactly this sort of chemical manufacture, you would likely kick start a lot of technological development forward by a similar amount of time, maybe more if our scientist made advances at a faster rate then the original labs did, given his body of learned knowledge. You could pick a Nobel Prize winner, but would probably be better off with some person with a lot of industrial chemistry experience, rather than a modern research scientist. tl;dr answer: Walt White (who is technically fictional) ",
