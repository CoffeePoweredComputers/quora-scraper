            "answer_text": "The paper especially the 4 GS papers were quite different. I dont think they were tough but they were unpredictable, not from those classical coaching sources. As far as i am concerned, I prepared for mains after my prelims got over and that also already being in a job so didnt give myself too much of a chance, yet i think i did ok by attempting all the GS questions. Yeah but in my optional i messed it up a little bit especially in paper one and I think that will cost my chances. Another mistake that i did is opt for Patna as a centre inspite of living closer to Ranchi, as Patna was ravaged by flood like situations\u2026and it was difficult especially during the exam breaks to find a proper resting place. Btw thankfully I have also qualified Indian Forest Services so its nice in a way since its only two months away and so, i think it will keep my mind deviated from getting too frustrated. One thing i will suggest the candidates that in addition to just reading through newspapers and collecting facts and news\u2026try to have a point of view on each and every topic..that view should not be of too much depth but at least some \u201cbeyond the lines\u201d Views should be there\u2026.that will help in the GS paper. The coaching and other materials are just fact feeding machines and once you sit in the exam they would turn out to be only of 20\u201330% value as there you have to write quickly and you dont have too much time too recall points. So if your mind is adapted to forming own point of view, then that would be of immense help. ",
