            "answer_text": "Everyone has a gimmick. Smaller, lighter, lite weight, fantastic gain, easy to use, low cost! Reality is a full size quarter wave radiator is rule of thumb. It\u2019s what basic good antennas are based on. Anything less is a compromise. Multi-band antennas incorporated together will exhibit gain, but 1/4 wave radiators are what Antenna designs strive for. Many manufacturers produce Tri-Band and 5 band beams. Sure they work, but again a half wave radiator with director and reflector half wave works best at resonant frequency. That is no gimmic! W2hp ",
