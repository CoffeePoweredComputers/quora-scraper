            "answer_text": "The system concept becomes even more useful by including two additional elements: feedback and control. A system with feedback and control functions is sometimes called a cybernetic system, that is, a self-monitoring, self-regulating system. \u2022Feedback is data about the performance of a system. For example, data about sales performance are feedback to a sales manager. Data about the speed, altitude, attitude, and direction of an aircraft are feedback to the aircraft\u2019s pilot or autopilot. \u2022Control involves monitoring and evaluating feedback to determine whether a system is moving toward the achievement of its goal. The control function then makes the necessary adjustments to a system\u2019s input and processing components to ensure that it produces proper output. For example, a sales manager exercises control when reassigning salespersons to new sales territories after evaluating feedback about their sales performance. An airline pilot, or the aircraft\u2019s autopilot, makes minute adjustments after evaluating the feedback from the instruments to ensure that the plane is exactly where the pilot wants it to be.  ",

            "answer_text": "Proper feedback is very important in closed loop system. Feedback is a value of output parameter given to the controller for comparison process so that it can compare the output with the set velue or set parameter. For example: Lets take a process of temperature control of a simple tank having water in it. It is having heater for maintaining the temperature of water. Temperature measurement device is there for water temperature measurement. Now the desired temperature of water is 60 degree Celsius. So seting this value in controller as set velue. As the water is being heated temperature rises. Measuring device ie RTD measures temp. And gives singnal to controller as feedback. The controller compares this feedback with set value and control the heater settings. So the temperature is controlled. ",
