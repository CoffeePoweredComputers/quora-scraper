            "answer_text": "Hi Very Good Question. A Good Astrologer has a Past, Present and a Future Where It has started? I was born in Orthodox Brahmin Family of Vaishnava Sampradaya. I have been exposed to daily Rituals as well as mantra Recitation. My Great Grand Father used to be Mysore King Court Priest/Astrologer. Before Independence, my Grand Father Family moved out and Settled outside Chennai a small beautiful Village called Neiveli in Tiruvallur District and they become landlords, by the gifts given Mysore King  How it changed Effect of Venus. I used to learn Astrology through my father out of passion. But my father did not wanted me to pursue this career. In fact he has knew that, I need to study Electrical Engineering due to placement of Mars, forming Pancha Maha Purusha Yoga in my chart, I have joined engineering, kept my interest in Astrology. Due to placement of Guru and Relationship of Guru with 6th House made me to Choose Teaching Profession. Also 2nd Lord in 11th House, made sense , that through my speech I get my Income, which is Teaching also true for profession like Astrology. Due to Benefic placement of Venus,Which represents women, luxury and comfort. I used to get lot of comfort in every aspect of life. more so all the Women were supportive in my life [Sister, Mother, Colleague and Wife} Since Venus is Sukra, in tamil it is called Velli (Silver). The Famous Vishnu Temple is called Srirangam, deity is called Rangan or Rangarajan and that Actual village name is velliyur.   Now how that related to me is Before I could complete, my Father\u2019s friend\u2019s Friend started Engineering College, he gave me admission in his college, I am the First batch Student. His name is R.Rangarajan. See the Connection. I got married and I get lot of support from my father in law, His name is N.Rangarajan. See the connection I am Pursuing Ph.D and Supervisor and his name is P.Rangarajan. See the Connection. One Rangarajan gave me Education. Another Rangarajan gave me Life Partner Third Rangarajan giving me boost in Career. It changed my life for good . I was born in Moola Naksthra, Basically it means Root. I have general Inclination towards knowing root of things, knowledge and wisdom Moola also has huge natural Psychic power, power can become lethal and destructive if it is not controlled mantra sadhana. If its not done it will bring person\u2019s fall due to unbalanced energy, own fall. Since I knew this from childhood and I kept phase with my Mantra Recitation and Sadhana Thirst for Wisdom and Knowledge, created passion towards Hidden knowledge, which includes Astrology and Scientific Research. My father knew that I will eventually get involved in Astrology later part of my life and will become famous. so he insisted me to focus on Engineering Education and to have stable career. Rahu Due to placement of Rahu in my chart, there is always obstacle in everything I did, and then eventually it has brough lot of success. My Marriage got fixed, suddenly my father fell ill, he underwent surgery, was recovering slowly but then sudden turn of events he passed away just 4 days before my marriage. Marriage got postponed, and then later I got married.My wife got pregnant and then suddenly she had abortion.Again after few years she got pregnant, we had our first child.I was working for particular organisation, but the growth was not there.I thought of shifting career, I got job in industry so moved out of my home town. Was there just for few months, sudden of change of events, I got back to Home town. But then shifted back to same career and now joined in one of the Top Organisation.Mars As I mentioned I have Pancha Maha Purusha Yoga. It has given me strong physical features, leadership qualities and Stand up for rights, irrespective of people and situation. In Organisation who ever given trouble to me, I have seen them screwing their life in front of my eyes, which was unbelievable., Right in front of my eyes.If your karma is powerful, god lets you see the people who screwed you, screw themselves.There were many occasion I have stood for my rights, I received my Rights, which would in normal case would be out of norm or world, Rest of the people.I have fought for my Key Benefit from the organisation , none had requested in the history of Organisation, I did and I got things done, which was out of the world experience rest of my colleague. They were Awe Stuck.Sun Due to uncomforable position of Sun I could not progress well during my Sun periodI could not rise my Income and save much during that time and I know the reason.Key Experiences (Dasha and Timings) I had this huge loan/Debt for number of years and I wanted to close, but it had not happened. Suddenly [Though I knew it was not sudden, its chage of Dasha] when that Dasha Changed, my powerful Dasha operated, I received huge money from unexpected Source, and Paid off that Huge loan, in matter of days. It was unbelievable and I could not believe [But I knew it will happen as I knew my Dasha Timings as well as my Chart]One time there was Attrition/ Reduction was going on in my organisation. I had difference of opinion with my Boss who was so mean to me, wanted to send me out.I got frustrated and I had given my Resignation. But then my senior Boss spoke to me and asked me withdraw Resignation during the time of Attrition! Can you ImagineIn 2015 there was flooding in chennai There was no power and water in entire part of chennai for 3days. But then in my home there was not even drop water stagnation, and best part no power failure for 3days. But my relatives who stayed two streets away, went without food, water, and power for 3 days!!!. Actually I have performed number of homas in my home, by myself, a month ago, and I knew the connection.Long time ago, I have predicted to my colleague who had vision in only one eye, that his vision in that eye will drop and he has to undergo surgery after 1 1/2 years, told him after that his vision will improve. Exactly 18 months later, his vision dropped, he underwent surgery, and recovered his vision for good. I felt happy that I could make changes in person\u2019s life, to make the people make positive decision and life.I predicted to another colleague who was unhappy that his marriage was delayed for long. I have predicted to him that its for good, in case if it happened earlier, it would have resulted marital discord and dispute. I told him he will get married in 6 months time to highly Educated person. As it turned out, he did get married after 6 months, to a Meritorious doctor. He again asked me for child prediction, I told him he will have two child, both are boys. Prediction came true and he was excited and thanked me for his prediction.I disguised myself as a layman / as client to all the astrologers, and tried to understand their mode or way of working. I have spent considerable Amount of Money (Infact Huge Money to them), Time and Energy. I found out including many leading Astrologers, they are just trying to get by. 90% don\u2019t know the subject, only 10% knew but they are too busy in milking money from politicians and Businessman.I knew longtime ago, even if my father had told me that My life will get changed after certain point of time in my life, and it will come in too fast phase. I realize back then and now .. how things were true and real. I can keep going on , Let me stop here as it will become monotonous.. Astrology is a true science for those who believe in, because they control the planets in their life, for those who don\u2019t, they are fools to obey the planets Let me complete with my personal Analogy Lets say You have been living in your home for years. You know every corner of your home. Then say suddenly power goes off in the middle of the night, its pitch dark. You find its very difficult to identify the objects, and you get up, get banged with your sofa. Though you know where the sofa is, in spite of knowing this you get hurt. This is like getting influenced by planet, obeying them. We become fools and slaves to planets. Instead of earlier situation, say you have your torch light ready in hand, you turn on, now nothing changes. Everything is there for us to see we can go comfortably from where we are to where we want to be. That light is astrology. It\u2019s a wonderful tool. If you understand clearly, outside circumstances, situation and obstacles does not change, its only our perspective and vision changed. We operate from whole new perspective, we can make changes in our life that will bring the results we want. So by using astrology, we are taking of planets, controlling them instead of getting influenced by them. Through astrology we are not become weak, astrology makes us stronger. This is my personal Experience. Hope it helps you. Astrologer can lie and go can go WRONG, but not ASTROLOGY AND VEDIC SCIENCE . Please UP VOTE if you like my personal experience. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be a non-believer. I did not care much about astrology and used to mock the discussions and rituals around this topic. I was living a very happy, active and mentally healthy life. I was quite successful in whatever I was doing. Then an era started when my Mom got my kundali reviewed by a well qualified astrologer. He mentioned that my sadhe-saati and some planetary transition was about to begin. He mentioned that I will remain fickle minded during that tenure and my labour won\u2019t produce fruitful results. I overheard this conversation and got worried. After some time the predictions started manifesting. I became fickle minded. Any plan which was not giving early signs of fruitful results, I used to change that. I was mentally worried and always used to remain in a state of confusion. I discussed this with my Father and told him how I overheard this conversation and how true those predictions were. I developed a strong respect for that astrologer. Then my father laughed. He made me realise that how my belief in the predictions and a change in the state of mind due to the fear of anticipation had led me to disaster. I realised how right he was. With a very light heart I started mocking the predictions and laughed at my judgement. My state of mind became happier. Which in turn resulted to determined efforts . Its been around 12 years and I did not face any kind of problem due to planetary transitions. For every problem I was able to figure out the root cause. I live a very healthy & mentally happy life till now. Hence I would say that astrology has changed my life twice. Once for the disaster and once for the enlightenment. Astrology might or might not be true but remaining away from it might be the best thing you could do to yourself. Do not be weak minded or weak hearted. Do not remain in confusions. Do not overthink. Do whatever you want with positive frame of mind and a sheer determination. Things will automatically take care of themselves. ",
