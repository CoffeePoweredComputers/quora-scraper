            "answer_text": "Starting a company in general requires lots of research. And the most important aspect of starting a new company is in the question itself. To be able to identify which industry one wants to start a company in, is in itself a very big step. The multimedia industry has grown in the past decade. There are so many companies out there in this industry. Building a successful multimedia industry will mean, bringing something unique to the table. First of all, I will suggest researching about a few successful multimedia companies out there. Look at the features and services they have to offer. Above all, look at the psychology behind the companies. Demographics of the customers that these successful companies serve. To be on the safe side, examine small to medium sized successful multimedia companies first. Read what the critics are saying about them. You can capitalize on what they lack. Write a very detailed business plan and make changes as you proceed. And above all...believe in yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Target marketing should be priority in the beginning. Who are your customers? How can you get them to notice you? Engage and start conversation whenever and wherever you can. Streamline your process. You\u2019re not going to be able to hire a full team when your starting off. Automate wherever possible. For instance, if you\u2019re overloaded with design projects, subscribing to a design service like Penji is perfect for you. You\u2019re going to be able to get more done, and your clients will be happy. Turnaround times are 24\u201348 hours so you\u2019ll be able to meet your deadlines way ahead of time. And it fits into your budget. Choose a niche. If you\u2019re a pro in the food industry, you\u2019ll attract those clients. If you\u2019re a pro in hospitality, you\u2019ll be working with those businesses. Study them and become an expert. ",
