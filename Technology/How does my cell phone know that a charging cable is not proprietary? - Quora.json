            "answer_text": "A few different ways are possible. It is important to note that it is not the cable it detects, but the electronics on the other side of the cable. The cell phone can tell that the charge current is lower or much higher than should be at the current state of charge. This would indicate that the max charge of the charging electronics is different than the proprietary electronics.USB can transmit information in addition to charging, as you probably know given the fact that you can load info to your computer, probably have used a sub flash drive, etc. Often electronics will send singals on the communication buses to indicate what the devices are, sometimes called a 'handshake.\u2019 The phone will expect a certain signals or pattern of bits to indicate the charger type. If it is unknown, or not the correct one, then an error will be flagged.",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't. USB cables have four pins and four wires. Some USB charging cables have the two data pins shorted together. That leaves the plus and minus wires to charge your phone. If your phone depends on having the two data pins being shorted together then it may complain about the cable being improper. This is kind of silly but the phone manufacturer may be trying to sell their own cables or charger. Buy a Charging cable instead of a Sync (data) cable and your phone will stop complaining. There is no black magic going on here :-) ",
