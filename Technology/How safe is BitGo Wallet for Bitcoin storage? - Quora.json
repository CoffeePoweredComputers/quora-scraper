            "answer_text": "BitGo is considered as one of the safest options when it comes to Bitcoin storage. What BitGo (USA) offers is a centralized way to manage cryptocurrencies. There are other companies, which are offering comparable solutions like Cobo[1] (China), Custody Coinbase[2] (USA) and Tangany[3] (EU). All these services are offering custodian blockchain wallets for enterprise customers but also for personal usage. There are also non-custodian wallets, where the actual user owns and manages the responding private key. The private key is like a password to authorize access to the wallet itself. Once lost, it can never be restored. On the other side, the user doesn\u2019t need to trust any third party to be trustworthy. There you have also to differentiate between software and hardware solutions. The software wallets are online or actual installed on the OS, which is considered less safe. Hardware wallet (like Ledger Nano S (EU)) are considered highly safe.
