            "answer_text": "Clearly I'm not a professional.  So I'm going to answer this question from my perspective that focuses on two things. ONE-- it's really dangerous to attempt to predict the future.  We have to make all sorts of presumptions.  Those presumptions lead us into a whole minefield of problems.  I'm sure I don't need to point out the obvious fact that even this question makes (forgivable) presumptions.  [1] That humans will survive much longer.  [2] That nano-technology as envisioned by Singularians (which I used to sorta' be one, but now have my cautious doubts and optimistic opinions) is even possible.  The biggest assumption that we have to make is in your operative word, \"future\".   TWO-- Presuming humans survive indefinitely, then yes at some point in the next quadrillion years before the stars cease burning through their fuel, it seems reasonable that nanotechnology will be a \"thing\" we develop and implement on a massive scale.  The thing is \"the future\" for most people means \"like, sometime in my lifetime or at least in the next century.\"  But the future is an awfully LONNNNNNNNNG period of time.  It can literally mean anything you want.  Therefore, \"the future\" also includes the possibility of humans going extinct in the year 2054, the planet going \"fallow\" again, octopuses dragging themselves onto land and taking the place of mammals as the dominant species.  Thereafter they develop civilization, science, technology, etc.  Thereafter THEY invent the aforementioned \"nanotech\".  In which case, yes, it will be a super big thing for the Squibbon.   So, presuming the following things: That humans survive the next century or so.That micro or nano-technological devices are possible.  That we have the ability to mass-produce it industrially.It seems incredibly likely that humans will develop this technology within the next hundred or so years and that it would change basically everything about us.  But (and for like the bazillionth time) that's a lot of speculation.  But why would it change everything? If you can make just four nanomites (say, taking 16 months to make them because it's really hard), but that those nanomites are engineered quite well with multi-purpose abilities and can \u2014together\u2014 operate in a solution of dissolved and readily available energy and materials from which to make more; AND presuming that those nanomites could make an additional nanomite every week (always taking four, 2 to scavenge, 2 to construct), and presuming you haven't (externally) continued to make more nanomites on your own (through the long process, just to make sure you seeded the solution correctly), then eventually you'd be leveraging exponential growth.   Like a lot of things, it would start out really slow.  The numbers would essentially double every month.  We're still presuming a lot (that, unlike all machines, they won't break down; requiring another nanomite to pause and repair that broken one), you can see that in just a year you'd have about 4100.  But the next year, you'd end up with more nanomites than the weight of the Earth (which, for obvious reasons is impossible:  the nanomites cannot get to the material fast enough, the Earth would squish them into liquid, there wouldn't be enough energy).   Then the question, the becomes, \"What do we do with this wealth of ability?\"  Well, presuming we don't wipe ourselves out somehow, and we actually master it, then (sigh, presuming again) we'd literally be able to do about anything within the confines of the ability of matter.  It changes everything.  Things like manufactured goods cease to have any value or obstacle in the production of the same.  Money, wealth, needs, scarcity, abundance -- they all become meaningless.   Even life itself may well (presuming!) be indistinguishably merged with technology.  Here's why.  If you can alter the \"stuff of life\" on a nano-scale level, then the temptation to remove what are perceived as \"negative aspects\" of our existence gains traction.  The thought scares us today, of course, but each generation becomes increasingly comfortable with the sharper edges of that technology.  Where my father looks on with revulsion at Facebook and all of these people sharing intimate details (with their data being mined by massive companies) \"kids these days\" are increasingly \"meh\" about their intimate privacy.   I'm not immune. It can be presumed that if such a technology is viable, the future generations will be increasingly comfortable with all of these humanity-ending changes.  And I say \"humanity ending\" because (presuming!) it would end us as a species.  There may still be descendants of us forever, but then they won't be human.  Everything gets rewritten.  Making anything of any size from the sub-microscopic to things that reach the physical size limits available for a given set of materials (machines & buildings \u2014like kilometers-in-diameter rotating Stanford tori and ark ships to other systems) cease to have cost and effort obstacles in front of them. The ability to make self-replicating anything, removes the two \"cost/effort\" driven factors that encumber us today:  humans.  Humans are hard to replace (for us).  They have to be paid.  They have lives to support.  Every step in the economic chain of how we live (from the goods we mine and food we farm, to refinement, to production, to distribution, to retail), adds almost ALL of the cost of doing business.  If you LITERALLY remove humans from every step in that process, then cost/effort ceases to have any meaning any longer.  If you can literally make anything (within the confines of what restrictions nature imposes), then economics as we know it end.   And that is presuming a whole hell of a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been following nanotechnology since I was an undergraduate chemist in 2003. In 2003, people were really excited about nanotechnology. Smalley, Curl and Kroto  received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996 for the discovery of fullerenes, and the world was abuzz about the potential for nanotechnology. Some claimed it would usher in utopian futures of desktop nanofactories that could make complex drugs on demand. Others believed it would bring a dystopian future of self-replicating nanomachines endlessly replicating and covering the world in a grey goo of tiny machines. What comes to my mind about this era is a bowling ball. There was all this hype around how great nanotechnology was going to be, and the only thing I remember seeing a press release about was a bowling ball coated in fullerenes ( Nanotech could put a new spin on sports ) that made it spin better. A bowling ball.  Fast forward to 2016, and a lot of that hype has died down. The bowling ball company is out of business. Nanotechnology hasn't ushered in a new era of technology. Nanotechnology has opened a range of interesting materials. Those materials may prove to be very useful in solving problems in materials and drug delivery. It has not caused a paradigm shift in the way we think about engineering and science.  Will nanotechnology be important in the future? Yes, it will probably play a role in the future. A lot of the pure science was worked out over the last couple of decades. However, applications remain elusive. Money is the great deflater of hype. If nanotechnology is so amazing, where are all the commercial applications? All of the companies spun out from nanotechnology have given mediocre returns at best. Nanosphere, one of the rare publicly traded companies in nanotech is losing tens of millions of dollars every year (Nanosphere Quarterly Cash Flow Statement 2015 Q3, 2015 Q2). Nanotechnology has been very successful at capturing the imagination of the public.  Nanotechnology gives people the false illusion that they can shrink down every day objects to solve problems. To defeat cancer cells, people imagine making a tiny killer robot that seeks out cancer cells and stabs them. It doesn't really work that way. The reality is that anything nano has to control assembly and recognition with atomic level precision. That's called chemistry. And, the rules are a lot different than the rules for large scale assembly.  I don't think we will look back a century from now and see nanotechnology as a technological turning point for humanity. It's just another tool in the toolbox for solving problems, and it hasn't proved itself to be particularly useful yet. ",
