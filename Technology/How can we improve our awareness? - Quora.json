            "answer_text": "Use the process I outline here in this response! The headline steps were created by Tony Robbins and I\u2019ve added my own narrative to interpret them for you. But first, some background\u2026 I can be incredibly impatient, I\u2019m too fast paced through life, and sometimes I stress at things that don\u2019t matter. These \u2018bad traits\u2019 take energy away from important tasks and make life less enjoyable. Sometimes I\u2019m ruining things rather than building things. I\u2019m way better than I used to be and that\u2019s awesome, but these flaws are still there. They are my ongoing self awareness improvement projects. I don\u2019t want to be \u2018cured\u2019 completely though, there\u2019s a lot of power in being an emotional being like me. If you take away the impatience completely what will happen to my drive\u2026? Will I think it\u2019s good to be a lazy loser? Will I quit working and live out my days festering on the sofa watching Netflix? The negative can drive the positive. If I lose money I get pissed off and I use my frustration to make even more back. If I have a bad start at golf I have the mental strength to fight back and not cave. You can\u2019t be a winner without having some traits that sometimes show themselves off in a negative way. For me self awareness is recognising my emotions, understanding why I\u2019m feeling / reacting the way I am and then doing something about it. Channelling my emotions into positive action and aligning my actions with my ambitions. I don\u2019t want to wallow in self pity and shame. I don\u2019t want to waste anymore of my life feeling stressed, anxious or angry. I don\u2019t want to waste my opportunity to live a great life. In my last 2 articles I\u2019ve covered why self awareness is so important and how you can use the power of self awareness to create something great: A life that you love, filled with abundance. These articles covered why I pay so much attention to self awareness and why you should too. If you missed them, here they are: The Undeniable Power of Self Awareness How to Use Self Awareness to Start a New Venture Here I\u2019m going to complete my self awareness series by sharing a 6 step process from master coach, Tony Robbins. We\u2019ve covered why you should develop your self awareness and the power it has to change your life. This is how to actually go about it. Here is Tony\u2019s process along with my narrative\u2026 1.Identify what you are really feeling Can you tell the difference between feeling angry and scared? Anger is usually fear clothed. Don\u2019t take every emotion at face value. Look deeper and ask yourself what you are really feeling. 2. Acknowledge and appreciate your emotions, knowing they support you Be thankful that your body is sending you a signal. Usually the signal means that something in your life needs to change. You just need to figure out what. Don\u2019t presume all negative emotions are bad for you \u2013 they provide vital insight which allows you to take responsive action. Use your negative emotions, don\u2019t shield yourself from the perceived danger of them. Work with them to fuel positive change. 3. Get curious about the message this emotion is offering you Ask yourself why you are feeling the way you are. Then ask \u2018how would I like to be feeling about this?\u2019 I get mad at the kids making noise sometimes, but I don\u2019t want to get so easily pissed about it. Why am I so averse to kids playing loudly? Why do I hate a messy house? These are difficult questions I still can\u2019t answer fully\u2026 it\u2019s a work in progress. 4. Get confident Confidence comes from doing something successfully again and again. Once you\u2019ve mastered an emotion or a situation once, remember how you did it the next time it comes around. Know that you can deal with that circumstance positively and make it a regular response. This was an extract from my article \u2014 Self Awareness Superpowers of the Elite for the final 2 steps and a lot more just follow the link! Thank you. Matt ",

            "answer_text": " Since your question does not specify it, I\u2019ll go a different route than everyone else and consider that \u201cawareness\u201d can mean one of two things: (1.) Awareness of objects other than oneself, that is, a directedness towards an object that allows the object to come to the fore in a vivid presence (2.) Awareness of oneself as an object - or self-awareness - that is, a directedness towards our (previous/future) directedness Now, following Locke, these two types of awareness have been understood as stemming from two basic human faculties: perception, and inner perception, or reflection. As all faculties, perception and reflection are abilities, that is to say, capacities to perform actions of a certain type. As such, they can be more or less developed in different people, but the degree to which they are developed in one person can also vary over time. A person might be more perceptive as a child than they are as an adult, but will be more prone to reflection as an adult than they are as a child. So how can we enhance our faculties of perception and reflection? Like with other abilities - say running - by putting them to use more often, and in a way that makes their exercise more and more difficult. In the case of both perception and reflection, this means confronting them with certain pertinent contents which all but\u2026 escape them. In the Lockeian tradition, \u201cperception\u201d is taken in the strict sense and its only such contents are (images of) physical things, such as tables, chairs and the like; but other traditions, like the phenomenological one, often take \u201cperception\u201d in a broader sense that extends its contents to ideal ones, such as \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cthe number 4\u201d etc. Now - and this is also in line with the phenomenological tradition - perception is most successful in grasping a given object, whatever that may be, when said object is in a striking contrast to all other surrounding objects, i.e., when it stands out as compared to everything else. The best perceived table in a row of black tables is the only white one. Conversely, perception fails to detach an object from the ones in its background, when all of them are too alike. Instead of perceiving various separate black tables aligned in a row, what we perceive is a sort of a uniform, albeit complex \u201crow of black tables\u201d. In this respect, enhancing perception amounts to challenging one\u2019s eye to see differences first in contents that seem similar, then in those that seem indistinguishable or even identical. Reflection, on the other hand, relates to contents that are operations of the mind, such as perception itself, but also willing, feeling and the like. However, this is the reason why unlike perception, reflection cannot grasp its object by simply recognizing its contrasting features, it has to moreover extract it from a an experience that is always given as a whole, say the perception of a table. Contrast only obtains when objects share certain kinds of qualities, like color, shape etc., not when they belong to categories - as with the act of perceiving and the table - which by definition have nothing in common. Enhancing reflection thus requires to force oneself to disassociate, or to abstract one content form a content that is never given separately from the first one. I have found that philosophy has helped me with both. ",

            "answer_text": "Aware word is used with different meaning in normal usage and philosophical term. Today children are highly aware about everything than the earlier generations. Here it means they are better informed and infinite information is available in their fingertips. The abundance of easy information itself is the cause of keeping most of them ignorant about the larger cause of life. Now if we discuss about the other meaning of awareness it is light, a steak of light which removes the darkness instantaneously. We should know it is our mind which is making what we are and so it is our perception that is being cultivated in our mind whereas the world is beyond with unending limits. Unless we create a condition of mind which can expand in its flight we try to be ignorant of the whole and unable to even step few step ahead or forward. Increasing awareness can\u2019t be objective but creating a condition can help. We need to reduce the garbage which we have accumulated binding us to remain in our narrow and small world of our own. When list of unfulfilled desires keep compiling when we keep making others as our reference point of progress we keep focusing in material world limiting our perspective. The desire making our ego stronger to fight or race keep deluding the mind in deeper ignorance because our goal could be eventually happiness and peace. I fact what all steps we are taking are working in counter direction and hence we speak for making a web and living in darkness or ignorance. Here the darkness needs a light and that needs to modify the mental condition. We live under a principle of cause and effect, accordingly what we have done wrong has to be paid and done good has to come back. This has to be taken in account in facing the time ahead but with a caution in mind of alertness to think and act with goodness always. This is a herculean task needing to change the habits and would need s strict discipline. Are we ready? Think it over and start practicing for trial. Remember the path is hard unless become habitual and enjoying. We start enjoying when our nature changes with humility and starts reflecting in our interfaces with the people. If we find or feel any success we could be moving towards the light. Have patience and keep adding compassion when you could be attracting people of good nature or helping many \u2026\u2026.. The heart would feel happier because peace is associated, Make this a habit and light would guide you the next step. You need not know learn about awareness, you also become light for many. ",

There is so much that happens in life that it\u2019s incredibly easy to get lost in the chaos of it all. Even the most self-aware people, when faced with these things or when put into situations like that will get lost in everything that happens. While it is nigh impossible to never got lost in the chaos, there are things you can do to decrease the chance of getting lost and decrease the amount of time you remain lost.  Set Regular Reminders - Ideally in the form of an alarm or an unusual object you carry with you in your pocket. Every time the alarm rings or you notice the object you simply rezone yourself in the moment and regain awareness of where you are.Other Options are: Putting your wristwatch on the opposite wrist or rings on different fingers. Anything that catches your attention.Meditate Regularly - It\u2019s just easier to be aware if you practice your self-awareness on a regular basis. Meditation teaches you how to block out unnecessary thoughts, making it easier to do so when you catch yourself being unaware.Making a Plan - Make a plan for the day to serve as a guide for where your awareness should be. Schedule as much as you can and refer to it often, changing things whenever something changes. Having 3 main goals that define that day also helps keep your awareness in check.Notice; don\u2019t judge - When you walk around try to notice as much about people, the environment and the world as you can without judging it. From the feeling of the wind against your skin to the way someone looks in walking by. Awareness is all about noticing what is happening without diving deeper into it, which will get you lost in the details.Looking at the Bigger Picture - Take yourself out of as many situations as you can and contemplate what the point of this situation is. You don\u2019t need to go all the way to the meaning of life and the point of the universe, but just what this situation is about. What is in it for you? Why are you here? What do you wish to accomplish/gain from this situation?",

            "answer_text": "Becoming more conscious Neocortex Awareness is the result of recognizing ourselves in the moment. In essence, it\u2019s about being CONSCIOUS. There isn\u2019t a specific region in the brain where the \u201cself\u201d could be seated. It\u2019s a concept in our head that gets created in between different neural activities and thinking. Only a flash of insight that is the culmination of our perceptions. However, human consciousness is different from that of other life forms. We have the neocortex that enables us to evaluate ourselves in space and time and create modules about it in the future. It\u2019s the neocortex that makes us self-conscious and aware. That is proven by the fact that all lack of self-control and unconscious physiological activity is connected with our reptilian brain. If we are operating from the perspective of our neocortex we become more aware and conscious as a person which enables us to make the right decisions. If there would be a single foundational habit to benefit this and make us more aware then it would be MINDFULNESS. Mindfulness is about becoming present to the moment and completely aware of oneself in it. It allows us to bring our attention to the things that truly matter and have a more meaningful experience in life. Mindfulness entails a person becoming more conscious of one\u2019s reality. It includes feelings, bodily sensations, the environment, thoughts and actions. Even though it\u2019s about raising our awareness, in its core, it\u2019s about becoming less mindless. Instead of being on autopilot all the time we should bring our complete attention to the moment. As you\u2019re reading this you probably aren\u2019t completely absorbed by these words. You\u2019re skipping a few lines here and there without actually being there. That\u2019s fine. Just take a moment, stop and smell the roses. Become the observer of your body, the beat of your heart, your breath, the blood flowing through your veins. How do you feel right now? What are you thinking about? Why is that so? Being mindful will lay the foundation to anything else in life as well. Being present and conscious about our energy will enable us to be aware enough of what's most important in life and how to accomplish anything in life. We will be able to notice other habits and how they impact us. Without this skill everything will pass us by without us even knowing it. It's essential for living a quality life.

            "answer_text": "I feel eligible to answer this question as this was my question for years now. Since awareness is closely dependent on presence of mind, I\u2019d like to talk about how to gain presence of mind which will eventually help you improve awareness. After a lot of struggle finding a perfect and legitimate answer that worked for me (and probably for everyone), I ended up finding it. I\u2019ll tell you what happened with me all these years. I was poor at maths, like very very poor. Even if I get to copy in the exam, I\u2019d still get border marks. The other day, I was travelling in the bus with my friends. We had just finished our Pre-board exam, and it was maths exam that day. As usual I was silent, fearing that I would fail. The toppers were discussing the questions & the answers they got. It was a scary moment for me. I still remember that embarrassing moment when I confidently discussed, & explained an answer. It ended up being a wrong one and a silly mistake from my side lead to getting the whole answer wrong. The topper friend, I was discussing with said few words that engraved in mind, then & there. The words were \u201cthoda presence of mind rakh k answer dia kar, maths me wahi zaruri h\u201d Translation: \u201chave presence of mind while answering, that\u2019s what is important in maths\u201d These words were like bombs to me. Since then I\u2019ve been looking for answer. Which you will have it now. So, what is the most important element to improve presence of mind? knowledge? power? money? Nope. It\u2019s Involvement I\u2019ll try to prove to you right away. I\u2019m into full time blogging for a year now. You can call blogging as my profession. I do it to earn a living. So, since the day I\u2019m into this thing, I\u2019ve only improved my presence of mind. Earlier, I was into an MNC and used to do blogging part time. I never saw this much of improvement. Soon after I quit my job I had all the time in the world to spend time working to improve my writing skills and hence do blogging regularly. Something happened in that phase. Since I suddenly stopped getting money to manage my finances, I was forced to work the hell out of myself to produce enough content that either paid me by clients or brought traffic to my websites. I had 3 websites to manage, from scratch. And since those where new, I had 0 income from it. Hence, working for clients and my own website was the option. Furthermore, working 40 hours a week wasn't an option at all. I had to work (even today, sometimes) for 18 hours straight to meet the two ends of my plan. Working this long, without getting tired was possible in two situations. I helplessly work, which I wasn'tI was involved completelyBy getting involved, I mean that thing getting my attention and me being attentive on anything related to writing. The result? I became so much involved that I seldom did any mistake in regards of publishing a work or delivering a piece of article to my clients. Enough of talking about me; Remember this scene? It was all about presence of mind. The way MS got rid of his glove for the last ball, expecting a chance of a run-out was absolute blister.  How could MS do it? Thanks to his involvement in the game. He anticipated the chance and nailed it like a pro. This dude is known for his involvement and presence of mind while playing. He's so involved that any point of the match you check the field placement, you'd find a fielder every possible position where the batsman could hit the ball. Alternatively, you'd find him adjusting fielders every other ball. And above this, his one liners are already very well known on the internet. It's all about involvement, with it, the presence of mind comes to you. Many people, including me (until recently) work hard to improve awareness/precense of mind, but we fail to notice the pre-requisite to get this done. It's the involvement in anything you do. This little thing works in sub-conscious mind. The more you're involved, the less you have to control yourself. This little thing is the auto-pilot mode. Once I'm involved, into a particular topic, I automatically do everything I'm supposed to do, and do it right. Without me even noticing it. That's the power of involvement and that's how one can improve awareness. I hope I've answered your question the way you expected it to be answered. All the best for your future. Aavjo, ",

            "answer_text": "When you increase your awareness, you improve the quality of your life. Here are 6 things you can do to ensure that awareness becomes an integral part of your day. Recognize and say \"thank you\" for what you have. Practicing gratitude trains our brain to focus on what we have in our lives right now, instead of being distracted by thoughts of what we don\u2019t have (or that others have). Create a gratitude journal and write in it for 5 minutes each morning or before you go to sleep at night. List 3 things you are grateful for. It can be the simplest of things, such as having a warm bed to sleep in, a roof over your head, a family that loves you, or food in your fridge.Train your brain to be more quiet. Try to meditate for 10 minutes each day. It doesn't require a lot of time, and it can help you deal better with the thousands of random thoughts that occupy you throughout the day and contribute to your feeling stressed, rushed, and overwhelmed. Think of it as mental hygiene that takes just minutes but can have long-term positive effects on how your brain functions. Try the Headspace app that makes meditation easy and even fun.Clean up your workspace. Before starting your workday, make sure you have everything ready for the tasks you'll need to complete. You can gather these materials the night before so that you don't waste any time in the morning looking for them. This applies to reference materials (bookmark them in your browser or write notes that you'll have handy on your desk), a checklist of tasks you need to complete during the day, a bottle of water at your desk, an energy snack (power bar or a cupful of walnuts, almonds, dates, figs, raisins).Become the master of your time. When you're ready to start work, use a timer to divide up your day into manageable increments that will allow your brain to focus in a more targeted and effective way. You can set the timer to 30 or 60 minute blocks, for example. You can also try the Pomodoro technique which consists of 25 minute blocks of time, followed by 5 minute breaks. When you're done with one segment, step away from your desk, and do something completely unrelated to work to give your brain a chance to rest: take a 5 minute walk, look out the window, stretch your body, grab a cup of coffee or tea.Tune out the distractions. Distractions negatively impact your focus, so you need to make a conscious effort to avoid them as much as possible. To do this successfully, you will need to (a) invest in a good quality set of noise canceling headphones, especially if you work in an open office environment, (b) set your phone to Airplane mode, (c) set expectations with others by letting them know you won't be available in the next few hours, and (d) avoid browsing the Internet, reading the news or checking social media; do these activities later in the day after you're done with your work.Don't multitask. You might find yourself on any given day doing several tasks simultaneously: reading email, talking to a coworker, eating, checking text messages on your cell phone, looking at your calendar, etc. Did you know studies show that multitasking is not only distracting, but it also negatively affect our cognitive abilities and can even reduce IQ by up to 10 percent? Try a different approach: take on each activity separately so that you can devote all of your focus and attention to it. Try checking email twice a day, instead of reading each incoming message in real time. Don't just be reactive by responding to others immediately. Focus on being proactive: dedicate your time to your top priorities and give them the recognition they deserve.",

            "answer_text": "There once was a farmer who discovered that he had lost his watch in the barn. It was no ordinary watch because it had sentimental value for him.  After searching high and low among the hay for a long while, he gave up and enlisted the help of a group of children playing outside the barn. He promised them that the person who found it would be rewarded.  Hearing this, the children hurried inside the barn, went through and around the entire stack of hay but still could not find the watch. Just when the farmer was about to give up looking for his watch, a little boy went up to him and asked to be given another chance. The farmer looked at him and thought. \"Why not? After all, this kid looks sincere enough.\" So, the farmer sent the little boy back in the barn. After a while, the little boy came out with the watch in his hand! The farmer was both happy and surprised and so he asked the boy how he succeeded where the rest had failed. The boy replied, \"I did nothing but sit on the ground and listen. In the silence, I heard the ticking of the watch and just looked for it in that direction. A peaceful mind can think better than a worked up mind.  Allow a few minutes of silence to your mind every day, and see, how sharply it helps you to set your life the way you expect it to be! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Jonathan, Thanks for your question. I have a practical example for you.  Recently over the Christmas period, my father stayed with us and we took a family visit to a museum called the Hyde Park Barracks[1], Hyde Park Sydney. The Barracks are surrounded by a traditional, large limestone fence as per the picture below.  Picture courtesy Wikipedia When I walked inside the large fence and looked around the sandy floored courtyard I felt;   \u2018a sense of confusion taking in the scale of the barracks building from the outside, a veritable but slight dizziness from the hot sun reflecting on the surface of the ground, and no other distinct or notable feeling other than a desire to get inside the Barracks building itself and view the exhibition as quickly as possible.\u2019 Over the next two and a quarter hours, we plunged into the experience reading about the history of the building and how it was a government home for newly arrived convicts and settlers to Sydney in the late 1700\u2019s and early 1800\u2019s. Learning how it housed people and organized them into work groups for each day that was needed to support the early colony. Read personal stories about the different types of characters and sometimes \u2018vagabonds\u2019 that inhabited the barracks during those times. Touched and perused the varieties of different beds people slept in. Viewed elaborate painted wall frescoes that summarized the journey of people from the harsh conditions 18th Century England all the way over to Australia. Tapped on touch screens to learn about the different rules, laws and punishments that were metered out in the times. We even saw a lovely original themed painting of a peopled version of the courtyard area painted by artist Wayne Haag.  Painting by Wayne Haag courtesy Hyde Park Barracks Now when we finished the exhibition and walked out of the Hyde Park Barracks building back into the sunlight of the courtyard, a type of explosion occurred inside my awareness. \u201cthe whole courtyard came to life, the colours were vibrant, the feeling warm, the dimensions fascinating and for a split second, I even felt like I could \u2018see\u2019 the people interacting there from old times.\u201d The experience was emotional, mental and even slightly spiritual. Yet it was exactly the same courtyard that I had viewed a couple of hours earlier. My teachers would say that by seeking a state of conscious emotional, mental and even spiritual engagement in our actions we can literally bend our own reality and experience life with greater awareness.

            "answer_text": "Some practical advice: 1. Analyze your thought processes. Think about what you think, when you think it, why you think it. Try to relate it to previous thoughts/feelings you've had, and even to your more distant past. Try to observe your patterns of thought and behavior. When you act, reflect on what made you act that way, how your underlying thoughts and feelings created a certain perception, thus creating a reaction. Don't do it all the time, though, or you might just become obsessed. Do it a few times during the day, and you'll likely pick up the habit and reap the long-term effects. 2. Plan your days ahead, have an agenda, even for free days, instead of mindlessly going through the day. Even if you can't thoroughly follow the schedule, your days will seem more structured and purposeful, time will seem to pass slowly, and you'll be more able to appreciate every little moment. 3. Think about what you do before you do it. Ask yourself if it's something you really need to do, whether it will amount to something valuable or not, like clicking on that \"21 Facts You Didn't Know About Walmart\" article or any other thing that sucks the life out of you. However, don't deprive yourself of a quality laugh - that is always good.  4. Think like a comedian. Make fun of life in your own head and to others as well. Practice wit. Question all sorts of ridiculous social conventions anytime you see it. Not only will that make you more aware, it will also make life more enjoyable. 5. Find purpose in everything you do, including a morning cup of coffee. Maybe think about everything that had to be done for that coffee to be on your table - from the proccess of extracting it from the earth to industrialization to marketing to sales.  6. Try to do something good for others everyday and observe their reaction. They will feel grateful and you will too. Try to grasp the impact you've had on them. 7. Finally, make a ritual out of sleeping. Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday, make your bed nice and tidy, put on PJs... Whatever you want. You will appreciate sleep more, and that you should do, because sleep is a major key to proper functioning of mental faculties, thus influencing your level of awareness. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been writing for several years now with the committed outcome of establishing self awareness at a physical and mind level, this has been possible through the application of Self Forgiveness wherein through identifying one's thoughts  feelings, emotions, beliefs, perspectives about life/ reality, internal conversations, studying our relationships and the relationship we hold toward the world, one is able to establish a fairly decent level of self-stability to understand what is best to be and become through a self-corrective process. This means that self-awareness to me is not only being aware of myself and my environment as 'who I am,' but also consider how I can correct/ align myself to live a principled living wherein who I am as life is honored and dignified.  Writing, along with Self Forgiveness and developing Common Sense and Self Honesty has allowed me to open up myself to myself, establish a relationship of self support toward myself, which can stand also as a point of support toward others, which is what can become the foundation of a sound society if we all commit ourselves to take Self Responsibility for our minds, our bodies and establish a relationship of self support through every word, thought and experience we have on our daily lives, ensuring that self awareness is then a platform from which we can then become active in our society to implement the same alignments at a wider level, which is for example promoting these same basic tools to establish self awareness as a living responsibility and also a living consideration of us having the ability to influence others and the world system in itself by us taking the initiative and self directive decision to stand as an example of what being self aware implies and the responsibility entailed within it, which should always aim at helping co-create a sound reality wherein individuals can coexist in the best possible agreement in awareness of who we are as Equals, as Life. Throughout all of this, Breathing is the ever present realization of who we are as physical beings in a physical reality and as such establish a point of physical self-direction wherein we ensure that whatever goes on in our minds is not automated, but instead self directive at all times. This is a Self-Honesty process. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the best way to self awareness is solitude. And there is no better place to do this than in nature. When you sit by yourself under the open sky, surrounded by trees;your mind quiets down. Don't think about anything in particular. Just let your thoughts flow. One moment you might be thinking about something that happened to you yesterday and the other you just might appreciate an ant crawling its way along a blade of grass. Looking at nature, you will start to introspect. Think about yourself. Your past and your present. Maybe the ant will reach the top of the blade and fall down. This might remind you of some failure or success in your life. You will see many examples in nature that you can relate to with instances in your life. Gradually you will get to know yourself better or be more self -aware. Humans fundamentally belong to nature. Nature helps us to really look into ourselves and think more clearly. And when our thoughts are in harmony with each other, then we can really appreciate ourselves. Self awareness is the ability to take an honest look at your life without any attachment to it being right or wrong, good or bad. -Debbie Ford ",

The former interpretation is metaphysically challenging, but the idea of \u201cmemes\u201d originated in the concept that ideas are like genes \u2014 they reproduce and propagate and battle each other for dominance. (That was before idiots on Facebook, Twitter etc. made a joke of the word.) In that case the idea that a meme might have a competitive advantage by being able to adapt to its environment (what else does \u201cawareness\u201d mean?) is quite tantalizing. If you just meant the latter interpretation, I reckon your awareness is a personal matter; most people never take anyone else\u2019s advice about how to improve it, and I\u2019m not even sure they should.

            "answer_text": "According to the neurosciences, there are a hundred billion neuron cells in the normal healthy adult human brain and each neuron cell can form 20,000 memory synapses. Imagine the phenomenal thinking and contemplative power of the human brain. No wonder, the human brain is considered the greatest and most evolved brain. Now, let us explore, enumerate, and explain those aspects of the human body, brain, mind, consciousness, which can help us make optimum use of the human potentials. 1. Akhand Vidya: An Integrated system of Learning and Education. It is generally believed that the most successful persons use around 6% of their brain and the rest of the brain goes through misuse and disuse atrophy. It is a criminal waste of Divine Gift. According to Brhad-Aranyaka Upanishad (I.5.14), there are 16 fundamental aspects (Sodasi-Kalas) of Nature, which include the sixteen forms of Arts and Sciences associated with the sixteen major parts of the human brain too. Hence, the first requisite is to gather the full spectrum of data, information, knowledge, and absolute wisdom of every aspect of the human body, the Solar system, and the Universal Consciousness. To start with, please comprehend the ten stages of Akhand Vidya from Akhand Sutra. 2. Tantra Vidya: The summary of the gross and subtle aspects of the perfect adult human anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and psychology are represented below. According to Akhand Sutra, there are ten major centers of consciousness in the body. They are associated with the ten major ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, the ten major endocrine glands, the vertebral column, and the nervous system. 1. Muladhara Chakra: The lowest Basic Chakra is associated with the Ganglion-Impar, where two paravertebral chains of the sympathetic nervous system unite in the pelvis, and it is responsible for the perfect physical health of hundred trillion cells of the body. 2. Svadhisthana Chakra: This Chakra is associated with the reproductive organs, the corresponding Gonads and the sacral parasympathetic nervous system, and the sacrum bone. It plays an extremely important role in sexual and reproductive health. 3. Nabhi Chakra: This Chakra is associated with the Adrenal Gland, the sympathetic nervous system, lumbar vertebrae, and the corresponding spinal cord. It has a tremendous effect on emotional stability, equilibrium, and emotional health. 4. Manipura Chakra: This Chakra is associated with the Pancreas, the corresponding sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, lumbar vertebrae and corresponding spinal cord. It plays an important in developing the concrete mind free from emotions. 5. Anahata Chakra: This Chakra is associated with the cardiac plexus, chest, thymus, and the thoracic vertebrae. It helps in developing a compassionate, loving, and caring heart. 6. Visudhi Chakra: This Chakra is associated with the cervical plexus, Thyroid-Parathyroid glands, and the cervical vertebrae. It helps in the articulation of speech and verbal expressions. 7. Ajna-Chakra: This forehead Chakra is associated with the Brain-stem, Pituitary gland, and the forehead bones. It helps in developing the faculty of discrimination 8. Vigyan Chakra: This Chakra is primarily associated with the Hypothalamus. 9. Pragyan Chakra: This is associated with Pineal gland, cerebral cortex, and the other bones. 10. Sahasrara Chakra: This is associated with the outer three layers of the neocortex of the brain and the upper bones of the skull. 3. Nadis: These are subtle channels in the body and they help integrate Chakras with the hundred trillion cells of the body. 4. Kundalini: It a mysterious divine spark within the body, which leads to a superconscious state of the mind. 5. Kundalini Awakening and Kundalini Yoga: 6. Akhand Yoga: The ten principles. 1. Yamaha: Five Virtues of Non-violence, Truth, Non-possessiveness, Non-acquisitiveness, and Brahmacharya. 2. Niyamas: Five disciplines of Purity, Contentment, Self-study, Austerity, and Self-Surrender to Nature. 3. Asanas: The physical exercises and postures to strengthen the body. 4. Pranayama: To regulate the flow of breath to control the mind. 5. Pratyahara: The withdrawal of senses from the external world. 6. Dharana: The process of creating a shield around the mental energy. 7. Dhyana: The art of pin-pointed concentration on an object or a subject. 8. Samadhi: The art of letting go of the mind and the emergence of Soul consciousness within the physical body. 9. Chakral Yoga: The activation and integration of the ten major centers of consciousness of the body called Chakras with the help of Soul consciousness. 10. Antra-Yoga: The internalization of the Soul consciousness within the central most part, the central canal within the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain. 7. Akhand Gayatri Mantra: \u201cAUM* - Bhur, AUM*- Bhuvah, AUM* - Suvah, AUM* - Maha, AUM* - Jana, AUM* -Tapah, AUM* - Gyan, AUM*- Vigyan, AUM*o - Pragyan, AUM* - Satyam! AUM*, Tat Savitur Varenayam, Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi, Dhio Yo-nah Prachodayath!! AUM* - Bhur, AUM*- Bhuvar, AUM* - Jyotir, AUM* - Vayur, AUM* - Amaruta, AUM* -Paramatma, AUM* - Ishvara, AUM*- Surya, AUM* - Antaratma, AUM* - Jivatma, AUM*!!!\u201d Akhand Gayatri Mantra has 10 Maha Vyahritis. They activate, awaken and integrate 10 major centers (Chakras). AUM* is repeated 22 times. 8. The Scientific Evaluation of Akhand Yoga: With the help of Power Spectrum Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG), we can easily study the brain electrical activity and recognize the state of the superconscious mind. The modern neuroscientists are not aware of the functions of the three outer layers of the neocortex of the brain, which act as an antenna to the Universal Consciousness, called Akash-Kosh, the storehouse of perfect wisdom of Nature. Akash-Kosh, which can be equated with the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere of the earth, vibrates with the built-in rhythm of 7 to 10 Hertz. Normally, we produce predominant alpha rhythm from the occipital region of the brain when eyes are closed and the mind is at rest. The rest of the brain does not show the predominant alpha rhythm. When we think or open the eyes, the alpha rhythm is replaced by the beta rhythm. This phenomenon is called the alpha-block or de-synchronization of brain electrical activity. With the regular practice of Akhand Yoga, we can activate the three outer layers of the neocortex of the brain and produce the predominant coherent alpha rhythm of around 8 Hertz throughout the brain with the closed and open eyes. This new research finding is part of his Ph.D. Thesis; \u201cPhysiology of Kundalini Yoga Power Spectrum Analysis of Electroencephalogram\u201d awarded by the University of Madras in 2001. 9. The Ultimate Proof, Result, and Reward of Super Human Consciousness: Divyank, the Divine Constant, with which the perfect and most beautiful objects of the universe and Nature are designed and created, is the ultimate proof. Divyank is represented as ((22/21)10.34419) = 1.618034. 1. The number, 22/21 represents the first stage of creation or Brahma Consciousness. 2. The number, 10, represents the ten stages of development or Vishnu Consciousness. 3. The five digits, 0.34419, represent the last stage of maturation or Shiva Consciousness. 4. The sum, 1.618034 represents the most economical algorithm of Nature. 5. The sum, 1.618034 is the most approximate decimal value of the Golden Ratio. 6. Divyank Ratio \u2013 38.1966% and 61.8034%. 7. Divyank Sequence \u2013 61.8034 \u2013 100.00 \u2013 161.8034 \u2013 261.8034 and so on. The Essence and Conclusion: With the wisdom of Akhand Vidya, Tantra Vidya, Yantra Vidya, Mantra Vidya, and the regular and conscientious practice of ten stages of Akhand Yoga, we can easily make optimum use of the full spectrum of the human brain, mind, consciousness, and potentials.

            "answer_text": "So you\u2019ve come to this point, or maybe you\u2019re just curious, what other people think about that. These are my thoughts: There is one thing i want to tell you and that is to admit that you can never ever know everything about anything. Think about it before continuing, ask yourself why it\u2019s like that and how you can influence it. When i was thinking about that, i\u2019ve come across this quote: You don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t know, when you don\u2019t know. You see my point? \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 I hope you\u2019ve spent the last minutes thinking about it. I want you to answer another question for me: What is the \u201cbiggest thing\u201d people are unaware of? There are many answers to that but my personal answer would be the part of time we call present, the now. So keep in mind that you have to make the experience for yourself. Do not take my or any other people\u2019s word for granted. I believe in you that you can think for yourself. Do not let yourself be influenced by prejudices, as they change the reality of your awareness. Keep in mind that you could possibly for 1% be wrong. Or maybe there is no wrong and right, maybe there will always be one hypocritical party/side. I can only write this, but try not to judge hypocritical people \u201cemotionally\u201d. Don\u2019t be angry at them, because they do not know. Having said all that i want to come back to your original question. I said the present is the biggest illusion that people are unaware of. Why is that so? You can actually try to answer this question for yourself, by asking yourself the following questions: Are you aware about the daily life of 7.4 billion people around the world? Are you aware about the almost infinite number of bacteria around us? Are you aware that exactly now there could be an animal dying because his natural foe wants to eat him? Are you aware how the climate changes due to all the combustion of fossil fuel? Do you know everything about mathematics? Physics? Cooking? Are you aware of circumstances lying in the past, that have long been forgotten and never been recorded somewhere? Can you even imagine a life of a single person? What is even a person? A human? One sole average person consists of 7,5 x 10 27 atoms more or less. One grain of sand also has several millions or whatnot molecules of carbon or whatnot. Are you aware that the gravitational force has like an infinite radius, influencing the spacetime. So every atom carries out a force on every other atom? But how many other atoms are there? Maybe you could describe it like this: There are two atoms A and B. I\u2019m aware that atoms are not the smallest form of the basic components of the universe. There is a gravitational force between these 2. Let\u2019s call the force \u201c1\u201d. Now doing this thought experiment with 3 atoms (additional atom C), we get A-B, B-C, A-C, we have 3 forces \u201c1, 2 and 3\u201d. So adding one atom trippled the number of forces. There is a mathematical theory for that, but what i want to say is, what would happen, if you do it for a very huge number of atoms? The number of forces will also increase by an infinity or whatnot. If the human has X-millions atoms and molecules, how much does the earth have? Our solar system? Our galaxy? The bigger \u201cgroup\u201d of galaxy of galaxies? The galaxies of galaxies of galaxies multiplied by an inconceivable finite(?) number that we can almost only describe it as infinite. Maybe research is more advanced than i think. But can we see the shadow? We can only see light. What has been in the shadow, didn\u2019t exist until see saw it. (Maybe with new technologies, it\u2019s possible to detect gravitational changes on micro scales). But a lot of these things are probably not relevant for your daily awareness. You probably want to increase your awareness about the \u201chuman world\u201d. I want to write about that too. Are you aware that almost everything electronic uses some effect of quantum physics? (Something with electron tunnel or whatnot) Why are my explanations so vague and imprecise? It\u2019s because i don\u2019t truly know. I only read about it. Are you aware that calculus was invented in the 17/18th Century? But everyone learns it. (I mean those people who were given a chance of education) Are you aware of humanity\u2019s history? How certain countries funded war on other countries? Mankind\u2019s history is extremely wicked, complex and dark. That\u2019s why the past is as important as the present. These were probably only 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the things you could\u2019ve been aware of. Now for the last thing, i want to tell you about myself and how i\u2019ve come across awareness. I am 19 years old and i was able to become \u201caware\u201d because (NO JOKES) i was a gamer. Being a gamer and being intelligent taught me, that every information counts. Everything a player does (in online games is my example) has an influence on the outcome. And the life goal is to change this wicked society. I say this to you straightforward, in my opinion the most crazy, unaware thing on this world is the monetary system, created in the stone age. Mankind as one unit could change the world, but they cannot, because they are absolutely not unified as one. Money is still an integral part of the world. I once read about that some american bankers transferred money in such way, that it lead to the world war 2, because people were/are extremely greedy. How do i know it\u2019s true? I don\u2019t, but i can figure that money influences people heavily, because for some their whole existence is on the line. Others have millions of euros, dollars, francs, yens and don\u2019t care about it. One good thing about the present is, that Bill Gates is the richest of the world. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s evil or something, but it could be. Only a lot of money can abolish the monetary system, isn\u2019t this crazy. But money will not vanish, especially not in the right-winged minds of people. And america is currently turning right-winged, maybe not, but thats my impression Trump collects the fears of people. You can be reasonable as you want, if something fears you, you attack it. But fear can only be conquered by dealing with it. So how to increase your awareness? By accumulating knowledge. But there is one crucial thing i almost forgot to mentian explicitly. People create their own reality, so even when the truth is almost obvious, other people will look at this truth in a whole other way. (Maybe my truth is superduper wrong) So to change the world we gotta change the people, but can we? Do mighty, powerful people allow that to happen? I don\u2019t know, but i\u2019ll try. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a slight issue with the answer below mine\u2026 not naming names - but they refer to \u201cremoving defects\u201d and if you know anything about our Shadow - that is not the point. The point is to become AWARE of our so-called \u2018defects\u2019 (which they aren\u2019t actually) and then see where issues interfere with our relationships and motivations. Learning to balance imbalances while accepting them lovingly as part of ourselves is the true lesson. (We\u2019re all flawed. Perfection is impossible - so why make that the goal?) Awareness of our weaker qualities (not \u201cfaults\u201d) helps us laugh at them and compensate for them by improving our behaviors and attitudes as a result of them \u2014 \u201cfaults\u201d are, after all, our teachers- spotlights on where we can enhance our experience of life by paying attention to that area. Self-awareness and mindfulness are different animals. Self-awareness is 2-headed: what I perceive about myself; and whether that matches what others perceive about me. Mindfulness is being \u2018present\u2019 in every moment to take the time to evaluate both and adjust on-the-fly to maximize the [enjoyment/ value/ experience] of where you are, now. There are many books. Three I\u2019ve used in the past (at different times in my life so I can\u2019t really compare their efficacy - also going from memory so may misspell names): Do You Think What You Think/ Baggrini Stragrom\u2026 How to See Yourself as You Really Are/ Dalai Lama\u2026 Insight/ Eurich\u2026 and a Zen Buddhist, Pema Chodron, has written a number of books I just love. They are less overt self-analysis but if you find yourself reacting strongly to her observations, there\u2019s probably some insight to be gleaned from your reaction. At some point, they all recommend asking others in your life for perspective, too. So if you\u2019re not a big reader - disarm those self-defenses and have some gentle, honest, heart-to-hearts with friends/ family/ and co-workers about how you show up in the world and see how aligned it is with what you already think. Best! ",

            "answer_text": "Before knowing anything else, you need to know yourself first. You need to know your weaknesses, strengths, beliefs and desires in life. Keeping in touch with your emotions means, you have to be self-aware. The most important characteristic of a leader is self-awareness, the ability to monitor one\u2019s own emotions and reactions. Learning how to be aware of yourself might not be easy , but if you can master this skill, it will help you become a much more effective leader. Many of us are not fond of spending much time on self-reflection. And even though personal feedback is presented, people are not always open to it because honest feedback isn\u2019t always flattering. Thus, many people indeed have low level of self-awareness. 1. Know your strengths and weaknesses- Knowing your strengths and coping with your weaknesses, will help you improve self-awareness. Each of us has strengths and weaknesses that compose of who we are and this will help you shape how to reach your goals. Your weaknesses hold you back from achieving many great things while your strengths are something that comes very easily for you to take. You should take ownership in assessing yourself because it is for your own personal development. 2. Ask for feedback and listen-This might not be easy, most especially if you are close minded and defensive to people who give critiques to you. Remember that without correction, your weaknesses would limit how far you could take yourself. Asking feedback can be as hurtful as it can be empowering. Although no one enjoys it, but we should try to view criticism as a useful feedback to improve ourselves. It will help you learn more about the traits that you need to develop, personally and professionally. 3. Develop intuitive decision making skills-Intuition plays a significant role in developing your self-awareness. This can be the source of significant errors in the course of decision making. Your intuition will help you navigate faster yet, this can also be misled if too many of your facts are wrong. Moreover, this will help you even more, this is an effective way to feed your subconscious mind. 4. Know your emotional triggers-Identifying what exactly emotionally triggers you can be challenging but getting to know and understanding it, can help you improve yourself. The key to cope with it, is to catch yourself reacting when your emotions are triggered. As long as you noticed that you are emotionally reacting, you just have to shift your emotional state in order to think through it. 5. Set boundaries-Keeping your boundaries firmly will help you maintain the integrity of your goals and the work you put in it. Setting your boundaries and sustaining it, is a skill. However, it is a skill that many people don\u2019t learn. Recognizing it means knowing and understanding your limits. Also, it takes courage and support but is a skill you can master that will help you develop yourself. 6. Practice self-discipline-In every area of your life, you need to practice self-discipline. It is a trait that provides you with the enduring focus necessary for you. If you want to control your desires and impulses to stay focused on what you think needs to get done to successfully achieve that goal, you need to practice self-discipline. This will also help you develop your potential and improve yourself awareness, since self-discipline help you form habits to attain your goals in life.s, you have to be self-aware. 7. Keep an open-mind-One of the most difficult things to practice is to keep an open mind. Understanding someone\u2019s point of view even if you disagree can change and free your mind. Change the way you think and don\u2019t get stuck in a mindset that makes you frustrated or helpless. This is one of the best tools in order to simplify life. Try to comprehend every situation on your path and it will help you improve your self-awareness and develop own potential. 8. Take psychometric tests-While there are plenty of online tests , grab it as long as you can, because this might help you find out if you are an Idealist, rational, artisan or guardian. There are also, other best known tests like Myers-Briggs and Predictive Index but all of these are aimed at serving as a data point towards greater self-awareness. Reflecting on trade-off questions helps test-takers better understand their own true characters. 9. Try new experiences-Exploring new things will teach you a thing about yourself. This is all about stepping out of your comfort zone and trying to do something you\u2019ve never done before. Unfamiliar things will help you respond in different ways that you never thought is possible. Travelling alone is also another way to discover things about yourself. 10. Discover your physical limits-What has physical exercise got to do with self-awareness and in developing yourself? Well, it will teach you, that your limits are not fixed but temporary. Most importantly, it will show you that everything you\u2019re holding back is just in your head. 11. Motivate yourself-Whatever has to be done, is always your choice. Sometimes you might feel heavy as you rise and it is hard to get going. However, feeling less motivated too often has been unhealthy. Motivating yourself and viewing life in a positive side will help you develop your potential and self awareness. In addition, awareness of your psychological needs can increase your motivation by helping you understand and seek out the reward that you desire. 12. Meditate-Meditation is a practice of improving your moment-by-moment awareness. Meditation usually begins with appreciating of, focusing on, inhaling and exhaling. However, this doesn\u2019t need to be formal or ritualistic. Just simply find a few seconds to focus on your breathing , often before sleep. Also, meditation can be helpful if you ask yourself set of questions like \u201cwhat can I do to change?\u201d, \u201cwhat am I trying to achieve?\u201d, or \u201cHow am I going to cope with my fears?\u201d Being self-aware and understanding how you are perceived by others are important components of personal growth and developing your potential. Some might ask, what is the importance of self-awareness? Well, self-awareness will help you improve yourself, establish your own identity and will help you have a harmonious relationship. Thus, developing self-awareness takes time, a lot of effort and practice. It requires a person to pay attention on his own personality and behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A and I answered a similar question here: What can I do to expand my consciousness? And again, speaking just for myself I would begin by asking what one means by the word awareness. To me that can mean my sensory awareness or my awareness of my inner states of mind, emotional turmoils, etc. Or it can mean some sort of heightened awareness of being, which is a notion I have no inner examples of in my life from which to respond. Then there can be awareness of something from which one might say god is in is heaven and all is right with the world kinda thing. Working on an answer of some kind then. I divide awareness between our awareness of being an observing self with a distinct continuous identity. Try as I may I cannot delve any deeper there. I am aware that I am a \u201cme\u201d and beyond that, \u201cme\u201d is referenced against all my experiences. My experiences are the lived life of \u201cme\u201d in all its variability. Likes, dislikes (values), affect (emotion) body awareness, awareness of the external world. So here is an example that over several years touches on some of the different types of awarenesses. So my innate proclivity is to be lost in thought and not very aware of my external surroundings as I take a walk. If out in nature, a companion might say \u201cLook at that flower, mountain, sunset..\u201d and I would look for a couple seconds and say something obligatory. Say I was like that 10 years ago. Then on impulse I bought a camera. Once I got it home I asked myself \u201cWhat is there to take pictures of?\u201d And I remembered that not having an answer to that question was why I stopped taking photographs years ago. I felt like an idiot who impulsively wasted money. Plus when I carried the camera around I felt self-conscious and inhibited. My pride wouldn\u2019t let me take the camera back and beg for a refund. So I instead promised myself that no matter how negative I felt about walking around with a camera where there was nothing to take pictures of: no matter I would take pictures everyday. I was really sort of disgusted by that Hobson\u2019s choice between humiliation of getting a refund and the pointless self-assigned task of using the camera. After several months I found that there actually were things to photograph. At some point I was able to dismiss negative thoughts because I had proved them wrong. I was taking pictures of things that interested me and the photos were good considering. Then I realized, or became more aware, that my uncertainty and self-doubt was kind of typical of how I approached other challenges in my life. So I started to become more aware of that tendency of only being fully satisfied with perfection in myself where such perfection I never found. But I had proved myself wrong about photographs, i.e., there were things enjoyable to take pictures of. So I became less hard on myself about other things I\u2019ve done or attempted. And I also became more aware of my surroundings. So now when I take walks I liken myself somewhat to a cat or other animal that is constantly aware of where its feet are, where the noises and motions are, etc. And it has been helpful to me. And I should say that I had a good adaptation in areas where I am by propensity stronger. My head is pretty good and I was living in it too much. So I see myself as more balanced now. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? How nice for me. But the thing is, whatever the narrative I come up with to explain that episode in my life, if I call it personal growth: that wasn\u2019t my goal. With the camera I chose the lesser of two sufferings. Awareness came more as a byproduct of my having pursued something out of impulse and then taking responsibility for that and trying to make the best out of it. I took that damn camera out everyday no matter how much it reminded me of how \u201cweak\u201d I was in not being able to resist the impulse to buy the camera. By committing to the camera, a lot of things came out of that. But I wasn\u2019t trying to become more aware. That was more or less forced upon me. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to be more aware of your surroundings is to hone your 5 senses and use it extensively : SIGHT - Eyes - Don't just see, observe - e.g. in a deck of cards which is the only one eye kingSMELL - Nose - Don\u2019t just smell, experience the aroma e.g. have you noticed the correlation between smell of good food and you beginning to salivateHEAR - Ears - Don't just hear, LISTEN e.g. next time you see a movie pay attention to the background music and its effect in dramatizing the sceneTOUCH - Skin - Don\u2019t just touch, feel e.g. take a mustard seed in your palm and see if you can feel it by keeping your eyes open but without looking at it or using your fingers. Close your eyes and try the same exercise.TASTE - Tongue - Don\u2019t just taste, flavor it e.g. take a lime and squeeze a few drops on your tongue and experience the effect of the taste, on you whole body.Slow down your impulses and instead use your senses to get a new experience, a fresh perspective and become more aware of happenings around you. In addition to the above also consider the following: Suspend judgement - be dispassionate and do not draw conclusions till you have all the facts.Be objective - Do not let your personal like/ dislikes/ biases become the basis for accepting/ rejecting / appreciating / condemningSee the whole picture - The context matters as much as the issue.Be rational - less emotionalBe a participant - not just a spectatorAsk questions; clarify doubts.",

            "answer_text": "How can being aware change your life? If you want to change your life, the first important step is to be aware of what is currently happening in your life. Ask yourself these questions- What are you feeling and why? Are you happy and content with your current circumstances? Do you think that someone else is controlling your life? What happened in your past that makes you think so? What do you really want? What is your goal? What triggers you to behave or act in a certain manner? What are the patterns that recur constantly in your life? Once you are aware of your emotions, thoughts, actions, goals, challenges and aspirations, you are in a position to identify the changes that can make your life better. Now, ask yourself - Do I have the power to change my life? Accept and acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses and grab every opportunity that comes your way. Maintain a log book to check your progress at the end of each day and see if you are on the right path. Being in a constant state of awareness is critical to your development and growth. It helps you identify the need for change. It helps you confront your fears and weaknesses and triggers you to overcome them. It helps you to take desirable actions that will lead you towards your dreams. For, unless you are aware of where you are, how would you know where you want to reach? I am a life coach and healer. And has helped many survive against depression and find happiness and peace. You can be the next. You can visit my website Peyush Bhatia - Certified Life Coach | Life Coach in India ",

            "answer_text": "There's only one thing which interrups awareness - not thinking what is required to think similar to not observing or not accepting what is real which is the only thing that makes difference. The world as perceived by your senses. We all think, and we all have desires and fetishes. Thinking, on one hand, is a logical array of thoughts (every bit matters) and is heavily based upon experiments and experiences and is only fueled by our natural senses which we proceed to call as logic. Fantasizing or desiring or daydreaming, on the other hand is basically thinking with emotions involved which makes it illogical and crude. It is not based upon senses or logic but upon a very primitive adaptation of brain called emotions. They are assigned to our particular want or obsession which we firsthand got attached to (physically or mentally) - hatred, love, fear, pride and many more. Now we all have to think, and we all can't avoid emotions (very natural, infact it's a part of our thinking process). But we can choose when to. Choosing thinking about what's real and when it matters, which is in my experience, is a very subjective thing and very exciting too, I think would help. Curiosity is the steering of the car named interest. While it's also an urge, a want, a thought of compliance, very natural too, but is based upon senses/reality. It doesn't care about us or any line of intellectualism. Getting rid of some uncontrollable emotions could be done by experimenting with them and recognising the fact that they all are just not needed, useless, futile, evolutionary error . Infact, they can be harmful most of the times. They would only be hepful if we had very very little intelligence. As of now, we have just enough of it. Awareness, as I am aware of, is nothing but the rejection of those emotions and accepting the fact that they mean nothing in the real world and are just in our heads. What we are left with, is the universe, and capability to understand it to the degree which can be amazing. ",

            "answer_text": "Do it the way our ancestors did it, Practise Meditation  All suggestions that you might have already heard are related mainly to the technical aspect of the affair. They describe some rules that should be followed in order to live a conscious life. But these rules are not sufficient, just the same as the knowledge of how to row properly in a boat is not sufficient as well. In order to row you need some muscles. Likewise you need to develop your perception so that it could learn to be aware. Meditation will help you. When you meditate, you observe your thoughts and emotions from outside. When you do it all the time, your ability to see things consciously grows, just the same as the muscle develops from constant loading. Awareness involves the ability to put emotions aside and look at things with a sober view. I don\u2019t know another more effective way to develop these skills, than meditation. Meditation has become for me the Amrit, which opened my eyes to many things and helped to get out of the illusions. I can also personally certify that it has helped me take major strides in improving my grades & avoid lethargic activities. If you want to raise your awareness, then meditation is the thing I\u2019d recommend to start with. ",

In the 90s it was 5 minutes\u2026 That\u2019s mainly because of technologies (mobile), which render communications more frequent but also more superficial. It also floods peoples with much more information, but less and less time to assimilate them. So peoples attention jumps quicker because of the increase flood of information we now bath almost all day long\u2026 As for the self-awareness, this can only be increased by self-exploration. Which means facing adventures and fears\u2026 As the newer experiences we gain of our world and reality, the more neurons are produced (called Neurogenesis) to adapt to the new situations\u2026 When this occurs, our personality is altered as well as our intelligence. This also means that your self-awareness will also change for the better. As you can\u2019t know yourself, without having the experiences the possibilities of the world around you. As no one can find know who he is, until he found his place within the world\u2026 ",

Even Alan Watts addresses this is in his book \u201cThe Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety\u201d. With self-awareness of your own awareness in the present moment, all previous worries, doubts and fears melt away.The more you experience this, the more you realize just how it is that most people truly are \u201casleep\u201d at the wheel.It\u2019s like you understand why you feel anxious when it\u2019s in your head, but when you try to explain it\u2026.the words can\u2019t do it. Sometimes I get so negative and I start to question everything\u2026 it\u2019s literally overwhelming.

This is also the most fundamental principle of awakening of the third eye. We will come to this in the end. Also, awareness has many subdivisions. Let's talk about social awareness first. For example, A is always engaged in productive activities but He is less interested in what's going on around the world and doesn't want to know either. He also does not participates in social events. He will be termed as \u2018socially less aware' by the judging party. Lets talk about self awareness. Lets take another example. B is preparing for an entrance exam. He has an action plan which he regularly follows. However, he is also aware about his physice and exercises regularly. Whenever he solves any problem, he is totally into it. He will be judged \u2018 self aware ' by the same. Lets take the case of emotional awareness. C has an exam the next day. She feels terrified. But she observes her feelings and acknowledge them. She takes some deep breathes and listens to some good music and feels motivated. She does well in the exam. She is \u2018emotionally aware'. In above mentioned scenarios and many more possibilities, there is one thing in common and it is the power to observe. This cycle would consist of 3 elements, Observe, acknowledge, and act. ",

            "answer_text": "You have the ability to notice what you are feeling and thinking. You might even be aware of why you are having certain emotions and thoughts. When you are feeling any kind of intense emotion, such as anger, try stopping for a moment and becoming aware of how you are feeling and why you are feeling that way. Once you are aware of what you are feeling, control the way you express it. If you are in the middle of class, you might have to express your anger later. Or if you are at home, you might be able to go to your room and express anger, and then talk about it with your parents. Essentially, you have to put some space in between the feeling of anger and how you display it. This way you can prevent yourself from doing something you regret later. Learn the lessons from tough situations or failures. Analyze what went wrong and what you should do differently next time to become successful. Be careful about the effects of interruptions, particularly from electronic devices. Rather than multitasking, prioritize and finish tasks one by one. Read motivating articles and books and explore why someone acted in a certain way. For instance, Manu Bhaker, a 16 year old became the youngest Indian to win world cup gold in shooting. ",

In this classic work of spiritual guidance, the founder of the Rochester Zen Center presents a comprehensive overview of Zen Buddhism. Exploring the three pillars of Zen\u2014teaching, practice, and enlightenment\u2014Roshi Philip Kapleau, the man who founded one of the oldest and most influential Zen centers in the United States, presents a personal account of his own experiences as a student and teacher, and in so doing gives readers invaluable advice on how to develop their own practices. Zen eschews wordy interactions, preferring direct practical experience. For that, I suggest: Workshops at the Center: a practical introduction to Zen Seven times a year the Rochester Zen Center offers a full-day introductory workshop taught by the Abbot, Roshi Bodhin Kjolhede (pronounced \u201ccoal-heed\u201d), and his senior students. Because beginning in Zen isn\u2019t as simple as deciding to attend a new church on Sunday, the introductory workshop is aimed at providing a useful introduction to Zen Buddhism, demystifying the religion and giving basic instruction on how to practice zazen (Zen meditation). It\u2019s a unique opportunity to learn first-hand from seasoned practitioners at one of the country\u2019s largest and oldest Zen centers. The workshops are scheduled on Saturdays and begin at 9:30 a.m. at the Zen Center\u2019s city center near downtown Rochester. For a detailed description of the workshop, please download the workshop brochure. Workshops are scheduled for January 20, March 10, and April 28. ",

Self-Awareness permits you to understand other people, howthey notice you, your attitude and your responses to them in the moment.

If you have ever been in an autoaccident you may have experienced everything happening in slow motion andnoticed details of your thought process and the event.  This is a state of sensitiveawareness. With practice we can learn to engage these types of heightenedstates and see new opportunities for interpretations in our thoughts, emotions,and conversations.

Once you learn how to meditate believe me you will meet your own awareness. Second is the way to spirituality which helps you simultaneously in knowing yourself and your goal and purpose in life. It is very hard to get to this path as you need to awaken yourself, motivate yourself and dedicate yourself to it. Some people relate spirituality to religion. Yes religious literature and scripts are helpful in some way. It shows you light but you have to travel all alone on this path. Once you know ypur own awareness you will understand everything, every phenomenon, everything around you. You can take help of books also. ",

The oldest and most respected means of developing sel-awareness is insight meditation, also known as vipassana. Begin by sitting comfortably, close your eyes and relax your entire body. Move your awareness to the bottom of your nose and begin to watch your body breathing itself. Passively observe your involuntary in breath, the brief pause, the out breath, and the brief pause as a natural cycle. Be curious about it as you identify as the one who witnesses your breathing, not the breather. Expect your mind to drift, but do not admonish yourself when distracted. Simply bring your attention back to the bottom of your nose and begin, again, to observe the natural rhythms of your breathing. Before long, you\u2019ll enjoy the experience of mindful detachment \u2026 aware of being aware. Alter this practice with observing your thoughts in the same way \u2014 not as the thinker, but as the witness who is aware of your thoughts. # # # ",

It is just listening to some instruction , guided by a person. You are just aware of instruction. You do a passive role during the session. Stored thoughts shape life. While leading day to day life, we are guided by stored thoughts, such as negative emotions, desire,comparison etc. These thoughts arise so instantly that hardly we are aware of it. You will find person's response to a situation is fixed , and repetitive in nature. It occurs , as we are not aware of our thoughts. The path to develop awareness is to to bring gap in between thoughts, also by reducing the intensity of thoughts. This is not possible by just to avoid arising of thoughts. If you avoid thought, then it will occur again. Just trying to forgetting thoughts will not serve the purpose. Hence, solution is to do meditation. It slows down the arising of thoughts. Gap between their arising also increases. My suggestion is to go for guided type meditation. ",
