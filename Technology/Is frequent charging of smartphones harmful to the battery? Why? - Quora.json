            "answer_text": "See, here\u2019s all you need to know about charging present day batteries be it in your laptop or smartphone or camera. Almost every device these days has the system to cut out power supply to charge the batteries as soon as they hit 100%, so it\u2019s not like your battery will get overcharged or explode by this in ideal conditions.Every battery has a fixed no. of charge cycles after which it becomes more or less uncapable of powering your device. Your battery enters a new cycle when you charge it up to 100% or when it gets almost all drained up.Technically you should try to charge your battery in a way that it doesn\u2019t enter a new cycle every day. Eg:- Try to charge when it hits 15%, unplug at 85%. Doing this will avoid the need to replace the battery for a longer period of time. (please read till the end)Now say you did not let your battery enter a new cycle for a whole week somehow. At the end of the week, your battery will take much less time to drain a certain no. of %s because it\u2019s in a week old charge cycle. As soon as you charge it full to enter a new charge cycle, the backup will increase significantly.So that was all the tech there is. Now, note this, there isn\u2019t exactly a 100% accurate tech/science to prove/approve the above theories and there is actually a lot of controversies around it. But according to the most popular believes, here\u2019s how you should charge your device for maximum battery life in the long run :- Only let your battery enter a new charge cycle once or maximum twice a week depending on the battery\u2019s health and capacity which effect how long can you handle a old charge cycle. And then again every week (or twice weekly maybe) leave your phone overnight to charge and let the battery enter a new charge cycle. Okay, so now before you start bossing people around you to charge their devices right, or start hyperventilating on how bad you\u2019ve been to your dearest device, let me remind you again, There is a a LOT of controversies and theories around this. It is not always possible or practical to follow all the instructions very strictly and I personally believe, despite the theories, it doesn\u2019t help prolong the battery life all that much and in today\u2019s ever developing world, more probably than not, your device will get outdated much before you have to replace the batteries on it. I am very much into tech so I know all this. But since I am a student too and don\u2019t have the time to tend to my devices that very much, I personally let my Honor 9 lite charge overnight everyday, and it has been managing to get me through the day for almost a year now. Likewise with my ipad or laptop, I just plug it in charging and take them out when I need them, not worrying on whether or not they enter a new charge cycle. This paragraph was just to clarify that even if you totally debunk the theories, your life will go on just fine. Hope this was helpful, thanks for a2a :) ",

            "answer_text": "Frequent charging of your depleted battery will reduce its life. Whenever you charge your phone you are potentially plating lithium on the anode electrode, more so during fast charging. The more plating, then less space for the Li-ions to tuck into the graphite; therefore, lower storage. In extreme cases, the lithium plating can poke through the separator to cause a short with the opposite electrode. Another harmful outcome in deep discharging/charging is the formation of dendrites. These are thin lithium spikes (like urchins) that grow in all directions from fast charging. Eventually, they can also pierce through the separator to cause a short. Solution: keep your phone or laptop plugged in as often as possible to maintain as full a charge as possible. This will minimize long recharging. If you have to do a long recharge after you've fully depleted your battery, charge it up slowly. If it gets hot, unplug, let it cool off, and then recharge. Use your laptop's slow USB or a slow power bank to recharge. ADDENDUM: Frequent charging at high SOC levels is better than long charging from low SOC levels; in case, the above didn\u2019t give you that notion. ADDENDUM 2: I mistakenly assumed the audience would remove their cell phone from charging at least once a day, like me. For those who might leave their devices in the charger most of the time, then check your owner\u2019s manual to see if the device BMS actually charges the battery to 100%. Most device mfrs do not program their BMS to charge the Li-ion battery to 100%. Most will program the BMS to stop charging at around 90\u201395% SOC. The reason is when a Li-ion cell is charged to its maxim voltage (4.2V for LCO chemistry in cell phones), it causes a great deal of voltage stress between the two electrodes. It\u2019s analogous to a balloon inflated to its maximum stretch, close to bursting. Once the high charging voltage is removed, many ions will migrate back to other side. So, there is a steep voltage drop from 100% down to 90\u201395% (4.2V to 3.9V). This will happen by itself in a few hours after charging is removed. I always keep my cell phone and laptop plugged-in knowing that their batteries will only be charged up less than 95% SOC. ",
