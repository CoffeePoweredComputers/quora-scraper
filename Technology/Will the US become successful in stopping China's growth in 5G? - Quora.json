            "answer_text": "No, but that\u2019s not US intentions. The US will not allow Huawei which has close ties to the Chinese Communist Party have that kind of access to communications in the US and hopefully with our closest allies. Yes, it costs more to produce such communications products in the US but necessary for securing national security. China has stolen more than enough through espionage from the US and its businesses as well as from the government. Trump wants that not to happen anymore, but the Democrats probably don\u2019t care. No doubt they want some Chinese funding to get rid of Trump in November. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think they want to stop China\u2019s 5G, but perhaps make sure there are alternatives that can fairly compete in the market. The other 5G systems out there are owned and built by private companies who cannot offer the financial incentives, payoffs to foreign leaders and bribes to industry executives that China CCP/Huawei can to get people to accept their system. This doesn\u2019t even count the fact that nobody can trust Huawei equipment from China CCP\u2019s intelligence backdoors and architecture that allows penetration by their potentially hostile government.
