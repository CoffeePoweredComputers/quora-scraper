            "answer_text": "It actually depends on your phone. The enemy of Lithium battery technology, other than just basic charging, is overheating. Some fast charging systems can raise the battery temperature \u2014 most do monitor temperature, but a bit of extra heat is usually unavoidable. So slow charging can avoid at least a little bit of faster aging in some devices. The typical cell runs around 300-500 full charge/discharge cycles before it's \"dead\", which is usually defined as when the maximum charge is only 80% of the original capacity. By they time you reach that with most chemistries, the cell is dying fast. The smartphone manages its own charging cycle. Most modern phone's don't actually have much of a real trickle charge mode. Charge speed probably depends on the capabilities of the USB port you're charging from. Usually, the phone will charge your cell to \"full\" and then stop charging completely. This is different than the NiMh/NiCAD cycle, which usually did have a true, very low current trickle charge. Now, your phone will monitor charge as it always does, and when plugged in, occasionally top it off as it falls. The charge rate near full is lower than other parts of the cycle, so some would still call this a trickle charge. Now, what you're probably really asking is about charging from a lower current power supply. For example, a phone on a PC's regular USB port, one with USB 2.0 only, none of the charging protocols, will charge at 5V at 500mA = 2.5W. Under other charging protocols, a device can supply up to 5V at 1.5A = 7.5W, and of course, some proprietary power modes can hit 2.4A and, as in the case of Qualcomm's Quick Charge, voltages up to +12V and 18W. The new USB 3.1 Power Delivery protocols allow up to 20V and 100W, though no phone is going to charge at 100W. So the real question is, how well is my phone protecting my battery. The phone contains the charging circuit, and that's responsible for deciding how much current and voltage to apply to charge the cell, and just when to do it. The all manage this, since Lithium cell charging is a bit more complex than the older types of secondary cells. Part of any proper faster charging is temperature monitoring... the system should be monitoring the temperature of the battery, and backing off after some set threshold to avoid compromising battery life. So you can monitor your phone during charging some time and see how warm it gets. If it's very warm, there's a chance you might get a little more life out of it going to a lower current charger. There are a few other things to watch. In a related move, if you ever plan to store your device for awhile, run the power down to about 50% first, and store in a cool place if possible. Both high temps and a completely full battery for long periods of time will shorten battery life. And NEVER let the battery die completely. Any properly designed phone will shut itself down long before a cell reaches zero, but self-discharge may eventually lower it to an unacceptable charge level. Most Lithium chemistries have a parasitic effect that kicks in at very low charges that can permanently damage the cell. You don't want that. Ideally, we shouldn't be full-cycling our cells, ever. Think about hybrid cars in operation (I have three Prius cars)... you're constantly charging the cells during periods of low engine drain, coasting, braking, etc. and discharging them when you need extra power, or in a few cases, when moving slowly under pure EV power. And yet, my 2003 Prius battery was still going strong at 240,000 miles, when I decided to replace it last summer. I can't even count how many cellphone batteries I went through during that time. The Prius lasts because it short-cycles the battery. In that 2003 model, the battery never goes higher in charge than 80% full, never lower than 40% full. So sure, you're only getting 40% of the full power of the battery, but it's going to outlive the rest of the car. In the newer models, they use about 60% of the cycle. Some full electrics do this, too, sometimes as an option... for example, the Nissan Leaf (my sister's car) had a \"long battery life\" mode that stops charging at 80%... of course, offering 20% less range. So technically, this could be implemented on a smartphone, too... have it only allow a charge to 80-90%, only allow a discharge to 10-20% or so. But here's the thing: a hybrid battery costs $2000-$6000 to replace, and you're without car for a week or whatever. A new cellphone battery? Under $50 right now for my LG V10... and by the time I need one, probably more like under $20. So why bother? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, although I have no proof and its against common sense, my personal eperience with at least three pair of phones is their battery had longer life and charge lasted longer when tricled charging them through a laptop usb port. Again I know this trickle charging might sound as hocus pocus to a lot of people, but I'm not a standard ignorant user, I know a lot about batteries, all types all sizes and all technologies since nicd to lipo, these last ones still surprise me a little, being old school as I am.
