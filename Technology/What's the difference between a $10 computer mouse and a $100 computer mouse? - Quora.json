            "answer_text": "In that context, the only difference is the price Anything can be sold at any price, I can sell a rock for $100 and a brand new car for $1 if I wanted to, but for $100, nobody\u2019s going to buy that rock, and for $1, I\u2019d be selling that car at a huge loss The real question is what mouse is worth $10 and what mouse is worth $100 and what are the difference between the mice? The average $10 mouse is bound to be a red (or blue) LED with sensor optical mouse with two buttons and a click wheel, no bells and whistles, nothing fancy A mouse worth $100 can have any number of things, a laser sensor instead of LED optical, extra buttons (macro buttons), adjustable sensitivity, higher build quality, more ergonomic, etc. I personally don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a mouse in the $100+ range though, I\u2019ve seen some really nice gaming mice for around $60 ",

I\u2019ve been using a $10 Logitech M100 that I\u2019ve used daily for 6 years. One might think it is somehow low quality, but 6+ years without breaking, what more could you ask for? Amazon.com: Logitech M100 USB Optical Wired Mouse (Black): Electronics with Prime and as an add-on purchase this would be less than $1/year. ",

            "answer_text": "gaming mice tend to focus on DPI, sensors, ergonomics (how well and how comfy it fits in your hand.) weight, grip and build quality. the big names that come up are Logictech, Corsair and Razor. Personally i cant stand razor, i\u2019v had too many mice from razor stop working for oddball stuff, like when i unplugged the USB for my Razor mouse from my desktop, and when it was re plugged in again, the left mouse button stopped working\u2026 permanently . Corsair is nice but exspensive, 60$ for a mouse? you must have me confused with someone who does not understand shit. it\u2019s got fantastic build quality but do i really need a whole numpad on the side of a mouse? Logictech? honestly i have not had a good time with any logictech products, headsets that break easily, keyboards that dont last and have parts break off easily. the mice are kind of ok. but the build quality leaves more to be desired. and the price often goes up to Corsair or Razor products price range. something from Steel series would be much better, the build quality and materials from Steel Series tends to be pretty top notch. Tecknet has some high end gaming mice for 30$ that are actually really nice. i personally am using a Tecknet Hyper-track (26\u201330$ off amazon) for gaming and it\u2019s replaced my Corsair Scimitar and i\u2019m definitely not going back to that odd Razor Deathadder, it\u2019s crap. also as a side note, high DPI is useless, most gamers will use very low DPI settings often going down to 400\u2013800dpi so they can more accurately control their mouse, havinga super high dpi just makes it easier to over aim at targets and miss, or make you twitch too much. it can help a bit on games like COD where you\u2019re pretty much running around all the time but for Esports titles and other games it\u2019s pointless to run at 2000\u201316000 DPI.
