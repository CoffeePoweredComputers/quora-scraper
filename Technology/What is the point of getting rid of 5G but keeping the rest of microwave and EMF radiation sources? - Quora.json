If so, I\u2019d look closely to be sure he (or she) isn\u2019t wearing a tinfoil hat under their wig. In other words, that action would be pointless. (Assuming you are talking about future mm-wave 5G, because the current roll-out is using the same frequency bands and towers as 4G.) The next time you buy a phone, it undoubtedly will come with 5G capabilities. The 5G RF from it will be less penetrating than your current LTE 4G phone, and you have no control over the 5G RF from carriers (which will also be less penetrating than current). ",

            "answer_text": "According to an expert who worked with microwave radiation technology in the British navy, 5G is ten times MORE radiation in your home than 4G. (Imagine a lightbulb 10X brighter than another lightbulb.) Microwave radiation (now also called Wifi) has long been used as a weapon to kill people, and/or make them sick. It destroys the vitamins in your food, and your body, and tears apart DNA. It causes SIDS, cancer, headaches, flu-like symptoms, lack of concentration, etc., etc. Our civilization should go back to 3G, not 5G, because at least we wouldn\u2019t be exposed to more microwave \u201ccooking\u201d than somebody constantly standing in front of the flimsy Faraday cage we call a microwave oven. Here are four videos to educate you more. The last one is the source I was referring to.     ",
