            "answer_text": "In 2020, there is covid-19 that people can not stand too close to others and this situation makes QR code really useful. I used to give out my business card and connect with people but in such pandemic the only way I give out my information is using the vcard format QR code. I would like to share 3 benefits I found from using vcard format QR code: Your recipients will get all your contact information into their phone contacts automatically without any manual typing or copy/paste from another text source.Allow receivers to scan the QR code with vcard format by their native phone cameras without installing any additional app.Does not require receivers to give up their personal information in exchange of your contact information to third party websitesIn my opinion, QR code is very relevant in 2020.

            "answer_text": "Though QR Codes are not being used for marketing nowdays, still are very much relevant in 2020 with increased presence in banking transactions (Wallets, UPI etc) due to following reasons: While NFC is more seamless technology to carry out P2P transactions, NFC enabled phones are still costly whereas QR Code can be scanned by any normal camera phone.NFC tags needed to encoded via special device whereas QR Codes can be easily printed via any printer.Scanning a QR Code is anyday faster than entering the UPI ID or any key.With several new technologies trying to surpass this, we might have something new in 2020 but it will take time to get as popular as QR Code has become now.
