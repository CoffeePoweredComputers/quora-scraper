            "answer_text": "If you wan to buy it now, then just buy it, but if you can wait, wait and see the pricing of some other phones which are going to launch- Moto G6/G6+ASUS Zenfone 5 (2018)Nokia 6 (2018)Honor 9 Lite (launched)These are some of the phones competing in this category. RN5Pro and Zenfone 5 will both have SD 636 processor which is very powerful. Nokia 6 and G6/G6+ will both have SD 630 processor which is also very powerful, Honor has the least powerful of having Kirin 659, very powerful, but still not as much as SD 636 or SD 630. All of these phones have a dual camera except Nokia 6. Honor 9 Lite also has dual front camera setup, but these phones don\u2019t give a good \u201cportrait\u201d mode blur effect, so the dual camera isn\u2019t as effective as it should be. Selfie camera is the biggest on RN5Pro, 21 MP, it stands out of the crowd. Stock Android on Moto G6 and Nokia 6. All others run custom UIs which I don\u2019t think is a good thing. Speakers- Nokia 6 has Dolby Atmos. Others are not as good. Battery- 4000 mAH on RN5Pro, 3300 on ASUS Zenfone and 3000 mAH on all others. Battery life of these phones is not known, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say- RN5Pro >Nokia 6> G6> ASUS Zenfone 5> Honor 9 Lite. 4000 on RN5Pro, so it will last very long, but Zenfone 5 will perform bad because it has a powerful and batter consuming chipset and it has a heavy custom UI. Nokia and G6 will perform above expectations due to stock android. Screen- Biggest on Zenfone due to the bezel-less display (but with a notch), smallest on Nokia 6 (1920x1080). Others have 18:9 ratio bigger screen. Other features- ASUS and Nokia 6 are having best of the best build quality. Best looking phones are Honor and ASUS. G6 and RN5Pro look average. In the end, Buy RN5Pro, else buy ASUS or Nokia 6 if you can wait. But I should also tell you that RN5Pro is the least expensive and ASUS being the most expensive. Moto G6, Honor 9 L, Nokia 6 all have about the same pricing. Edit: I think there is no competition for Redmi Note 5 Pro. Just buy it (or you can consider Zenfone Max Pro too). ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Let's us start by saying that it's October 2018 and somehow (and just somehow) Redmi Note 5 pro is still the most bang-for- buck smartphone on the Indian market. When it was sold initially at Rs 13999 and then at Rs 14999( due to GST and other tax issues) it was the best sub 15k phone and now it's available at a beggarly price of Rs 12999 on Flipkart Big Billion Day sale after 8 months of release and it's still a hell of a deal at that price point. Common Nitpicks The UI is heavy: Well MiUi is heavy. But the question is does it affect performance. The simple answer is NO. Why? Because MIUI is not heavy enough to cause any discomfort to a SD636 and 4GB RAM combo.No USB-C : To be fair most people don't even know the difference between USB-B and USB-C. Hell even I googled the difference before writing this. So if you don't know the difference between the two it probably won't make any difference to you.Hybrid sim slot: This can be a deal breaker for some but let me tell you about something called a micro-usb flash drive invented ages ago that can allow you to use two SIMs simultaneously. And hey you are still getting 64GB internal ( thats about 20hours of Brazzers in HD.) which is enough for most users.Old design: Thinking that the new Notch-design is very modern opposed to the RN5 pro's no-notch screen is stupid because the Notch trend will probably be replaced by a new trend before your notch phone is even delivered and you'll be stuck with a notched bastard for a year.The only reasonable cause that I can fathom of someone deciding not to buy RN5 pro for RS 12999 is because they have small hands ( mind you the thing is massive.) One hand usage is difficult and I have massive hands. The alternatives Nokia 6.1 Plus looks better,has Android One, a slightly better screen but is yet to be seen as a credible challenger especially in Camera and overall optimisation department because Nokia is new with Android. ( We all know how Nokia's last experiment went). Asus Zenfone max pro M1 is a slightly snappier phone ( due to a light ZenUi) with almost stock Android like features but stumbles in battery (5000MaH but poor back up) and Camera sucks big time. Honor phones use their in-house HiSilicon chipsets manufactured in China are highly unreliable. So I hate them. (They look like toys too). So there you have it. Go for RN5 pro if you want the best all round phone with great battery, reasonable camera, killer processor all packed into a premium metallic body( okayish looks) at a steal price. Otherwise just buy something else and regret it later. Edit: Stop cribbing over that plastic ass ugly realme2pro. It just looks cheap like a toy. There's no two ways about it. Edit 2: Redmi note 5 pro is now available for INR 10999 on Flipkart. That's some offer I can tell you. Edit 3: Wassup playr's! See I predicted that soon notches on smartphones will soon be replaced by something else. BOOM!! ",
